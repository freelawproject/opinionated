Each was shot at close range with a shotgun. Both men died almost instantly from severe wounds to the face and neck. Ten days later, police in Lincoln stopped an automobile driven by Brown. Inside the car they found the shotgun that had fired the spent shell casings found near the victims\u2019 bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">After his arrest, Brown underwent extensive psychiatric evaluation and spent several years at Bridgewater State Hospital (Bridgewater) before finally being found competent to stand trial in March, 2001. A jury found him guilty on two indictments charging murder in the first degree, each on the theory of deliberate premeditation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">On appeal, Brown contends that he was incompetent to stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>trial and that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Brown also assigns legal error to various aspects of his trial. These include claims that (1) the prosecutor improperly introduced evidence of Brown\u2019s purported postarrest silence, (2) the judge improperly failed to hold a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of certain statements made by Brown, (3) the judge improperly declined to give the jury an instruction on intoxication, (4) the judge improperly excluded from evidence certain Bridgewater medical records, and (5) the judge improperly and systematically excluded students from the jury. Finally, Brown seeks relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, noting particularly the extensive evidence that he suffered a mental disease at the time of the killings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>On August 5, 1996, a grand jury returned four indictments against Brown, charging him with murder in the first degree for the killings of Athos Oliveira and Thomas Meyer, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1; unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a); and unlawful possession of ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">After his arrest, Brown was sent to Bridgewater for evaluation pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18 <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Following a hearing held on April 9, 1998, he was found not competent to stand trial and committed to Bridgewater under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 16 (b):<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This commitment was periodically renewed by various judges in the Superior Court. In January, 2001, approximately two months prior to the scheduled trial date, a report was filed with the court pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(a),</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>concluding that Brown\u2019s symptoms were \u201cunder good control due to his compliance with his medication regimen and treatment at Bridgewater State Hospital,\u201d but that he could be \u201cat risk for becoming more symptomatic as his trial approaches.\u201d The judge brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Brown into court and held a hearing at which he concluded that Brown was competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(d). </em>As a precaution, the judge ordered that a further evaluation of Brown, pursuant to \u00a7 15 <em>(a), </em>be performed by the court clinical psychologist on March 7, 2001, the day that the trial was scheduled to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">On March 7, defense counsel submitted to the court a report of a private forensic psychiatrist stating that Brown was no longer compliant with his medication regimen and was not competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge then ordered that Brown be further evaluated by the court clinical psychologist, who also opined that Brown was incompetent to stand trial. The judge continued the trial and ordered that Brown be evaluated by the Commonwealth\u2019s psychologist. That psychologist\u2019s evaluation report was filed on March 9, and a competency hearing was held over four days during the period March 12 through March 21.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the competency hearing, a psychiatrist retained by the Commonwealth opined that Brown \u201cha[d] the sufficient ability to consult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and that he ha[d] a rational as well as a factual understanding of the court proceedings\u201d and that therefore he was competent to stand trial. The defense called three witnesses, including a psychiatrist who testified that Brown was not competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The judge issued a written ruling finding Brown competent to stand trial on March 23, 2001.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On that same day, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>began. After four weeks of trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all four indictments. Brown was sentenced to consecutive terms of life on the murder convictions and to from two and one-half to five years for unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon to be served concurrently with one of the life sentences.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The ammunition conviction was placed on file with Brown\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">2. <em>Facts. </em>Based on the evidence at trial, the jury were warranted in finding the following facts. On the morning of Saturday, June 15, 1996, Brown asked his friend Dwight Bobbitt, a security guard who possessed a firearms identification card, to purchase a shotgun for him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Brown told Bobbitt that he needed the gun \u201cfor business.\u201d Brown gave Bobbitt $280 cash,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the two men boarded a bus to travel from the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston to the Bob Smith\u2019s Sporting Goods store in downtown Boston. Brown told Bobbitt that he would look at the guns, then point at the one he wanted and say \u201cthat\u2019s the freshest, that\u2019s the one I want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">When the two arrived at the store, they went to the gun department. As Bobbitt looked at a particular shotgun, Brown told him, \u201cthat\u2019s the freshest.\u201d Brown walked away, and Bobbitt approached the salesman and purchased the gun, a \u201cMoss-berg 500\u201d twenty-gouge shotgun with an eighteen inch barrel,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> along with one box of ammunition,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> at a total cost of $268.21. Brown and Bobbitt then took a taxicab back to Roxbury. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>they parted so that Bobbitt could go to work, Brown took the shotgun and ammunition with him. Bobbitt told Brown to remove the serial number from the gun with a file because he would report the gun stolen in two weeks.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">When Bobbitt returned home from work after midnight, he found Brown in the company of two friends outside Brown\u2019s residence in Roxbury. Brown brought the shotgun outside, fired it into the air three or four times, and picked up the spent shell casings. Brown then went inside, came back outside, fired the gun into the air again, and then went back inside. Responding to a call reporting shots fired, two Boston police officers arrived at Brown\u2019s residence at about 2 a.m. When questioned by police, Bobbitt and the others denied having heard any shots. The officers then left. Fifteen minutes later, Brown came outside again. He was wearing a thigh-length green jacket and black boots. Brown pulled the shotgun out from under his jacket and again fired it into the air three times. He then left on foot, heading in the direction of the South End.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">It was warm, and despite the early hour, people on Appleton Street were outside socializing and walking about. Among them was Athos Oliveira, who had driven to the South End from his home in Somerville. At approximately 3:30 a.m., a man approached Oliveira in front of 106 Appleton Street, pointed a shotgun at him, and fired twice. The first shot grazed Oliveira\u2019s head, taking off his cap and shredding its bill. The second shot was a direct hit to Oliveira\u2019s face and neck. He was killed almost instantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The man then ran down Appleton Street toward the intersection with Dartmouth Street. A group of men getting out of an automobile parked along Dartmouth Street saw the shooter approach them, hesitate, then continue down Appleton Street. The assailant soon encountered Thomas Meyer, who was standing across from 131 Appleton Street. Meyer was dressed in a black tuxedo because he had attended a friend\u2019s wedding reception in the Back Bay section of Boston earlier that evening. The assailant fired a single shot into the back of Meyer\u2019s head, killing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>him instantly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He then continued down Appleton Street, heading toward West Canton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Witnesses who observed the man who shot Oliveira and Meyer described him as a black male with Afro-style hair wearing a thigh-length green jacket. This general description matched that of Brown. Police investigators responding to the scene also found several spent shotgun shell casings near where the bodies of Oliveira and Meyer lay.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A ballistics expert later determined that all of the shells had been fired from the same shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">It is unclear where the assailant went after he shot Meyer and continued down Appleton Street. The next witness to report seeing Eric Brown was Bobbitt. They met in front of Brown\u2019s residence sometime on the morning of Sunday, June 16, 1996. Bobbitt asked him if he had heard about the killings in the South End that had occurred earlier that morning. Brown said, \u201cNo. Why you asking me. Do I look like that type?\u201d Bobbitt testified that during this exchange Brown did not appear to have any problem understanding what he was saying; nor did Bobbitt have trouble understanding Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Ten days later, at approximately 3:25 a.m. on June 26, 1996, a police officer in Lincoln observed a van driving erratically along an otherwise quiet two-lane road. The officer stopped and approached the van. Brown was in the driver\u2019s seat, alone in the vehicle. Music was blaring from the radio. Without prompting, Brown presented the officer with an expired Rhode Island driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Brown would not, however, make eye contact with the officer, nor did he respond to a request that he turn down the radio\u2019s volume. When asked where he was coming from, Brown told the officer that he had taken two girls from a party in Cambridge to Winchester, and was now returning home.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The officer became concerned for his safety and called for backup. When another officer arrived, Brown was asked to step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>out of the vehicle. The officers asked Brown if they could search the van for drugs and weapons, and he assented. Inside they found a loaded shotgun and a spent shotgun shell.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Brown was placed under arrest for unlawful possession of a firearm and given Miranda warnings.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Using the serial number on the shotgun, the officers determined that it had been purchased at Bob Smith\u2019s Sporting Goods and reported stolen to the Boston police by Bobbitt. The shotgun was later test fired for ballistic analysis. The marks on the casings matched those on the casings found on Appleton Street. In a subsequent search of the apartment where Brown lived, the police found an empty box of twenty-gouge shotgun shells on the floor of his bedroom bearing a price tag from Bob Smith\u2019s Sporting Goods. They also found a thigh-length green coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The defense proceeded principally on the theory that Brown was not criminally responsible for his actions because of severe mental disease. This involved presenting extensive expert testimony, as well as testimony from Brown\u2019s family and friends regarding their observations of his mental deterioration in the years leading up to the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The primary defense witness was a forensic psychiatrist, whose observations were based on eight examinations of Brown (involving twenty-one hours), discussions with witnesses, and review of the records of other professionals. The expert opined that, at the time of the murders, Brown suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He exhibited many symptoms of this disease, including delusions, hallucinations, some disorganized speech, flat affect, and a loss of interest in friends, work, and social life. The expert testified that, even with these symptoms, those suffering paranoid schizophrenia are not completely impaired cognitively and maintain the capacity to do detailed planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The expert further opined that Brown exhibited signs of schizophrenia as early as 1993. This included social withdrawal, moodiness, and decreased attention to personal hygiene. By 1995, Brown had become \u201cgrossly psychotic.\u201d As a result, Brown suffered a host of visual and auditory delusions. One of these involved a woman in a chariot called \u201cHelen and the Hell Dogs\u201d whom Brown thought was following him. Brown also believed that he had invented a ray gun and a perpetual motion machine that ran on magnets. At various times he also thought he was the Messiah or an \u201canti-Christ,\u201d and that he had to write important books. Brown also had delusions about a real estate deal in which he would construct one hundred three-family houses in Roxbury in association with a group called the Tribe of Judah.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Homophobic delusions were particularly prominent in Brown\u2019s schizophrenia.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These often involved a group of friends with whom Brown socialized and went to dance clubs. Brown became convinced that members of his social group were secretly homosexuals, in league with the devil, with an intent to \u201cconvert\u201d him.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He also believed that he had a \u201cspecial role\u201d regarding \u201csexual immoralizers\u201d related to the Bible and the government. Some of Brown\u2019s delusions were particularly graphic, involving homosexual violence and rape.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">According to the expert, Brown\u2019s homophobic delusions were particularly prominent around the time of the killings. He obtained the gun because the delusional voices in his head told him to kill the \u201csexual immoralizers\u201d; and he went to the South End because \u201cthat\u2019s where the gays live.\u201d Brown told the defense expert during one interview that the voices in his head told him to kill two men, \u201cone for Sodom, one for Gomorrah.\u201d When he saw Ol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>iveira, the voices said, \u201cLet him be the first.\u201d As he moved down the street after the first shooting, the voices told Brown to \u201cshoot some more.\u201d When he saw Meyer, Brown thought Meyer was \u201cwalking like a lady,\u201d and so the voices told him to \u201cshoot him when he gets close.\u201d At another point Brown told the expert: \u201cThe gay people were sexual immoralizers. It was my job [to kill them] because I was communicating with the voices. When I would read the Bible almost every night, they would say, \u2018this is what we want you to do.\u2019 \u201d When asked by the expert if he thought killing was not right, Brown told him, \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">During another interview, Brown told the expert that on the night of the murders, he drank vodka and beer, and smoked marijuana. The voices then told him that it was time to kill the \u201csexual immoralizers.\u201d Brown told the expert that he asked one man he encountered if he were a homosexual. When that man said he was not, Brown moved on. When a second man \u2014 apparently Oliveira \u2014 answered, \u201cYes\u201d to the question, the voices told Brown to shoot him. Brown said that he was scared but did not feel as though he had any choice but to shoot, otherwise the voices might kill him. The voices were saying repeatedly to him, \u201cOne for Sodom, one for Gomorrah.\u201d When Brown then encountered Meyer, he told the expert that he asked him if he were a homosexual. Meyer replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and the voices told Brown, \u201cThis is the second one. Shoot him.\u201d Brown then ran away and hid in an alley for an hour, afraid of harm from a higher power and convinced that it was the end of the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The expert further testified that, at the time of the shootings, Brown was in a state of extreme psychosis, with his delusions and hallucinations overwhelming his ability to control himself. This caused panic, extreme fear, and confusion. Consequently, in the expert\u2019s opinion, Brown lacked the substantial capacity to appreciate the legal wrongfulness or illegality of his actions; and he lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The expert also opined that Brown was not malingering, and that he had no nonpsychotic motive to kill the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Two of Brown\u2019s family members testified to his mental deterioration. His older brother testified that between 1995 and June, 1996, Brown\u2019s dress changed from neat to sloppy. He became angry and confrontational. He told his brother that there were people after him. Between October, 1994, and March, 1995, Brown lived with a female cousin. She testified that, beginning in January, 1995, Brown became withdrawn, often staying in his room playing loud music. His dress and grooming habits deteriorated, and Brown became irritable and hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Members of Brown\u2019s social group also observed a change in him. When he first began associating with them, Brown was well groomed, well dressed, and in good physical shape. He was a particularly talented dancer. By early 1995, though, Brown had dropped out of his dancing group without explanation. In the fall of that year, one member of the group passed Brown in the street, but Brown did not seem to recognize him. Brown appeared in total disarray, with bulging eyes, dirty clothes, and a scraggly beard.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Bobbitt testified<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> that, in December, 1995, Brown asked him to drive with him to Philadelphia and back.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Throughout the trip, Brown asked Bobbitt repeatedly to look behind their vehicle to see if they were being followed. Brown repeatedly said, \u201cI wish you mother fuckers would stop following me.\u201d Bobbitt also observed Brown \u201chaving a conversation with the radio.\u201d The conversation seemed nonsensical to Bobbitt. Brown did not, however, have any difficulty driving the vehicle. On the return trip the two men were arrested in Pembroke, New Jersey, after Brown made an illegal U-turn in front of a police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Two of Brown\u2019s former employers also testified. Beginning in May, 1991, Brown worked as a technician in a laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). He did well in the job, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>improved his skills, and seemed popular with his coworkers. By December, 1994, Brown had become more \u201cdisheveled\u201d than before, and eventually he quit the job. He told his employer that he was going to work on home renovations with his brother.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In December, 1995, Brown was hired to work in another laboratory at MGH. By March, 1996, Brown was arriving late to work and not completing his assignments. Then, in May, 1996, Brown became drunk and behaved badly at a party held for laboratory staff. Brown was asked for his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">In rebuttal, the Commonwealth called its own expert, a psychiatrist in private practice, whose testimony continued over three days. He opined that Brown did not suffer from a psychotic illness on the day of the killings. In his opinion, Brown did not lack the substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his behavior to the requirements of law. Based on a test he gave Brown, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified that Brown might have been malingering. A defense surrebuttal expert who examined the same test results reached a different conclusion, and testified that Brown was not malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">3. <em>Competency to stand trial. </em>Brown argues that the judge\u2019s pretrial rulings on his competency deprived him of a fair trial. He asserts that the competency hearing was \u201cconstitutionally inadequate\u201d because the judge only ordered an \u201cexamination\u201d under \u00a7 15 (a) yet refused to order \u201cobservation and further examination\u201d under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(b), </em>at Bridgewater prior to the hearing.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> He also asserts that his hearing was inadequate because the judge refused to order the production of Brown\u2019s Bridgewater medical records and the tape recording of the District Court hearing held pursuant to <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 494-499 (1983) <em>(Rogers </em>hearing), see note 7, <em>supra, </em>for use at the competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>hearing. He also asserts that the evidence of competency was insufficient to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. We disagree with each of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\u201cIt has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>393 Mass. 393, 398 (1984), quoting <em>Drope </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171 (1975). See <em>Medina </em>v. <em>California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 439 (1992) (\u201cIt is well established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial\u201d). General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 15, provides the framework for a court to ensure that a defendant is competent prior to bringing him to trial. Section 15 <em>(a) </em>states that \u201c[wjhenever a court of competent jurisdiction doubts whether a defendant in a criminal case is competent to stand trial ... it may . . . order an examination of such defendant to be conducted by one or more qualified physicians or one or more qualified psychologists.\u201d After the \u00a7 15 (a) examination, \u201cthe court may order that the person be hospitalized at. . . Bridgewater state hospital ... for observation and further examination, if the court has reason to believe that such observation and further examination are necessary in order to determine whether mental illness or mental defect have so affected a person that he is not competent to stand trial.\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(b). </em>If the court is not satisfied that the defendant is competent to stand trial, \u201cthe court shall hold a hearing on whether the defendant is competent to stand trial.\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 <em>15(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\"><em>A </em>judge\u2019s determination of competency is entitled to substantial deference \u201cbecause the judge had the opportunity to view the witnesses in open court and to evaluate the defendant personally.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>420 Mass. 569, 574 (1995). The test for competency to stand trial is \u201cwhether the defendant has \u2018sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>supra, </em>quoting <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960). The Commonwealth must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is competent to stand trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowley, supra </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Brown suggests that the court \u201csimply bypass[ed] the step of sending [him] to Bridgewater for evaluation when a serious question regarding [his] competency remain[ed]\u201d after the \u00a7 15 <em>(a) </em>evaluation. However, the language of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(b) </em>(\u201cthe court <em>may </em>order that the person be hospitalized\u201d [emphasis added]) is permissive rather than mandatory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lameire, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 276 (2000) (judge may decide competency question after receiving report of \u00a7 15 [a] evaluation). See also <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 698, 709-710 (2005) (term \u201cmay\u201d is permissive rather than mandatory). At the time he requested the \u00a7 15 <em>(b) </em>examination, Brown had been committed to Bridgewater for several years pursuant to \u00a7 18 <em>(a), </em>and evaluations of him had already been filed with the court periodically during that commitment. We find no support in the record for Brown\u2019s assertion that the trial judge declined to order a \u201cnecessary [15 (h)] evaluation\u201d because of his \u201cdesire to avoid delay or to punish the defendant for voluntarily going off his medication.\u201d The judge\u2019s decision to rule on Brown\u2019s competency based on the \u00a7 15 <em>(a) </em>evaluations and the extensive psychiatric testimony at the competency hearing was not an abuse of discretion and it did not make the judge\u2019s subsequent determination of competency \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lameire, supra </em>at 276-277 (no abuse of discretion where judge relied on psychologist\u2019s preliminary examination of defendant for competency determination, without ordering \u00a7 15 [\u00a3&gt;] evaluation).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">In addition, the judge\u2019s refusal to order the production of Brown\u2019s Bridgewater medical records and the tape recording of the <em>Rogers </em>hearing did not render the hearing constitutionally inadequate. The competency hearing was four days long and included the testimony of four witnesses \u2014 two of whom testified regarding their observations of Brown at Bridgewater and his treatment while committed there. One of the witnesses testified about the <em>Rogers </em>hearing, including the resulting court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>order and the fact that Brown subsequently resumed taking his medications. Admission of the Bridgewater medical records and the tape recording of the hearing would have been cumulative of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Finally, we turn to the judge\u2019s substantive conclusion that Brown was competent to stand trial. The judge credited the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, which included discussion of Brown\u2019s medical history, the witness\u2019s comprehensive psychiatric evaluation of Brown, and the witness\u2019s conclusion that Brown was competent to stand trial. The judge also noted Brown\u2019s conduct and demeanor during the proceeding and his interaction with his attorneys, observing that he \u201cwas attentive and appeared at all times to interact appropriately with defense counsel.\u201d Although Brown is correct that a defendant\u2019s demeanor is not dispositive of the issue of competency, it is a relevant factor, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lameire, supra. </em>The judge was not obliged to accept the testimony of other experts who opined that the defendant was not competent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, supra </em>at 575, and cases cited. The evidence the judge found credible sufficed to meet the Commonwealth\u2019s burden, and support the judge\u2019s finding of competency.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\"><em>4. Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Brown moved for required findings of not guilty on all charges. The motions were denied after hearing. On appeal, Brown challenges this ruling, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the guilty verdicts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, we must determine whether the evidence, viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to satisfy a rational trier of fact that each element of the crime had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Our analysis asks not whether the evidence requires a finding of guilt, but whether it permits such a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>440 Mass. 396, 400-401 (2003). Accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). Because the motions were made at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, before the defense presented its evidence, we consider only the evidence admitted when the motions were filed \u2014 that is, only the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. 326, 330 (2000). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>370 Mass. 147, 150 n.1 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">On the basis of that evidence, the jury could have found that Brown, with the help of Bobbitt, obtained a twenty-gouge shotgun and ammunition on Saturday, June 15, 1996; that he fired the gun several times in front of his residence in Roxbury at approximately 2 a.m. on Sunday, June 16, 1996; and that, after evading the police who responded to the fired shots, he left his residence with the shotgun and went to the South End. The jury could have found further that Brown was the man who encountered Oliveira in front of 106 Appleton Street in the South End at approximately 3:30 a.m.; that he fired the shotgun twice at Oliveira, killing him; that he then ran down Appleton Street and across Dartmouth Street, encountering Meyer near 131 Appleton Street; that Brown shot Meyer in the back of the head, killing him instantly; and that he then fled by continuing down Appleton Street toward West Canton Street. The jury were also warranted in concluding that Brown obtained the gun intending to use it for the \u201cbusiness\u201d of killing, and that he approached and shot each victim deliberately, without provocation, and at close range, intending to cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In sum, based on the evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s casein-chief, it was both reasonable and possible for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Brown murdered Oliveira and Meyer, and that he did so with deliberate premeditation. Accordingly, the judge properly denied the motions for required findings of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">5. <em>Purported introduction of postarrest silence. </em>Following his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>arrest in Lincoln, Brown was interrogated by a police lieutenant. Brown told the lieutenant essentially what he had told the arresting officer: that he had dropped two girls off in Winchester and was returning home. After discussing this with Brown, the lieutenant \u201casked him if he had anything further to add to his statement that he had given to the officers during the night. And he responded, \u2018no, he did not.\u2019 \u201d Brown claims that by eliciting this testimony, the prosecutor impermissibly introduced evidence of his postarrest silence. Because there was no objection at trial, our review asks whether any error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 690 (1983) <em>(Mahdi).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">A defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent during postarrest custodial interrogation cannot be used against him at trial, and the provision of Miranda warnings involves an implicit assurance that a defendant\u2019s exercise of his rights will not penalize him at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>430 Mass. 654, 657 (2000), and cases cited. Contrary to Brown\u2019s characterization, the lieutenant\u2019s testimony that Brown had nothing further to say merely indicated that Brown\u2019s statement to him was complete. This did not constitute an assertion by Brown of his right to remain silent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hussey (No. 1), </em>410 Mass. 664, 671, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 988 (1991) (defendant\u2019s statement that \u201che had nothing else he could say\u201d did not amount to invocation of right to remain silent). Indeed, Brown had already waived his Miranda rights, told the lieutenant that he was aware of his rights and of the waiver, and answered the lieutenant\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Similarly unavailing is Brown\u2019s challenge to a question concerning the lieutenant\u2019s interrogation posed by the prosecutor to the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal expert. Over the course of his examination, the expert was asked a range of questions about various pieces of evidence and whether they were significant in the formation of his opinion of criminal responsibility. Specifically, the prosecutor asked the expert if it were significant to him that the lieutenant had a \u201cconversation regarding [his Miranda waiver] with Mr. Brown on the early morning of June twenty-sixth of 1996 and that [Brown] acknowledged understanding each of those rights and that he thereafter signed or read and then signed [the waiver form]?\u201d Brown argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>this testimony, which was intended to undermine the insanity defense, led to an impermissible inference that Brown\u2019s \u201cexercise of the right to remain silent is inconsistent with insanity.\u201d See <em>Mahdi, supra </em>at 695 (\u201cFundamental unfairness results from the use of evidence of such silence regardless whether the person exercising his or her constitutional right to remain silent claims insanity as a defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">This testimony does not involve the exercise of the right to remain silent, which Brown waived, or the improper use at trial of the exercise of such a right. Rather, the prosecutor\u2019s question properly focused on Brown\u2019s apparent comprehension of the content of what the lieutenant said to him,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and as such was relevant to the question of his sanity. <em>Mahdi </em>protects the exercise of rights, not the understanding of their content.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">6. <em>Voluntariness of statements. </em>In the Commonwealth\u2019s casein-chief, statements that Brown made between June 15 and June 26, 1996, were introduced through the testimony of various civilian and police witnesses. The defense did not object to the admission of these statements on voluntariness grounds either pretrial<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or at the time of their admission.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> On the tenth day of trial, once the defense case was underway, the Commonwealth filed a motion requesting that the judge rule that certain statements already admitted in evidence were voluntary.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Defense counsel asked the judge to wait before ruling on the voluntari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ness of the statements until after he had heard psychiatric testimony whether Brown was suffering from a mental illness. The judge declined to delay his ruling, and ruled, over objection, that the Commonwealth had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each of the enumerated statements was made freely, willingly, and voluntarily. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge provided a \u201chumane practice\u201d instruction to the jury pertaining to all of Brown\u2019s statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 149-152, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982) (\u201chumane practice\u201d instruction provides that jury should not consider defendant\u2019s confession or admission unless jury are satisfied that it was voluntary act). Brown argues here that the judge\u2019s failure to hold a voir dire on the voluntariness of these statements deprived him of a fair trial. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\u201cIt is . . . fundamental that a confession, or ... an admission, whether made to police or to a civilian, is admissible only if it is voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheriff, </em>425 Mass. 186, 192 (1997). See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 376 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 44, 48 (1980). \u201cStatements that are attributable in large measure to a defendant\u2019s debilitated condition, such as insanity ... are not the product of a rational intellect or free will and are involuntary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>416 Mass. 831, 834 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 651 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>395 Mass. 448, 455 (1985). When a defendant raises the issue of voluntariness, the judge must conduct a voir dire out of the jury\u2019s presence to determine whether the statements in question were voluntary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, supra. </em>If the defendant does not raise the issue of voluntariness, the judge has a sua sponte obligation to conduct a voir dire only if the voluntariness of the statements is a live issue such that there is evidence of a \u201csubstantial claim of involuntariness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stroyny, </em>435 Mass. 635, 646 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>426 Mass. 395, 398 (1998). If a substantial issue of involuntariness is raised, a judge\u2019s conclusion that a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>statements are voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cmust appear from the record with unmistakable clarity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, supra </em>at 152, quoting <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544 (1967). \u201cIn looking at the totality of the circumstances to determine the voluntariness of a statement, the judge may consider, among other things, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence, physical and mental stability, and experience with and in the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 203 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">As a threshold matter, we note that the statements Brown made to Bobbitt prior to the shootings are not subject to a voluntariness analysis, because the purchase of the gun was part and parcel of the crime. As we said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 504 (2003), \u201cWhile the rule [requiring voluntariness hearings] covers statements made by defendants to private parties in the aftermath of their criminal conduct ... we have never applied it to statements made by a defendant during the commission of his crime.\u201d Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Netto, </em>438 Mass. 686, 699 (2003). With respect to the remainder of Brown\u2019s statements, we conclude that the judge did not err in failing to conduct a voir dire hearing sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Brown concedes that he did not raise the issue of voluntariness prior to trial or at the time of the admission of the statements.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> He argues instead that voluntariness \u201cwas clearly a live issue in light of [Brown\u2019s] evidence of mental illness.\u201d However, when a defendant raises an insanity defense, the voluntariness of all his statements does not automatically become a live issue. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>410 Mass. 506, 515 (1991) (no live issue of voluntariness where judge lacked substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s insanity at time he made statements). When the statements were admitted in evidence there was no substantial claim that at the time they were made Brown was suffering from the effects of mental illness and that the statements were attributable in large measure to that mental illness. The testimony during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief was that Brown appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>understand what was said to him and that the witnesses who testified to his statements did not have trouble understanding him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, supra </em>at 514. Defense counsel\u2019s strategy with respect to the statements was to question whether they, in fact, had been made, rather than challenging their voluntariness.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">To the extent that the voluntariness of Brown\u2019s statements became a live issue after their admission (during the defense case), the judge properly submitted the voluntariness issue to the jury by providing the humane practice instruction. See <em>id. </em>at 512 (\u201cif the voluntariness of a confession or admission remains a live issue after evidence of the confession or admission has been presented to the jury, then the \u2018humane practice\u2019 of Massachusetts dictates that the judge instruct the jury that they may consider the voluntariness of the confession or admission and reject any statements which they consider involuntary\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Girouard, </em>436 Mass. 657, 667 (2002) (whether defendant\u2019s mental disability affected voluntariness of his statements properly left for jury\u2019s determination where \u201cit was only during the defendant\u2019s presentation of his case at trial that he proffered evidence on this issue, namely, testimony from his expert witness who had performed a psychological evaluation of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Finally, we address Brown\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of proving the voluntariness of his statements beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge found that the Commonwealth had met this burden, even though he did not conduct (nor was he required to conduct) a voir dire. The finding, even if not required in this case as a predicate to the admission of the statements, was requested by the Commonwealth. It is supported by testimony that at the time Brown made statements to his friends he did not appear to have any trouble understanding questions posed to him nor did they have any trouble understanding him, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cryer, </em>426 Mass. 562, 566 (1998) (judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s confession voluntary supported by testimony of interrogating officers that \u201cdefendant appeared sober and coher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>ent, that he did not appear to have any problems understanding them, and that they had no problems understanding him\u201d), and, with respect to the statements made to police officers, by testimony that Brown signed two Miranda waivers after appearing to understand the rights they conveyed. See <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">7. <em>Intoxication instruction. </em>The judge refused to instruct the jury on intoxication, as requested.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Brown argues that this constituted error. \u201cAn instruction on voluntary intoxication is not required absent evidence of \u2018debilitating intoxication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chaleumphong, </em>434 Mass. 70, 78 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Erdely, </em>430 Mass. 149, 152 (1999). Such evidence must support the inference that, \u201cat the time of the killing, intoxication impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to form any requisite criminal intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>436 Mass. 598, 603 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>448 Mass. 180, 188-189 (2007) (judge\u2019s refusal to provide intoxication instruction not error where there was no evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication at time of killing).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Neither Bobbitt nor any other witness who was in Brown\u2019s company prior to the murders testified that Brown either consumed or appeared debilitated by the consumption of intoxicating substances. Consequently, in support of his argument, Brown points to the testimony of his psychiatric expert that Brown stated to him that prior to the shootings Brown had smoked marijuana and ingested vodka and beer. However, as the judge instructed the jury, this testimony was admitted only as a basis for the expert\u2019s opinion, not for the truth of the underlying statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>433 Mass. 575, 577-578 &amp; n.1 (2001) (judge instructed jury that expert could testify to basis of his opinion but that where basis constituted statements of other people, those statements were \u201cnot admitted for the truth\u201d); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 106 (1982) (psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>witness\u2019s testimony about facts that were the basis of his opinion, which was \u201cadmitted for the limited purpose of laying the foundation for his opinion,\u201d was proper). Similarly, the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert that Brown stated that he had been drinking prior to the shootings and that Brown was drinking excessively in the months leading up to the murders is based on hearsay that was not admitted as substantive evidence. In addition, none of this evidence \u2014 or any other evidence admitted at trial \u2014 demonstrated how much or for how long Brown had been drinking on the night of the shootings or what effect any alcohol that he may have ingested had on him, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chaleumphong, supra </em>(no evidence of debilitating intoxication where there was testimony that defendant was not drunk even though there was evidence he may have consumed alcohol), or whether his ability to form the requisite criminal intent was impaired, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, supra </em>(even though there was testimony that defendant had been drinking and smoking marijuana, judge correctly refused to instruct on intoxication where there was no evidence showing that intoxication impaired defendant\u2019s ability to form requisite criminal intent). On this record, the evidence did not warrant or require an instruction on intoxication, and the judge did not err in declining to give it<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">8. <em>Exclusion of certain of Brown\u2019s psychiatric records. </em>At trial, the judge refused to admit in evidence Brown\u2019s Bridgewater medical records.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Brown argues that this exclusion constituted error, and that it violated his right to present a defense under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, specifically his right to \u201cplace before the jury any evidence which is at all probative of his mental condition,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Louraine, </em>390 Mass. 28, 34 (1983). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201cIn the face of \u2018legitimate demands of the adversarial system,\u2019 \u201d the right to present a defense \u201cmay be tempered according to the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>439 Mass. 547, 552 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>372 Mass. 337, 343 (1977). The judge may exclude evidence that is \u201ccumulative, repetitive, or confusing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, supra </em>at 553, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duming, </em>406 Mass. 485, 495 (1990). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>444 Mass. 586, 590 (2005) (\u201cjudge did not abuse his discretion, or deny the defendant\u2019s rights to present a defense . . . under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights or the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, by excluding testimony that essentially was cumulative\u201d). Here, Brown introduced extensive evidence at trial about his mental condition during the period in which he was hospitalized at Bridgewater, including the detailed testimony of four expert witnesses pertaining to observations, evaluations, and the treatment of Brown during his commitment to Bridgewater. The Bridgewater medical records would have been cumulative of this evidence.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the records and there was no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">9. <em>Exclusion of students from jury. </em>Of the 155 members of the venire, twenty-four were college students. The judge excluded all of them on grounds of hardship. Of these, only three asked for a hardship excuse without prompting. The judge specifically suggested to twelve of the students that their service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>would create a hardship after they had initially indicated that they were not seeking a hardship excuse.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Brown argues that this exclusion of students from the jury deprived him of a fair trial. Neither party objected to the exclusion of any specific student or to the exclusion of students generally. Accordingly our review is under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights require that a jury be \u201cdrawn from a source fairly representative of the community.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>382 Mass. 86, 96 (1980) <em>(Bastarache), </em>quoting <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 538 (1975) <em>(Taylor).</em><footnotemark><em>45</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We have previously rejected the argument that col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>lege students constitute a distinctive group for purposes of the fair cross section analysis required by <em>Bastarache, supra, </em>and <em>Taylor, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>438 Mass. 142, 149, cert. denied, 538 U.S. 966 (2003) <em>(Evans). </em>Brown offers no legal argument that would cause us to reconsider that conclusion, nor does he point to any evidence suggesting that the jury pool was not otherwise \u201cfairly representative of the community.\u201d Consequently, to the extent that the judge\u2019s exclusion of students was improper, we do not conclude that it created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We do agree, however, that the judge\u2019s exclusion of students, insofar as it was systematic, was improper. In <em>Evans, supra </em>at 149, we approved a judge\u2019s exclusion of students on the ground of hardship insofar as it \u201cwas based on individual circumstances and not on the basis of any policy, and that the decision in each instance was within the judge\u2019s discretion under G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 40 (trial lasting more than three days may be ground to excuse juror for hardship).\u201d In contrast, in this case the judge\u2019s decision to exclude students without an individualized finding of hardship is apparent. Only three of the students in the venire asked for a hardship excuse. The rest were excused without discussion, or directly prompted by the judge to ask for such an excuse (which was then granted). The exclusion of students without an individualized finding of hardship violates G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 3 (\u201cNo person shall be exempted or excluded from serving as a grand or trial juror because of . . . occupation\u201d). Students are not to be excluded simply by virtue of their occupation. As with any other hardship excuse, those for students must be based on an individualized finding and not a blanket rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">10. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>In addition to our consideration of the issues raised by the parties in this appeal, we have independently reviewed the entire record of the case as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Brown asks that we exercise our extraordinary power under that section to reverse his convictions and grant him a new trial. In support he cites the extensive evidence of his mental illness, suggesting that the jury should have returned a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>While Brown did present substantial evidence supporting his insanity defense, our task is not to determine whether the verdicts are those we would have returned, but whether they are consonant with justice. Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, does not \u201cconvert this court into a second jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168, 181 (1970), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gricus, </em>317 Mass. 403, 406-407 (1944). The insanity defense was fully and fairly presented to the jury, and the Commonwealth offered evidence in rebuttal. The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury about the insanity defense were correct, comprehensible, and comprehensive. In similar cases, we have concluded, \u201cSince the issue of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility was fully and fairly before the jury . . . justice does not require that their verdict be disturbed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lunde, </em>390 Mass. 42, 50 (1983), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>373 Mass. 65, 72 (1977).

Brown resumed taking his medications following the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b772-10\">The other two witnesses called by Brown were staff members at Bridge-water who testified that Brown was suffering from schizophrenia but did not provide opinions whether he was competent to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Further details of the competency proceedings are discussed, <em>infra, </em>in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>consideration of Brown\u2019s challenge of the finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Although he imposed sentence to be served at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction, the judge recommended that the defendant remain at Bridgewater for observation relative to his physical and mental safety. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alfonso, ante </em>738 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Bobbitt testified that on Saturday, June 15, 1996, he had no trouble understanding what Brown said to him; nor did Brown seem to have trouble understanding him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Earlier on Saturday, June 15, 1996, Brown had cashed a paycheck dated June 13, 1996, for $297.17 at All Checks Cashed in Roxbury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\">The shotgun operated by a \u201cpump action.\u201d A tube below the barrel would hold several shells.

The officer receiving the waiver testified that Brown appeared to understand the rights he had explained to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Three other expert witnesses called by the defense \u2014 two psychiatrists and a psychologist, all employed at Bridgewater State Hospital \u2014 also testified. Each made the same diagnosis as the primary expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The defense\u2019s primary expert testified that homophobic delusions are common in paranoid schizophrenics who have conflicts about their own homosexual impulses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">In February, 1995, Brown was arrested in Miami, Florida. He told a doctor at the Dade County jail that he had come to Miami in order to flee the sexual assaults of his social group, and he recounted many of the delusions he later described to the defense expert. Brown was diagnosed with paranoid homophobic psychosis and forcibly medicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The man who appeared most prominently in Brown\u2019s delusions was a member of Brown\u2019s social and dancing group. He testified that he had never had any contact with Brown of a sexual nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-447 (1967), we adopted the Model Penal Code\u2019s formulation for the insanity defense: \u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01 (Proposed Official Draft 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Bobbitt was called as a witness by the Commonwealth during its case-in-chief; however, the defense elicited testimony on cross-examination that it later argued supported Brown\u2019s insanity defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The defense expert testified that Brown made this trip in response to the delusional voices he was hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The defense expert testified that Brown quit his job at the laboratory because of his delusion about the \u201cTribe of Judah,\u201d involving construction of one hundred three-family residences in Roxbury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The docket indicates that Brown filed motions for observation and examination pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(b), </em>on February 28, 2001, and March 12, 2001. There is no indication that the judge took action on the first motion, and the second motion was denied after a hearing. During the competency hearing, on March 20, 2001, defense counsel again moved for a \u00a7 15 <em>(b) </em>examination, which the judge denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The judge explicitly noted in his written memorandum that the burden of proof was on the Commonwealth. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>393 Mass. 393, 400 (1984) (reversal warranted where \u201c[i]t is not clear from the record . . . whether the judge placed the burden of proving competency on the prosecution, as is appropriate\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\">This point is of particular importance in this case because the defense, which sought to negate Brown\u2019s criminal responsibility on the basis of mental disease, effectively constituted an admission that Brown killed Oliveira and Meyer. Because the defense case is not considered, we also do not consider whether it caused deterioration of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. 317, 323 (1999) (deterioration occurs when Commonwealth\u2019s evidence shown to be incredible or conclusively incorrect).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The question to the rebuttal expert was one in a long line that recited portions of the evidence and asked the expert if they were significant. Even were we to find some error in the question about the lieutenant\u2019s interrogation of Brown, it would not approach a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Significantly, in his summation, which included an extended attack on Brown\u2019s insanity defense, the prosecutor made no mention of Brown\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Prior to trial, Brown had filed a motion to suppress, inter alla, his statements to the police as fruits of an unlawful search of his automobile. Brown did not raise the issue of the voluntariness of his statements in the motion. The judge, however, briefly discussed the voluntariness of one of Brown\u2019s statements to the police in his written memorandum denying the motion, noting that Brown failed to offer any evidence that the statement was involuntary, and concluding that Brown spoke voluntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Brown did object to the admission of some of these statements on hearsay grounds. These objections were correctly overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\">The Commonwealth specifically listed statements to Bobbitt on June 15, 1996; Bobbitt and Jada Hill on June 16; Bobbitt on June 16 or June 17; Sam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>uel Lewis on June 18; Lewis, Bobbitt, and Michael Holman on June 19; and Officers Richard McCarty and Randall Azzato and Lieutenant Kevin Mooney on June 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Brown\u2019s motion to suppress, see note 33, <em>supra, </em>which challenged statements made by Brown to the police as fruits of an unlawful search, did not serve to raise the issue of their voluntariness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>410 Mass. 506, 509-510 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, </em>443 Mass. 93, 97 (2004) (\u201cwhen a defendant has made a considered and tactical decision not to challenge voluntariness, the judge need not obstruct that strategy by conducting a voir dire\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Because we hold that the judge\u2019s ruling of voluntariness was based on adequate findings of fact, we reject Brown\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s use of his statements in closing argument constituted error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Although defense counsel submitted written requests for a number of instructions, including an instruction on intoxication, he did not raise or argue for the intoxication instruction at the charging conference (in which other contested instructions were discussed at some length); nor did he suggest in his closing argument that Brown was intoxicated at the time of the murders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Because we conclude that an intoxication instruction was not warranted, we reject Brown\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s failure to provide an intoxication instruction relieved the Commonwealth of a portion of its burden of proof in violation of his right to due process under the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The defense correctly points out that the Commonwealth suggested in closing argument that Brown might have been \u201cabusing alcohol and abusing marijuana\u201d on the night of the shootings. Although Brown does not raise this as error, we examine it in the context of our review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Passley, </em>428 Mass. 832, 834-835 (1999), and conclude that, to the extent the argument was improper, it did not create a substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bregoli, </em>431 Mass. 265, 278 (2000) (although prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper where he used evidence substantively in closing argument that was admitted only for limited purpose, any effect was minimal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Brown contends that his Bridgewater records were admissible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>G.
