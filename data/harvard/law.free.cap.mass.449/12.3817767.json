On appeal, he alleges error in (1) the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>instruction on the use of evidence of intoxication when considering the issues of deliberate premeditation, extreme atrocity or cruelty, and malice, and (2) the denial of his motion for a new trial, based primarily on an assertion of counsel\u2019s failure to investigate adequately a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense, without an evidentiary hearing. He also asks us to reduce the degree of guilt found by the jury pursuant to our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We affirm the conviction and decline to order a reduction in the degree of guilt or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant and Francis Albis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> spent the evening of March 4, 2000, \u201cbar hopping\u201d in North Adams. Between approximately 8 p.m. on March 4 and 2 a.m. on March 5, they visited three bars and each consumed approximately ten drinks \u2014 some were beers and some were mixed drinks. The two men showed signs of alcohol consumption, but neither appeared intoxicated. Early in the evening the defendant also took two Artane pills, a medication prescribed for him for Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, a developmental abnormality that affects the involuntary movements controlled by the frontal networks of the brain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">While inside the last bar visited that night, they encountered David Champagne, the victim. The defendant became angry and upset. He told Albis that he wanted to \u201ckick [Champagne\u2019s] ass\u201d for beating up his cousin. The defendant and Albis told several people words to the effect that they wanted revenge for what Champagne did to \u201ctheir\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">At \u201clast call,\u201d Champagne left the bar. The defendant and Albis left about three minutes later. They hailed the driver of a nearby parked car, who, coincidentally, happened to be Champagne, and asked him for a ride home. Champagne said he was going their way. Witnesses observed that their conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tian appeared amicable, but Albis noticed the defendant becoming upset and told him he did not want any trouble. Albis sat in the front passenger seat; the defendant sat in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">While they were traveling the defendant angrily asked Champagne, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Champagne said he did not. The defendant said, \u201cYou go with my cousin . . . you beat her up.\u201d Champagne denied the accusation. The defendant continued speaking angrily at Champagne after he parked his car near the adjacent apartment buildings where Albis and the defendant lived. Champagne and Albis got out of the car. Champagne told Albis he wanted the defendant out of his car. Albis grabbed Champagne and told him he did not want to get involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The defendant got out of the car and attacked Champagne. He struck Champagne several times in the back. Champagne fell and the defendant stood over him, striking him repeatedly. Albis eventually pulled the defendant off Champagne because the defendant was landing all the blows. He said Champagne had \u201chad enough.\u201d At that point Albis noticed for the first time that the defendant had a knife in his hand. Early in the evening the defendant had mentioned he was carrying a knife. Albis was worried about what just happened. He walked to the upstairs tenants\u2019 apartment in his apartment building because the lights were on. As he walked past Champagne he could hear gurgling. The defendant followed Albis.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Inside the apartment the defendant repeatedly asked one of three tenants if he recognized him, to which the tenant repeatedly replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Eventually he said, \u201cNo,\u201d just to appease the defendant. The defendant then grabbed the man, pushed him against a wall, and said boastfully he \u201cjust did a guy\u201d and was not afraid \u201cto do another one.\u201d The defendant held out his knife and said he stabbed the man fifteen times because he molested a family member. Albis said he was going to telephone the police. The defendant told him not to, and said he would handle it. He then told Albis and the three tenants he would \u201cget away with it\u201d because he had Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. The three tenants thought the defendant was drunk. Albis and the defendant went downstairs to Albis\u2019s apartment where they argued after Albis again mentioned telephoning the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Albis\u2019s wife, Melissa, and one of the upstairs tenants went outside to look for a body, which they thought they saw in the distance. When they returned, Melissa Albis tried to telephone police, but the defendant stopped her. He assured her that her husband had nothing to do with the killing, and that he would get away with it because he had Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. When she insisted on telephoning police, the defendant reminded her that he had just killed someone and would have no problem killing her or her five children.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The defendant left the Albises\u2019 apartment and returned with his wife and stepbrother. He washed the knife, and told his wife to make sure Melissa Albis did not go anywhere. He then told Melissa Albis in a threatening tone, \u201cYou know nothing, you seen nothing and you heard nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">At approximately 7 a.m. on March 5, 2000, a North Adams police officer responded to a report about a man lying on the ground at 85 North Holden Street, and discovered Champagne\u2019s body. It was a \u201cstone\u2019s throw\u201d from Albis\u2019s apartment. An autopsy revealed twenty-two stab wounds. He was stabbed in the back thirteen times, puncturing his left lung four times and his right lung once. He was stabbed in the front of the chest four times, resulting in two lacerations of the liver. Champagne bled to death as a result of the injuries to these internal organs. In addition, he was stabbed through the left side of his neck; through his left cheek and tongue; and all the way through his left shoulder. Three of his wounds were defensive. The wounds were consistent with the defendant\u2019s knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Police interviewed people in the last bar where Champagne had been, and were directed to Albis and the defendant. Police questioned the two men nearly simultaneously but in different rooms. At first, Albis described going to the bars but omitted what happened afterward. He later described the entire series of events. The defendant first told police he could not remember things because he had been drinking. He admitted \u201cbar hopping\u201d with Albis, but denied getting into a fight with Champagne. When his interrogators learned of Albis\u2019s statement, they told the defendant they did not believe him. He then asked for a soft drink, a cigarette, and the opportunity to see his son. The officers acceded to his requests. The defendant disclosed that Champagne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>had abused his cousin, who asked him to \u201cbeat his ass.\u201d He described the fight with Champagne after Champagne drove him and Albis home. Champagne never hit him and he punched Champagne an undetermined number of times. He remembered taking out his knife, but said he had no recollection of stabbing Champagne. He told them where he had put the knife and signed a consent form allowing police to search his apartment. The defendant said he did not intend to kill Champagne. One officer overheard him tell his son that he was never coming home because he had done a terrible thing \u2014 he had hurt and killed a man.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">A variety of forensic tests and comparisons produced the following results. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing of the blood on the boots worn by the defendant matched Champagne\u2019s DNA. The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on both rear doors of Champagne\u2019s car. Boot prints at the scene matched the boots worn by the defendant. No blood was found on the knife but blood is water soluble and can be washed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The defendant offered testimony of Dr. Paul Spiers, a licensed clinical and neuropsychologist with special expertise on the effects of alcohol on the brain. He opined that, based on his review of the defendant\u2019s medical records and the witness statements, and based on the combined effects of the Artane<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the alcohol the defendant consumed that evening, he was not able specifically to intend his actions or the results of his actions at the time he struck Champagne.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">2. <em>Intoxication instruction. </em>The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s instruction on intoxication was deficient in numerous respects. He asserts the judge declined, over objection, to give the supplemental instruction on intoxication as it appears in the Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 61-63 (1999), that she failed to give any intoxication instruction as to the third prong of malice or to the so-called <em>Cunneen </em>factors to be considered on the question of extreme atrocity or cruelty, and that she failed to instruct the jury that they could consider the defendant\u2019s inges<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>tian of drugs. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The trial transcript indicates that trial counsel, who is not appellate counsel, submitted to the judge written requests for jury instructions. However, those requests for instructions are not in the record. They were not filed with the clerk of the court and docketed, and they were not discussed with sufficient detail at the charge conference to assist us in determining what was requested specifically as to intoxication. In particular, there is no reference in the transcript to the Model Jury Instructions on Homicide, <em>supra. </em>Similarly, when trial counsel objected to the judge\u2019s instruction on intoxication, it was unspecific. We conclude that the defendant has failed to preserve properly the question of the judge\u2019s failure to follow the model instructions. We review to determine if any error resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>442 Mass. 356, 370 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Although it is recommended that a judge give the model instmction on intoxication, failure to give it is not error. \u201cAll that we have ever required be said to juries about the effect of drug [including alcohol] consumption on a defendant\u2019s intent or knowledge would be satisfied by a simple instruction that the jury may consider credible evidence of the effects of the defendant\u2019s consumption of drugs [or alcohol, or both] in deciding whether the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving the defendant\u2019s state of mind beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 300 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>434 Mass. 307, 316 (2001). See also Model Jury Instructions on Homicide, <em>supra </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The judge\u2019s instructions on deliberately premeditated murder began with a definition of deliberate premeditation followed by a definition of malice. Both were correct. She then instructed: \u201cIn considering intent, in considering premeditation . . . you may take into consideration ingestion of alcohol by the defendant in determining whether or not he had the ability to premeditate, he had the ability to have a specific intent, a specific purpose to kill.\u201d This instruction was adequate. The jury\u2019s attention was separately directed at the elements of this theory of murder that might be affected by intoxication. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>were told they could consider evidence of alcohol consumption appropriately on the question of premeditation, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>420 Mass. 226, 232 (1995), and malice (specific intent), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, supra </em>at 298-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The judge\u2019s instruction on the elements of murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty began with an explanation of the three prongs of malice, followed by a definition of extreme atrocity or cruelty and a discussion of the <em>Cunneen </em>factors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, supra. </em>Her correct instructions were followed immediately by an instruction that when \u201cdetermining whether or not the defendant had the necessary state of mind, the malice, as I have defined it, for first degree murder, extreme atrocity or cruelty, you may turn to all of the circumstances as you find them to be in determining such state of mind, including alcohol ingestion and whether or not that affected the defendant\u2019s state of mind.\u201d This instruction focused the jury\u2019s attention on the elements of malice applicable to this theory of murder. Significantly, her use of the term \u201cstate of mind\u201d is broader than the term \u201cspecific intent,\u201d which she used in the intoxication instruction given with the theory of deliberate premeditation. \u201cState of mind\u201d is the same term this court used in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, supra </em>at 300, to describe collectively the Commonwealth\u2019s burden in cases involving proof of a defendant\u2019s \u201cintent or knowledge.\u201d We are satisfied that the judge\u2019s instruction adequately informed the jury they could consider evidence of alcohol consumption on the element of malice applicable to the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, including the knowledge component of the third prong of malice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, </em>411 Mass. 293, 298-299 (1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The defendant correctly points out that the intoxication instruction given with the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty fails to tell the jury they could consider evidence of alcohol consumption among the circumstances when determining whether the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 648-649 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>(1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 455 (1984) (where evidence suggests defendant was so far overcome by intoxicating substances as to be incapable of deliberate premeditation or of committing murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty, he is entitled, as matter of common and not constitutional law, on request, to instruction that jury may consider such evidence when deciding whether Commonwealth had met its burden as to deliberate premeditation or extreme atrocity or cruelty). Because the defendant did not specifically object on this basis, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>433 Mass. 481, 489 (2001), we review to determine if any error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>420 Mass. 95, 113 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The evidence of extreme atrocity or cruelty was overwhelming. The attack was disproportionate to what was needed to bring about death. The defendant first attacked Champagne by stabbing him several times in the back. He continued stabbing Champagne, who never landed one blow, until Albis intervened. Champagne suffered twenty-two stab wounds, most of which were delivered to the torso with considerable force and a high likelihood of serious injury or death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Champagne was conscious during much of the attack, as he had three defensive wounds on his arms, which would have occurred after the wounds to his back. The defendant appeared to take pleasure in the killing. Minutes after the stabbing he boasted that he had just killed someone by stabbing him fifteen times, and he displayed the knife he used. Most, if not all, the <em>Cunneen </em>factors are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The evidence of intoxication was not strong. Although a significant amount of drugs and alcohol were consumed (two pills and approximately ten drinks over seven hours), the defendant was not debilitated by it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>443 Mass. 782, 793-794 (2005). He took the knife out of his pocket, opened it (it is a folding knife) by pressing a \u201cbutton\u201d that required considerable pressure, and kept it concealed even from Albis, who told the defendant he did not want any problems, until the last minute. He stabbed Champagne with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>some precision and considerable force. He knew he had killed someone, and he was well aware of the details of the killing. He had the presence of mind to count fifteen of his twenty-two thrusts. He intimidated people with details of what he had done to gain their silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Where the jury rejected the claim that, based on evidence of the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol, the Commonwealth had failed to prove he acted with malice as to this theory of murder or that he acted with deliberate premeditation, it is highly unlikely that they would have found that the defendant did not commit the murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty based on the same evidence of his consumption of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s final assertion of error as to the intoxication instruction, namely, that the judge made no mention that the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s consumption of drugs in conjunction with alcohol. There was no specific objection, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, supra, </em>so we consider whether any error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">There was no dispute that the defendant had taken two Artane pills between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. on March 4, 2000, about one hour before he and Albis went out. He had not consumed any alcohol thus far that evening. By the time they had arrived at the first bar it appeared to the bartender that the defendant had been drinking. Dr. Spiers testified about the synergistic effects of Artane and alcohol. There was no serious dispute about the amount of alcohol consumed. There was no attempt to ascertain the effect of alcohol on the defendant apart from the effect of Artane. In the circumstances, it is highly unlikely that the jury did anything but consider the defendant\u2019s state of sobriety based on the combined effects of Artane and alcohol. Indeed, that was probably the only workable way to consider the evidence. We conclude that the failure to instruct the jury that they could consider the effects of both drugs and alcohol would have made no difference in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">3. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant appeals from the denial of his motion for a new trial, which is based primarily on a claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present evidence that the defendant was incapable of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>requisite mental state needed to establish deliberate premeditation or malice by virtue of the combined effects of his level of intoxication and Tourette\u2019s Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The first aspect of the claim is that trial counsel failed to investigate a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense based on mental disease or defect and the defendant\u2019s medical history. He in fact did so, and the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, so found. Dr. Spiers\u2019s affidavit, filed with the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, indicates he had been engaged by trial counsel precisely for this purpose. Trial counsel provided Dr. Spiers with the defendant\u2019s medical records, police reports, and witness statements, and he consulted with trial counsel about testifying that the \u201calcohol [the defendant consumed] had an enhanced disinhibitory effect on [his] nervous system because he suffers from Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, [which] would have resulted in a diminished capacity to think rationally and control his behavior.\u201d He also was prepared to offer a series of opinions that the defendant \u201c[lacked] the capacity to premeditate . . . could not formulate a specific intent to kill . . . was not capable of formulating the intent to cause grievous injury or of understanding from the circumstances that his actions presented the substantial likelihood of causing Mr. Champagne\u2019s death,\u201d and that he lacked the capacity to commit murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty. Trial counsel reviewed the medical records and also spoke with Dr. Jay Ellis, the defendant\u2019s treating neurologist for seventeen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Trial counsel indicated in his affidavit that he had concerns about the viability of building a defense around Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, based in part on his own observations of the absence of any serious problems manifested by the defendant\u2019s behavior and appearance, and based in part on evidence that, shortly after the killing, the defendant told witnesses that he would get away with the killing because he had Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. To trial counsel this \u201csmacked of a specific intent. . . to . . . kill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Notwithstanding his concerns, and mindful that the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case meant there was little hope for an acquittal, trial counsel determined that the best defense was to develop evidence that would result in a manslaughter instruction. He notified the district attorney of his intent to pursue a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>based on Tourette\u2019s Syndrome combined with the evidence of substantial consumption of alcohol. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 874 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>431 Mass. 822, 828-829 (2000). He furnished the report of Dr. Spiers and the defendant\u2019s medical records to the district attorney. The district attorney interviewed Dr. Ellis, whose reports were included. He expressed the opinion that Tourette\u2019s Syndrome played no part in the killing. The district attorney notified trial counsel that if he proceeded with a defense based on Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, he intended to call Dr. Ellis, the defendant\u2019s treating neurologist, in rebuttal. As a result, trial counsel decided to forgo a defense based on Tourette\u2019s Syndrome and to proceed with intoxication as the focal point of the defense. Dr. Spiers gave essentially the same ultimate opinion, tied to the defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption, that he was prepared to give using Tourette\u2019s Syndrome as the basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The judge found that the \u201chighly skilled\u201d trial counsel\u2019s decision was not manifestly unreasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She noted that \u201c[i]f [trial counsel] had used the defendant\u2019s neurological disorder as a means of getting a manslaughter instruction, he would have emphasized the defendant\u2019s statements in the process of doing so. Instead, [he] chose to emphasize the defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption\u201d to obtain a manslaughter instruction. Where the motion judge was also the trial judge, she could rely on her familiarity with the facts of the case, as she did here, and her conclusion is entitled to \u201cspecial deference.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, <em>771 </em>(1999). We agree that his strategy was not manifestly unreasonable. As such, it cannot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, 374 </em>Mass. 722, 728 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The defendant also faults trial counsel for failing to follow up on Dr. Spiers\u2019s suggestion to consult a physician specializing in neurology and have the defendant tested for organic brain deficits. Subsequent testing for temporal lobe epilepsy was negative. The defendant has failed to show that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, 373 </em>Mass. 109, 115 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>There is no merit to the claim that trial counsel \u201cmade a series of unfulfilled promises about evidence concerning [the defendant\u2019s] limited education, his dysfunctional family and deprived childhood, his long history of alcoholism, his inability to maintain employment, his history of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, and his record of treatment for the condition.\u201d Dr. Spiers testified about the fact that the defendant had Tourette\u2019s Syndrome and he described the manifestations of the condition. He also testified that, based on his review of witness statements and the statement given by the defendant to the police, the defendant was manifesting the effects of the alcohol he consumed as well as the symptoms of his Tourette\u2019s Syndrome immediately after the stabbing. Other witnesses also testified that the defendant had Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. The reference in counsel\u2019s opening statement to Tourette\u2019s Syndrome materialized sufficiently during the trial. The details in trial counsel\u2019s opening statement that did not materialize in the evidence either became evident from the general tenor of the case, or were so inconsequential that, we can say with utmost confidence, they made no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The crux of the defense began with Dr. Spiers\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. It provided foundation for the defendant\u2019s possession and use of Artane, and the combined effects of Artane and alcohol on him. Dr. Spiers\u2019s opinion testimony permitted a voluntary intoxication instruction, which in turn afforded the best opportunity for a manslaughter verdict. Without that testimony, it was not at all clear that the defendant was entitled to a voluntary intoxication instruction where there was no evidence of debilitating intoxication. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>443 Mass. 782, 793-794 (2005). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the defense was well integrated from trial counsel\u2019s opening statement to his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that counsel had not settled on his theory of defense until the last day of trial is belied by the record. Trial counsel avoided any emphasis of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome except as noted. The place in the record on which the defendant relies involves a sidebar conference requested by the district attorney to remove any doubt in his own mind that the defense was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>proceeding with a so-called \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense based on Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. Trial counsel assured the judge and the prosecutor that that was not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Finally, the judge did not abuse her discretion by deciding the claim of ineffective assistance in the motion for a new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 660 (1992). The defendant\u2019s motion and affidavits did not raise a substantial issue by \u201ccasting] doubt on\u201d the issue of trial counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 608 (2001). The judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s motion and affidavits did not raise a substantial issue is entitled to substantial deference where she was also the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeVincent, </em>421 Mass. 64, 69 (1995). The judge could properly disregard, without conducting a hearing, the self-serving assertions in the defendant\u2019s affidavits that trial counsel did not discuss trial strategy with him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scoggins, </em>439 Mass. 571, 578 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The defendant also raised in his motion for a new trial the issue of the judge\u2019s failure to give an instruction, conformably with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 266 (1989), which requires a cautionary instruction as to witness credibility when cooperation agreements are predicated on a duty to offer truthful testimony. There was no objection at trial to the omission. There was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because the case against the defendant was, as the judge noted, overwhelming. The testimony of Albis, the cooperating witness, was corroborated by other witnesses. The defendant\u2019s statement to police also largely corroborated Albis\u2019S testimony, and the defendant told police where he had hidden the knife.
