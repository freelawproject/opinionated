In determining that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, required this result by its definition of rape as sexual intercourse compelled \u201cby force and against [the] will\u201d of the victim, we stated that \u201c[fjraud cannot be allowed to supply the place of the force which the statute makes mandatory.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, supra </em>at 384. In the present case, the Commonwealth asks us to overrule the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision and hold that misrepresentations can in fact substitute for the requisite force. Because the <em>Goldenberg </em>case has been the law for nearly one-half century, during which the Legislature has had ample opportunity to change the rape statute and has not done so, we decline to overrule our decision in <em>Goldenberg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>Relevant law. </em>The crime of rape is defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>(t\u00ed): </em>\u201cWhoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a person and compels such person to submit by force and against his will, or compels such person to submit by threat of bodily injury, shall be punished . . . .\u201d This definition has changed over time, but the requirement that the act be \u201cby force and against [the] will\u201d of the victim has remained constant for two hundred years. Compare St. 1805, c. 97, \u00a7 1 (crime to \u201cravish and carnally know any woman <em>by force and against her </em>will\u201d [emphasis added]). We have said that \u201cby force\u201d and \u201cagainst [the] will\u201d are \u201ctwo separate elements each of which must independently be satisfied.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 727 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, supra, </em>we considered, as a matter of first impression,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whether rape could be committed by fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 383. The <em>Goldenberg </em>case involved a woman who had gone to the defendant, a physiotherapist, to procure an abortion. <em>Id. </em>at 379-380. The defendant told her that, as part of the procedure, he \u201chad to have intercourse\u201d with her and that it would \u201chelp it some way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. He then proceeded to have intercourse with her. <em>Id. </em>at 381. We noted that \u201cit could not be found beyond a reasonable doubt that the intercourse was without her consent,\u201d and that the evidence \u201cnegatived the use of force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. Thus, the only way the defendant could have been convicted was if his fraudulent representation that the intercourse was medically necessary could both invalidate the consent and supply the requisite \u201cforce.\u201d We concluded, however, that \u201c[fjraud cannot be allowed to supply the place of the force which the statute makes mandatory,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 384, and cited with approval a Michigan case, <em>Don Moran </em>v. <em>People, </em>25 Mich. 356 (1872), which on \u201cfacts strikingly similar\u201d had found no rape to have been committed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, supra </em>at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Facts. </em>We turn now to the facts of the present case, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the night in question, the defendant had sexual intercourse with the complainant by impersonating her longtime boy friend, his brother. According to the complainant, while she was asleep alone in the bedroom she shared with her boy friend, the defendant entered the room, and she awoke. In the dark room, the complainant assumed that the defendant was her boy friend returning home from work, and addressed him by her boy friend\u2019s name. He got into the bed and had intercourse with her. The complainant was \u201cnot fully awake\u201d at the time of penetration. During the intercourse, she believed that the man was her boy friend, and had she known it was the defendant, she \u201cwould have never consented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The defendant was indicted for rape and tried before a jury in the Superior Court. At trial, the main issue was whether the complainant knew at the time the identity of the person with whom she was having sex.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defense was that the sex was fully consensual. The defendant told an investigating police officer that the complainant had come to him while he was asleep in another room and had invited him to her bedroom to have sex with her. The Commonwealth argued that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>procured the complainant\u2019s consent to sex fraudulently by impersonating her boy friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><em>Procedural history. </em>The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, but the motion was denied. The jury were unable to reach a verdict, and the judge declared a mistrial. The defendant then moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the Commonwealth had failed to present sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict at trial, and that any subsequent retrial would thus violate common-law principles of double jeopardy. See generally <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793 (1985). When this motion was denied, the defendant sought relief from a single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 106, 107 n.1 (1994). The single justice reserved and reported the case to the full bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>In determining whether the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt so as to permit a subsequent retrial without violating double jeopardy principles, we apply the familiar standard: \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the tight most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 109-110, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Taking the evidence in the tight most favorable to the Commonwealth, we assume that the defendant fraudulently induced the complainant to have intercourse. However, as noted above, the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>338 Mass. 377, 384, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 1001 (1959), is that intercourse where consent is achieved by fraud does not constitute rape. That rule compels the conclusion that there was no evidence of rape in this case, and we decline to overrule the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">a. <em>The rule of the </em>Goldenberg <em>decision. </em>For all purposes relevant to this case, the crime of rape is defined by statute as nonconsensual intercourse achieved \u201cby force.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>(b). </em>The Commonwealth, advancing the same argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>that was rejected in the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision, contends that the defendant\u2019s fraud should be allowed to satisfy the requirement of force. In requesting that we overrule the <em>Goldenberg </em>case, the Commonwealth asks us to read \u201cforce\u201d out of the statute in cases involving misrepresentation as to identity. Yet we have never suggested that force is not an element of the crime, or that \u201cby force\u201d is synonymous with lack of consent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 727 (2001) (each element \u201cmust independently be satisfied\u201d). Because \u201c[n]o portion of the statutory language may be deemed superfluous,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracciola, </em>409 Mass. 648, 654 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974), we are not free, any more than we were in the <em>Goldenberg </em>case, to adopt the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed interpretation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We assume that, when it enacts legislation, the Legislature is not only aware of existing statutes, but is also aware of the prior state of the law as explicated by the decisions of this court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 440-441 (2003). Thus, we find it significant that the Legislature has not seen fit to overrule the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision in forty-eight years, during which the rape statute was amended three times,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> scholarship and attitudes regarding rape changed considerably, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 571 (1987) (Abrams, J., concurring), and the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision received criticism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>from at least one member of this court. The Legislature is free to amend the rape statute or create a new substantive offense to encompass the conduct at issue, as many other States have done.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, where the Legislature has chosen not to do so, \u201c[i]t is not for this court ... to rewrite the clear intention expressed by the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lena, </em>415 Mass. 835, 841 (1993), quoting <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>390 Mass. 275, 283 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">b. <em>Whether the </em>Goldenberg <em>decision is distinguishable. </em>Relying principally on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>25 M.J. 114, 116-117 (C.M.A. 1987), the Commonwealth attempts to distinguish the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision on the ground that it involved \u201cfraud in the inducement\u201d while the present case is one of \u201cfraud in the factum.\u201d We find this argument unpersuasive. Assuming that there is a distinction that is meaningful in the context of sexual intercourse, we examine the concepts involved. The term \u201cfraud in the factum\u201d typically refers to \u201cthe rare case when there has been fraud as to the essential nature of [a legal] instrument or an essential element of it.\u201d <em>Frederico </em>v. <em>Brockton Credit Union, 39 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 57, 63 (1995). \u201cFraud in the inducement,\u201d by contrast, occurs \u201cwhen a misrepresentation leads another to enter into a transaction with a false impression of the risks, duties, or obligations involved,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 686 (8th ed. 2004), but there is no fraud as to the essential nature of the transaction. <em>Frederico </em>v. <em>Brockton Credit Union, supra. </em>In the context of rape, by analogy, \u201cfraud in the factum\u201d must mean that the victim is defrauded as to the nature of the act performed, rather than the reason for doing it. Compare <em>Boro </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>163 Cal. App. 3d 1224, 1228 (1985) (fraud in factum where victim consents to doctor\u2019s penetration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of her with medical instrument but he then penetrates her with his penis), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Bolsinger, </em>709 N.W.2d 560, 564 (Iowa 2006) (fraud in inducement where defendant touched victims\u2019 genitals on pretext of medical examination because they were \u201ctouched in exactly the manner represented to them\u201d). In the present case, there is no claim that the complainant did not know she was consenting to a sex act; rather, just as in the <em>Goldenberg </em>case, her consent was induced by fraud as to the circumstances surrounding the act. Thus, the present case involves \u201cfraud in the inducement,\u201d as did Goldenberg, and is squarely controlled by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Fraudulently obtaining consent to sexual intercourse does not constitute rape as defined in our statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been granted. This case is remanded to the county court for entry of an appropriate order by the single justice barring a subsequent retrial on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Under the statute, rape may also be proved by evidence of intercourse compelled by \u201cthreat of bodily injury.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>(b). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracciola, </em>409 Mass. 648, 653 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We recognized that any prior statements regarding this question, such as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roosnell, </em>143 Mass. 32, 40 (1886), were dicta. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>338 Mass. 377, 383, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 1001 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Although the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision has been questioned, it has never been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>overruled. In dictum in a footnote in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 221 n.5 (1986), the court, per Justice Abrams, raised but did not decide the issue whether the <em>Goldenberg </em>opinion was still good law. Justice Abrams again questioned Goldenberg\u2019s vitality in a concurrence in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 571 (1987) (Abrams, J., concurring). However, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracciola, supra </em>at 652-653, a later decision, Justice Abrams\u2019s majority opinion carefully distinguishes the <em>Goldenberg </em>decision without any intimation of overruling it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>our review in this case is analogous to review of a denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Alternatively, the Commonwealth pursued the theory that because the complainant was not \u201cfully awake\u201d at the time of the intercourse, the act constituted rape under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>105 Mass. 376, 380-381 (1870). However, read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the complainant\u2019s testimony was that she consciously consented to intercourse under the mistaken belief that it was with her boy friend. Nowhere does the complainant suggest that she was not sufficiently conscious to consent. To the contrary, she testified that she was aware of the defendant in bed with her and had intelligible and appropriate conversation with him prior to the intercourse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">There is no allegation of any \u201cthreat of bodily injury\u201d in this case. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>(b). </em>See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b138-16\">The <em>Goldenberg </em>rule is not only required by our own law, it is also consistent with the law in a majority of other jurisdictions. In England, a long line of cases, beginning with <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>168 Eng. Rep. 911 (Cr. Cas. Res. 1822), held that sexual intercourse by fraud, particularly by \u201cpersonaling\u201d the complainant\u2019s husband, was not rape. See <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Barrow, </em>1 L.R.-C.C.R. 156 (Cr. Cas. Res. 1868); <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>169 Eng. Rep. 779 (Cr. Cas. Res. 1854); <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>173 Eng. Rep. 497 (N.P. 1838); <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>173 Eng. Rep. 488 (N.P. 1838). But see <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Dee, </em>14 L.R. Ir. 468 (1884). Similarly, in this country, most jurisdictions that have considered the issue have held that intercourse by fraud does not constitute rape. See, e.g., <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>State, </em>30 Ala. 54 (1857); <em>Don Moran </em>v. <em>People, </em>25 Mich. 356 (1872); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hough, </em>159 Misc. 2d 997 (N.Y. Dist.
