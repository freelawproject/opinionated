See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5. The record suggests that, at that time, Cioch \u201celected to continue her life insurance on retirement.\u201d* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to health insurance, however, she did not enroll in the town\u2019s public employee group insurance plan. Rather, during her tenure as an active public employee and on her retirement Cioch was enrolled in her husband\u2019s health insurance plan. When Cioch\u2019s husband retired in 1997 \u2014 about three years after her own retirement \u2014 the couple was no longer eligible for his employer\u2019s insurance program, and they purchased private health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">After reading an article in a newsletter for retired persons,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in October, 1999, Cioch inquired of the town treasurer whether she \u201ccould be enrolled in a Town health insurance plan.\u201d She received no response either to that query or to subsequent inquiries and, in December, 1999, requested and received enrollment forms for the town\u2019s retiree group health insurance program, specifically for the health maintenance organization, Health New England. On the form she submitted to the town, Cioch requested individual enrollment and indicated that \u201c[i]f, in the future, spouses are allowed to join,\u201d her husband would elect coverage. She also indicated that neither she nor her husband was enrolled in Medicare.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When Cioch learned in April, 2000, that the town had not acted on her application, she persisted in her enrollment efforts through the summer of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">There is no dispute that Cioch made no preretirement inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>concerning postretirement health insurance eligibility, or that she was not affirmatively told that, if she was not enrolled in the town\u2019s health insurance program on retirement, she would be eligible or ineligible to enroll thereafter. Nothing in the record indicates, however, that Cioch believed she was entitled to postretirement enrollment at any time before reading a publication of an entity not connected to the town some years after both she and her husband had retired; to the contrary, the couple had purchased private health insurance after her husband retired.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>'<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While the town appears to have had no written policy concerning postretirement enrollment at the time Cioch retired, there is no suggestion that it permitted such enrollments, or that its employees understood that it would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">By October 12, 1999, before Cioch either made any inquiries concerning, or submitted, her group health insurance application, the town\u2019s board of selectmen (board) formalized a written \u201cPolicy on Health Insurance,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> generally communicating that enrollment in the town\u2019s group health insurance program on retirement was a predicate to coverage during retirement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The policy provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cEligibility. Regular employees of the Town (whether employed, appointed or elected) whose normal workweek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>is twenty (20) or more hours per week are eligible for health insurance benefits provided by the Town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201cEnrollment. Enrollment in the health insurance plans offered by the Town is limited to eligible employees, the legal spouse, and their dependent unmarried children</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201cRetirees. Any employee retired by the Town under the current pension plan or who receives retirement income as a result of their employment with the Town shall be eligible to enroll in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Blue Care 65 Plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield Medex Plan or Health New England MedWrap Plan upon attaining age 65, if they are eligible for Medicare. If a retiree is not eligible for Medicare, the employee will continue on the plan they were last enrolled in with the Town. The Town will pay 50% of the premium for the plan and the retiree will pay 50% of the premium.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">On October 1, 2001, Cioch filed a complaint against the town, as well as its treasurer, the board, and the board\u2019s chairman; she filed an amended complaint on July 17, 2004. She sought a declaration that the defendants had violated the \u201cstate public employee retirement law, in particular G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 &amp; 16, by [their] refusal to enroll [Cioch] in the Town\u2019s retiree group health insurance program,\u201d an order requiring that she be enrolled in the plan of her choice, and damages, as well as costs and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">After various preliminary proceedings, the Superior Court judge considered Cioch\u2019s motion for entry of judgment, and the defendants\u2019 request for findings of fact and rulings of law, on stipulated facts and exhibits. Treating the motion as one for summary judgment, he denied Cioch\u2019s motion, and entered judgment for the defendants, concluding that the town\u2019s regulations were properly adopted and that when Cioch first applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>for enrollment in the town\u2019s health insurance programs in December, 1999, she was ineligible under the terms of the town policy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cioch filed a timely notice of appeal, and we transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Where the Superior Court judge has decided the case on stipulated facts and agreed exhibits, all questions of law and fact are open to our decision on review. See <em>American Lithuanian Naturalization Club, Athol, Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Athol, </em>446 Mass. 310, 322 (2006). Under the Home Rule Amendment, art. 89 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth\u2019s various municipalities may undertake certain health insurance obligations to their employees. G. L. c. 32B. See <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>424 Mass. 315, 316 (1997). The town has voted to accept that responsibility and, among other provisions, has accepted G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, thereby requiring it to \u201center into a contract. . . to make available the services of a health care organization to certain eligible and retired employees and dependents ... of such active and retired employees, on a voluntary and optional basis, as it deems to be in the best interest of the governmental unit and such eligible persons. . . .\u201d Id. See <em>Ludlow Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ludlow, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 113 n.5 (1991). The town offers several group insurance plans for active and retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>municipal employees, including teachers. The parties do not dispute that a town may regulate participation in such a plan, provided such regulations are both reasonable and properly adopted. See <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>423 Mass. 1018 (1996). The question here is whether a town may, consistent with its obligations under G. L. c. 32B, adopt a policy or regulation precluding postretirement enrollment of retirees in such a health insurance plan who were not enrolled in the plan on retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The decision in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 479 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 1018 (1996), provides a starting point for our analysis. There, the issue was whether a statute, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9 (municipal obligations with respect to group indemnity health insurance programs), precludes a retired municipal employee from enrolling, postretirement, in a municipal indemnity group health insurance plan.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Appeals Court concluded that, \u201cat least until the town issues regulations to the contrary, \u00a7 9 does not require participation by the employee at the time of retirement to obtain coverage thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483. On further review, we clarified \u201cthat a municipality may adopt reasonable regulations, see G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 14 (1994 ed.), as has been done under G. L. c. 32A, \u00a7 3 (1994 ed.), concerning participation in a municipality\u2019s program under G. L. c. 32B (1994 ed.) by a retiree who was not a participant in such a program at the time of retirement.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>423 Mass. 1018, 1018 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Given that G. L. c. 32B establishes a sparse framework for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>provision of public employee insurance, there is nothing unreasonable about the town\u2019s defining eligibility for that insurance, or conditioning eligibility on preretirement or at retirement participation. When construing statutes such as c. 32B, we \u201cattempt to ascertain and carry out the intent of the Legislature. <em>Baker Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 872, 877 n.11 (1977). To that end we examine the whole statute with attention to the language used, the evil to be remedied, and the object to be accomplished by enactment.\u201d <em>Hayon </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of New England, </em>375 Mass. 644, 648 (1978). See <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, supra </em>at 319. In enacting G. L. c. 32B, the Legislature generally intended to \u201cenabl[e] each community which votes to accept the statute to contract for and contribute to a program of insurance for its employees,\u201d <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>404 Mass. 365, 367 (1989), to \u201cgather[ ] employees in large groups to facilitate bargaining for and administering insurance coverage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 369, citing <em>Municipal Light Comm\u2019n of Taunton </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Group Ins. Comm\u2019n, </em>344 Mass. 533, 539 (1962), and to provide a \u201ccomprehensive scheme of [health insurance] coverage\u201d for public employees. See <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 </em>v. <em>Chatham, supra </em>at 368; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 480-481 (1995). See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 1 (\u201cpurpose of this chapter is to provide a plan of group . . . health insurance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">As a local-option statute, however, G. L. c. 32B is \u201ceffective in a city and town only when the municipality votes to adopt its provisions,\u201d <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, supra </em>at 316-317, and a municipality is permitted to adopt \u201conly those provisions of the statute that best accommodate its needs and budget.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 317. While the statute establishes the broad requirements for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>participating municipal insurance programs, it otherwise accords municipalities substantial latitude in the adoption of \u201csuch rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary for the administration of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 14. See <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 </em>v. <em>Chatham, supra </em>at 367 (\u201cA community is bound by expressly stated constraints in setting up its program, but is given broad authority to act within those constraints\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Nothing in the plain language of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 or 16, requires a municipality to permit a retiree who has not enrolled in a municipal health insurance plan while employed, to enroll in a municipal health insurance plan after she has retired, or precludes it from doing so.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, supra </em>at 480. Chapter 32B addresses the broad requirements with which a municipal health insurance group policy must comply, including the periods (i.e., active employment and retirement) for which it must offer coverage. See <em>id. </em>at 481. It does not, however, define individual eligibility. The requirement in \u00a7 9 that \u201cthe group general or blanket insurance . . . shall be continued\u201d refers not to compulsory insurance coverage for individual retirees, but rather \u201cmandates that the period covered by group policies shall continue through retirement without specifying whether a retired employee has to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>covered prior to retirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481. While G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, is not identical to \u00a7 9, its requirement that a municipality \u201cmake available the services of a health care organization to certain eligible and retired employees,\u201d similarly obligates a municipality to contract for coverage for eligible retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Undoubtedly, a municipality may not enact a bylaw, policy, or regulation that is inconsistent with State law. See, e.g., <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 19 (2000); <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>420 Mass. 702, 703 (1995). But G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, if accepted by a municipality, requires only that a municipality obtain a health insurance policy or policies providing coverage for \u201celigible\u201d retirees. See <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, supra </em>at 322-323 &amp; nn.15-16. The Legislature\u2019s use in \u00a7 16 of the language \u201ccertain eligible and retired employees\u201d leaves it to individual municipalities to define the appropriate class. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Ware, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 333, 336-337 (1993) (public authority has substantial authority to make and change eligibility requirements). The town accordingly is free to adopt a policy limiting enrollment to active employees, provided the policy provides for continued coverage of those employees during their retirement, as the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We similarly reject Cioch\u2019s contention that application of the town\u2019s policy to her constitutes an improper retroactive denial of health insurance benefits: Cioch has not demonstrated that she has been denied in retirement any benefit she earned as an active employee. Specifically, she has not shown either that the benefits she earned as an active town employee included the right to enroll in the insurance program after retirement, cf. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass. 687, 689 (1994) (\u201cWhen policy language identifying those to whom coverage is afforded constitutes part of the basic insurance agreement, a person claiming coverage . . . must demonstrate that he is an insured\u201d); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, supra </em>at 479 (plaintiff\u2019s burden to demonstrate eligibility for coverage), or that her failure to enroll in the program was in reliance on any representation by the town concerning future eligibility. Indeed, the parties stipulated that Cioch did not \u201cdiscuss health insurance benefits upon her retirement with any representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>of the school department,\u201d and she does not allege that the town made any representation about postretirement eligibility.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The record demonstrates no expectation of postretirement eligibility on Cioch\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Certainly, G. L. c. 32B does not preclude postretirement enrollment, see <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, supra </em>at 479, and it does permit the town\u2019s active employees to continue their health insurance coverage during retirement. <em>Id. </em>But nothing in the record supports the notion that Cioch, as a retiree, is entitled to benefits available to active employees. Cf. <em>Larson </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Plymouth, </em>430 Mass. 719, 724 (2000) (health insurance \u201cis an unearned benefit, no different in concept from holidays, future sick leave, or other similar benefits\u201d). While Cioch\u2019s appellate brief is replete with language to the effect that the town\u2019s policy causes the \u201cforfeiture\u201d of a substantive right, she has not established forfeiture of rights she had as a retiree. The town\u2019s policy, first reduced to writing in 1999, has the effect of denying enrollment to retirees who were not enrolled at the time of retirement. But Cioch has not demonstrated that the policy was applied retroactively to deny her benefits to which she otherwise would have been entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decisions of this court and the Appeals Court in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 479 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 1018 (1996), built on prior decisions establishing the broad authority of municipalities to regulate the terms of their health care plans within the statutory framework. See, e.g., <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>404 Mass. 365, 367 (1989); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Ware, supra. </em>In the more than ten years since <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, supra, </em>the Legislature has not amended the statute to limit that discretion. Accordingly, we conclude that the town properly may proscribe postretirement enrollment in its G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>c. 32B health care plans, by limiting eligibility for enrollment to active employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">General Laws c. 32B is a local-option statute that governs health insurance benefits for active and retired employees of municipalities and other State political subdivisions, as well as the dependents of those employees. While we use the term \u201cmunicipal\u201d throughout this opinion, our analysis applies also to other political subdivisions covered by the statute. See <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>424 Mass. 315, 316 &amp; n.4 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We are cognizant of legislation presently pending before the General Court that, if enacted, may affect municipal health insurance options. Among other things, the pending legislation proposes that municipalities be given an option to join the State\u2019s Group Insurance Commission (GIC) with respect to the provision of health care for coverage for active and retired employees. See 2007 House Doc. No. 3749, \u00a7\u00a7 4-8 (\u201cAn Act establishing the municipal partnership act\u201d); 2007 Senate Doc. No. 1584 (\u201cAn Act to promote quality and affordable municipal health insurance through the GIC\u201d); 2007 House Doc. No. 2601 (\u201cAn Act to promote quality and affordable municipal health insurance through the GIC\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Although regulations promulgated by the GIC under G. L. c. 32A do not apply to municipalities or G. L. c. 32B, see, e.g., <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 482 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 1018 (1996), for simplicity we use various terms as they are defined in those regulations. In that regard, we use the terms \u201cretired employee\u201d and \u201cretiree\u201d to mean a \u201cformer employee in the service of the [municipality], whose services have ended, and who is eligible for and actually receives a retirement or pension allowance.\u201d 805 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (1996) (defining term for purposes of regulations applicable to c. 32A). See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (1) (ii) (\u201cMember Inactive\u201d defined as employee whose employment has been terminated, and who is receiving retirement allowance, or who is otherwise on authorized leave without pay, and \u201cwho may be entitled to any present or potential retirement allowance,\u201d although not then receiving such allowance); G.

L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (1) (ii) (inactive members), although not then receiving such an allowance. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (3) (deferring receipt of retirement allowance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Similarly manifesting the lack of any general perception among municipal employees of any postretirement eligibility for employees who were not enrolled in the town\u2019s group health plans during their employment or on retirement is that only one retired employee other than Cioch has attempted to enroll in the town\u2019s health insurance plan after retirement. The town denied reenrollment to that retiree, despite the fact that he had been enrolled on retirement, but cancelled his coverage about eight years later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The written policy apparently surfaced after the town filed its opposition to Cioch\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and her motion for reconsideration. The town\u2019s oppositions to those motions referred only to a long-standing practice or policy requiring preretirement enrollment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The minutes of the meeting of the board on October 12, 1999, at which the policy was adopted, reflect that the policy was an \u201ceffort at putting together the Board\u2019s practices.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\">SeveraI years later, on October 6, 2003, the town meeting added a group insurance benefit bylaw.

Any employee retired by the Town under the current pension plan as a result of their employment with the Town shall be eligible to continue as a participant in the group health insurance plans offered by the Town\u2019s carrier provided he/she was enrolled in a plan on the date of retirement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We do not address Cioch\u2019s claim that her denial of enrollment in the town\u2019s health insurance program is inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. While the parties stipulated that the applicable agreements contained no provision stating \u201cif teachers covered by those agreements did not enroll in the Town\u2019s group health insurance program by the time they retired, they would forfeit their right to enroll,\u201d no such agreement has been made part of the record. We are therefore unable to determine what, if any, grievance procedures were required to be undertaken by Cioch. See <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Watertown, </em>404 Mass. 23, 25 (1989), quoting <em>Balsavich </em>v. <em>Local Union 170, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>371 Mass. 283, 286 (1976) (\u201cEmployees may not simply disregard the grievance procedures set out in a collective labor contract and go direct to the court for redress against the employer. . . . They must initiate the grievance procedures as the contract provides . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Shortly after we transferred the case here we solicited amicus briefs. We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, Inc., IUPA, AFL-CIO. Because we conclude that G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, does not forbid a municipality from precluding postretirement enrollment in its health insurance programs, we need not rule on the town\u2019s motion to strike the brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Although the present case involves health insurance provided by an health maintenance organization under another section of the statute, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, we construe G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 16, to the extent possible, in a consistent manner. See, e.g., <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>424 Mass. 315, 319 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Cioch\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 32B gives a municipality \u201cno discretion\u201d to decline to enroll a retiree into its group health insurance plan, and makes it \u201cmandatory\u201d to do so, is based on a flawed reading of <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 479 (1995). The Appeals Court\u2019s decision in that case rejected the town\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9, precluded it from enrolling, postretirement, a retiree into its group health insurance plan. It did not address whether a town could regulate postretirement eligibility. Our decision, on further appellate review, made clear that such regulation is permissible. <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Southbridge, </em>423 Mass. 1018 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Both Cioch and the town argue that there are economic benefits to be derived from their respective positions. Given our conclusion that the Legislature has left it largely to municipalities to design and implement their health programs, we do not consider the possible economic impact of the municipality\u2019s choices in this case. Likewise, while Cioch argues that postretirement health insurance benefits are necessary to attract employees into public service, we note only that such benefits are available to attract such employees, but they must comply with eligibility requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b720-5\">This authority is similar to that granted to the GIC, G. L. c. 32A, \u00a7 3, as administrator of G. L. c. 32A. See G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16 (municipality may adopt \u201csuch rules and regulations as may be necessary for the administration of this section\u201d). While the GIC has promulgated more inclusive eligibility regulations than the town has adopted, see 805 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.20 (1996) (permitting retirees to apply for enrollment postretirement, but not automatically extending coverage), they are not the only reasonable eligibility requirements. The Legislature has given each \u201cappropriate public authority in each governmental unit\u201d discretion to fashion a program of insurance meeting its needs, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 14, and requiring participation at the time of retirement is not inconsistent with the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In keeping with the noncoercive nature of the statutory scheme, not only are municipalities not obliged to accept the provisions of G. L. c. 32B, but once they have, employees are not obligated to accept coverage. <em>Municipal Light Comm\u2019n of Taunton </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Group Ins. Comm\u2019n, </em>344 Mass. 533, 539 (1962) (while Legislature could force insurance on public employees, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 4, permits employees to opt out). <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>404 Mass. 365, 369-370 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In contrast, it appears that another retiree, who was enrolled in the town\u2019s health insurance plan on retirement, was permitted to add coverage for his wife postretirement. In that case, however, there were allegations that an employee in the town treasurer\u2019s office led the employee to a belief that the wife could be added during a future enrollment period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
