Bernier (wife) from decisions of a judge in the Probate and Family Court incident to her divorce from Stephen A. Bernier (husband) presents us with the novel question whether it is proper to discount the value of an S corporation, see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361-1379 (2000), by \u201ctax affecting\u201d income at the rate applicable for C corporations, where one spouse will receive ownership of all shares of the S corporation after the divorce and the other will be required to relinquish all ownership in the business. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 311, 312 (2000). Also presented by the wife\u2019s appeal are whether the judge erred in discounting the fair market value of the S corporations at issue here by applying \u201ckey man\u201d and \u201cmarketability\u201d discounts; whether the amount of alimony awarded to the wife was proper; and whether the judge improperly dismissed the wife\u2019s equity complaint against the husband alleging misuse of marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">On the issue of tax affecting, we conclude that the judge erred in adopting the valuation of the husband\u2019s expert witness that tax affected the fair market value of the parties\u2019 S corporations at the \u201caverage corporate rate,\u201d in the words of the husband\u2019s expert, of a C corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a preliminary matter, where valuation of assets occurs in the context of divorce, and where one of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>ties will maintain, and the other be entirely divested of, ownership of a marital asset after divorce, the judge must take particular care to treat the parties not as arm\u2019s-length hypothetical buyers and sellers in a theoretical open market, but as fiduciaries entitled to equitable distribution of their marital assets. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Further, careful financial analysis tells us that applying the C corporation rate of taxation to an S corporation severely undervalues the fair market value of the S corporation by ignoring the tax benefits of the S corporation structure and failing to compensate the seller for the loss of those benefits. On the other hand, in the circumstances of this divorce action, we agree with a recent decision of the Delaware Court of Chancery that failure entirely to tax affect an S corporation artificially will inflate the value of the S corporation by overstating the rate of return that the retaining shareholder could hope to achieve. See <em>Delaware Open MRI Radiology Assocs. </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>898 A.2d 290, 327 (Del. Ct. Ch. 2006) <em>(Kessler). </em>Our review of the scant case law and the pertinent literature on the issue leads us to adopt generally the metric employed by the <em>Kessler </em>court, see <em>id. </em>at 328-330, described more fully <em>infra, </em>which most closely achieves the parties\u2019 stated intention in this case to divide the value of their S corporations equally, the outcome the judge also sought to achieve. We also conclude that, where the husband testified that he planned to retain control of the S corporations after the divorce, the judge erred in applying key man and marketability discounts, discounts that assume the possible sale of the asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On the issue of alimony, we hold that the judge did not err in awarding the wife an amount of alimony sufficient to meet her personal needs, as reflected in her financial statement, exclusive of losses she incurred in owning and operating a horse farm acquired by the parties during the marriage and given to the wife pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation and the judge\u2019s award in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>divorce action. See <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477, 482 (1996) (purpose of alimony is support and maintenance). Finally, we determine that the wife\u2019s equity complaint against the husband was not barred by principles of issue preclusion and res judicata and therefore should not have been dismissed. We affirm the portion of the third amended supplemental judgment in the divorce matter concerning alimony, vacate the portion of the third amended supplemental judgment concerning valuation of the parties\u2019 S corporations, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. We vacate the judgment of dismissal in the wife\u2019s equity action, which we also remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The parties were married in Massachusetts in 1967. On June 12, 2000, the husband, then fifty-two years old, and the wife, fifty-four years old, filed cross complaints for divorce in the Dukes Division of the Probate and Family Court Department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record indicates, and the judge found, that initially the parties were of modest means. However, in 1986, after they moved from Billerica to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, their circumstances improved markedly. The engine of the parties\u2019 financial success was two supermarkets that were subsequently owned by two S corporations, of which the husband and wife each owned one-half.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During their marriage, the parties also acquired what the judge termed an \u201cextensive\u201d portfolio of residential, commercial, and undeveloped properties. Among these properties was a thirty-six acre plot of land in West Tisbury, which the parties purchased in 1996, and on which they constructed Rosewood Farm (horse farm), a horse breeding farm under the control and management of their company, Rosewood Farm, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">After they filed for divorce but before trial, the parties voluntarily entered into numerous temporary stipulations governing their financial affairs during the pending proceedings. The stipulations gave the husband sole authority to operate and manage the supermarkets and similar authority for the wife to ran the horse farm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Further, the stipulations provided that certain business and personal expenses, and the parties\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and costs, be paid from specified joint assets. Additionally, before trial, the parties agreed that all of their assets would be divided equally, and stipulated to the value of most of their assets, approximately $11 million. The parties were unable to reach agreement on two issues: the value of the supermarkets and the amount of alimony due to the wife. On February 27, 2002, a judge in the Probate and Family Court entered a judgment of divorce nisi, bifurcating the trial on the two remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Between February and May, 2002, the judge heard eight days of testimony, which centered principally on the value of the supermarkets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the trial, each party presented the testimony of an expert witness on valuation: Mark Leicester prepared the wife\u2019s valuation, and Joel Horvitz prepared that of the husband.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Leicester and Horvitz were in broad agreement on key points. Specifically, both agreed that the buyer of the supermarket shares would seek an investment that would yield the buyer\u2019s required rate of return. They also agreed that the most accurate estimate of the supermarkets\u2019 value would be achieved by employing what both parties refer to as the \u201cincome\u201d approach, taking the supermarkets\u2019 average adjusted income after expenses for a set number of years, divided by the appropriate capitalization rate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Despite their areas of agreement, however, the two experts arrived at vastly different appraisals of the supermarkets\u2019 fair market value. Leicester testified that the fair market value of the supermarkets was $16,391,000. Horvitz set the fair market value at $7,850,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The discrepancy in the experts\u2019 valuations was due to several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>factors, primarily Horvitz\u2019s application of tax affecting, as well as certain discounts to his calculations of fair market value<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Leicester\u2019s omission of those considerations. Specifically, Horvitz tax affected as if the S corporation were a C corporation, at what he termed the \u201caverage corporate rate\u201d of thirty-five per cent. But see note 19, <em>infra. </em>He testified that tax affecting the S corporations at the C corporation rate was proper because, among other things, a person contemplating the purchase of an S corporation would factor into his probable rate of return the tax consequences of the purchase. Leicester, on the other hand, did not tax affect the supermarkets\u2019 income in his valuation because, as he testified, an S corporation, unlike a C corporation, does not pay taxes at the entity level, and because no sale of the business was contemplated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Horvitz additionally discounted the fair market value of the supermarkets by applying a ten per cent \u201ckey man\u201d discount to the adjusted net income of the supermarkets to account for the undisputed fact that the husband was the most important figure in the operation and management of the supermarkets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He then applied an additional ten per cent discount to account for the \u201clack of marketability\u201d of the S corporation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>a closely held business. Leicester maintained that, because the husband planned to maintain ownership and control of the supermarkets after the divorce, key man and marketability discounts should not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On August 18, 2003, the judge entered a supplemental judgment, finding of facts, rationale, and conclusion of law on the valuation of the supermarkets. The judge rejected Leicester\u2019s valuation as \u201cunreliable.\u201d Specifically, she faulted Leicester on the grounds that he improperly combined pretax and posttax data in establishing a capitalization rate, improperly applied a rate of growth to his valuation, omitted a marketability discount, and lacked experience valuing S corporations. The judge adopted substantially without change Horvitz\u2019s method of applying tax affecting and key man and marketability discounts to the supermarkets, and adopted his conclusion that the fair market value of the supermarkets on the relevant date, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>was $7,850,000. In concluding that the income of the parties\u2019 S corporations should be tax affected for valuation purposes, the judge cited <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>272 F.3d 333 (6th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 827 (2002) <em>(Gross) </em>(affirming United States Tax Court judgment that it was proper to tax affect using zero per cent corporate tax rate, in context of valuing gift of S corporation stock).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">On January 22, 2004, nunc pro tune to October 6, 2003, the judge entered a third amended supplemental judgment, awarding the husband the option to purchase the wife\u2019s fifty per cent ownership interest in the supermarkets for $3,925,000 \u2014 one-half of the supermarkets\u2019 total value of $7,850,000 \u2014 and providing other relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">After the close of trial, and while the divorce proceedings were pending, the wife, individually and, in a derivative action, on behalf of the parties\u2019 business entities, filed a separate verified complaint in equity against the husband and the business entities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The wife sought fifty per cent of the supermarkets\u2019 net income from January 1, 2001, the date of the last reconciliation of the supermarkets\u2019 accounts, to February 2, 2004, the date the husband exercised his option to purchase the wife\u2019s fifty per cent ownership interest in the supermarkets.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Among other things, the wife alleged that the husband had taken the position at a corporate meeting in July, 2003, that he was entitled to all of the income from the supermarkets after the last reconciliation (December 31, 2000), and that he had failed to provide the wife with accountings and distributions as required under the temporary orders. After a hearing, the judge dismissed the wife\u2019s equity complaint with prejudice, holding that because the wife\u2019s claims should and could have been brought in the divorce action and were resolved by the divorce action, her equity claims were barred by issue preclusion and res judicata.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The wife\u2019s appeals from the judge\u2019s decisions in the divorce action and from the dismissal of her equity complaint were consolidated in the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">2. <em>Tax affecting the valuation of S corporation shares. </em>The parties agree, as the judge found, that the \u201cmajor difference\u201d in the valuations of Horvitz and Leicester is Horvitz\u2019s use of tax affecting. To assess the propriety of the judge\u2019s adoption of Horvitz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>methodology of tax affecting, it is instructive to summarize the pertinent facts regarding corporate structure and taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The husband and wife, as equal shareholders, elected that the supermarkets be taxed under the provisions of subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361-1379. To elect S corporation status, the corporation and its shareholders must meet and maintain several requirements, including, as relevant here, that (1) the corporation may not have more than one hundred shareholders, and (2) only individuals, estates, or certain trusts may hold its shares. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361(b). In other words, an S corporation may not have a traditional corporation (known as a \u201cC corporation\u201d) as one of its shareholders. The primary advantage of an S corporation over a C corporation is that the S corporation is not Federally taxed at the corporate level,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but is \u201cpassed through\u201d to the shareholders on a pro rata basis and taxed to the shareholders when earned by the corporation, whether or not the corporation pays dividends. Cf. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 707-777 (2000) (taxation of partnerships); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1363 (\u201ctaxable income of an S corporation shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual\u201d). See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Net income from these entities is passed through to owners and taxed at the individual level in the year that it is earned. In contrast, the earnings from a C corporation are taxed twice: once at the corporate level, and then at the individual level as a tax on shareholder dividends, if any, paid by the C corporation. Thus, as we illustrate in the margin, S corporation shareholders enjoy the considerable benefit of avoiding the \u201cdouble taxation\u201d of corporate dividends that is the hallmark of the C corporation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">To distinguish between S and C corporations, however, does</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>little in itself to clarify the issue of valuation. To begin with, we must acknowledge that the valuation of an S corporation is an inexact science.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Gross, supra </em>at 356 (Cohn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Compounding the difficulty in the case of an S corporation is the question whether, and how, to account for tax consequences. The matter has bedeviled the professional appraisers\u2019 community for some time, and certainly was the source of some confusion at the time of the trial. See <em>id. </em>at 355 (Cohn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See also <em>Kessler, supra </em>at 326 (valuation of S corporation by tax affecting has \u201celicited a fair amount of attention from judges, appraisers and academics\u201d). While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) appears to have endorsed the practice of tax affecting an S corporation in the manner that Horvitz followed, see <em>Gross, supra </em>at 353 (Cohn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), quoting IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes: Valuation Training for Appeals Officers<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (in valuing S corporations, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\u201cneed only to adjust the earnings from the business to reflect estimated corporate income taxes that would have been payable had the Subchapter S election not been made\u201d), both case law and professional scholarship have cast serious doubt on the validity of this practice.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In this case, the debate over tax affecting played out in the diametrically opposed positions taken by the parties\u2019 experts. Would the hypothetical purchaser of the supermarkets at fair market value, as the wife\u2019s expert maintained, not factor any tax consequences at all into his analysis of the achievable rate of return on his investment, because an S corporation, as an entity, pays no taxes? Or, as the husband\u2019s expert asserted, would that purchaser tax affect at the C corporation tax rate,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> because, in the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>words, \u201cthe value of an entity should not depend on whether the shareholders make the elections to be a C or S Corporation?\u201d Or would an alternative to these two extremes better account for the value of the supermarkets in the circumstances of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Valuation of a business is a question of fact. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 541 n.47 (1997). Thus, the standard is whether the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. See Mass R. Civ. R 52 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). When the opinions of valuation experts differ, a judge may \u201caccept one <em>reasonable </em>opinion and reject the other\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 863 (1989). The judge may also \u201creject expert opinion altogether and arrive at a valuation on other evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge may not, however, reach a valuation that is materially at odds with the totality of the circumstances or, in the case of divorcing spouses, at variance with the requirements of the equitable distribution statute. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. See C.P. Kindregan, Jr., &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 45.8, at 334-335 (3d ed. 2002), citing <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, supra </em>at 862-867.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In adopting Horvitz\u2019s approach over Leicester\u2019s in the matter of tax affecting, the judge invoked the <em>Gross </em>case to support her conclusions. That case does not, however, do the work to which the judge assigned it. At issue in <em>Gross </em>was the fair market value of certain gifts of restricted stock of an S corporation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Declining to adopt the position set out in its own valuation guide, see note 17, <em>supra, </em>the IRS opposed the tax affecting of cash flows that the company had employed in estimating fair market value using the income approach. See <em>Gross, supra </em>at 354 (Cohn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed that the Tax Court had the discretion to adopt the testimony of the Commissioner of Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Revenue\u2019s expert witness that tax affected the S corporation using a zero per cent corporate tax rate \u2014 effectively meaning no tax affect at all. <em>Id. </em>at 355 (Cohn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court was unpersuaded by the position taken by the taxpayer\u2019s expert, who tax affected at the corporate rate to account for the possibility that the corporation might lose its S corporation status in the future, because, the court noted, the record did not contain sufficient evidence that this was likely to happen. <em>Id. </em>at 353 (Cohn, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court likewise rejected the argument that tax affecting at the C corporation rate was necessary to offset the fact that an S corporation must distribute enough funds to shareholders to pay their tax liability on its earnings; the court noted that the S corporation at issue had always distributed almost one hundred per cent of its net earnings and there was no evidence this practice would not continue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The judge in this case cited <em>Gross </em>for the proposition that \u201c[t]ax affecting Subchapter S income for valuation purposes should be reflected in determining the \u2018cost of capital.\u2019 \u201d However, the judge ignored the <em>Gross </em>court\u2019s application of a zero per cent corporate tax rate and instead adopted Horvitz\u2019s thirty-five per cent \u201caverage corporate tax rate.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See note 19, <em>supra. </em>We conclude there is no support in <em>Gross </em>for the judge\u2019s adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Horvitz\u2019s figure, and moreover, the judge failed to offer a cogent explanation of her choice. See note 21, <em>supra. </em>The husband has cited no cases, nor have we found any, that apply the presumed thirty-five per cent rate of taxation of a C corporation to estimating the fair market value of an S corporation using the income approach.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We agree with the husband that the judge is free to credit the reasonable opinion of one expert over that of another. See <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 620 (1992) (in reviewing valuation, court should \u201caccept the judge\u2019s findings of fact as true unless they are clearly erroneous\u201d); <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, supra </em>at 863. However, even though the consensus on tax affecting was not entirely clear at the time of trial, and still remains subject to debate, the judge erred in adopting in all material respects Horvitz\u2019s valuation that tax affected at thirty-five per cent<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> when doing so was not reasonable, as it would clearly produce an arbitrary result: a significant undervaluation of the supermarkets. See <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, supra, </em>citing <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1032, 1033-1033 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The difficulty with the judge\u2019s position is framed cogently in the decision in <em>Kessler, supra. Kessler </em>concerned a closely held S corporation, where the dealings between the majority and minority shareholders were constrained by fiduciary considerations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc. </em>367 Mass. 578, 593 (1975), quoting <em>Cardullo </em>v. <em>Landau, </em>329 Mass. 5, 8 (1952) (\u201cwe hold that stockholders in the close corporation owe one another substantially the same fiduciary duty in the operation of the enterprise that partners owe to one another . . . [that standard of duty being defined as] the \u2018utmost good faith and loyalty\u2019 \u201d). Here too, the property division between the husband and wife is constrained by fiduciary considerations. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. In <em>Kessler, </em>three of eight shareholders (Kessler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>group) of a radiology practice operating as an S corporation wanted the majority shareholders (Broder group), with whom business relations had raptured, to buy out their shares. Predictably, the value each side attached to the shares differed markedly. The expert for the Broder group treated the S corporation as a C corporation in his valuation, applying forty per cent as the tax rate to the business\u2019s earnings. The Kessler group\u2019s expert did not tax affect earnings at all. The judge found neither expert\u2019s testimony concerning tax treatment to be fair. \u201cThe problem with [the] approach of treating [the entity] as a C corporation is obvious. [The entity] is a very small entity. The record reveals no set of circumstances in which it is likely that [the entity] will convert to C corporation status. It is a highly profitable entity that generates and distributes income well in excess of the stockholder level taxes its stockholders must pay. The S corporation tax status is a highly valuable attribute to the shareholders of [the entity], given its profitability and the affluent status of its physician stockholders, who face top marginal tax rates.\u201d <em>Kessler, supra </em>at 326. Treating the enterprise effectively as a C corporation, the court held, failed to account for the comparative tax benefits of S corporation ownership \u2014 its signature feature \u2014 and therefore depressed the estimate of the business\u2019s fair value. <em>Id. </em>at 327. On the other hand, the judge in <em>Kessler </em>reasoned, not tax affecting at all was also unfair, because it would lead to a windfall for the minority sellers. \u201c[Denying] the reality that each shareholder owes taxes on his proportional interest in [the business] would result in the [Kessler group] receiving a higher per share value from the court than it could ever have realized as a continuing shareholder. . . . This is a simple premise \u2014 no one should be willing to pay for more than the value of what will actually end up in her pocket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-329, citing Fisher, The Sale of the Washington Redskins: Discounted Cash Flow Valuation of S Corporations, Treatment of Personal Taxes, and Implications for Litigation, 10 Stan. J. L. Bus. &amp; Fin. 18 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Having rejected the rationale and conclusions of both experts, the Delaware court proposed an alternate approach. This approach attempted to capture the tax benefit to the buyer of S corporation shares (the Broder group) of receiving cash dividends that are not subject to dividend taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 330. The court ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>served that, as is the case here, the buyout was an \u201cinvoluntary removal,\u201d <em>id., </em>and not an arm\u2019s-length purchase. To calculate the effect of taxes on the buyers and the sellers in these circumstances, the judge asked: if the S corporation at issue were a C corporation, at what hypothetical tax rate could it be taxed and still leave to shareholders the same amount in their pockets as they would have if they held shares in an S corporation? In other words, the judge asked what the effective corporate tax rate would be for the S corporation shareholder, although the entity itself paid no corporate tax. Assuming a dividend tax rate of fifteen per cent and a personal income tax rate of forty per cent (the shareholders were wealthy physicians who paid individual taxes at the highest rate),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the court imputed a \u201cpre-dividend\u201d corporate tax rate of 29.4 per cent to the S corporation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The result was to leave the shareholder of an S corporation with the same amount of money in his or her pocket as the shareholder of a C corporation being taxed at a (fictitious) 29.4 per cent corporate tax rate. <em>Id. </em>Applying this rate to the earnings of the entity measures \u201cwith the greatest practicable precision the fair value of the . . . interest in the going concern value of\u201d the business. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The <em>Kessler </em>court\u2019s trenchant analysis allows us to see that, in this case, applying the presumed thirty-five per cent tax rate applicable to a C corporation to the valuation of the supermarkets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>understated the value of the supermarkets, while failing adequately to account for the loss of S corporation benefits to the wife.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The result was particularly misplaced in this case in light of the uncontroverted evidence that the supermarkets would continue to operate as S corporations after the parties\u2019 divorce; that they would continue to be owned by one of the existing shareholders<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>; and that the supermarkets were profitable and would continue their historic practice of making cash distributions. We emphasize, moreover, that the valuation of the supermarkets was undertaken pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, for purposes of equitable distribution in a divorce matter. Even though the judge did not have the benefit of the <em>Kessler </em>decision at the time she rendered her judgment, these circumstances alone should have prompted the judge to look past the all-or-nothing approach of the parties\u2019 experts and pay particular attention to the facts of this case over more abstract considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">We conclude that the metric employed by the <em>Kessler </em>court provides a fairer mechanism for accounting for the tax consequences of the transfer of ownership of the supermarkets from one spouse to the other in the circumstances of record. On remand on the issue of valuation, the judge is to employ the tax affecting approach adopted in <em>Kessler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">3. <em>Discounts. </em>The parties\u2019 experts agreed that the husband\u2019s expertise was critical to the continued success of the supermarkets. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>On the assumption that after the divorce the supermarkets might be sold to a third party who would replace the husband at the helm of the supermarkets,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Horvitz (the husband\u2019s expert) discounted the value of the two supermarkets by ten per cent each for the \u201closs of [the husband]\u201d as the \u201ckey man\u201d and for the costs of sale (including broker\u2019s fees and advertising) of the supermarkets as closely held corporations. In evaluating the supermarkets, the judge adopted Horvitz\u2019s key man and marketability discounts. In the circumstances of this case, that was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">It is appropriate to assess a key man discount when an individual\u2019s \u201ccontinued services are critical to the financial success\u201d of the business being valued and may be or will be lost. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 482, 485 (1981) (defining term). See also Rev. Rul. 59-60, 1959-1 C.B. 237; <em>Estate of Feldmar </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>56 Tax Ct. Mem. Dec. (CCH) 118, 130 (1988); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>411 N.W.2d 868, 871 (Minn. Ct. App. 1987). Here, however, given the husband\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that he would maintain total ownership and control of the supermarkets, it is beyond reason to conclude that the business\u2019s value should be reduced to account for loss of the man who is \u201cthe whole show.\u201d Indeed, the cases cited by the husband support rather than detract from our analysis. In <em>Estate of Feldmar </em>v. <em>Commissioner, supra, </em>the court adopted a key man discount because the \u201ckey man\u201d in the complex insurance holding company at issue had in fact died; without him, the court reasoned, the company might have no value at all. In <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Nelson, supra, </em>the court found a key man discount applicable where the heart of the business was the sale of the employee\u2019s unique engineering services; the key man and the business were literally inseparable. The husband\u2019s role in the supermarkets, in contrast, is that of chief executive; his services are critical but not unique or irreplaceable, and in any event, as we have previously noted, the husband was not likely to be \u201clost\u201d to the enterprise. In the circumstances of this case, the judge should not have adopted a key man discount in valuing the supermarkets.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Similarly, a marketability discount \u201cadjusts for a lack of liquidity in one\u2019s interest in [a closely-held corporation], on the theory that there is a limited supply of potential buyers for stock in a closely-held corporation.\u201d <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 577 n.8 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 903 (2004), quoting <em>Lawson Mardon Wheaton, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>160 N.J. 383, 398-399 (1999). See <em>Balsamides </em>v. <em>Protameen Chems., Inc., </em>160 N.J. 352, 373 (1999). As Horvitz testified, and the judge found, a marketability discount is \u201cthe ability to convert the subject company to cash.\u201d This discount was not warranted in light of the husband\u2019s testimony negating any possibility of a sale. See note 28, <em>supra. </em>The subject companies will continue as going concerns and are not being converted to cash. \u201c[Njeither marketability nor a minority discount should be applied absent extraordinary circumstances .... Close corporations by their nature have less value to outsiders, but at the same time their value may be even greater to other shareholders who want to keep the business in the form of a close corporation.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>348 N.J. Super. 466,474-476 (2002). Applying a marketability discount in light of the husband\u2019s intended, and presumed, acquisition of the supermarkets unfairly deflated their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">One final issue raised by the wife is the matter of the rate of growth utilized in valuing the supermarkets. Horvitz used no growth rate in his valuation because he testified that doing so was a mere \u201cguess\u201d about the future. However, while he testified that the supermarkets \u201chad a downward trend in sales over the last three years,\u201d he also admitted on cross-examination that the supermarkets\u2019 revenues were, in fact, growing, and that only the percentage of growth had been trending downward. Leicester testified that his valuation added a two and one-half per cent growth rate to account only for inflation. The judge \u201c[did] not find that the application of a growth rate is appropriate in this matter.\u201d We disagree. We are persuaded that the judge abused her discretion by rejecting the two and one-half per cent growth rate advanced by Leicester where the uncontroverted record demon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>stated that revenue growth had exceeded that amount in all relevant years, and there was no evidence that future growth would fall short of inflation.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">4. <em>Award of alimony. </em>The wife was awarded alimony in the pretax amount of $5,288.46 per week, or $275,000 per year (approximately $165,000 after taxes, assuming forty per cent total rate of taxation).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The judge also ordered the husband to pay to the wife as additional alimony the sum of $3,160.11 per week to cover the expenses of the horse farm, until he paid the wife in full for her interests in the supermarkets.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The wife claims that the alimony award must be vacated as inadequate to meet her demonstrated needs, because it fails to cover the costs associated with her postdivorce ownership and management of the horse farm, which had always been principally under her management and control, which had never made a profit, and which sustained yearly losses in excess of $600,000.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The wife also claims that the award leaves the parties \u201cdrastically unequal in terms of income\u201d because the husband will have postdivorce income of almost $2 million yearly while she receives only $275,000 yearly. We decline to vacate the alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">A judge has considerable discretion in fashioning an alimony award, on consideration of all the factors set forth in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. See <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477, 480-481 (1996); <em>Drapek </em>v. <em>Drapek, </em>399 Mass. 240, 243 (1987); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Mass. 398, 400 (1977); <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. 420, 422 (1976). Our review of an alimony award made pursuant to \u00a7 34 is essentially a two-step analysis. \u201cFirst, we examine the judge\u2019s findings to determine whether all relevant factors in \u00a7 34 were considered.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>Bowring </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>399 Mass. 265, 267 (1987). The second part of our review is to determine whether the reasons for the judge\u2019s rulings are apparent in her findings and rulings. <em>Id. </em>If a judge has made findings consistent with her obligations under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, indicating that she has fairly considered all factors relevant under \u00a7 34 and has not considered any irrelevant matter, her determinations as to alimony may not be reversed unless \u201cplainly wrong or excessive.\u201d See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 37-38 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The judge\u2019s findings of fact show that she considered all of the factors under \u00a7 34 in reaching her conclusion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Her determination that the alimony award should not be used as a postdivorce subsidy of the horse farm was also sound. \u201cAlimony is an award for support and maintenance . . . .\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, supra </em>at 482, quoting Inker, Alimony and Assignment of Property: The New Statutory Scheme in Massachusetts, 10 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 1, 11 (1975). See <em>Keller </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>420 Mass. 820, 827 &amp; n.13 (1995) (award of alimony is improper absent finding of financial need on part of recipient spouse); <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 623 (1986) (\u201c\u00a7 34 does <em>not </em>alter the fundamental purpose of alimony: to provide economic support to the dependent spouse\u201d [emphasis in original]). Alimony \u201chas historically been based on the common law duty of the husband to support his wife. Property division, on the other hand, is based on the joint contribution of the spouses to the marital enterprise.\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, supra, </em>quoting Inker, <em>supra. </em>Neither the court nor the parties may \u201cblur the distinction between alimony and property division.\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, supra, </em>quoting Inker, <em>supra. </em>\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>standard of need is measured by the \u2018station\u2019 of the parties \u2014 by what is required to maintain a standard of living comparable to the one enjoyed during the marriage.\u201d <em>Grubert </em>v. <em>Grubert, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 819 (1985). See <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 366, 369 (2004) (same). There was no evidence that the money-losing horse farm was necessary to maintain the wife\u2019s \u201cstation\u201d in life. The wife\u2019s election to maintain the horse farm is a personal decision concerning the postdivorce use of former marital property; the husband cannot be forced to finance that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The wife relies on <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 741 (2005), for the proposition that it is error to reduce an alimony award so that a husband may avoid \u201csubsidiz[ingj\u201d for the foreseeable future the wife\u2019s \u201cavocation.\u201d This case is readily distinguishable. First, the <em>Kelley </em>decision addressed only modification of a judgment for alimony (based on the husband\u2019s request to eliminate support), rather than an original alimony award. Therefore, the standard of review was whether there had been a change of circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment, not whether the wife was entitled to alimony to support her position of underemployment. See <em>id. </em>at 738-739. Second, if we are to extrapolate from the <em>Kelley </em>decision to comment on the actual award of alimony provided to the wife by the Probate and Family Court judge in that case, that award was designed to support the wife\u2019s ability to care for three children while working as an artist. The wife here, in contrast, was awarded an amount sufficient to meet her personal expenses without being required to seek any additional employment. Moreover, the judge found that the wife had skills in the management of horse breeding that would permit her to acquire \u201cfuture capital, assets and income.\u201d To require that the husband in this case subsidize a venture that loses on the order of $600,000 per year, regardless whether the horse farm is a vocation or \u201cavocation\u201d for the wife, is a matter different from ordering support of an individual who, for reasons inapplicable here, may not be able to earn up to her full potential. The wife has failed to present persuasive evidence that her desire to continue to run the horse farm at a loss is integral to maintaining an \u201celaborate life-style.\u201d That choice cannot, as the wife urges, be analogized to awards properly designed to maintain a similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>standard of living to the marriage, such as allowing an individual to \u201csocialize or entertain\u201d or \u201cpurchase clothing\u201d as in the past. See, e.g., <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 608 (1990); <em>Grubert </em>v. <em>Grubert, supra </em>at 812. We cannot say that the judge\u2019s award was \u201cplainly wrong or excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">5. <em>Complaint in equity. </em>The parties entered into stipulations for temporary orders during the divorce that provided, among other things, that both would continue to own the supermarkets and equally share their profits during the pendency of the divorce, as well as to account for certain monies from the supermarkets to be used for particular purposes, including their attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The net income of the supermarkets was equalized through the end of 2000, thus leaving \u201cunequalized\u201d income of some $3.6 million yearly for the period of more than three years, from January 1, 2001, to February 2, 2004 (post-2000 period), during which the wife continued to be a fifty per cent shareholder of the supermarkets. The wife appeals from the judge\u2019s dismissal of her complaint in equity, filed after the close of evidence but while the case was still pending, seeking an accounting and equalization of income for the post-2000 period. We conclude that the judge\u2019s actions in this case effectively deprived the wife of a reasonable opportunity to bring the issue of income equalization during the post-2000 period before the court at an appropriate juncture, and that the equity complaint was therefore wrongly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">A brief chronology is in order. The wife sought to introduce the matter of income equalization on several occasions. The first was through a contempt claim filed in November, 2002.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Then, on July 28, 2003, before the divorce or contempt judgments entered, the wife filed an equity complaint against the husband. The impetus for this complaint was the husband\u2019s assertion at a corporate meeting of the supermarkets on July 10, 2003, that the income of the supermarkets was entirely his. When it issued, the divorce judgment on the property division did not address equalization of income for the post-2000 period. In September, 2003, the wife moved postjudgment for equalization, to which she ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>pended the complaint in equity.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The contempt judgment issued in September, 2003, and did not address the issue of income equalization for the post-2000 period.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> On September 30, 2003, during a hearing on the wife\u2019s postjudgment motion for equalization, the judge suggested that the wife was entitled to a share of the income (\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any dispute that she owned those shares\u201d) but nevertheless precluded the claim because the \u201cissue was never presented to me.\u201d She noted that the wife\u2019s equity complaint was \u201cpotentially a remedy for that issue.\u201d In July, 2004, the judge dismissed the wife\u2019s equity action on the husband\u2019s motion to dismiss, giving two reasons for so ruling: first, that the pretrial stipulations of the parties did not specify any entitlement of the wife to equalization of income; and second, that the issue should have been raised and resolved during the pendency of the divorce action, and was therefore barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The judge\u2019s actions created a \u201cCatch-22\u201d for the wife, whose various attempts to have the court address the issue of equalization for the post-2000 period were denied as either premature or waived. Before a claim will be barred on the ground of claim preclusion, it must be established that the claim was actually and necessarily decided in a prior action or that there was a full and fair opportunity to have done so that was not taken. See <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 24 (1988); <em>Massachusetts Prop. Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Norrington, </em>395 Mass. 751, 753 (1985); <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Rockwood Sprinkler Co., </em>340 Mass. 773, 775 (1960). Here, the judge erred in concluding that the pretrial stipulations somehow canceled the need to consider equalization for the post-2000 period in her judgment. The stipulations were entered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>temporary orders to govern spending (e.g., salary, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses) only until the divorce judgment entered.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The parties agreed in the stipulations that payments debited to the parties\u2019 accounts would be considered loans repayable on \u201cthe final division of [the] marital assets.\u201d The stipulations were not intended to divest the wife of her fifty per cent share in the supermarkets. If the stipulations respond to the wife\u2019s entitlement to income in any way, they weigh in the wife\u2019s favor, providing that \u201c[t]he parties agree that neither will draw any funds from any of the corporations for their personal benefit, other than the weekly paycheck to [the husband], except as provided herein in their agreement.\u201d The stipulations clearly do not entitle the husband to full ownership of the income distribution.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Second, it is clear that the judge\u2019s rulings did not provide the wife with a full and fair opportunity to air her claims, which the wife brought in a timely manner. The equity complaint was filed less than two weeks after the husband declared at a corporation meeting that he would henceforward treat the income from the supermarkets as entirely his own. The wife could not have known in advance of the divorce judgment that that judgment would not address equalization for the post-2000 period, a matter that was clearly set before the judge months before the judgment issued. Principles of res judicata and claim preclusion were inapplicable to the wife\u2019s complaint in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In regard to equalization, we are also constrained to note one final issue concerning the parties\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and costs. In the novel and complex circumstances of this case, we conclude that valuation of the markets and equal distribution of property are not issues that are easily separable. The parties\u2019 original stipulations provided that the supermarkets would advance the parties\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, with the payments \u201cdebited to the party\u2019s account who has incurred those expenses,\u201d and that such payments would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>be considered loans repayable by each party on the \u201cfinal division of [the] marital assets.\u201d The parties agreed to an equal division of the marital assets and the supermarkets. Each party has expended a considerable sum for legal representation toward the joint goal of valuing the supermarkets and dividing these assets. A final equalization of the supermarkets should incorporate the fees paid to attorneys for each party, and be treated so that each party is effectively debited with half of the attorney\u2019s fees. To fail to do so would leave the wife to pay her entire legal expenses out of her own pocket while the husband effectively would receive a windfall by simply moving money from one source under his control to another. We therefore conclude that the valuation of the supermarkets should be adjusted to take into account advances of legal fees for both parties since the December 31, 2000, reconciliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>The portion of the third amended supplemental judgment in the divorce matter concerning alimony is affirmed. We vacate the portion of the third amended supplemental judgment concerning valuation of the parties\u2019 S corporations, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion concerning tax affecting, key man and marketability discounts, the application of a two and one-half per cent growth rate to account for inflation, and the equalization of attorney\u2019s fees. We vacate the judgment of dismissal in the wife\u2019s equity action, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-13\">As we discuss <em>infra, </em>the income of a C corporation is subject to income tax at both the corporate (or entity) level and the shareholder level on dividends, if any, paid to shareholders.

On the parties\u2019 joint motion the judge issued the third amended supplemental judgment, in which the husband was also ordered to pay alimony in the amount of $8,448.57 per week from the date of the judgment until August 17, 2007, and $5,288.46 per week thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b803-5\">EarIier, in November, 2002, the wife had filed a complaint for contempt against the husband, alleging that he had violated the temporary orders by failing to provide her with financial information concerning the supermarkets and by taking money from the supermarkets for purposes not sanctioned by the temporary orders. In September, 2003, the judge found the husband in contempt for (a) failing to provide monthly accounting of income generated from the rentals to Bernier Realty Trust from May 1, 2002, until November, 2002; (b) failing to deliver copies of weekly cash journals and accounts payable check registers and monthly reports generated by the supermarkets within forty-eight hours of the date the reports were generated; and (c) utilizing corporate assets and pledging the credit of the supermarkets to attempt to start a health food store. The husband was ordered to (a) provide an accounting to the wife for all monies taken for his personal benefit; (b) pay to the wife the sum of $7,500 for her attorney\u2019s fees; and (c) cease making any investments or otherwise utilizing assets of the supermarkets until the wife was paid in full for her share of the supermarkets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The judge reasoned that the wife\u2019s failure to raise her claims for equalization of the income of the supermarkets during the divorce proceedings barred her from raising the claims in a subsequent equity action, where the issue of equalization of income had been addressed in temporary orders pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Massachusetts has a nominal State tax on the income of S corporations at the entity level, about which there is no dispute. Both parties\u2019 experts included this State tax in their valuations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\">We demonstrate the cognizable tax benefit to S corporation shareholders by way of an example adapted from the opinion of the Delaware Court of Chancery in <em>Delaware Open MRI Radiology Assocs. </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>898 A.2d 290 (Del. Ct. Ch. 2006) <em>(Kessler). </em>Assume that a corporation generates one hundred dollars in net annual earnings. If it is organized as a C corporation, its earnings after tax would be sixty dollars, assuming, as is the usual custom, that the effective corporate tax rate is forty per cent. Then, assume that the entity distributes its posttax earnings to its shareholders in the form of a dividend. Applying the individual tax on dividends at the prevailing rate of fifteen per cent, the shareholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>(assuming for the moment one single shareholder) would receive total posttax distributions of fifty-one dollars. Thus, the shareholder\u2019s effective tax rate after corporate income and dividend taxes would be forty-nine per cent. If the corporation were organized as an S corporation, its shareholder (again, assuming only one) would receive the entire one hundred dollars in earnings as distributions and be subject only to a shareholder-level tax. Thus, the shareholder would be responsible for paying taxes on the one hundred dollars at his or her individual tax rates, which will vary according to the shareholder\u2019s total net income. If we assume the individual tax rate to be forty per cent because the shareholder is in the highest marginal tax rate, the shareholder would pocket sixty dollars after tax if all earnings were distributed. The benefit is thus clear: the shareholder of the S corporation in this example ends up with sixty dollars, while the shareholder of the C corporation ends up with fifty-one dollars. See <em>Kessler, supra </em>at 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\">As counsel for both parties agreed at oral argument, valuation of any closely held corporation is fraught with uncertainties, and thus difficult to accomplish with precision and consistency. There are several unknown variables present in valuing shares of a company that is not publicly traded and not immediately marketable. See C.P. Kindregan, Jr., &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 45:8, at 332 (3d ed. 2002), citing B.H.

On direct examination, he said that the figure \u201crepresents the after-tax weighted average adjusted earnings in the hands of a new owner,\u201d while agreeing that S corporations pay no Federal tax at the entity level. On cross-examination, Horvitz testified both that the thirty-five per cent tax rate represents \u201cthe average corporate rate\u201d and that the thirty-five per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>cent rate was for \u201cpersonal tax.\u201d This discrepancy alone diminished the integrity of Horvitz\u2019s analysis. The judge was similarly vague. She stated only that Horvitz \u201capplied an effective tax rate of thirty-five (35%) per cent to arrive at the after-tax weighted average adjusted earnings\u201d and that \u201cthe Court believes that a deduction for taxes that will be owed must be made to either earnings or cash flow before an appropriate valuation can be made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The subject of taxation in <em>Gross </em>was the valuation of a gift of stock. The adverse parties were the government and the gift recipients of S corporation shares. The issue of equitable distribution was not present, as it is here. See <em>Gross, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The judge stated in her findings that Horvitz distinguished the outcome of <em>Gross </em>on the ground that the issue in that case \u201cwas the value of a fractional, minority interest in an S Corporation that was to be valued for gift tax putpose[s].\u201d She does not explain how that supposed distinction affects the determination of value here.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The judge also cited the IRS valuation guide to justify tax affecting. However, the IRS valuation guide cannot be cited as authority. See note 17, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The judge\u2019s written \u201cRationale\u201d provides no clearer window on her thinking, perhaps reflecting a confusion about whether corporate or individual taxation rates were being applied. See note 19, <em>supra. </em>The judge stated, \u201cA buyer [of] either entity has to consider the tax consequences of the income generated. A shareholder of a C corporation only personally pays taxes on the dividend that [it] receive[s], [It has] actually received the dividend and can utilize those monies to pay the resultant tax. ... A shareholder of an S corporation pays taxes on [its] proportionate share of the company, whether or not [it] actually receive[s] the cash. If sufficient funds were not received by the shareholder then he would have to utilize personal funds to pay the taxes. When the S corporation distributes additional funds to the shareholders so that the tax can be paid [as was the testimony in this case] the working capital of the company is reduced, and the income available to distribute to the owners is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>reduced. Therefore, the Court believes that a deduction for taxes that will be owed must be made to either earnings or cash flow before an appropriate valuation can be made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Subsequent to <em>Gross, </em>the United States Tax Court also decided in several cases that it was improper to tax affect an S corporation. See cases cited at note 18, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">See note 19, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">In <em>Kessler, </em>the Delaware court reached its determination noting the presence of both a Delaware \u201cequitable entire fairness claim and a statutory appraisal claim.\u201d <em>Kessler, supra </em>at 310.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The Delaware court emphasized, as do we, that a different analysis might apply if the profits of the S corporation were plowed back into the company instead of distributed, or if the shareholders were not individually taxed at the highest bracket. See <em>Kessler, supra </em>at 329 n.101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The Delaware court determined the 29.4 per cent figure by creating fictional percentages to represent Federal corporate tax at the entity level and dividend tax at the shareholder level, to arrive at the same figure that would be left in the pockets of shareholders of an S corporation after taxing one hundred dollars of earnings (i.e., sixty dollars resulting after taxing one hundred dollars of earnings at the rate of forty per cent as in our example, see note 15, <em>supra). </em>To derive this fictional figure, the court worked in reverse. To achieve a posttax income of sixty dollars (after corporate entity tax and dividend tax), the figure to tax would be $70.60 (fifteen per cent of $70.60 is $10.60, and subtracting the latter from the former arrives at sixty dollars). To arrive at $70.60 from the total one hundred dollars of earnings, the court subtracted 29.4 per cent, the appropriate fictional tax rate. Phrased differently, the court asked at what rate a C corporation would be taxed at the entity level to permit the shareholder to receive a distribution of sixty dollars (as he would from an S corporation) rather than the fifty-one dollars he would have received as a C corporation shareholder. That differential rate captures the benefit of ownership in the S corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The judge stated: \u201c[The wife\u2019s expert\u2019s] position is that a Subchapter S corporation would be worth substantially more than a Subchapter C corporation to a buyer. This is premised on the notion that an S corporation has an ability to provide greater cash flow to the owner due to the single level of tax paid by the entity. The court does not agree with this argument. Owners of S corporations normally distribute funds to themselves, as additional compensation, in order to pay the taxes arising from the corporate profits.\u201d The judge apparently eschewed the common understanding that shareholders in S corporations benefit from not having to pay a tax at the entity level. The fact that the husband paid himself additional money to meet his tax burden only supports the proposition that he benefited from the entity\u2019s S corporation status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The husband testified that the supermarkets were not for sale at any price. The wife made clear that she was willing and able to purchase the husband\u2019s one-half share for $8 million. There was additional evidence at trial that two other supermarkets on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, each totaling 25,000 square feet of selling space (smaller than the supermarkets at issue), had recently sold for approximately $9 million each. There was evidence that a large supermarket chain had made an overture to the husband to purchase the supermarkets, and that the husband was not open to discussions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Horvitz testified that he applied the discounts because, \u201cI don\u2019t have the luxury in a divorce case of knowing who the owner\u2019s going to be and what the person will be able to do\u201d with the supermarkets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Even if the husband had full control of the supermarkets, of course, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>services could be lost due to illness or other catastrophe, to the detriment of the supermarkets\u2019 financial success. Leicester\u2019s valuation, as well as Horvitz\u2019s, took into account the risk that the businesses could potentially suffer in the event of the husband\u2019s incapacity or death. See C.P.
