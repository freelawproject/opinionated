L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, for his participation in a homicide that had occurred fifteen years earlier, in July, 1989. The defendant was arrested after his coventurer confessed; the two men had successfully concealed their involvement in the crime for more than eleven years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">On appeal, the defendant challenges certain evidentiary rulings by the trial judge; argues that the prosecutor made improper statements in his closing argument; claims that certain of the jury instructions were erroneous; and contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter. We affirm the conviction, and conclude that there is no basis to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the conviction of murder in the first degree or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The evidence presented at trial permitted the jury to find the following facts. The victim was shot to death in the early morning hours of July 3, 1989. An eyewitness, James Jones, testified that he and the victim were talking in the parking lot of a Brockton bakery when Jones noticed a blue pickup truck, in which there were two white men and a tan-colored dog, driving slowly down the street toward them. As the truck approached, Jones heard the passenger say to them, \u201cDid you see . . . ?\u201d Jones then saw a rifle with a scope being pointed out of the passenger side window at them as the passenger said, \u201cWell, how do you like this?\u201d Jones testified that \u201csomething told me to get the hell out of here,\u201d and he and the victim began to run away from the truck. Four or five rifle shots followed, one of which struck the victim in the back, killing him. Other shots hit a wall and car windows near where Jones had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>attempted to take cover. After the truck departed, Jones ran to a convenience store and telephoned 911. The call came in at 2:54 a.m. on July 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">At the time of the homicide the defendant was living in Whitman with his then-wife, Victoria, in an apartment above one occupied by Glen Alebord and Alebord\u2019s girl friend at the time, Heidi Eaton. According to Eaton, between approximately 11 p.m. and midnight on the evening of July 2, the defendant and Alebord, who had been drinking together, drove to Brockton in Alebord\u2019s pickup truck \u201cto party,\u201d bringing with them two dogs, one black and one tan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alebord was the driver. Several hours later, Alebord and the defendant returned, awakening Eaton, who joined them in the kitchen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alebord told Eaton that he and the defendant had become lost in Brockton and had stopped to ask a group of black men for directions. One of the men, he said, had \u201cpunched him in the face\u201d and stolen seventy dollars from him. Alebord and the defendant had then driven around the block, while Alebord retrieved his .22 caliber rifle from behind the seat of the truck and passed it to the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The two men drove back to \u201cthe group of men\u201d and, as Alebord reported to Eaton, the defendant \u201cshot into the crowd.\u201d The defendant was present in the kitchen while Alebord recounted these events to Eaton, but said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Alebord then told Eaton that he and the defendant were going to return to Brockton with Alebord\u2019s shotgun in order to \u201cscare\u201d the men. Alebord retrieved his shotgun from his bedroom, and he and the defendant then left the apartment in the defendant\u2019s car. The two men returned to the apartment approximately one hour later, telling Eaton that \u201cwhere they had been earlier\u201d was now surrounded by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Later that same day Alebord\u2019s brother showed Alebord a front-page story in the Brockton Enterprise, a local daily newspaper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>concerning the shooting. Eaton testified that after Alebord saw the article, he retrieved the rifle from his truck and disposed of it in a cranberry bog. That same day, Alebord fled to Maine with Eaton and their child. While in Maine, Alebord painted his truck black. Approximately ten days later, Alebord and Eaton returned to Whitman where they met with the defendant and Victoria to discuss the Brockton homicide. During the meeting, according to both Eaton and Victoria, the defendant repeatedly stated, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I shot somebody.\u201d All four then agreed, in the words of Eaton, that the shooting \u201cwould not be discussed again so that nobody would find out.\u201d The defendant later moved away from Whitman. He was arrested in Florida in 2001.\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">2. <em>Admission of coventurer\u2019s statements. </em>Relying on <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 126 (1968), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 510, 515 (1985), the defendant argues that the judge erred in admitting in evidence the statements Alebord made to Eaton in the kitchen of their apartment after the shooting.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge held that the statements were admissible under two theories, either as being made in furtherance of an ongoing joint venture or as adoptive admissions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>(joint venture hearsay exception to confrontation clause). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>430 Mass. 700, 705 (2000) (adoptive admissions do not implicate confrontation clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As to the joint venture basis, the defendant argues that it was error to admit Alebord\u2019s statements in evidence because the Commonwealth had not first established by other nonhearsay evidence that there was a joint venture. The judge\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Out-of-court statements by joint venturers are admissible against each other if the statements are made \u201cboth during the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 543 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708-709 (1976). While a statement may be introduced under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>exception to the hearsay rule \u201conly if the existence of the joint criminal venture is shown by some other evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, supra, </em>the Commonwealth can meet that burden by establishing an \u201cadequate probability of the existence of a common venture, including participation by the given defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 340 (1983), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 709 n.7. An \u201cadequate probability\u201d exists when the Commonwealth satisfies a judge \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that a criminal joint venture took place between the declarant and the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 838, 844 (2000). In determining whether an \u201cadequate probability\u201d exists, the evidence is to be viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144 (1992), and may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>384 Mass. 149, 159 (1981), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Here, Jones\u2019s eyewitness testimony placed two men in a truck cooperating in the shooting. The driver headed toward the victim slowly enough to allow the passenger to obtain the victim\u2019s attention orally, and then either the passenger or the driver fired the rifle at the victim through the open window on the passenger\u2019s side of the truck. There was also sufficient evidence to establish an adequate probability that this defendant in fact participated in the shooting. Alebord and the defendant fit the description of the shooters: two white men in a pickup truck in Brockton with a medium-sized tan dog on the evening in question, having in their possession a rifle of the same caliber and description (scope equipped) that was used to commit the murder. This, together with the defendant\u2019s repeated inculpatory statement during the Whitman meeting, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I shot somebody,\u201d was sufficient to establish on the basis of nonhearsay evidence that the defendant participated in a joint venture with Alebord.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">It was also proper for the judge to admit Alebord\u2019s statements in evidence as adoptive admissions of the defendant. The theory of adoptive admissions is straightforward: \u201cWhere a party is confronted with an accusatory statement which, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would challenge, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>party remains silent or responds equivocally, the accusation and the reply may be admissible on the theory that the party\u2019s response amounts to an admission of the truth of the accusation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 506 (1992). To be admissible, \u201cit must be apparent that the party has heard and understood the statement, that he had an opportunity to respond, and that the context was one in which he would have been expected to respond to an accusation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 719 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">There was ample evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant\u2019s actions met the requirements articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, supra. </em>Eaton testified that Alebord, in the presence of the defendant, said that the defendant \u201cshot into the crowd,\u201d and proceeded to provide further details of how the shooting transpired. This is precisely the type of \u201caccusatory statement which, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would challenge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra </em>at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">There was also sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant \u201cheard and understood\u201d Alebord\u2019s statement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, supra. </em>Eaton testified that the kitchen was not large, and that Alebord and the defendant had been speaking loudly enough to awaken her. Eaton did testify that she did not \u201cremember\u201d whether the defendant \u201csaid anything or not,\u201d but she clarified that statement by testifying that, if the defendant had said something, she \u201cprobably would have remembered it.\u201d Her testimony permitted a reasonable inference that the defendant heard and understood Alebord\u2019s allegations. The defendant did not respond to or correct Alebord\u2019s statements at the time they were made. Nor did he take the opportunity to do so when Alebord left the kitchen to retrieve his shotgun, leaving Eaton and the defendant alone. Alebord\u2019s statements were properly admitted as adoptive admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">3. <em>Admission of evidence of coventurer\u2019s postcrime actions. </em>The defendant challenges the admission in evidence of Alebord\u2019s actions following the shooting \u2014 disposing of his rifle, fleeing to Maine, and painting his truck black \u2014 because, the defendant argues, these actions occurred after any joint venture had concluded and therefore cannot be attributed to him. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>too, the evidence was properly admitted. The inquiry focuses not on whether the crime itself has been completed, but whether a joint venture was continuing. \u201cActs of a joint venturer amounting to consciousness of guilt may be attributed to another joint venturer if the acts occurred during the course of a joint venture and in furtherance of it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>405 Mass. 326, 330-331 (1989). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 452 (1988) (if joint venture has ended, subsequent actions of joint venturer cannot be admitted against another).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">There was sufficient evidence for a jury to find (assuming they first found that the Commonwealth had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a joint venture) that the joint venture was ongoing at the time of Alebord\u2019s actions, and that Alebord\u2019s actions were taken during and in furtherance of the joint venture. Within ten days of the shooting, Alebord returned to Whitman, where he, Eaton, the defendant, and Victoria Braley met and agreed to conceal the involvement of Alebord and the defendant in the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. 502, 519 (1993) (\u201cEfforts on the part of a joint venturer to conceal the occurrence of the enterprise\u2019s unlawful purpose or to effect an escape warrant the inference that the joint venture continued through the time the statements were made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">4. <em>Admission of the defendant\u2019s postarrest statements. </em>In January, 2001 (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>State Trooper Richard Warmington and a Brockton police detective traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, to take custody of the defendant and return him to Massachusetts. Trooper Warmington testified that he and the detective took custody of the defendant at a Florida pretrial detention facility, and then drove with the defendant to the airport for a commercial flight back to Massachusetts. While in the car on the way to the airport, Trooper Warmington advised the defendant of his Miranda rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On arriving at the airport in the mid-afternoon, Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Warmington removed the defendant\u2019s handcuffs, as the commercial airline on which they were flying did not permit passengers to be handcuffed either in the terminal or on the aircraft. While waiting in the airport lounge before boarding the plane, the defendant and the officers engaged in what the judge characterized as \u201clight conversation and banter\u201d between themselves and also with the defendant.* <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At one point, the detective left to obtain refreshments. Trooper Warmington stated that the defendant, who was sitting alone with him, suddenly asked, \u201cHow did you get on to me?\u201d Trooper Warmington testified, \u201cI told him that his partner wasn\u2019t as good as he was in keeping this quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Before trial the defendant moved to suppress both the defendant\u2019s statement and Trooper Warmington\u2019s response. The motion was denied, and both statements were elicited by the Commonwealth during its examination of Trooper Warmington. On appeal, the defendant argues that because he had invoked his right to counsel, <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-445 (1966), the subsequent conversations with Trooper Warmington and the detective were a \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d of information or \u201cthe functional equivalent of an interrogation\u201d such that the statements should have been suppressed. See <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, 377 </em>U.S. 201, 206 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>429 Mass. 388, 393 (1999). We review each statement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">a. <em>The defendant\u2019s statement. </em>We see no error in the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s statement was not the result of interrogation, nor in her finding that the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary. The defendant\u2019s statement was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u201cThe procedural safeguards of <em>Miranda </em>are required not where a suspect is merely in police custody, but rather where a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 792, 796 (1997), quoting <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300 (1980). For Miranda purposes, interrogation \u201cmust reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself,\u201d and consists of \u201cexpress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 796-797, quoting <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, supra </em>at 300-301. The term \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d includes \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police . . . that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 797, quoting <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, supra </em>at 301. The \u201c \u2018functional equivalence\u2019 test does not turn on the subjective intent of the particular police officer but on an objective assessment as to whether the police statements and conduct would be perceived as interrogation by a reasonable person in the same circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>985 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 944 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">At the airport the defendant was in the custody of the police, but no reasonable person would have perceived the conduct of the two officers to have constituted an \u201cinterrogation\u201d as that term is used in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra. </em>The circumstances in which the \u201clight conversation and banter\u201d transpired were unusual. Trooper Warmington, a veteran law enforcement officer, was tasked with the rendition of a suspect charged with a serious crime. The officers were required to escort the defendant through a public airport in the middle of the day, and then onto a commercial airplane for a lengthy flight back to Boston. They were prohibited throughout from using handcuffs to maintain physical control over the defendant. Trooper Warmington testified that it was therefore necessary to put the defendant at ease to ensure that there was, in the Trooper\u2019s words, \u201cno problem getting him on that aircraft.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Importantly, the judge credited Trooper Warmington\u2019s testimony that he and the detective purposefully avoided discussing with the defendant any issue that may have had relevance to the investigation. A reasonable person would not perceive that the officers, in these circumstances, sought to engage the defendant in conversation for the purpose of the \u201cdeliberate elicitation\u201d of inculpatory statements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, supra </em>at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The judge was also correct in ruling that the defendant\u2019s statement to Trooper Warmington at issue here was voluntary. \u201cAny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>380 Mass. 876, 883, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1004 (1980), quoting <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra </em>at 478. Volunteered statements of a defendant are admissible even if Miranda errors are otherwise present, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>422 Mass. 269, 271 (1996), and \u201c[spontaneous and unprovoked statements are admissible even if made after a defendant has invoked his right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>438 Mass. 103, 115 (2002). According to Trooper Warmington\u2019s testimony, which the judge credited, the defendant made the statement, \u201cHow did you get on to me?\u201d without any prompting. The judge did not err in ruling that the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Because there was no interrogation and the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary, the protections afforded by <em>Miranda </em>are not implicated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, supra. </em>We therefore need not consider whether the defendant\u2019s earlier response in the car to the detective\u2019s inquiry as to whether he had an attorney constituted an invocation of his right to counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">b. <em>The trooper\u2019s response. </em>In response to the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cHow did you get on to me?\u201d the judge permitted Trooper Warmington to testify that \u201cI told him that his partner wasn\u2019t as good as he was in keeping this quiet.\u201d The trooper\u2019s response should not have been admitted. Were it admitted for its truth, it would constitute impermissible hearsay, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>351 Mass. 489, 491 (1966). The Commonwealth suggests that the testimony was properly admitted \u201cnot for its truth, but to show the state of police knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>drew their attention to the defendant,\u201d quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>443 Mass. 245, 270 (2005). This rationale fails: \u201cThe circumstances of the police focus on the defendant were not at issue in this case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 511 (1999).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore review to ascertain whether the error is nonprejudicial, that is, whether \u201cthe conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750,764-765 (1946).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Excluding Trooper Warmington\u2019s response entirely from our consideration, there was overwhelming other evidence, from Victoria Braley and from Heidi Eaton, that Alebord and the defendant had jointly participated in the shooting. The improper admission of Trooper Warmington\u2019s response was cumulative of other evidence, and does not constitute prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 159-160 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">5. <em>Limiting instruction. </em>There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge improperly allowed in evidence Eaton\u2019s testimony concerning the newspaper article. Because Alebord\u2019s postcrime concealment actions were properly admitted, the newspaper article was admissible to demonstrate that Alebord knew that a gun-related homicide had occurred in Brockton earlier that day, and to explain why Alebord then immediately took steps to conceal involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The defendant also argues, citing <em>Horta </em>v. <em>Sullivan, 4 </em>F.3d 2, 8 (1st Cir. 1993), certified question answered by 418 Mass. 615 (1994),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the judge should have given, sua sponte, a limiting instruction concerning the article, because the article was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>hearsay and not admissible for its truth. We disagree. The defendant did not make a request for such an instruction, despite his opportunity to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonardi, </em>413 Mass. 757, 764 (1992) (\u201cthe law does not require a judge to give limiting jury instructions regarding the purpose for which evidence is offered unless so requested by the defendant\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In any event, the newspaper article was not entered in evidence; Eaton merely testified that the article concerned \u201ca shooting in Brockton [in which a] man was shot in the parking lot.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The cases on which the defendant relies, <em>Horta </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>432 Mass. 578, 589 (2000); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>384 Mass. 572, 577-579 (1981), are inapposite. In each case the article or its specific content was entered in evidence. Where, as here, the defendant raises for the first time on appeal a claim concerning the failure to give a limiting instruction, we review to determine whether there is a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>411 Mass. 313, 323 (1991). Having done so, we conclude there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">6. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument. </em>In his closing argument the prosecutor made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201c[Wjhat does [the defendant] say? Here\u2019s a guy, eleven years after a homicide, living in another state, what does he say to the trooper? You\u2019ve got the wrong man, what am I doing here, I live in Florida? I didn\u2019t kill anybody, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>are you doing? What am I going back to Massachusetts for? No. He say <em>[sic] </em>seven words, seven words: \u201cHow did you get on to me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The defendant objected at trial, and asserts on appeal that this statement was an unconstitutional comment on the defendant\u2019s right to silence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mahdi, 388 Mass. 679, 694 (1983), and <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-618 (1976). The statements should not have been made by the prosecutor. We therefore \u201cassess the record as a whole to determine the probable impact of the improper comments.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, supra </em>at 696. The <em>Mahdi </em>court suggested five factors in determining whether an error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201c(1) the relationship between the [statement] and the premise of the defense; (2) who introduced the issue at trial; (3) the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt; (4) the frequency of the reference; and (5) the availability or effect of curative instructions.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 696-697.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment on the defendant\u2019s silence touched on the premise of the defense: misidentification. But there was other corroborated evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and the prosecutor\u2019s reference was not extensive. Importantly, at the defendant\u2019s request, the judge immediately issued a strong curative instruction, referencing directly the defendant\u2019s challenge to that portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>430 Mass. 654, 661 (2000) (where judge gave explicit and thorough instruction that defendant\u2019s hesitation to speak to police was not to be held against him, and where evidence against defendant was substantial, error was harmless). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 10-11 (1980) (failure of instruction to \u201cpoint out the particulars which were the basis and purpose for the defendant\u2019s request for an additional instruction\u201d contributed to finding of reversible error). In her final charge to the jury, the judge reinforced her instruction, reiterating the defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination and noting that closing arguments are not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Closing arguments must be viewed \u201cin the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury, and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>533, 553 (1990). After a careful evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s comments in their context, we conclude that the remarks, \u201calthough better left unsaid, [do] not require reversal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>417 Mass. 126, 133 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Next, the defendant argues that his due process rights were violated by references in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to facts not in evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See note 13, <em>supra. A </em>prosecutor must limit his closing comments to \u201cthe evidence and the fair inferences which can be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 378 (1978). We conclude there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">As to the prosecutor\u2019s references to \u201cmurder\u201d (to which the defendant objected at trial), the prosecutor asked Eaton whether the Whitman meeting concerned \u201cthe homicide,\u201d and she responded in the affirmative; Victoria Braley\u2019s testimony was that the meeting concerned \u201cthe shooting.\u201d A homicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every homicide is a murder, nor is every shooting a murder; \u201cmurder\u201d is not a fact but a crime that must be proved. But a prosecutor may argue the inference that a \u201chomicide\u201d or a \u201cshooting\u201d is a \u201cmurder,\u201d and the prosecutor\u2019s decision to do so here was warranted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 459-460 (1978), subsequent motion for new trial vacated, 409 Mass. 405 (1991) (prosecutor entitled to marshal evidence and argue for decision of controversy in favor of Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The defendant did not object at trial to the other aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s closing that he now challenges on appeal. We review these claims to determine whether there exists a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 686-687 (2001). While Eaton testified that she did not remember whether the defendant \u201csaid anything or not\u201d when in the kitchen, she immediately clarified her statement, testifying that if the defendant had said something, \u201cI probably would have remembered it.\u201d As we have just stated, a prosecutor is entitled to argue for a decision of the controversy in favor of the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>and the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Eaton\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s silence in the kitchen was permissible. Finally, while the prosecutor misstated Eaton\u2019s testimony regarding the color of the track, the prosecutor himself reminded the jury prior to his closing argument that \u201cit\u2019s your memory that roles.\u201d This point was reinforced by the judge in her charge to the jury. These prosecutorial statements, even if made in error, did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">7. <em>Jury instruction on joint venture hearsay evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the judge improperly instructed the jury on the law pertaining to joint venture hearsay.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendant did not object at trial, but argues now that the judge should have instructed the jury to consider the statements and actions of Alebord only if and when the joint venturers were acting to conceal the crime <em>in furtherance of </em>the joint venture. Because the judge did not do so, he argues, the jury may erroneously have believed that they could consider any actions taken by Alebord to conceal the crime, even if those actions occurred after the joint venture had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Although a more precise instruction might have been preferable, there is no merit to the point. The Commonwealth placed in evidence only statements made (or actions taken) by Alebord that were alleged to have occurred before the Whitman meeting, and which therefore occurred during the joint venture itself. In a case of murder in the first degree, when the defendant fails at trial to claim an error in a jury instruction, \u201cour review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>charge is limited to determining whether there is an error in the charge which creates a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>384 Mass. 247, 258 (1981). Any such error here does not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">8. <em>Involuntary manslaughter instruction. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s claim, made for the first time on appeal, that the failure of his trial counsel to seek an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, or the failure of the judge, sua sponte, to give such an instruction created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>444 Mass. 678, 684-685 (2005). We reach this conclusion for essentially the same reasons that the Appeals Court articulated in the case of the defendant\u2019s coventurer. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alebord, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 6-9 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Even if requested, the judge need not have given the instruction. Involuntary manslaughter is an unlawful homicide where \u201cwanton and reckless conduct causes death, or . . . where an unintentional killing \u2018result[s] from a battery not amounting to a felony which the defendant knew or should have known endangered human life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>434 Mass. 570, 590 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fryar, </em>425 Mass. 237, 248, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1033 (1997). In determining whether an involuntary manslaughter instruction must be given, we ask whether any \u201creasonable view of the evidence would have permitted the jury to find \u2018wanton and reckless\u2019 conduct rather than actions from which a \u2018plain and strong likelihood\u2019 of death would follow.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>426 Mass. 582, 585 (1998). In doing so, \u201cwe draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyous, </em>436 Mass. 719, 731 (2002). A judge is not required to instruct on involuntary manslaughter when it is obvious that \u201cthe risk of physical harm to the victim creates a \u2018plain and strong likelihood that death would follow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>428 Mass. 478, 493 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>422 Mass. 574, 578 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Eaton testified that, while in the kitchen, Alebord stated that the defendant \u201cshot <em>into </em>the crowd\u201d (emphasis added). The defendant did not counter this allegation. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the defendant fired into the air, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>distinguishing the circumstances here from the circumstances in the cases relied on by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>424 Mass. 242, 244 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koonce, </em>418 Mass. 367, 369 (1994). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>361 Mass. 709, 712-713 (1972). \u201cAbsent some evidence that the defendant\u2019s knowledge was impaired, intentionally discharging a firearm in the direction of another person creates a plain and strong likelihood of death.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>423 Mass. 288, 290 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, supra </em>at 590, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzmeyer, </em>414 Mass. 540, 547 (1993) (\u201cWhen it is obvious that the risk of physical harm to the victim creates a \u2018plain and strong likelihood that death would follow,\u2019 ... an instruction on involuntary manslaughter is not warranted\u201d). Firing a rifle multiple times, directed toward specific individuals, provides a sufficient basis to conclude that the defendant understood the likely deadly consequences of his actions. There was no error.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This also disposes of the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 90-91 (1992) (where evidence indicates that judge would have denied motion, it is not ineffective assistance if counsel failed to file such motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">9. <em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record in accordance with the requirements of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. We conclude that the verdict is supported by the evidence and is consonant with justice. The defendant engaged in a deliberate, unprovoked attack on two defenseless men. There is nothing in the record of this case to suggest that we exercise our extraordinary power to reverse the verdict, reduce the conviction, or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The coventurer, Glen S. Alebord, moved to sever his trial from the defendant\u2019s, and the motion was allowed. Alebord\u2019s conviction of murder in the second degree as a joint venturer was affirmed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alebord, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\">There was evidence that Brockton is approximately fifteen to twenty minutes away from the Whitman apartment building by automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Heidi Eaton testified that Alebord and the defendant returned sometime between 1 and 3 a.m. Victoria Braley testified that Alebord and the defendant returned in \u201cthe middle of the night,\u201d but she was not sure of the time.

Trooper Warmington also testified that the detective then asked the defendant whether he had an attorney, to which the defendant responded that, although he did not have one at the time, it was his impression that one would be appointed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>him on his return to Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Trooper Warmington testified at the pretrial hearing that \u201c[w]e tried to talk about sports a little bit.

Things that had no relevance to the case. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Trooper Warmington testified at the pretrial hearing that \u201c[the detective] and I would be speaking about something, and the defendant would jump in . . .

I mean, it\u2019s a lot better traveling somewhere on an aircraft when it\u2019s amicable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\">We agree with the defendant that there is some ambiguity in the record on several points. It is unclear whether the judge in fact concluded that the defendant had asserted his right to counsel and, if so, when. There is also ambiguity in Trooper Warmington\u2019s testimony as to when any such assertion occurred. At the pretrial hearing, Trooper Warmington testified that the defendant responded to the detective\u2019s question about an attorney in the car on the way to the airport. On cross-examination, however, defense counsel asked: \u201c[At the point after you responded to the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cHow did you get on to me?\u201d he] indicated that he was asserting those rights available to him under Miranda, correct?\u201d The trooper responded, \u201cHe did.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument also fails on factual grounds, as the prosecutor did refer to the trooper\u2019s response substantively for its truth during his closing argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Because the trooper was available for cross-examination, there is no constitutional concern that implicates the confrontation clause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 3 (2005). In making this claim on appeal, the defendant makes reference to his constitutional right to receive due process. His challenge is, however, directed to a straightforward evidentiary ruling, and is thus reviewed under the prejudicial error standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), rather than the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard of constitutional claims. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163-164, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">In <em>Horta </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>4 F.3d 2 (1st Cir. 1993), the United States Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Appeals for the First Circuit considered a plaintiff\u2019s appeal from a grant of summary judgment to the defendant police officers in a civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). In evidence was a newspaper article describing certain police tactics employed during the motor vehicle chase in which the plaintiff was injured.

However, an intent to scare need not be mutually exclusive of an intent to aim at a particular individual. Given the evidence that the defendant intentionally shot into the crowd, his alleged intent only to scare does not satisfy the requirements for an involuntary manslaughter instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>423 Mass. 288, 290 (1996) (no involuntary manslaughter instruction required where defendant fired weapon several times in direction of victim allegedly only \u201cin order to scare\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
