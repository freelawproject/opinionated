See St. 1897, c. 506. St. James was built in 1958 on an eight-acre parcel of land (property) acquired by the RCAB in 1946 from Waldo M. Maffei (Waldo) and his five siblings. Waldo and his sister voluntarily transferred their respective interests in the property to the RCAB for no monetary payment, and Waldo\u2019s four brothers each received $3,000 for their respective shares. In connection with the property transaction, Waldo\u2019s wife, Catherine Maffei (Catherine), released her rights of \u201cdower and homestead.\u201d The church was named in honor of Waldo\u2019s father, James Maffei (James), allegedly in fulfilment of an oral agreement between the RCAB and the Maffei family that the property would \u201cforever\u201d be used as the site of a church so named, although the plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaint alleges, and the judge found, that Waldo had been prepared to donate his interest in the property to the RCAB before any alleged oral agreement about the future use of the property was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">After St. James closed, Catherine, individually, and with her daughter, Maureen Maffei, as trustee of the Waldo M. Maffei Revocable Trust<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (collectively, Maffeis), filed a verified complaint in the Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in the form of a resulting or constructive trust on the property in their favor, and for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Their claims center on the alleged oral agreement between the Maffei siblings and the RCAB that the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>would be maintained in perpetuity as a church in honor of Waldo\u2019s father, as well as on the RCAB\u2019s failure to draft a deed reflecting that, if the property were not so used, ownership would revert to the Maffeis. The Maffeis were joined by plaintiff Eileen Hanafin, who sought recovery from the RCAB for alleged negligent misrepresentation in connection with a donation of $35,000 she made to St. James more than two years before its closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The claims of all three plaintiffs rest, in whole or in part, on the presumption that the RCAB owed them a legal duty, grounded in the \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d inherent (they allege) in the priest-parishioner relationship, to inform them that, under canon law, St. James could be suppressed at a future time. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the RCAB\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all counts and dismissed the case. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We conclude that summary judgment in the RCAB\u2019s favor was proper. First, as we explain below, insofar as the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action are predicated on the alleged fiduciary or confidential relationship between a member of the Roman Catholic Church clergy and his congregants, the claims in this case raise matters of internal church governance that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids us to consider.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We may not, consistent with the First Amendment, inquire into any alleged pastoral duties owed by the Roman Catholic priesthood to its laity concerning matters of canon law. See, e.g., <em>Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for the U.S. &amp; Can. </em>v. <em>Milivojevich, </em>426 U.S. 696, 710 (1976); <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, </em>416 Mass. 781, 785, cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1142 (1994). Second, to the extent that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims pertain to matters legally cognizable in our civil courts, they fail in one or more of their essential elements. See Mass. R. Civ. R 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). We may not address grievances that are insufficiently supported by cognizable evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the judge\u2019s findings and other un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>contested material of record, as viewed in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). The RCAB was incorporated by the Legislature in 1897, and empowered, among other things, to \u201creceive, take and hold, by sale, gift, lease, devise or otherwise, real and personal estate of every description, for religious, charitable and burial purposes, and to manage and dispose of the same for the religious and charitable purposes of the Roman Catholic church.\u201d St. 1897, c. 506, \u00a7 2. In the 1940\u2019s, Reverend Robert H. Lord of St. Paul\u2019s Parish in Wellesley sought permission from the RCAB to purchase land to establish a church to serve the needs of the growing Roman Catholic population of East Natick and the adjacent \u201cFells section\u201d of Wellesley, who were geographically isolated from existing parishes in those towns. The RCAB approved the request, and Reverend Lord began searching for a suitable location for the new church. He soon identified a tract of approximately eight acres of land on the Worcester Turnpike in Wellesley as \u201cthe best site \u2014 and, indeed, the only good site \u2014 for such a church.\u201d The land was held in equal shares as tenants in common by James\u2019s six children.* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Some time in 1946, Reverend Lord had several conversations with Waldo in Waldo\u2019s home during which he inquired about the Maffei family\u2019s donating the property to the RCAB for use as the site of a church. The conversations apparently occurred in the presence or within the hearing of Catherine. According to a \u201cstatement under oath\u201d that Catherine gave to her attorneys in May, 2005, Reverend Lord came to the Maffei house several times to explore obtaining the property for use as a church.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Waldo thereafter contacted his sister and four brothers about the RCAB\u2019s request, but they rejected it. On the third visit to Wal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>do\u2019s home,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the presence of Catherine, Reverend Lord told Waldo that the church would be named \u201cSt. James\u201d in honor of Waldo\u2019s father, and that the church would remain a tribute to James \u201cforever.\u201d He also told Waldo that the RCAB would pay each of the other four Maffei brothers $3,000 to transfer their respective interests in the property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to Catherine, who is the sole surviving participant of these events,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> during negotiations for the property Reverend Lord did not inform any members of the Maffei family that canon law permitted the closure of the church in the future.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Maffei family agreed to transfer the property to the RCAB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>for $12,000 (representing payment of $3,000 to each of Waldo\u2019s four brothers), a price that amounted to $1,500 per acre.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The parties did not enter into a purchase and sales agreement, but executed a deed transferring all legal and beneficial interest in the property to the RCAB in exchange \u201cfor consideration paid.\u201d An attorney hired by the RCAB prepared the deed, which the Maffei siblings, choosing not to be represented by counsel, had the opportunity to read and then signed before a notary in Waldo\u2019s home.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The spouses of the four married Maffei brothers, Catherine among them, also executed the deed, relinquishing their rights of \u201cdower and homestead.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The deed, in fee simple absolute, makes no reference to naming the church in honor of James. Nor does it recite any alleged agreement concerning using the property \u201cforever\u201d as a church. The deed contains no reservation of rights or right to enter or retake the property. The Maffeis claimed that the family never would have executed the deed had they been informed that the property might not always be used as the locus of a church named for James.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In 1950, the RCAB erected St. James as a parish, and by 1958, a new St. James Church (renamed St. James the Great to avoid confusion with another church in the area) was constructed. Waldo and Catherine, founding parishioners, became heavily involved in the affairs of St. James. Waldo paid $10,000 for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>church altar, and he and his wife frequently volunteered their time and resources to benefit the parish.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In 2002, the church served approximately 900 families.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">By that time, however, questions, real or rumored, had arisen concerning St. James\u2019s continued viability. In 1999, an article appeared in a local newspaper stating that the RCAB had included St. James on a list of parish churches to be closed. Shortly thereafter, Reverend George Vartzelis, then pastor of St. James, assured his congregation that the article was incorrect and that St. James would remain open. In June, 2002, the RCAB launched a capital endowment campaign in which each of its 368 parishes was to raise a specific amount in donations. St. James\u2019s target was $370,000. In conjunction with the capital campaign, Reverend Vartzelis sent solicitation letters to his parishioners requesting funds for the RCAB campaign, and also asked for $35,000 in donations to refurbish St. James \u201cto keep it as good as it needs to be and as we all want it to be now and for the future.\u201d Reverend Vartzelis, at the time he made these statements, had no knowledge of the RCAB\u2019s plans, if any, to close the church. Based on Reverend Vartzelis\u2019s representation that a gift would benefit St. James \u201cnow and for the future,\u201d Hanafin, then a retiree in her eighties, donated $35,000 to the church. Hanafin states in her affidavit: \u201cIf I had known that the Archdiocese . . . was giving any consideration to closing St. James, I would not have made the gift of $35,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Reverend Vartzelis retired in the spring of 2003, and the RCAB replaced him with an administrator, an interim position, rather than with a pastor. In January, 2004, the RCAB required each \u201ccluster\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of parishes to investigate and report on which parishes in the cluster might be closed in a \u201creconfiguration\u201d plan. The Wellesley-Weston cluster, to which St. James belonged, reported in their \u201creconfiguration response\u201d that, while it would be best for all parishes in the cluster to remain open, St. James would be the \u201cmost feasible\u201d church to close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>as it \u201chas the smallest number of recorded families and individuals; the smallest Mass count; the smallest religious education program; and the smallest sacramental index.\u201d On October 5, 2004, the RCAB issued a decree of suppression of St. James, effective October 31, 2004. The decree reassigned the territory covered by St. James to other parishes, transferred the canonical registers of St. James to another parish, and transferred \u201cthe goods and obligations\u201d of St. James to the RCAB.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The RCAB retained legal title to the property. During one of the last Masses before the church closed, Hanafin asked Reverend Vartzelis, \u201cFather, why didn\u2019t you tell us the church was closing?\u201d He replied, \u201cI really didn\u2019t know it, Eileen,\u201d and he seemed, Hanafin stated in her affidavit, \u201cvisibly upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The plaintiffs filed their six-count verified complaint on June 8, 2005.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They subsequently moved for lis pendens on the property and, in light of Catherine and Hanafin\u2019s advanced age, for a speedy trial. The RCAB moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The judge denied the RCAB\u2019s motion to dismiss and allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for lis pendens and motion for a speedy trial. Thereafter, all parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We turn now to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">2. <em>Scope of review. </em>As the movant for summary judgment on all counts, the RCAB must affirmatively establish the absence of a triable issue as to each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In deciding the motion, the judge was required to consider all factual allegations, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ably for the plaintiffs. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). We review the judge\u2019s legal conclusions de nova. <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 214, 215 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Our consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is also informed, and limited, by bedrock principles of the First Amendment. It is axiomatic that the First Amendment protects an individual\u2019s freedom to worship, or not to worship, as he or she chooses. It also places beyond our jurisdiction disputes involving church \u201cdoctrine, canon law, polity, discipline, and ministerial relationships.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>436 Mass. 574, 579 (2002). See <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>437 Mass. 505, 515 (2002); <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, </em>378 Mass. 58, 61, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 899 (1979). Among the religious controversies off limits to our courts are promises by members of the clergy to keep a church open. See <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, </em>416 Mass. 781, 785, cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1142 (1994) (\u201cTo inquire into an alleged promise by the Bishop to keep a parish open or refrain from merging it with another parish was an impermissible intrusion into the Bishop\u2019s ecclesiastical authority\u201d). See also <em>Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for the U.S. &amp; Can. </em>v. <em>Milivojevich, </em>426 U.S. 696, 721 (1976) (\u201creorganization of the Diocese involves a matter of internal church government, an issue at the core of ecclesiastical affairs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">This is not to say that every property dispute between a church and its adherents is beyond the review of civil courts. \u201cThe State has an obvious and legitimate interest in the peaceful resolution of property disputes, and in providing a civil forum where the ownership of church property can be determined conclusively.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>443 U.S. 595, 602 (1979). But even in the property arena, we must proceed with caution, for the First Amendment also \u201ccircumscribes the role that civil courts may play in resolving church property disputes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Presbyterian Church in the U.S. </em>v. <em>Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial Presbyterian Church, </em>393 U.S. 440, 449 (1969). We have jurisdiction over church property disputes if and to the extent, and only to the extent, that they are capable of resolution under \u201cneutral principles of law\u201d \u2014 which the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>States Supreme Court has defined as \u201cwell-established concepts of trust and property law familiar to lawyers and judges.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wolf, supra </em>at 603. See <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, supra </em>at 786; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Albanian Orthodox Diocese in Am., Inc., </em>355 Mass. 278, 282 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The standards enunciated above clearly forbid our consideration of the religious obligations, if any, of a clergy member to his or her congregants, or of the \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d that may be engendered in congregants solely by virtue of the clergy\u2019s religious authority. We certainly must also stand apart from questions of canon law: we must avoid inquiry into whether the RCAB, Reverend Lord, or Reverend Vartzelis owed a fiduciary, confidential, or any other duty to discuss with the plaintiffs the nature of property ownership under canon law. We may not inquire into the ecclesiastical authority of Reverend Vartzelis and Reverend Lord to bind the RCAB by making oral promises about church property, to examine the actual status or disposition of church property under canon law, or to attempt to interpret any particular provision of canon law. As a matter of constitutional law, such disputes are beyond our authority. <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 72, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In this case, the RCAB did not raise the constitutional issue of jurisdiction. The judge in the Superior Court, however, properly noted the necessary restraint in analyzing the plaintiffs\u2019 ownership claims. For the purposes of this appeal, we shall presume jurisdiction strictly limited by the constitutional principles stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">3. <em>Standing. </em>As an initial matter, the judge rejected for lack of standing the Maffeis\u2019 claim that they gave the property to the RCAB in trust. He ruled that, because the Maffeis\u2019 interests in the alleged charitable trust were indistinguishable from those of other parishioners of St. James, only the Attorney General was authorized to prosecute claims to enforce the trust\u2019s provisions. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although it is not clear whether the judge\u2019s ruling on standing applied also to Hanafin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>on appeal the defendant urges that we also deny Hanafin standing to bring her claim. We shall accordingly address standing as to all of the plaintiffs. Although we agree with the judge that the standing of some of the plaintiffs is problematic, we do so for reasons different from those he articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Turning first to the judge\u2019s reasoning, it is clear that the plaintiffs have alleged individual stakes in this dispute that make them, and not the Attorney General, the parties to bring suit, assuming no other impediments to their standing to pursue this litigation. A \u201cgift to a church generally creates a public charity.\u201d <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>193 Mass. 551, 555 (1907). \u201c[I]t is the exclusive function of the Attorney General to correct abuses in the administration of a public charity by the institution of proper proceedings. It is his duty to see that the public interests are protected . . . or to decline so to proceed as those interests may require.\u201d <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Medford Community Ctr., Inc., </em>384 Mass. 163, 167 (1981), quoting <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>332 Mass. 246, 250-251 (1955). However, a plaintiff who asserts an individual interest in the charitable organization distinct from that of the general public has standing to pursue her individual claims. <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Medford Community Ctr., Inc., supra. </em>See <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>425 Mass. 270, 276 (1997) (standing arises from claim of \u201cpersonal right that directly affects the individual member\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are readily distinguishable from those of the general class of parishioner-beneficiaries. The Maffeis allege that they conditionally gifted their land to the RCAB and that they personally have an equitable reversionary interest in the property as a result of the actions of the RCAB. Hanafin claims that she lost substantial personal funds as the result of the RCAB\u2019s negligent misrepresentation to her. These claims are personal, specific, and exist apart from any broader community interest in keeping St. James open. See <em>id. </em>The plaintiffs have alleged personal rights that would, in the ordinary course, entitle them to standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">However, the issue of standing for the Maffei plaintiffs is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>clouded by the fact that they have brought suit as the sole trustees of the Waldo M. Maffei Revocable Trust (trust),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and as the trust\u2019s sole beneficiaries. But the real property they seek to recover is property that Waldo, in his individual capacity, voluntarily alienated from his estate in 1946, possibly before the trust was created, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>and almost sixty years before the trust proceeds became distributable to the trustees at Waldo\u2019s death in 2003.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The RCAB raises the issue of the trustees\u2019 standing only in passing, without citation. See, e.g., <em>Greater Media, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>415 Mass. 409, 418 (1993) (cursory argument not supported by meaningful authority does not rise to level of proper appellate argument). We address the merits of the trustees\u2019 argument because the RCAB has effectively waived any claim of standing, see <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Banerji, </em>447 Mass. 875, 887 n.20 (2006), because the Maffei plaintiffs raise substantial issues that may arise again, see <em>Knapp Shoes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., </em>418 Mass. 737, 738-739 n.1 (1994), and because Catherine\u2019s individual claims must in any event be adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">4. <em>Constructive trust. </em>A constructive trust is a flexible tool of equity designed to prevent unjust enrichment resulting from fraud, a violation of a fiduciary duty or confidential relationship, mistake, or \u201cother circumstances\u201d in which a recipient\u2019s acquisition of legal title to property amounts to unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, </em>416 Mass. 781, 789, cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1142 (1994). See <em>Nessralla </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>403 Mass. 757, 762-763 (1989); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>358 Mass. 154, 156 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>(1970) (listing circumstances giving rise to constructive trust). See generally 5 A.W. Scott &amp; W.F. Fratcher, Trusts \u00a7 462 (4th ed. 1989). A constructive trust may arise even if the parties did not intend to convey the real estate in trust. <em>Yamins </em>v. <em>Zeitz, </em>322 Mass. 268, 272 (1948). The Maffeis assert that they have established a prima facie claim to a constructive trust in their favor as to every theory under which a constructive trust may be imposed: fiduciary or confidential relationship, fraud, mutual mistake, and unconscionability and unjust enrichment. The judge rejected their claims, and for the reasons we explain below, his decision was sound. We begin first with the breach of duty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ANg\">a. <em>Constructive trust: breach of fiduciary duty </em>\u2014 <em>confidential relationship. </em>The court may impose a constructive trust where one acquires an interest in property in breach of a legal duty to one who has granted that interest. See <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, supra </em>at 789. The duty may be a fiduciary duty, but it need not be a fiduciary duty that is established as a matter of law, such as that of attorney to client or trustee and beneficiary. A fiduciary duty may arise from the circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>433 Mass. 323, 331-332 (2001) (plaintiff\u2019s affidavit raised sufficiently specific allegatians that would permit jury to find that \u201ca full relation of principal and broker\u201d arose between plaintiff client and defendant broker, giving rise to broker\u2019s fiduciary duties to client); <em>Warsofsky </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>326 Mass. 290, 293-294 (1950) (where loan applicant supplied confidential information to defendant banker, who \u201cimpliedly at least\u201d understood the terms on which applicant\u2019s information was given and undertook to comply with those terms, banker stood in relation toward applicant and could not use information for personal gain). A constructive trust may also be appropriate to remedy the breach of duty arising from a relationship of \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d that is not a fiduciary relationship established as a matter of law, such as a relationship in which one party confides confidential information to one who then uses that information for his own benefit and to the declarant\u2019s harm. See, e.g., <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>404 Mass. 160, 163 (1989) (fiduciary relationship between unmarried cohabitants where woman reasonably relied on defendant companion\u2019s promises to take care of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>and defendant knew of and accepted plaintiff\u2019s trust in him); <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Kosow, </em>349 Mass. 749, 757 (1965) (abuse of \u201cinfluence springing from that trust and confidence to obtain personal advantage\u201d at expense of another warrants imposition of constructive trust). The confidential relationship, however, must comprise more than \u201c[m]ere respect for the judgment of another or trust in his character . . . .\u201d <em>Meskell </em>v. <em>Meskell, </em>355 Mass. 148, 151 (1969), quoting <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>210 Mass. 581, 584 (1912). Moreover, a constructive trust \u201cis not imposed where a recipient has given value or had no notice of the violation of duty.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 544 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Here, the Maffeis assert that the RCAB, acting through its designated agent, Reverend Lord, owed them a fiduciary duty to apprise the family of the possibility of suppression and to draft a deed reflecting what they allege was the parties\u2019 understanding of their conditional transfer of interest in the property. Alternatively, the Maffeis argue that their relationship with Reverend Lord and the RCAB created a cognizable relationship of \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d breached by these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The fatal flaw in these arguments is evident in the Maffeis\u2019 contention that the RCAB\u2019s legal duties flow principally from the parties\u2019 shared religious affiliation. As they allege in their verified complaint, the Maffeis \u201creposed absolute trust and confidence in Reverend Lord, as he was the Pastor of a Catholic Church, and absolute trust in his promise that the land would forever be used as a Church .... Reverend Lord understood that the Maffeis trusted him, as he was a Priest and a Pastor of a Catholic Church.\u201d Or, as Catherine testified in her sworn statement when asked whether Reverend Lord\u2019s status as a priest had \u201cany effect on your believing him\u201d that the property would remain a church in honor of James: \u201cOf course. . . . Everything the priests said, we trusted him very dearly. We really did. So what Father Lord said, he was a gentleman and a wonderful priest, and we believed everything he said.\u201d Or, as the Maffeis assert in their brief on appeal: there \u201cmust\u201d be a relationship of trust and confidence between a diocese and the members of the faith it purports to serve; \u201cone\u2019s religion creates faith and trust that [the] Church is asking [for donations] in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>good faith.\u201dA ruling that a Roman Catholic priest, or a member of the clergy of any (or indeed every) religion, owes a fiduciary-confidential relationship to a parishioner that inheres in their shared faith and nothing more is impossible as a matter of law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such a conclusion would require a civil court to affirm ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tians of purely spiritual and doctrinal obligation. The ecclesiastical authority of the RCAB and Reverend Lord over the parishioners, the ecclesiastical authority of the RCAB over Reverend Lord, the state of canon law at the date of the property transfer, the knowledge of the canon law that might reasonably be attributed to the RCAB and Reverend Lord in 1946, the canonical obligation of Reverend Lord, if any, to inform parishioners of canonical law \u2014all of these inquiries bearing on resolution of the Maffeis\u2019 fiduciary claims would take us far afield of \u201cneutral principles of law.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>443 U.S. 595, 602 (1979). We decline to hold that, as a matter of civil law, the relationship of a member of the clergy to his or her congregants, without more, creates a fiduciary or confidential relationship grounded in their shared religious affiliation for which redress is available in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Nor, apart from the constitutionally impermissible grounds urged on us by the Maffeis, is there other evidence of a fiduciary or confidential relationship between the parties in the transaction for sale of the property. This is not a case where the RCAB or Reverend Lord allegedly undertook to manage property solely for the Maffeis\u2019 benefit or acted without their prior authorization, cf. <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>433 Mass. 323, 336-337 (2001), or used confidential information of the Maffeis to effect the sale. Cf. <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Kosow, </em>349 Mass. 749, 757 (1965). Nor can the clearly aspirational oral statement that the property would \u201cforever\u201d be a church in honor of James, without more, create an actionable duty breached by the church\u2019s closure. See <em>Meskell </em>v. <em>Meskell, </em>355 Mass. 148, 151 (1969). On the record before us, the breach of duty claim cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>b. <em>Constructive trust: fraud. </em>The Maffeis argue, in essence, that because Reverend Lord negotiated for the property from a position of superior knowledge of the canon law of suppression, his statement that the property would be used \u201cforever\u201d for a church honoring James Maffei was an actionable \u201cmisrepresentation of future facts\u201d that should be remedied by a reversion of the property to the Maffeis. The Maffeis\u2019 appeal to the authority of <em>Cellucci </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 722 (1974), <em>S.C., </em>368 Mass. 811 (1975), and <em>Gopen </em>v. <em>American Supply Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 342 (1980), to support their argument is unavailing. In the <em>Cellucci </em>case, the court ordered specific performance of an agreement to sell real estate where the agent of the defendant-purchaser made representations of fact and law designed to induce the plaintiff to refrain from negotiation with the defendant\u2019s competitor for sale of the property. Among the misstatements was that the purchase and sale agreement between the parties meant that the defendant had purchased the site. <em>Cellucci </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., supra </em>at 730-731. In the <em>Gopen </em>case, the defendant parent company was found liable to a commercial lessor for misstating its subsidiary\u2019s financial condition, thereby inducing the lessor to enter into a lease with the subsidiary. <em>Gopen </em>v. <em>American Supply Co., supra </em>at 345. In both cases cited, the actionable misrepresentation was \u201cmade by one possessed of superior knowledge to take advantage of the relative ignorance of another.\u201d <em>Cellucci </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., supra </em>at 731. See <em>Gopen </em>v. <em>American Supply Co., supra. </em>In both cases cited, the fraud occurred at the time the property was transferred. See <em>Pietrazak </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>341 Mass. 107, 109-110 (1960) (home builder\u2019s statement that \u201cthere would be no water in the cellar,\u201d although not made with intent to deceive, would support deceit action where statement was made as though with personal knowledge, was capable of being known by builder, and was material to plaintiffs\u2019 decision to buy house). In each case the statements were made with the clear knowledge that they were untrue or with the false implication that the speaker was speaking from personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Here, considering the Maffeis\u2019 claims under neutral principles of law, the record is devoid of any evidence of Reverend Lord or the RCAB\u2019s intent to mislead or to deceive the Maffeis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>There is no allegation that applicable canon law was confidential and not accessible to the plaintiffs. Moreover, the alleged oral promise of a church existing in perpetuity and in James\u2019s honor cannot fairly be characterized as a verifiable statement when made, and is thus materially different from, for example, a statement about corporate structure and signing authority, see, e.g., <em>Cellucci </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., supra, </em>or a statement about the financial condition of one\u2019s subsidiary, see, e.g., <em>Gopen </em>v. <em>American Supply Co., supra. </em>An action for deceit will not lie for statements that are \u201cmerely a matter of opinion, estimate, or judgment.\u201d <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>355 Mass. 117, 118 (1969), quoting <em>Chatham Furnace Co. </em>v. <em>Moffatt, </em>147 Mass. 403, 404 (1888). Finally, a \u201csubsequent refusal to carry out an oral promise, standing by itself, is not . . . fraud\u201d remediable by a constructive trust. J.R. Nolan &amp; L.J. Sartorio, Equitable Remedies \u00a7 351, at 496 (2d ed. 1993). Equity may not rest on such a slender reed. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">c. <em>Constructive trust: mutual mistake. </em>For the reasons advanced <em>supra, </em>we agree with the judge in the Superior Court that the Maffeis have \u201cno reasonable expectation\u201d of proving mutual mistake as to the parties\u2019 understanding of the legal status of the property sale.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> They have advanced no evidence beyond speculation to support the claim that Reverend Lord did not intend an outright purchase of the property for use according to the RCAB\u2019s needs.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>342 Mass. 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>(1961) (mutual mistake as to intention to divide property at State line remediable by constructive trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">d. <em>Constructive trust: unconscionability and unjust enrichment. </em>It is unsupportable for the Maffeis to contend that the RCAB purchased the property for an unconscionably low price of $1,500 per acre where they do not allege that the RCAB would have refused to pay them $3,000 each for their interest, as was paid to the other Maffei children. Had Waldo and his sister sold their interests as their siblings did, rather than making a gift of them, the RCAB may have had to pay more than the $2,000-$2,200 per acre alleged to be the going price for comparable land.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Where the record establishes that two of the Maffei siblings were willing to transfer voluntarily and that, partly as a result of their donated interests, the RCAB paid a low, but not unconscionable, price for the property; where the deed unambiguously granted the RCAB full legal and equitable interest in the property; and where the Maffeis have not shown a triable issue on their claims of fraud, breach of duty, or mutual mistake, they are not entitled to a constructive trust on generalized allegations of unconscionability or unjust enrichment. Cf. <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>346 Mass. 76, 79-80 (1963) (unjust enrichment found and constructive trust imposed by court where \u201cthe words used in the instrument of transfer resulted in a situation which was materially at variance with [the parties\u2019] common intention\u201d). The judge properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">5. <em>Resulting trust. </em>The judge also correctly found that the Maffeis failed to demonstrate a triable issue on their cause of action for a resulting trust. A resulting trust may be imposed to enforce a conditional gift. It typically occurs where \u201ca transfer of property is made to one person and the purchase price is paid by another; in such a case a trust results in favor of the person who furnished the consideration.\u201d <em>Meskell </em>v. <em>Meskell, </em>355 Mass. 148, 150 (1969). Unlike a constructive trust, a resulting trust pivots on the key element of intention. The party who furnishes consideration must not intend to do so as \u201ca gift or advance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ment\u201d to the one who takes legal title to the property. See <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, supra </em>at 789; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 663 (1992). See also 5 A.W. Scott &amp; W.F. Fratcher, Trusts \u00a7 462.1 (4th ed. 1989). Moreover, a \u201cresulting trust must arise, if at all, at the time of the execution of the deed.\u201d <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, supra, </em>quoting <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>275 Mass. 490, 494 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The Maffeis\u2019 case for a resulting trust is infirm in several respects. First, their contention that the property was given as a \u201cconditional gift\u201d is belied by the clear and unambiguous words of the deed, which the Maffeis do not claim they had no opportunity to read prior to signing before a notary. See <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, supra. </em>Second, they have not advanced any evidence that, at the time the deed was executed \u201cfor consideration paid,\u201d the parties intended anything other than a complete transfer of all legal and beneficial interest in the property from the Maffeis to the RCAB. Neither the verified complaint nor Catherine\u2019s sworn statement alleges that anyone told Reverend Lord that the family required, or even expected, the property to be deeded back to them if it were no longer used as a church. The judge did not err in granting summary judgment to the RCAB on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">6. <em>Breach of contract. </em>Summary judgment was appropriate on the Maffeis\u2019 breach of contract claim. We have noted the deed\u2019s completeness and lack of ambiguity. Moreover, the terms of the alleged oral contract were never reduced to writing and the Maffeis are thus barred from seeking to enforce the oral agreement by the Statute of Frauds. See <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>310 Mass. 774, 775 (1942) (oral contract for purchase of real estate cannot be enforced against party thereto unless party or party\u2019s agent has signed written memorandum reciting essential terms with reasonable certainty); G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The Maffeis nevertheless argue that the RCAB is estopped from asserting the Statute of Frauds based on \u201cfacts . . . similar\u201d to those of <em>Cellucci </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 722 (1974), <em>S.C., </em>368 Mass. 811 (1975).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We disagree. It is sufficient to note that the RCAB is shown to have paid a fairly negotiated price for the property and that the record is devoid of any evidence that the parties agreed that the property would revert to the Maffeis if it were no longer the site of a church. Estoppel is not warranted. The RCAB was entitled to summary judgment on the contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">7. <em>The Maffeis\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim. A </em>defendant is liable for negligent misrepresentation if \u201cin the course of his business . . . [he] supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions\u201d on which the others justifiably rely, \u2018if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fox v. F &amp; J Gattozzi Corp., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 581, 587 (1996), quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552(1) (1977). The Maffeis\u2019 action for negligent misrepresentation rests on allegations that the RCAB failed to exercise reasonable care by not informing the Maffeis about the possibility of suppression, and that the RCAB was negligent in preparing a deed that did not reflect the actual terms of the parties\u2019 agreement that the property would revert to the Maffeis if it no longer held a church. The First Amendment, as we have discussed, prohibits us from addressing the first averment; the lack of any evidentiary support in the record, as we have also discussed, dooms the second allegation. The judge did not err in granting summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">8. <em>Hanafin\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim. </em>Hanafin claims that the RCAB acted negligently in failing to inform Reverend Vartzelis of its plans to close St. James when it knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>he would be soliciting funds in 2002 to sustain the church \u201cnow and for the future.\u201d The claim cannot be sustained. First, as the judge noted, there is no evidence that Reverend Vartzelis used Hanafin\u2019s donation for anything other than his stated purpose: to refurbish St. James. Second, Hanafin has not shown that Reverend Vartzelis failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in using the phrase \u201cfor the future\u201d in soliciting funds. See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>F &amp; J Gattozzi Corp., supra. </em>Indeed, Reverend Vartzelis solicited funds to refurbish St. James in 2002. As to the RCAB, it was not until January, 2004, that the Wellesley-Weston \u201ccluster\u201d recommended closing St. James, and not until October, 2004, that St. James was suppressed. There is, in short, no evidence that, in June, 2002, Reverend Vartzelis knew that the St. James would be suppressed two years later after a lengthy review process, although he and, presumably, Hanafin were aware of rumors about St. James\u2019s closure as early as 1999. Hanafin\u2019s negligence action was properly dismissed on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u201cSuppression\u201d is a term of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law, which means to end the existence of a parish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The record does not disclose when the trust was created, although, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>it is undisputed that the trust is not a party to the property dispute at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states, in relevant part, that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the members of St. Jeremiah Parish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and others, and the Council of Parishes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">James Maffei, an Italian immigrant, established a successful sand and gravel business and owned several tracts of land in Wellesley and the surrounding area.

A letter from Reverend Lord to his superiors introduced in evidence by the Maffeis referred to \u201cprotracted negotiations\u201d with the Maffei family. Catherine, in her sworn statement, testified that Reverend Lord \u201ccame back [to her home] several times\u201d to talk about the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The verified complaint and Catherine\u2019s sworn statement are often at odds on key factual representations. According to Catherine\u2019s sworn statement, it was Waldo who first raised the issue of naming the church after his father; after Reverend Lord told Waldo that he had made inquiries of his superiors and determined that this was possible, Waldo said that the deal could be finalized if the RCAB were willing to give his brothers \u201csome little thing,\u201d such as \u201c$3,000 apiece\u201d to transfer their respective interests. The verified complaint alleges that Reverend Lord is the person who broached the idea of naming the church for James Maffei (James), and that Waldo\u2019s brothers asked to be paid $3,000 each for their interests in the property. The judge\u2019s findings follow the version of events set out in the verified complaint rather than Catherine\u2019s relatively more spontaneous sworn statement, and we discern no abuse of discretion in his choosing between the plaintiffs\u2019 own conflicting facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Reverend Lord died in 1954, and Waldo died on January 13, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The Maffeis submitted the affidavit of an expert in canon law, that Canon 515, \u00a7 2, of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law governs suppression of a parish.

He is neither to erect, suppress, nor alter notably parishes, unless he has heard the presbyteral council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">In their verified complaint, the plaintiffs state their \u201cbelie[f]\u201d that the suppression provisions of canon law in effect in 1946, when the deed to the property was transferred, were similar to those promulgated by Pope John Paul II. Although the RCAB denies the allegation of similarity in its answer, it does not contest the fact of suppression under prevailing canon law. Whether the 1983 code or any other code of canon law authorizes suppression of a parish is not relevant to our resolution of the claims in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Maffeis alleged that similar property sold for $2,000 to $2,200 per acre at the time. This estimate is consistent with the statements of Reverend Lord to his superior in a letter dated September 16, 1946, in which, among other things, Reverend Lord states that similar land \u201cusually sells at around $2,000 an acre. For a tract just across the street from the one I want (and inferior to it) the owner demands $2,400 an acre. The Town of Wellesley recently paid $2,200 for one acre of land adjacent to the tract I am bargaining for.\u201d Reverend Lord also stated in the letter that, according to a member of the planning board of Wellesley whom he consulted, \u201c$12,000 is really a very cheap price for the Maffei land.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"Ak\">Although the verified complaint states that counsel hired by the RCAB prepared the deed and that the Maffei family was not represented by counsel when they sold the property, Catherine in her sworn statement states that one of the Maffeis\u2019 neighbors, who was an attorney, prepared the deed at their request (\u201cwe got ahold of [the attorney], and she put everything together\u201d) and was present when the deed was executed.

Sartorio, Equitable Remedies \u00a7 351 (2d ed. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Maffeis are correct that Massachusetts courts have \u201cnot directly addressed the question of whether a pastor-communicant relationship is per se a confidential one when undue influence is alleged.\u201d See <em>Dovydenas </em>v. <em>The Bible Speaks, </em>869 F.2d 628, 641-642 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 816 (1989) (court need not decide whether under Massachusetts law confidential relationship between parishioner and communicant exists where other evidence of record establishes such relationship). They have not persuaded us to recognize such a relationship as a matter of law in all circumstances by citing decisions from other jurisdictions that they argue do so. One of these cases is not relevant to the circumstances of adult parishioners. See <em>Koenig </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>527 N.W.2d 903, 906 (S.D. 1995), overruled on other grounds by <em>Stratmeyer </em>v. <em>Stratmeyer, </em>567 N.W.2d 220 (S.D. 1997) (relationship between altar boy and diocese and its members one of trust and confidence because defendant clerics \u201cwere not only acting as members of the church, they were also acting as agents or representatives of God,\u201d and plaintiff altar boy was taught to \u201ctrust and respect\u201d them). The other cases on which they rely concern circumstances of repeated, affirmative false statements by clergy to the plaintiff that would constitute fraud apart from any religious affinity between the parties. The cases cited provide scant support for the premise that a member of the clergy is obligated as a matter of law to inform a parishioner about a matter of canon law that may have some future operation on the estate granted. See <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>O\u2019Carroll, </em>162 Md. 431, 435 (1932) (plaintiff, who was extremely depressed and nervous, \u201cbecame easily subject to the undue and dominating influence\u201d of cleric who repeatedly and with fraudulent statements importuned her to turn over her property); <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>Pironi, </em>48 N.J. Eq. 607, 610 (1891) (transfer of land to priest by \u201cignorant, eccentric, and entirely illiterate\u201d elderly woman); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Divine, </em>173 Misc. 1029, 1030 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.), aff'd, 260 A.D. 443, 445 (N.Y. 1940) (spiritual advisor who falsely represented that he would deposit plaintiff\u2019s money in his \u201cHeavenly Treasure\u201d and return it to her on demand holds funds as constructive trustee); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>76 R.I. 1, 12 (1949) (cult-like religious figure who exercised near-total dominance over congregants and effected \u201ccomplete surrender\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s will abused confidential relationship with plaintiff-parishioner who turned over substantial property to cleric).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Maffeis correctly state that these decisions contain statements that one who acts in the capacity of \u201cspiritual ascendancy\u201d over a donor has a confidential relationship to the donor that requires the spiritual advisor to justify any gift made to him or her by the donor. See, e.g., <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>O\u2019Carroll, supra </em>at 444 (\u201crelation of spiritual adviser and a member of his congregation is generally regarded as of a confidential nature\u201d); <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>Pironi, supra </em>at 609 (\u201cspiritual ascendancy\u201d of Roman Catholic priest over Roman Catholic layperson \u201cin a legal point of view is deemed confidential\u201d); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Divine, supra </em>(proof that defendant religious leader was \u201cspiritual adviser\u201d to plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>places on defendant burden of justifying acceptance and use of plaintiff\u2019s money and property); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Dodge, supra </em>at 12-14, citing <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>Pironi, supra </em>at 609 (equity will come to aid of one who has patted with property while under such influence, even absent showing of fraud or \u201cimposition\u201d). However, these decisions predate the United States Supreme Court\u2019s First Amendment jurisprudence as reflected in, for example, <em>Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for the U.S. &amp; Can. </em>v. <em>Milivojevich, </em>426 U.S. 696 (1976), and <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, </em>416 Mass. 781, cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1142 (1994), and we do not consider them weighty authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In light of what we have said concerning the First Amendment, we decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to take \u201cthe opportunity to outline the responsibilities of religious organizations to their members concerning the necessary information to provide their worshippers before accepting their contributions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The Maffeis argue that the judge erroneously shifted to them the burden on summary judgment of establishing Reverend Lord\u2019s knowledge or lack of knowledge of the canon law of suppression. We see no error, where the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning Reverend Lord\u2019s knowledge and state of mind were couched in highly speculative and conditional terms (\u201cIt is likely\u201d that Reverend Lord knew that the proposed church would be subject to suppression, and \u201c[i]f Reverend Lord did not understand that the provisions of Canon law\u201d authorized suppression, then parties transferred property based on mutual mistake).
