L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, reported by a single justice of this court. The Commonwealth challenges an order of a judge in the Superior Court requiring it to disclose to the defendant information concerning the relationship, if any, between an individual, Jane Doe,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and State or local police, as well as any promises, rewards, or inducements the Commonwealth may have provided to Doe. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douzanis, </em>384 Mass. 434, 436 n.5 (1981) (Commonwealth may seek discretionary relief from single justice of this court as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>to disclosure order). The defendant has given notice of his intent to pursue a defense of entrapment, claiming that Doe induced him through \u201cpersistent and repetitive\u201d requests to sell cocaine to an undercover State trooper, and that the information he seeks from the Commonwealth \u2014 whether Doe was acting as an agent of or at the direction of the government and whether the Commonwealth provided Doe with anything in exchange for her alleged assistance \u2014 is \u201ccritical\u201d to establishing his entrapment defense. The refusal to provide the information, he argues, interferes with his Federal and State constitutional rights to present a full defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s opposition rests largely on its asserted privilege not to disclose the identity of a confidential informant. We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s privilege may not shield information that is material to the defense of entrapment, as to which the defendant has made an adequate pretrial showing. We conclude that the judge was correct and remand the case to the county court for entry of a judgment denying the petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>In December, 2004, a Suffolk County grand jury returned four indictments charging the defendant with trafficking in cocaine, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b), </em>and one indictment charging conspiracy to violate the drug laws, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40. According to the Commonwealth,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant engaged in a series of illegal drug transactions with Trooper Mary Wakeham, acting undercover. Trooper Wakeham \u201ccalled the defendant at home\u201d to arrange for the initial purchase of one ounce of cocaine. She subsequently arranged to purchase cocaine from the defendant on four separate occasions between August and September, 2004, in amounts ranging from one ounce (for which she paid $1,100) to four ounces (for which she paid $4,800). According to the Commonwealth, on two of those occasions, the defendant himself conducted the exchange with Wakeham; on two other occasions, he sent a \u201crunner,\u201d Richard Dobbyn, to complete the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that it also expects to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>evidence that the defendant regularly engaged in the sale of cocaine. For example, according to the Commonwealth, following one sale to Trooper Wakeham in August, 2004, the defendant telephoned her to say that he had made a \u201cmistake\u201d by confusing two bags of cocaine and that the bag he sold to her, intended for someone else, was of a lower quality than he had meant to sell to Wakeham. The Commonwealth also points to anticipated evidence to the effect that, during an arranged transaction in September, 2004, the defendant and Dobbyn met Wakeham in a garage where the defendant stated that he had to leave to meet his \u201csupplier\u201d in Winthrop; that, on returning, the defendant showed the trooper a large \u201cchunk\u201d of cocaine, which she estimated to be at least 200 grams; and that the defendant had access to additional cocaine with which to reward Trooper Wakeham for the inconvenience she endured while the defendant went to his supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The defendant was arrested on the evening of October 4, 2004, after Trooper Wakeham picked him up in her automobile and completed a partial sale of two ounces of cocaine. According to the Commonwealth, on the same afternoon surveillance officers reported that they had seen the defendant engaging in conduct consistent with the sale of small quantities of drugs outside a Revere bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In January, 2006, the defendant filed notice of an entrapment defense, together with two discovery motions, one of which sought to discover \u201cany and all government agents, unwitting intermediaries or not, and informants who provided assistance or information\u201d that led to his arrest, as well as \u201call promises, considerations, rewards, benefits, or inducements made ... to induce or encourage the cooperation of any witness, agent, or informant or that individual\u2019s families or friends.\u201d According to the defendant, Doe, an acquaintance of his, had been \u201ccultivating\u201d him as a \u201cpotential seller\u201d to the undercover trooper for some time. The judge entered a conditional order requiring the defendant to provide an affidavit concerning his prior dealings with Doe, and obligating the Commonwealth, in response, to provide the requested discovery regarding Doe.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Thereafter, the defendant filed his affidavit, in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>claims that Doe had contacted him at home on more than one occasion, wanting to \u201cdo and to purchase drugs.\u201d He claims that, in the summer of 2004, Doe brought Trooper Wakeham to his house and introduced her to him as \u201cMary the bar manager.\u201d Doe, he said, was \u201cpersistent and repetitive\u201d in her requests that the defendant sell drugs to Trooper Wakeham. After reviewing the affidavit, the judge concluded that, \u201cin the circumstances of this case, the requested information, if it exists, may be considered exculpatory,\u201d and ordered the information produced,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in accordance with Mass. R. Crim. R 14 (a) (1) (A) (iii), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The Commonwealth moved for reconsideration. The judge allowed the motion only to the extent that she would conduct an inspection in camera of the Commonwealth\u2019s information in question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to the trial prosecutor\u2019s affidavit submitted for in camera review,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the judge ordered the Commonwealth to disclose to the defendant the contents of its submission. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The government\u2019s privilege not to disclose the identity of an informant has long been recognized in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Commonwealth. See, e.g., <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>109 Mass. 487, 488 (1872). The privilege \u201cserves a substantial, worthwhile purpose in assisting the police in obtaining evidence of criminal activity. The privilege, which is not absolute, should be respected as far as reasonably possible consistent with fairness to a defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douzanis, </em>384 Mass. 434, 441 (1981). See <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59 (1957) (purpose of privilege is to further and protect public interest in effective law enforcement by encouraging citizens to perform obligation of communicating knowledge of commission of crimes anonymously to law enforcement officials); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 408 (1989) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Competing with this privilege is the defendant\u2019s entitlement to exculpatory or other information that is material to his defense. See <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 60-61 (where \u201cthe disclosure of an informer\u2019s identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege <em>must </em>give way\u201d [emphasis added]). The cases that have required disclosure \u201chave all done so on a standard of materiality or something roughly akin thereto.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, </em>406 Mass. 565, 571 (1990).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to materiality, we have said that the \u201cproper inquiry\u201d concerns \u201cwhether disclosure would have provided material evidence needed by the defendant for a fair presentation of his case to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571-572, 574.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The Commonwealth argues that the defendant did not make an adequate showing that the requested information would be sufficiently material to his defense to justify invading its privilege on two grounds: that the defendant\u2019s affidavit is \u201cutterly lacking\u201d in specificity, and that the evidence will show that the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crimes for which he is charged. We disagree. For reasons we shall explain, the defendant has raised a potentially viable entrapment defense and has made a sufficient showing that the information he seeks from the Commonwealth regarding Doe is material to that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">\u201cThere are two elements of the entrapment defense: (1) that the defendant was induced by a government agent or one acting at his direction and (2) that the defendant lacked predisposition to engage in the criminal conduct of which he is accused.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 47 (1992). The defendant has the initial burden \u201cof producing some evidence of inducement by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts to the Commonwealth \u201cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) there was no government inducement <em>or </em>(2) the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteagudo, </em>427 Mass. 484, 487 (1998) (defendant\u2019s testimony, if believed, that trooper induced commission of crime raised issue of entrapment and Commonwealth then had burden to prove defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Our leading case on entrapment explains that the defense \u201cis appropriately raised ... by the introduction of some evidence of inducement by a government agent or one acting at his direction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 651-652 (1972). That case concerned whether a jury instruction on entrapment was warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>416 Mass. 528 (1993). Here the issue has arisen before the trial, but the showing of inducement the defendant is obliged to make is the same. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shuman, </em>391 Mass. 345, 352 (1984) (describing entrapment evidence proffered by defendant by pretrial motion to dismiss). The question, therefore, is whether the defense of entrapment here has been \u201cappropriately raised.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 651. \u201cThe threshold for a defendant to raise the entrapment issue is low . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, supra </em>at 536. \u201cThe inquiry is whether there is <em>any </em>evidence sufficient to raise the defense, even if the evidence is unsubstantial and even if the evidence comes solely from the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>546 F.2d 613, 615 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 958 (1977). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 846, 851 (2006) (threshold for showing evidence of inducement sufficient to entitle defendant to entrapment instruction is \u201clow threshold\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We conclude that the defendant has met the threshold of proffering \u201csome\u201d evidence of inducement by a government agent, even if \u201cunsubstantial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra. </em>In <em>Miller, </em>this court explained that \u201c[m]ere evidence of solicitation is not enough to show inducement, but little more than solicitation is required to raise the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652. The types of conduct that possess the indicia of inducement include \u201caggressive persuasion, coercive encouragement, lengthy negotiations, pleading or arguing with the defendant, <em>repeated or persistent solicitation, </em>persuasion, importuning, and playing on sympathy or other emotion\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, supra, </em>and cases cited. In his motion for discovery, the defendant claims that Doe \u201chad been cultivating the defendant as a potential seller to undercover trooper for some time,\u201d and in his supporting affidavit, he stated that she \u201cwas persistent and repetitive in her requests to sell . . . drugs to the undercover State Trooper even after the introduction.\u201d It would have been preferable had the defendant\u2019s affidavit provided more details of Doe\u2019s importuning that he sell cocaine to the undercover trooper, such as the number of occasions, and dates, on which he interacted with Doe concerning Trooper Wakeham, and his response to her cajoling. But the defendant\u2019s assertions that Doe \u201ccultivated\u201d him, and that she was not only \u201crepetitive\u201d but was \u201cpersistent\u201d in her efforts to get the defendant to sell cocaine to Trooper Wakeham, is sufficient in light of the \u201clow\u201d threshold to establish a potentially viable entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We therefore turn to consider whether the defendant\u2019s requested discovery is material to that defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 571. The defendant asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Doe was acting as an agent for, or at least at the direction of, the police.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The assertion, if true, has a direct relationship to his entrapment defense because entrapment focuses on \u201cevidence of inducement by a government agent <em>or one acting at his direc</em>tion\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracey, supra </em>at 537 n.10. The information, if it exists, is essential to establish his claim that the government induced him to commit the crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 305 (1992) (necessary for entrapment defense to establish inducer is government agent). The Commonwealth seeks to have the benefit of the informant\u2019s privilege while refusing to disclose whether Doe was in fact acting as a government agent. It may not do so. Failure to disclose information about the relationship, if any, between Doe and law enforcement or information as to any promises or inducements made to Doe by the government would defeat the defendant\u2019s ability to establish his defense of entrapment.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As this court recognized some decades ago: \u201cIt is the government that claims the \u2018privilege,\u2019 see <em>Scher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>305 U.S. 251, 254 (1938), which is confined to its purpose, and cannot in any event be asserted where it interferes with a fair defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>365 Mass. 534, 544 (1974).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The Commonwealth contends that a defense of entrapment is not viable in this case because it expects to prove at trial that Doe did not bring about the defendant\u2019s propensity to sell drugs. It points to anticipated evidence that the defendant was willing to make four separate sales of cocaine to Trooper Wakeham, was able to provide over $1,000 worth of cocaine within sixteen days of the first meeting with her, admitted to having a supplier and other customers, obtained a quantity of cocaine far larger than the amount ordered by Trooper Wakeham, and was seen making what appeared to be casual sales of drugs to others. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteagudo, supra </em>at 488 (evidence of supplier of cocaine, additional customers, and access to large quantities of cocaine sufficient for jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that defendant was predisposed to commit crimes at time of alleged inducement).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Whatever the strength of the evidence at trial, it is for the jury, not an appellate court before trial, to decide whether to credit the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 658-659 n.3 (\u201cWe agree with the great weight of authority that, for compelling reasons, including constitutional considerations, the entrapment issue should be heard and decided by the jury\u201d). At this stage of the proceedings, our concern is only with whether the defendant has satisfied his burden of producing \u201csome\u201d evidence of inducement. <em>Id. </em>at 651. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 314, 325 (1982) (\u201cIn the usual case, therefore, it is far more prudent for the judge to follow the traditional, and constitutionally sounder, course of waiting until all the evidence has been introduced at trial before ruling on its sufficiency to raise a proffered defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The public policy rationale supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s informant\u2019s privilege is generally stated as protecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>identity of an informant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 408 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douzanis, </em>384 Mass. 434, 441 (1981) (government\u2019s privilege serves purpose of assisting police in obtaining evidence of criminal activity). We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that, where the identity of a person suspected of being an informant or agent is known to the defendant, the privilege does not apply. While protecting the identity of informants plainly advances the important public policy interest of encouraging people to inform the police about criminal activity without fear of reprisal for doing so, see <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59 (1957), citing <em>Scher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>305 U.S. 251, 254 (1938), the inverse is equally true. Revealing to a defendant that a particular individual known to him is in fact acting as an informant for the police will tend to discourage people from cooperating with the police. Certainly such information may place at risk the safety of the individual, once she is revealed as an informant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>(protection of informer is factor to consider in disclosing identity). The Commonwealth is, of course, free to use as informants persons known to any defendant, as it has always done. It may not, however, withhold information concerning any informant where, as here, the information is material to the defense and potentially exculpatory. <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The case is remanded to the county court for entry of judgment denying the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for relief under G.

Nondisclosure of a source of information that bears on a preliminary question, such as the suppression of evidence, \u201cis more readily tolerated than the nondisclosure at trial of a source of evidence, where guilt or innocence is directly involved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>413 Mass. 521, 532 (1992). Although we are concerned here with the rulings of a judge made before trial, they implicate the same concerns that will arise at trial, namely, whether the defendant has a valid defense to the charges, i.e., his guilt or innocence. It is therefore appropriate to examine the defendant\u2019s claim under the standard of \u201cmateriality,\u201d as the Commonwealth argues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lugo, supra </em>at 574, the issue was whether disclosure of a so-called surveillance location would have provided material evidence needed by the defendant for a fair presentation of his case to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The facts of this case are analogous to those in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Choice, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1999), where undercover police officers asked an individual where they could buy drugs, and the individual led them to the defendant, who sold drugs to the officers and was arrested. The defendant sought to discover the name of the \u201cinformant\u201d to substantiate a defense challenging the credibility of the officers. In concluding that disclosure of the identity was required, the Appeals Court stated: \u201cIt was sufficient in this case that the Hispanic gentleman, whom the police did not regard as a confidential informant, was placed by the prosecution in a central role in this case. As such, he was also central to the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909. Similarly here, information about whether Doe was acting as a government agent, or whether she received inducements \u2014 inducements that may have influenced her actions \u2014 has direct bearing on the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The Commonwealth argues that this case is controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Youngworth, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 30, 33 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1064 (2003), where the Appeals Court concluded that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity was not required. That case does not concern an entrapment defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>402 Mass. 209, 215-216 n.5 (1988), the Commonwealth argues that the defendant has not shown that the discovery information is material to his defense because his supporting affidavit lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the necessary specificity. The <em>Ramos </em>case, however, concerned a denial of a motion for a hearing to challenge the veracity of statements made in an affidavit in support of a search warrant. This court concluded that the defendant\u2019s \u201cmere denial\u201d of the facts in the affidavit was not a \u201csufficiently rigorous\u201d preliminary showing to require a hearing on the motion under <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucente, </em>116 Ill. 2d 133, 152 (1987).
