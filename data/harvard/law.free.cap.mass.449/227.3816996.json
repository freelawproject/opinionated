Based on the statutory language, we conclude that the Legislature did intend to create such a privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The facts relevant to the present appeal are not in dispute. The defendant, Alberto Vega, was indicted on two counts each of incest, rape of a child with force, and indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, and on one count of assault with intent to rape a child. The charges were based on allegations that the defendant sexually assaulted his two younger sisters repeatedly for several years, while they were between nine and fourteen years of age. After reporting the sexual assaults, both complainants received counselling and medical services from numerous providers. At issue in this appeal are communications between the second complainant (the younger of the two sisters) and a licensed mental health counsellor from whom she received counselling. The Superior Court judge found, and the parties do not dispute, that the counsellor is an allied mental health professional (AMHP) as defined in G.L. c. 112, \u00a7 163.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\"><em>Procedural history. </em>Pursuant to the procedure outlined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996), the defendant moved to obtain access to the complainants\u2019 mental health treatment records, including records of the second complainant\u2019s communications with the AMHP.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the complainants. The GAL asserted a privilege on the complainants\u2019 behalf with respect to all counsel-ling records.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a hearing, the Superior Court judge con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>eluded that all of these records were privileged under various statutes, except for the records of communications with the AMHP. The judge reasoned that because G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 172, the statutory provision rendering communications with AMHPs confidential differed from other, similar provisions in its form, wording, and placement in the General Laws, it did not indicate a legislative intent to create a privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The Commonwealth filed a petition in the county court seeking relief from the trial court judge\u2019s order. After allowing the GAL\u2019s motion to join or intervene, a single justice of this court reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A party seeking extraordinary relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, must demonstrate both a substantial claim, of violation of substantive rights and error that cannot be remedied by ordinary appellate review. <em>Dunbrack </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 502, 504 (1986). Here, the issue of the existence of a privilege for AMHP communications is \u201ca matter of general significance to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>389 Mass. 275, 283 (1983). Furthermore, the error claimed by the Commonwealth is not remediable by any other means. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bing Sial Liang, </em>434 Mass. 131, 133 (2001). Thus, we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">b. <em>Relevant law. </em>We sketch the statutory scheme by which the Legislature has chosen to protect communications with certain mental health professionals from disclosure. The Legislature has created confidentiality rules and evidentiary privileges applicable to various mental health providers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Communications to licensed psychologists are rendered confidential pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 129A, and are privileged from testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>disclosure by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, communications between social workers and their clients are made confidential by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135A, and privileged by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B. Communications with sexual assault counsellors are deemed confidential pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, as are communications with domestic violence counsellors under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20K. Although neither of these latter two provisions contains the word \u201cprivilege,\u201d they nonetheless have been held to create an evidentiary privilege. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tripolone, </em>425 Mass. 487, 488-489 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 265 (1986). The question before us is whether the Legislature intended AMHPs, unlike all these other mental health providers, to be subject to a duty of confidentiality and yet not have their communications protected by an evidentiary privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">c. <em>The statute at issue. </em>Statutory interpretation is a question of law. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 719 (2002). As with any question of statutory interpretation, our starting point is the statutory text. <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 407, 415 (1984). General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 172, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cAny communication between an allied mental health or human services professional and a client shall be deemed to be confidential. <em>Said privilege </em>shall be subject to waiver only in the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201c(a) where the allied mental health and human services professional is a party defendant to a civil, criminal or disciplinary action arising from such practice in which case the waiver shall be limited to that action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>where the client is a defendant in a criminal proceeding and the use of the privilege would violate the defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process and right to present testimony and witnesses in his own behalf;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u201c(c) when the communication reveals the contemplation or commission of a crime or a harmful act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\"><em>\u201c(d) </em>where a client agrees to the waiver, or in circumstances where more than one person in a family is receiving therapy, where each such family member agrees to the waiver.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The plain text of the statute reflects a legislative intent to create an evidentiary privilege as well as a confidentiality rule. Most obviously, the statute specifically uses the term \u201cprivilege,\u201d referring to the confidentiality of communications with an AMHP as \u201c[s]aid privilege.\u201d Any reading of the statute that ignored the word \u201cprivilege\u201d would violate the canon that a statute \u201cbe construed \u2018so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., 427 </em>Mass. 136, 140 (1998). Furthermore, two of the four enumerated instances of \u201cwaiver\u201d in the statute relate specifically to legal proceedings, see G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 172 (a), <em>(b), </em>indicating that the protections of the provision apply when disclosure is sought to be compelled through legal process. This is the very definition of a privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The language of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 172, is even stronger than similar language that we construed as creating an evidentiary privilege in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>387 Mass. 424 (1982). That case involved a former version of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135, as amended through St. 1981, c. 91, \u00a7 1, which related to communications with social workers and provided, in part: \u201cNo social worker . . . may disclose any information he may have acquired from persons consulting him in his professional capacity except [under enumerated circumstances].\u201d Although this statute did not refer directly to an evidentiary privilege or even use the word \u201cprivilege,\u201d we held that its language created one. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, supra </em>at 427. The Legislature is presumed to be aware of the prior state of the law as explicated by the decisions of this court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 440-441 (2003). Thus, we presume that when G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 172, was enacted, several years after the <em>Collett </em>decision, see St. 1987, c. 521, \u00a7 2, the Legislature was aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>similar language in a cognate statute had been interpreted as creating a privilege.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">It is true, as the Superior Court judge noted, that for some mental health providers, the Legislature has chosen to enact separate confidentiality and privilege provisions. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 135A, 135B (social workers); G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 129A, and G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (psychologists and psychotherapists). Yet for other providers, a confidentiality rule and a privilege are created in the very same provision. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20J (sexual assault counsellors), 20K (domestic violence counsellors). Nor do we dwell on the fact that the AMHP provision is found in the professional requirements chapter of the General Laws, rather than the evidentiary section, given that the social worker privilege, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B, is found in that same chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">In short, the fact that the Legislature did not make the AMHP provision identical to some other statutory privileges does not make it any less of a privilege, in view of the Legislature\u2019s manifest intent to create one. The Legislature has created evidentiary privileges for different mental health providers using varying wording, form, and placement. Compare G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (provision in professional requirements chapter of General Laws explicitly using term \u201cprivilege\u201d), with G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20I<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (provision in evidentiary chapter not using word \u201cprivilege\u201d). The Legislature need not, at its peril, use the exact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>same formula for each statutory provision in order to achieve a particular result. Rather, where the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting a statute is clear, \u201cthe statute, if reasonably possible, must be construed to carry out that intent.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 32, 36 (1949). Furthermore, a court does not interpret a statute so as to produce an illogical result. See <em>ROPT Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. 601, 603 (2000). There is no indication that the Legislature intended to make communications with AMHPs subject to court-ordered disclosure when communications with other mental health professionals, who may well be providing similar services to the same clients, are protected from such disclosure.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The statute at issue here bears no resemblance to statutory provisions that we have found to confer confidentiality without a corresponding privilege. For instance, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Senior, </em>433 Mass. 453, 457 n.5 (2001), we noted that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70, governing hospital records, expresses a \u201cpolicy favoring the confidentiality of medical records,\u201d but does not create a general physician-patient privilege. However, in that provision, unlike the statute at issue here, not only is the word \u201cprivilege\u201d nowhere to be found, the statute expressly negates the existence of a privilege by stating that confidential hospital records may, \u201cupon proper judicial order, whether in connection with pending judicial proceedings or otherwise ... be inspected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recognize that privileges are to be construed narrowly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>438 Mass. 325, 330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>(2002). Here, however, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the Legislature\u2019s intention to create a privilege in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 172, appears plain from the statutory text. The fact that the Legislature knew how to provide expressly for confidentiality without privilege, but did not do so, only reinforces this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The GAL, as intervener, urges a broader ground in support of our decision today: that the mental health records at issue are constitutionally protected, irrespective of any statutory privilege. However, we generally decline to reach constitutional questions where, as here, there is a readily available statutory ground that renders such a decision unnecessary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>374 Mass. 744, 749 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 172, creates an evidentiary privilege encompassing communications with AMHPs. The case is remanded to the county court for entry of an appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-18\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 172, provides that \u201c[a]ny communication between an allied mental health or human services professional and a client shall be deemed to be confidential.

L. c. 112, \u00a7 163.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The outcome of this case is not affected by our recent revision of the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocol in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122 (2006). The <em>Dwyer </em>decision changed only the procedure for seeking access to privileged records, not the substantive law of evidentiary privilege. That revised protocol will govern subsequent proceedings in this case on remand. See <em>id. </em>at 124 <em>(Dwyer </em>protocol applies \u201cto all criminal cases tried after the issuance of the rescript in this case\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The GAL did not assert a privilege as to the records of one complainant\u2019s visit to a school nurse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Although the defendant argued before the single justice that relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, was not available to the Commonwealth in this case, he does not raise this argument before the full court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Confidentiality rules impose a duty of nondisclosure \u201cin all circumstances,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brandwein, 435 Mass. 623, 628 n.7 (2002), while evidentiary privileges are specifically applicable to legal proceedings, see <em>id. </em>at 628-629. See also 1 D.M. Greenwald, E.F. Malone &amp; R.R. Stauffer, Testimonial Privileges \u00a7 7.32 (3d ed. 2005) (\u201cConfidentiality laws regulate both testimonial and nontestimonial disclosures . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Because the statutory definition of \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d includes providers other than licensed psychologists, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, the psychologist confidentiality rule and the psychotherapist privilege are not strictly coextensive. The discrepancy is not material to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b254-27\">It is of little relevance that the Legislature chose, some time later, to outline a social worker evidentiary privilege in a separate provision, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135B, despite the fact that G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135, was already recognized as creating such a privilege in <em>Collett. </em>See St. 1989, c. 535, \u00a7 <em>1. </em>The Legislature often adopts subsequent enactments simply to clarify the law. See <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 103 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b254-32\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 135B, provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, in any court proceeding and in any proceeding preliminary thereto and in legislative and administrative proceedings, a client shall have the privilege of refusing to disclose and of preventing a witness from disclosing, any communication, wherever made, between said client and a social worker . . . relative to the diagnosis or treatment of the client's mental or emotional condition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b254-33\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20J, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-34\">\u201cA sexual assault counsellor shall not disclose such confidential communication, without the prior written consent of the victim ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Such confidential communications shall not be subject to discovery and shall be inadmissible in any criminal or civil proceeding without the prior written consent of the victim to whom the report, record, working paper or memorandum relates.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In this case, for instance, the complainants received services from numerous mental health professionals, and might not even have been aware of the different occupational titles of different providers, let alone the possibility of a significant distinction in the legal protection of communications made to them.
