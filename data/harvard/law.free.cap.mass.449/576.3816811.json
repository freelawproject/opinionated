L. c. 123A, asserting that he was interviewed by a qualified examiner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of his right to counsel. The defendant also argues that the judge\u2019s findings that he was a sexually dangerous person constituted clear error, that the Commonwealth did not timely file the petition for trial, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. Because we hold that there is no right to counsel at an interview with a qualified examiner under G. L. c. 123A and find no error in the defendant\u2019s other claims, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\"><em>Background. </em>The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. On April 7, 1993, the defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of rape of a child and one count of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years. He was sentenced to three concurrent terms of from six to ten years in State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">On January 18, 2002, the Commonwealth filed a petition, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>to commit the defendant as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>a sexually dangerous person. A judge in the Superior Court found sufficient cause that the defendant was sexually dangerous, and issued an order for his temporary commitment to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center) pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (&lt;?). On July 3, 2002, after a hearing, a different judge in the Superior Court found probable cause to believe that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person and ordered him committed to the treatment center for examination and diagnosis by two qualified examiners. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">After the defendant was committed to the treatment center, his counsel informed the Commonwealth and the treatment center that he wished to be present at all examinations of the defendant. One qualified examiner interviewed the defendant on August 2, 2002, with the defendant\u2019s counsel present.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On August 7, 2002, a second qualified examiner, Barbara Quinones, appeared at the treatment center to interview the defendant. The defendant\u2019s counsel was not present. Quinones knew that counsel had asked to be present during any interview. She attempted to contact counsel, but was unable to reach him because he was on vacation. Quinones informed the defendant that he could have his lawyer present if he wished, proceed without his lawyer, or decline the interview. She told him that even if he declined the interview, she would prepare and file her report. The defendant agreed to go forward with the interview without his attorney present.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Quinones also administered warnings on the limits of confidentiality prior to examining the defendant, stating that (1) she was a qualified examiner appointed by the Commonwealth to conduct an evaluation whether the defendant met the criteria of a sexually dangerous person; (2) she would be preparing a report based on the interview; (3) the information the defendant provided would be included in the report and possibly in oral testimony to the court; (4) the content of the interview would not be kept confidential; and (5) the defendant did not have to answer the questions, did not need to participate in the interview at all, and could end the interview at any time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>365 Mass. 265, 269-270 (1974). She also asked the defendant to repeat the warning in his own words, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Both qualified examiners timely filed written reports that concluded that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person as defined by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. The Commonwealth filed a petition for trial on August 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">A jury-waived trial took place in October, 2003. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge issued oral findings of fact and rulings of law, concluding that the Commonwealth had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Right to counsel. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to exclude Quinones\u2019s report and testimony based on a claimed violation of his right to counsel. The motion was granted, and the Commonwealth sought relief under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118. A single justice of the Appeals Court vacated the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">At trial, Quinones testified about her interview with the defendant and her written report was admitted in evidence. The defendant claims that her testimony and report should have been excluded because she interviewed him in violation of his right to assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. There is no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The Sixth Amendment and art. 12 provide a right to counsel at every \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>427 Mass. 169, 174 (1998). We need not address whether the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies to every aspect of the proceedings under G. L. c. 123A,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because even if it does, here, as in criminal proceedings, only the decision to undergo a psychiatric evaluation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and not the interview itself, is a critical stage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>423 Mass. 356, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>359, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, supra </em>(postconviction probationary evaluation not critical stage entitling defendant to protection under Sixth Amendment or art. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Even though a psychiatric interview is not considered a critical stage in criminal proceedings, the defendant argues that the evaluation of the qualified examiner should be considered a critical stage in proceedings under G. L. c. 123A because \u201c[e]yen more so than in the criminal responsibility context where it is the defendant who is voluntarily raising the mental health issue, in a civil commitment under G. L. c. 123A, it is the Commonwealth [that] raises the issue.\u201d We disagree. The \u201ccritical stage\u201d test is whether the accused finds himself \u201cconfronted, just as at trial, by the procedural system, or by his expert adversary, or by both.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>740 F.2d 1104, 1117-1118 (D.C. Cir. 1984), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>413 U.S. 300, 310 (1973). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, supra </em>(adopting holding in <em>Byers </em>case). In order to constitute a critical stage, the accused must require assistance in \u201ccoping with legal problems or assistance in meeting his adversary,\u201d and the Sixth Amendment does not apply where there is no possibility \u201cthat the accused might be misled by his lack of familiarity with the law or overpowered by his professional adversary.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Byers, supra </em>at 1118, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ash, supra </em>at 313, 317. In an interview with a qualified examiner under G. L. c. 123A, a committed person is \u201cnot confronted by the procedural system; he ha[s] no decisions in the nature of legal strategy or tactics to make.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Byers, supra. </em>A qualified examiner is not a representative of the Commonwealth requiring a defendant to \u201cdefend himself against [a] direct onslaught of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>447 Mass. 313, 314 n.2 (2006) (\u201cThe qualified examiners mentioned in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 [a], are independent experts appointed by the court\u201d); note 1, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In addition to claiming a constitutional right to counsel at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>interview with a qualified examiner, the defendant asserts that he had a statutory right to counsel under G. L. c. 123A. We reject this argument. Although the plain language of G. L. c. 123A provides a right to counsel to individuals who the Commonwealth seeks to commit,* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it does not expressly provide for a right to counsel at the interviews with the qualified examiners. The provision governing the qualified examiners\u2019 evaluations specifies certain protections for this process, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (c) (\u201cAll written documentation submitted to the two qualified examiners shall also be provided to counsel for the person named in the petition and to the district attorney and attorney general\u201d), but does not provide for counsel to be present at the interviews with the qualified examiners. \u201cWe will not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there, either by inadvertent omission or by design.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poissant, </em>443 Mass. 558, 563 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 443 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Moreover, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 123A in 1999, see St. 1999, c. 74, after this court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, supra, </em>and the Legislature did not add a right to have counsel present at the interviews with the qualified examiners. Thus, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to provide committed persons the right to counsel at the interviews with the qualified examiners. See <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 366 (2005) (Legislature presumed to be aware of this court\u2019s decisions at time it amends statute); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, supra </em>at 440-441 (same).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>right to counsel when he was making the decision whether to undergo the examination by the qualified examiner. See <em>Vuthy Seng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>445 Mass. 536, 548 (2005), quoting <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 471 (1981) (right to counsel includes assistance of attorney \u201cin making the significant decision of whether to submit to the [psychiatric] evaluation and to what end the psychiatrist\u2019s findings could be employed\u201d). Even assuming that the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment or art. 12 applies to provide the defendant with the right to consult with counsel when deciding whether to undergo the interviews with the qualified examiners, no violation of such a right is presented by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We begin by noting that the defendant has submitted no affidavit<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or other evidence demonstrating that he did not have access to his attorney in the period leading up to the interviews with the qualified examiners or that he asked Quinones to reschedule the interview so that he could consult with his attorney.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor does he contest Quinones\u2019s assertions that she told him about the option of rescheduling and administered <em>Lamb </em>warnings, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>365 Mass. 265,269-270 (1974), and that he chose to undergo the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">There is no question that counsel was appointed for the defendant before the defendant had to make a decision whether to undergo the evaluations. The fact that the defendant participated in an evaluation with the first qualified examiner five days before Quinones\u2019s appearance at the treatment center undercuts his argument that he was denied assistance of counsel in deciding whether to undergo the evaluations. See <em>Vuthy Seng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 549 (\u201cthe defendant makes no claim that his counsel was unable to advise him regarding the first court-ordered competency examination. The consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the second examination will be no different\u201d). Moreover, it is clear that the defendant\u2019s attorney knew that the defendant was committed pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, which contains clear guidelines as to the role of the qualified examiners\u2019 reports in the commitment proceedings. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14. Cf. <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 470-471 (\u201cDefense counsel . . . were not notified in advance that the psychiatric examination would encompass the issue of their client\u2019s future dangerousness, and defendant was denied the assistance of his attorneys in making the significant decision of whether to submit to the examination and to what end the psychiatrist\u2019s findings could be employed\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contos, </em>435 Mass. 19, 25 (2001) (\u201c[T]here was no misconduct in the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to notify counsel [of the examination] because counsel was aware of the order for the examination and the purpose of the examination. Defense counsel was on notice that an examination would occur imminently because of the upcoming trial . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">2. <em>Judge\u2019s findings. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge\u2019s finding that he is a sexually dangerous person is clearly erroneous. Specifically, he argues that although there was evidence from which the trial judge could have made findings that the defendant suffered from pedophilia as defined in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 2000) (DSM-IV), the judge did not make findings that his pedophilia constituted a statutory mental abnormality. The judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Weighing and crediting the testimony of witnesses during proceedings under G. L. c. 123A \u201care for the trier of fact, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradway, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 291 (2004), quoting <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 156, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996). Under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, the definition of a sexually dangerous person includes any person who has been \u201cconvicted of ... a sexual offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] or personality disorder which makes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">At trial, there was testimony detailing the sexual offenses that the defendant committed against two of his female relatives, one in 1985 and one in 1992. Each was eight years old at the time of the offense against her. In addition, the two qualified examiners testified for the Commonwealth. Both diagnosed the defendant with pedophilia<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a personality disorder not otherwise specified, with antisocial traits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They testified that the defendant\u2019s diagnosis met the statutory criteria under G. L. c. 123A. Experts for the defendant testified that he was not a sexually dangerous person under G. L. c. 123A.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the judge made findings based on the evidence presented at trial. Specifically, she found that the defendant had \u201cthe mental abnormality of being a pedophile,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which had not been treated. She noted that all of the experts agreed that pedophilia is a chronic condition, and that the defendant fit the criteria for that condition pursuant to the DSM-IV. Although the judge did not find that the defendant suffered from a personality disorder, she concluded that the finding of pedophilia was sufficient to cause him to be likely to reoffend. Based on these findings, as well as the defendant\u2019s conviction of two or more sexual offenses, the judge concluded that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person who, if not confined, would be likely to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">3. <em>Timeliness of filing of trial petition. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the trial petition because it had not been filed within the statutory time period. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a). </em>The motion was denied. On appeal, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>fendant argues that because the trial petition was filed before the qualified examiners\u2019 reports were docketed, it should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>provides that the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial \u201cshall be made within 14 days of the filing of the report of the two qualified examiners.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>447 Mass. 691, 698 (2006), we held that the term \u201cwithin\u201d in the context of this provision means that \u201cthe petition for trial must be filed within fourteen days of and <em>after </em>the filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 reports.\u201d Here, the qualified examiners\u2019 reports were not docketed until August 16, 2003, which was one day after the trial petition was received by the court. However, the record indicates that the Commonwealth was proceeding based on the completion of the qualified examiners\u2019 reports. In these narrow circumstances, we conclude that dismissal was not warranted. We emphasize that the statute contemplates receipt of the reports of the qualified examiners followed by a decision to go forward by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, supra, </em>where the Commonwealth never filed a petition for trial, but claimed that the initial commitment petition filed pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>satisfied the \u00a7 14 (a) trial petition requirement, <em>id. </em>at 692, 697, here the Commonwealth did file a \u00a7 14 <em>(a) </em>trial petition that stated that the qualified examiners had already submitted their evaluations to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">4. <em>Ineffective assistance. </em>The defendant contends that trial counsel\u2019s advice not to testify at trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We need not decide whether the <em>Saferian </em>standard applies to proceedings under G. L. c. 123A because for purposes of this appeal the Commonwealth agrees that it does, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>109, 115 (2006) (reviewing claim of ineffective assistance under G. L. c. 123A according to <em>Saferian </em>standard), and because in applying this standard we conclude that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra, </em>the defendant must demonstrate that there \u201chas been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and if that is found, the defendant must show that such behavior \u201chas likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d An attorney\u2019s decision \u201cnot to call the defendant will not be gainsaid absent a showing that the defendant\u2019s own testimony would have materially assisted the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>434 Mass. 307, 318 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The defendant claims that if he had testified, he would have sought to introduce his relapse prevention plan, a transition plan, the GED he obtained in prison, and certificates showing that he took various college and prison courses. However, he acknowledges that these items were referred to in trial testimony. They were also discussed in documents that were introduced in evidence. He does not point to any advantage that he would have obtained from testifying to this himself rather than from eliciting it from other witnesses. The defendant has not demonstrated that his testimony would have materially assisted the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-11\">A qualified examiner is defined under G.

Generally, such claims require fact finding and are best brought in a motion for a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 115 (2006). Here, however, we can resolve the defendant\u2019s claim based on the trial record. See <em>id. </em>(\u201cwe will hear a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal when the factual basis of the claim appears indisputable, as here, on the trial record, and the issues do not implicate any factual questions more appropriately resolved by the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
