The penal portion of her sentences committed her to concurrent terms of from three to five years to the \u201c[Massachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI)] Cedar Junction to serve at MCI Framingham.\u201d General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 28A, limits the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to \u201cthe review of sentences to the state prison imposed by final judgments in criminal cases\u201d and to \u201cthe review of sentences to the reformatory for women for terms of more than five years imposed by final judgments in criminal cases.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues that her penal sentences, which (as we explain <em>infra) </em>were revised to her detriment by the Appellate Division, were \u201cillegal\u201d because her original sentence was not \u201cto the state prison,\u201d nor was it for a term of \u201cmore than five years,\u201d and could not, therefore, be reviewed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We conclude that the Appellate Division had jurisdiction to review the sentences at issue, both under the express terms of the defendant\u2019s original sentence and pursuant to G. L. c. 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>\u00a7 28A, as construed in light of the 1994 sentencing reform amendments. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On November 7, 2000, the defendant waived her right to a jury trial in the Superior Court and pleaded guilty to ten counts of forgery, G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1; three counts of larceny over $250, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30; and three counts of identity fraud, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37E. A judge in the Superior Court sentenced the defendant on all three larceny convictions \u201cto MCI Cedar Junction to serve at MCI Framingham\u201d for a single term not exceeding five years or less than three years. On the forgery and identity theft convictions, the judge sentenced the defendant to sentences to be served concurrently with the larceny convictions. The judge also sentenced the defendant to five years\u2019 probation on the larceny convictions, from and after the completion of the larceny sentence, and five years\u2019 probation on the forgery and identity theft charges, to run concurrently with the term of probation on the larceny convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A. On May 23, 2001, the Appellate Division entered an order, amending her sentences, the effect of which was to increase the defendant\u2019s over-all sentences by imposing concurrent sentences of from three to five years on the second and third larceny convictions to be served from and after the sentence imposed on the defendant for the first larceny conviction. The Appellate Division otherwise affirmed the sentences and dismissed the appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Gavin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>367 Mass. 331, 333-334 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Four years later, in September, 2005, the defendant filed a motion in the Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (a), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> claiming that the Appellate Division of the Superior Court had no jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>hear her appeal from the sentences, and that the amended sentences imposed by the Appellate Division were therefore \u201cillegal.\u201d The defendant argued that G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, grants jurisdiction to the Appellate Division to review sentences only of more than five years to the \u201creformatory for women.\u201d Because her sentence was, in effect, she argued, to the \u201creformatory for women,\u201d* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and did not exceed five years, it was not reviewable by the Appellate Division.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The motion judge, who was also the plea judge, denied the defendant\u2019s motion, as well as her motion for reconsideration. The defendant appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>As a preliminary matter, the Commonwealth claims that the Superior Court judge was correct to deny the defendant\u2019s motion under rule 30 (a) because he had no authority to determine the jurisdictional limits of the Appellate Division. The Commonwealth points out that the Appellate Division is a \u201chigher-level tribunal\u201d than the Superior Court, consists of a panel of three judges, and has, as its name implies, appellate jurisdiction to review the sentencing actions of the trial court. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28B. Accordingly, the jurisdictional limits of the Appellate Division can be challenged, the Commonwealth argues, only by an appeal to the Appeals Court or by a petition to this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The point has some merit. However, where G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, has no provision concerning appellate review of a decision of the Appellate Division,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we have the authority to resolve the defendant\u2019s claim pursuant to our power of general superinten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>dence of the courts, G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>406 Mass. 21, 24 n.2 (1989) (declining to address propriety of reporting questions to Appeals Court regarding issues in G. L. c. 209A proceeding, but concluding court had authority to address merits pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3). In light of the importance of the issues involved, which have been fully briefed, we proceed to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Turning first to the defendant\u2019s own sentence to \u201cMCI Cedar Junction to serve at MCI Framingham,\u201d this constitutes a \u201cstate prison\u201d sentence by its own terms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The term \u201cstate prison\u201d is defined by the Legislature as \u201cMassachusetts Correctional Institution, Cedar Junction.\u201d G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 <em>(o). </em>That correctional institution houses men only. In light of the Legislature\u2019s elimination of gender-based distinctions in sentencing, see St. 1993, c. 432 (note 1, <em>supra), </em>the fact that the denominated \u201cstate prison\u201d is a male-only facility can no longer support a conclusion that the term \u201csentences to the state prison,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, confines such sentences to men alone. Here, the felonies to which the defendant pleaded guilty and the length of the initial sentences imposed on her, concurrent sentences of from three to five years, give her sentence the character of a \u201cstate prison\u201d sentence, not a sentence to a house of correction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (defendant found guilty of larceny shall, \u201cif the value of the property stolen exceeds two hundred and fifty dollars, be punished by imprisonment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>the state prison for not more than five years, or by a fine of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars and imprisonment in jail for not more than two years\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The clause \u201cto serve at MCI Framingham\u201d merely denotes where the defendant is to be housed to carry out her \u201cstate prison\u201d sentence. Pursuant to G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 16, as amended through St. 1972, c. 777, \u00a7 10, all women sentenced to incarceration \u201cshall be committed to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham, or to other such correctional facility or facilities as the commissioner may from time to time designate as appropriate for the purpose.\u201d A woman sentenced \u201cto MCI Cedar Junction,\u201d without an accompanying \u201cto serve at MCI Framing-ham\u201d clause would, by the express terms of G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 16, be committed to serve her sentence at MCI Framingham, or such other facility as is deemed \u201cappropriate\u201d by the Commissioner of Correction. The defendant\u2019s contention to the contrary notwithstanding, the \u201cto serve at MCI Framingham\u201d clause in her sentence is also consistent with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 19, which provides that the \u201csentence to imprisonment of a female convicted of a felony shall be <em>executed </em>in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham\u201d (emphasis added). In context, the terms to \u201cserve\u201d and to \u201cexecute[]\u201d are synonymous, in that both terms specify where the defendant is to serve her sentence. The defendant\u2019s sentence is a State prison sentence, and the review of her sentence was, therefore, plainly within the statutory jurisdiction of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We need not reach the defendant\u2019s alternative argument that the sentence of a woman directly to MCI Framingham can never constitute a sentence \u201cto the state prison\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, and that the appeal from any such sentence is governed by the limitations of the \u201creformatory for women\u201d clause in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A. We dispose of the matter briefly to eliminate any uncertainty in this regard. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 Mass. 611, 618 (2006); <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The defendant relies primarily on <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Mass. 525, 527 (1913), in which this court held that the \u201creformatory prison for women\u201d was not a \u201cbranch of the State prison, when the place of punishment of women convicted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>felony is under consideration.\u201d The distinction drawn in the <em>Moulton </em>case between felony sentences to the reformatory for women and felony sentences to the State prison was based on circumstances and legislative schemes that are no longer operative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The provision of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, that the defendant argues restricts the rights of women to appeal from their sentences, St. 1945 c. 255, \u00a7 1, is a historical artifact designed to address the disparate sentencing structure that once existed for men and women.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With the legislative reforms enacted in 1994, such a disparity no longer exists. See St. 1993, c. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Statutes that \u201crelate to a common subject matter \u2018should be construed together so as to constitute an harmonious whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417, 424 (2000), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975). Adopting the interpretation of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, urged by the defendant would restrict certain appeals by women, while allowing those of similarly situated men to proceed. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>is inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature, as evinced by the Legislature\u2019s comprehensive 1994 amendments that reformed the sentencing statutes to eliminate such disparities in the sentencing of men and women. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>More to the point, \u201cwhere a statute may be construed as either constitutional or unconstitutional, a construction will be adopted which avoids an unconstitutional interpretation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>351 Mass. 331, 334 (1966), quoting <em>Demetropolos </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>342 Mass. 658, 660 (1961). In light of the equal protection jurisprudence mandated by art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments, see e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 20-22 (1977), we cannot admit an interpretation of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, that, as the defendant would have it, authorizes men to appeal from a State prison sentence of any length, including one of less than five years, but denies the same right to women. While the portion of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, pertaining to appeals by women remains operative,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the statute can no longer be interpreted as restricting the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division to only cases where a woman appeals from a State prison sentence that is for a term of more than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We are cognizant there may be cases where a judge sentences a woman to \u201cMCI Framingham\u201d without indicating, as the judge did in this case, whether she is sentenced \u201cto MCI Cedar Junction\u201d or whether the sentence is a sentence to a \u201cstate prison.\u201d The right of a woman to appeal from her sentence to the Appellate Division should not turn on whether the sentencing order or mittimus includes either the phrase to \u201cMCI Cedar Junction\u201d or to a \u201cstate prison.\u201d <em>See Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982) (\u201cWe will not adopt a literal construction of a statute if the consequences of such construction are absurd or unreasonable\u201d). When the sentence of a woman is to \u201cMCI Framingham,\u201d without more, the determination whether a discretionary sentence<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is one to a \u201cstate prison,\u201d and therefore appealable pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28A, should rest on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>whether the facts necessary for conviction or the length of the sentence make it evident that the sentence is a \u201cstate prison\u201d sentence. Here, the sentencing judge appropriately indicated by his use of the term \u201cMCI Cedar Junction\u201d that the defendant\u2019s sentence was a \u201cstate prison\u201d sentence. The denial of the defendant\u2019s motion under Mass. R. Crirn. R 30 (a) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\">St. 1993, c. 432.
