L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issue arises on an appeal by the town of Middleborough and the board of appeals of Middleborough (board) (collectively, Middleborough) from a Superior Court judgment affirming a decision of the Housing Appeals Committee (committee) of the Department of Housing and Community Development. The defendant, Delphic Associates, LLC (Delphic), sought a comprehensive permit from the board, see G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, which the board denied. Delphic appealed to the committee, which directed the board to issue the permit. The committee determined, and a judge in the Superior Court affirmed, that project funding under the New England Fund qualified as a valid subsidy program under the act. In a thoughtful and detailed opinion, the Appeals Court affirmed, although its analysis of whether a financing commitment under the New England Fund constituted a \u201csubsidy\u201d dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>fered from that of the committee and the judge in the Superior Court. See <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 39 (2006). We granted Middleborough\u2019s petition for further appellate review limited to the question noted above.* ****<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The material facts are not in dispute. In order to place them in context we describe briefly the history of relevant portions of the act, which has been thoroughly canvassed in earlier opinions. See, e.g., <em>Dennis Housing Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 76-78 (2003); <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 347-354 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The act allows a public agency, nonprofit organization, or limited dividend organization interested in constructing low or moderate income housing to circumvent the often arduous process of applying to multiple local boards for individual permits and, instead, to apply to the local board of appeals for issuance of a single comprehensive permit. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. An applicant who is denied a comprehensive permit or is granted the permit under conditions that make the proposed development \u201cuneconomic,\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, may appeal to the committee for a de nova review of whether the board\u2019s decision was \u201creasonable and consistent with local needs.\u201d See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. If the committee finds that the local board\u2019s action does not meet these standards, it may order that the comprehensive permit issue. <em>Id. A </em>party aggrieved by a decision of the committee may appeal to the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>which will uphold the committee\u2019s determination if it is supported by substantial evidence, which is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 376. These steps were followed in this case, as we now describe.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">In March, 2000, Delphic applied to the board for a comprehensive permit to subdivide a four-acre parcel in the town of Middleborough into ten buildable lots. Three of the lots were to be reserved for affordable housing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Delphic informed the board that the project was eligible to receive funding through the New England Fund of the FHLBB. In that respect and pursuant to 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.01(2) (1993),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Delphic provided the board with a \u201cproject eligibility letter\u201d confirming that eligibility that it had obtained from the Norwood Cooperative Bank (Norwood Bank), a member of the FHLBB. The proposed financing described in the project eligibility letter was to be provided by the FHLBB to the Norwood Bank through the New England Fund. Norwood Bank, in turn, would provide a loan to Delphic at below-market interest rates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>After a public hearing, which lasted for some nine sessions, the board unanimously denied the permit, determining (among other things) that the parcel lacked adequate frontage and that it previously had been designated as one on which building could not take place. Delphic appealed from the denial of the permit to the committee. The committee held conferences with counsel, visited the proposed project site, held a de nova hearing in which it heard from witnesses for the parties and from intervening abutters,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and considered post-hearing submissions. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23. In July, 2002, the committee issued a written decision overturning the board\u2019s denial of the comprehensive permit and directing that the permit issue to Delphic, with certain conditions not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In August, 2002, Middleborough sought judicial review of the committee\u2019s order in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. In April, 2004, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion on the pleadings, and denied that of Middleborough. See Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (h), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). In relevant part, the judge rejected Middleborough\u2019s argument that the New England Fund loan was not a \u201csubsidy\u201d provided by the Federal or State government within the meaning of G. L. c. 40B, a necessary prerequisite to Delphic\u2019s right to proceed with its appeal under the act. In so holding, the judge gave considerable weight to the committee\u2019s analysis of the New England Fund program in a prior decision, Stubom Ltd. Partnership vs. Barnstable Bd. of Appeals, Housing Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>peals Committee, No. 98-01 (March 5, 1999) (Stubom), which we discuss <em>infra. </em>Middleborough appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The Appeals Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment. <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 41. However, on the question before us \u2014 whether the New England Fund financing commitment provided a government subsidy within the meaning of the act \u2014 the Appeals Court rejected \u201cmuch of\u201d the reasoning of the Stubom decision as having been \u201cpropelled, at least in part, by policy considerations rather than exclusive adherence to the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 46. The Appeals Court nevertheless concluded that the New England Fund did provide a government subsidy, since the FHLBB and its debt instruments are exempt from certain Federal, State, and local taxes. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433 (2000). The Appeals Court thus reasoned that developers would receive a government benefit from a New England Fund loan in the form of tax exemptions to the FHLBB and its member banks that led to loans at reduced interest rates to entities such as Delphic. <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 50 (\u201cthe financial participation of the government in the form of ... tax exemptions is sufficient to constitute a governmental subsidy for purposes of [G. L.] c. 40B\u201d). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">2. <em>Waiver. </em>We consider as an initial matter claims concerning waiver made by the Attorney General, representing the committee, and by Middleborough. The Attorney General asserts that Middleborough has waived its right to contest whether funding from the New England Fund is a valid government subsidy because, during the administrative proceedings, Middleborough failed \u201cadequately\u201d to challenge the rebuttable presumption of fundability established by the project eligibility letter. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 31.01(2), 31.07(l)(a) (1993) (establishing rebuttable presumption of fundability on introduction of fundability letter). See notes 8 and 9, <em>supra. </em>Cf. <em>Hingham </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>433 Mass. 198, 215 (2001) (issue not raised in administrative proceeding may not be raised on judicial review of proceeding). In response, Middleborough argues that the Attorney General, in turn, has waived the waiver argument by not raising it in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Century Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bank of New England-Bristol County, N.A., </em>405 Mass. 420, 421 n.2 (1989) (issue raised for first time on appeal will not be considered). Middleborough also counters that, in any event, the issue of fundability is one of subject matter jurisdiction that may be raised at any time. See <em>Litton Business Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981) (subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Turning first to the potentially determinative question of subject matter jurisdiction, Middleborough argues that, by statute and regulation, fundability is a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining an appeal before the [committee],\u201d and therefore is unwaivable. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>We do not agree. Subject matter jurisdiction is \u201cjurisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 870 (8th ed. 2004), which among the various trial courts and administrative agencies \u201cis both conferred and limited by statute.\u201d <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Edgar, </em>403 Mass. 616, 619 (1988). Title 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.01(1) provides that a developer appealing from the denial of a comprehensive permit to the committee \u201cshall fulfill the following jurisdictional requirements: ...(b) The project shall be fundable by a subsidizing agency under a low and moderate income housing subsidy program.\u201d The Legislature has designated the committee hearing process as the sole administrative avenue to hear a developer\u2019s challenge to a local board\u2019s denial of a comprehensive permit. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. Thus, viewed within the context and purposes of the act, it is clear that what the department denominates as a \u201cjurisdictional requirement\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>more properly viewed as a substantive aspect of the successful applicant\u2019s prima facie case for entitlement to a particular government benefit, in this case, a comprehensive permit. See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. 811, 825 (2002) (statutory reference to Federal or State construction subsidy program is \u201cproperly viewed as a statutory mechanism to determine the threshold eligibility for the developer of a housing project to seek a comprehensive permit\u201d). See also 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.01(5) (1993).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Indeed, the intent of the act \u2014 to streamline and accelerate the permitting process for developers of low or moderate income housing in order to meet the pressing need for affordable housing, see, e.g., <em>Dennis Housing Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 76 (2003) \u2014 would be severely hampered if the issue of fundability could be raised collaterally at any point to attack the validity of the grant of a comprehensive permit. Such a construction of the statute and regulations would seriously complicate a municipality\u2019s ability to determine whether existing or proposed affordable housing projects met the minimum statutory requirements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Regulatory terminology notwithstanding, the issue of fundability is not one of subject matter jurisdiction that can never be waived. It is an evidentiary issue that the party opposing the comprehensive permit must rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We need not discuss at length the remaining conflicting waiver arguments. Middleborough did not accept the committee chair\u2019s express invitation to pursue the question of fundability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>or object to his statement that fundability \u201cis not one of the issues [that has] been raised in this case.\u201d The Attorney General did not brief the waiver issue in the Superior Court or the Appeals Court. Whatever the merits of any party\u2019s claim regarding waiver, we will address the substantive question before us: it has been fully briefed and argued, and public policy would benefit from the elimination of any uncertainty surrounding whether a financing commitment through the New England Fund constitutes a valid government subsidy under the act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Andrews </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 Mass. 611, 618 (2006); <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">3. <em>Fundability of subsidized housing, </em>a. <em>The New England Fund of the FHLBB. </em>We begin with a summary of the relevant features of the New England Fund of the FHLBB from uncontested material in the Stubom decision and the applicable Federal statutes. <em>See Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 43-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The FHLBB is one of twelve regional banks comprising the Federal Housing Finance Board, the latter being an \u201cindependent agency in the executive branch of the Government.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422a(a)(2) (2000). Each regional bank serves a discrete geographical area within the United States, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423 (2000). \u201cSupervised\u201d by the Federal Housing Finance Board, each regional bank is a corporation owned by \u201cmember\u201d banks that have subscribed to the stock of their respective Federal Home Loan Bank. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1422(2)(A), 1424, 1426 (2000). Federally chartered, the FHLBB is privately capitalized, privately owned, and managed independently of the government. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1426-1427 (2000). But the FHLBB\u2019s capital, reserves, advances, surplus, and income are all exempt from Federal, State, and local taxation, as are loans and other obligations issued by the FHLBB. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The New England Fund \u201cdraws its mandate\u201d from the Federal Housing Finance Board\u2019s general purpose \u201cof providing funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>for residential housing finance.\u201d Stubom, <em>supra </em>at 15. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1430(a)(2)(A) (2000). Under the New England Fund program, the FHLBB advances funds to a member bank, which in turn makes a construction loan to a developer at below-market interest rates. Stubom, <em>supra </em>at 3. The loan may be used either for housing projects targeting those with incomes as high as 140 per cent of the area median income or for economic development projects. <em>Id. </em>The New England Fund\u2019s eligibility guidelines for affordable housing developments explicitly refer to the \u201ccommonly understood\u201d requirement of the comprehensive permit process that one-quarter of the owners or renters have incomes that do not exceed eighty per cent of area median income. <em>Id. </em>See note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">b. <em>Standard of review. </em>In reviewing the decision of an administrative agency charged by the Legislature with promulgating regulations, the standard of review is circumscribed as articulated in numerous decisions. See, e.g., <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 618 (1997). Thus, in considering whether housing financed through the New England Fund constitutes housing \u201csubsidized by the federal or state government\u201d within the meaning of the act, we give paramount importance to the language of the act in order to determine legislative intent. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977) (\u201cthe statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose\u201d). Where statutory lacunae exist, the details of legislative policy are to be spelled out \u201cin the first instance by [the] agency charged with administration of the statute.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 654 (1982) <em>(Wellesley I), </em>quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 368 n.20 (1973). See <em>Wellesley I, supra, </em>quoting <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., 362 </em>Mass. 417, 441 n.22 (1971), <em>S.C., </em>365 Mass. 215 (1974) (in considering regulations promulgated under act, \u201cwe give great weight to a \u2018reasonable construction of a regulatory statute adopted by the agency charged with [its] enforcement\u2019 \u201d). Where the statutory language is not without ambiguity, see <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 354, our deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the governing statute is highest. See, e.g., <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 850 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>A reviewing court \u201cmust apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 654, quoting <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, supra </em>at 855. See <em>Leopoldstadt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Health Care Fin. &amp; Policy, </em>436 Mass. 80, 91 (2002), quoting <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>(\u201cthis principal is one of deference, not abdication\u201d). Moreover, we recognize that \u201c[w]here the focus of a statutory enactment is reform,\u201d as is true of the act, see <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 347, \u201cthe administrative agency charged with its implementation should construe it broadly so as to further the goals of such reform,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 774 (2002). Agency action will not be overturned unless it be proven arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the agency\u2019s own rules. See <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976). Last, the burden of proving the invalidity of administrative action rests with the party challenging that action. <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 233, 242 (2006).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With these guidelines before us, we advance to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">c. <em>\u201cSubsidy\u201d under G. L. c. 40B.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Legislature did not define the term \u201csubsidy\u201d for purposes of the act. Initially, neither did the administrative regulations promulgated by the Department of Community Affairs (department) to implement the act. See, e.g., 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 30.02 (1978). However, between 1990 and 1991, the department promulgated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>amendments to its then-existing regulations, defining the term \u201csubsidy\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\"><em>\u201cSubsidy </em>means the grant, through a federal or state housing program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing, including a local housing program approved by the Executive Office of Communities and Development, of direct financial assistance; of indirect financial assistance through insurance, guarantees, or other means; of in kind assistance; of technical assistance; or of other supportive services. The definition conforms to the legislative intent expressed in the Report of the Special Commission Relative to the Implementation of Low and Moderate Income Housing Provisions (1989) [see note 18, <em>infra], </em>and includes assistance through the Local Initiative Program, 760 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 45.00, and similar programs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 30.02 (1991).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consistent with the broad reform purpose of the act, the department defined the term \u201csubsidy\u201d expansively, encompassing both direct financial support and a wide range of indirect financial and nonfinancial support. In so doing, the department did not exceed its statutory authority. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Hill Architectural </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 570, 583 (1996) (administrative agency \u201chas jurisdiction to establish regulations that bear a rational relation to the statutory purpose\u201d); <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>401 Mass. 172, 176 (1987) (\u201cregulation may be authorized though not traceable to specific statutory language, [and] powers granted include those reasonably implied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Then, in the Stubom case, the committee was asked to resolve the issue that Middleborough now raises on appeal: whether the New England Fund met the regulatory definition of a government subsidy for the purposes of G. L. c. 40B.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the Stubom decision, the committee began by noting its precedent of reading the statute and regulations liberally to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s aims, in order to allow \u201cthe entire comprehensive permit process to evolve with the changing world of housing subsidies.\u201d Stubom, <em>supra </em>at 6. The committee considered whether the New England Fund met the four-part test for determining whether an entity is a governmental \u201cinstrumentality\u201d set out in <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>414 Mass. 582, 587 (1993). Applying that test, the committee concluded that the New England Fund had sufficient characteristics of a government agency to qualify as a Federal program.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Stubom, <em>supra </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The committee determined that the financing mechanism of the New England Fund provided a government subsidy because \u201cfinancing will be provided at a low interest rate,\u201d and because \u201cit is generally understood that \u2018the funds handled by these banks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>are . . . public funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, quoting <em>Fahey </em>v. <em>O\u2019Melveny &amp; Myers, </em>200 F.2d 420, 445 (9th Cir. 1952), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Mallonee </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>345 U.S. 952 (1953). The committee also pointed to the broad definition of the term \u201csubsidy\u201d endorsed in <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 655 (subsidy not limited to grants of money, but includes \u201c[h]elp, aid, [or] assistance\u201d generally), noting that in that case, <em>id., </em>this court held that mortgage financing from the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) constituted a \u201csubsidy\u201d under G. L. c. 40B. The committee determined that the financing mechanism of the New England Fund \u201cis a public subsidy quite similar to MHFA financing, and constitutes a subsidy\u201d within the meaning of the act and its regulations. Stubom, <em>supra </em>at 12. The committee concluded that the New England Fund financing mechanism constituted \u201cthe sort of affordable housing subsidy program that is crucial to current efforts to fill the need for affordable housing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The Appeals Court disavowed the reasoning of the Stubom decision, holding that the act \u201crequires not just governmental involvement, but a governmental subsidy,\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 39, 48 (2006), and that \u201cthe concept of a subsidy\u201d requires \u201cthat something of economic value is made available, and that it be provided, at least in this context by the Federal or State government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46. The Appeals Court concluded that none of the factors cited by the committee in support of its conclusion in the Stubom decision persuasively demonstrated that the New England Fund provided a government subsidy under the act, <em>id. </em>at 47-48, reasoning that \u201cif the Federal or State government does not contribute something of value to the effort, there is nothing that qualifies as a government subsidy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 49. The Appeals Court then looked to \u201cother features\u201d of the New England Fund programs as operated by the FHLBB and reasoned that the tax-exempt status of both the funds held by the FHLBB and the loans it provided from the New England Fund eased the tax burden on the FHLBB, \u201cthereby increasing its ultimate profits and enabling it more easily to make loans at favorable rates to its members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. As such, the Appeals Court concluded that the tax exemptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>were \u201csufficient to constitute a governmental subsidy\u201d for purposes of the act. <em>Id. </em>at 50.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We do not disagree with the Appeals Court to the extent that it holds that an exemption from taxation constitutes a government subsidy under the act. See <em>Massachusetts Hous. Fin. Agency </em>v. <em>New England Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>356 Mass. 202, 209 (1969) (noting that exemption of MHFA financial instruments from certain State and Federal taxes permitted MHFA to make mortgage loans \u201cat interest [rates] lower than those which would be charged if the borrower were to obtain funds in the general mortgage market\u201d). We conclude, however, that the Appeals Court should not have repudiated the reasoning of the Stubom decision and, by necessary implication, the committee\u2019s reasoning in this case. The act and its regulations permit many kinds of government subsidies, and we disagree with the Appeals Court\u2019s rejection of the committee\u2019s more expansive interpretation of the fundability requirements of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">First, the broadly meliorative purpose of the act is evident in the Legislature\u2019s directive that low or moderate income housing be \u201csubsidized by the federal or state government under <em>any </em>program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined in the applicable federal or state statute\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997) (\u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an expansive meaning, that is, \u2018one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind\u2019 \u201d). Second, as we discussed earlier, the scope of review of an administrative decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, leaves little room for appellate discretion. As we noted, the agency\u2019s decision must be upheld if supported by \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 376 (1973), and we must indulge all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the agency\u2019s determinations. <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 657. Our deferential standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>of review \u201cdoes not permit a court to treat the proceeding [under G. L. c. 30A] as a trial de nova on the record which was before the administrative board. A court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de nova.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Next, this court itself has said that the term \u201csubsidy\u201d in the act must be read expansively. See <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 655 (subsidy not limited to grants of money, but includes \u201c [hjelp, aid, [or] assistance\u201d generally). See also, e.g., <em>Charlesbank Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admin., </em>379 Mass. 635, 638 (1980) (mortgage insurance constitutes subsidy). In <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 655-656, we held that a low-interest loan from a quasi governmental State entity (in that case, the MHFA) constituted a subsidy under the act. In the Stubom decision, the committee determined that the New England Fund subsidizes low or moderate income housing when the FHLBB advances funds from the New England Fund to one of its member banks, \u201cwhich in turn makes a construction loan to a developer [at] <em>a below-market interest </em>rate\u201d (emphasis added). Stubom, <em>supra </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We see no meaningful distinction between the low-interest loan that constituted a subsidy in <em>Wellesley I </em>and the low-interest loan provided by the New England Fund in this case. In both cases, a program of the Federal or State government lent funds for affordable housing construction at below-market interest rates. In both cases it appears that below-market interest rate loans were made possible by the lenders\u2019 exemption from certain forms of taxation. It was thus reasonable under the regulation, the intent of the statute, and the prior jurisprudence of this court for the committee to conclude that the financing commitment through the New England Fund, with its below-market interest rate loan, constitutes a \u201csubsidy\u201d for purposes of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Viewed in light of the statutory mandate, our deference to administrative actions, and our prior decisions, we cannot say that the New England Fund\u2019s below-market interest rate loans do not constitute a subsidy for purposes of the act. Nor do we deem unreasonable the committee\u2019s conclusion that a government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>subsidy is involved where a legislatively-created and monitored entity (here, the FHLBB) advances construction funds to a developer of affordable housing at below-market interest rates to advance the legislative purpose of supporting and stabilizing the financing of residential housing. The committee\u2019s reasoning in the Stubom decision is consonant with the Legislature\u2019s remedial purposes and broad grant of authority to the department. Neither the statute nor the department\u2019s regulations interpose any of the additional restrictions on the source of the funds, the scope of the program, or the degree of subsidy that Middleborough would have us read into the act. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 378 (act relies on standards set by State and Federal entities to \u201cdefine the requisite property interest for a permit in terms of the selected financing agency\u2019s property interest requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We conclude that the committee\u2019s decision in this case, and in the Stubom decision that preceded it, is not \u201ccontrary to the plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose,\u201d <em>Leopoldstadt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Health Care Fin. &amp; Policy, </em>436 Mass. 80, 91 (2002), quoting <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 618 (1997), and is due substantial deference from this court. We decline to overrule the committee\u2019s determination, under its reasoning in the Stubom decision, that the New England Fund program constitutes a valid subsidy under the act and its implementing regulations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, the Superior Court properly allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>pleadings, and properly denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings of Middleborough.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b537-10\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 20, defines \u201clow or moderate income housing\u201d as \u201cany housing subsidized by the federal or state government under any program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined in the applicable federal or state statute, whether built or operated by any public agency or any nonprofit or limited dividend organization.\u201d See 760 Code Mass.
