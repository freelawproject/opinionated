L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, from a decision of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy (department) that a local telephone company that purchases telephone services from another telephone company could be restricted from reselling those services at discounted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>prices to certain customers. Specifically, the appeal raises two issues: the validity of a restriction imposed by Verizon New England, Inc., doing business as Verizon Massachusetts (Verizon), an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), on DSCI Corporation (DSCI), a competing local exchange carrier (CLEC), regarding <em>to whom </em>DSCI may resell certain telecommunications services provided by Verizon to the Commonwealth pursuant to Verizon\u2019s customer-specific pricing contract with the Commonwealth (Commonwealth CSP); and the availability of a corporate rewards discount that Verizon typically gives to its business customers, when DSCI resells the services provided under the Commonwealth CSP. The department concluded that Verizon\u2019s restriction on resale was not unreasonable or discriminatory, and that DSCI was not entitled to apply the corporate rewards discount. We affirm the department\u2019s decision so far as it concerns the resale of the services provided pursuant to the Commonwealth CSP and remand for clarification and further action the issue of the applicability of the corporate rewards discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">1. <em>Statutory and regulatory overview. </em>\u201cUntil the 1990\u2019s, the provision of local telephone service was not competitive.\u201d <em>MCI WorldCom Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>442 Mass. 103, 104 (2004). \u201cIndividual telephone companies, sometimes called \u2018incumbent local exchange carriers\u2019 (ILECs), maintained monopolies over defined geographic areas.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Global NAPs, Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel.

L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified in part at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251-261 [2000]).\u201d <em>MCI WorldCom Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, supra </em>at 104-105.

See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.613(b) (2006).

The department states that customer specific pricing contracts, such as the one at issue here, are \u201ccustomer-specific variations to a carrier\u2019s standard tariff offerings and are filed with the [department as part of CSP tariff filings.\u201d* ****<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to the Commonwealth CSP contract, Verizon provides telecommunications services to certain State and local government and nonprofit agencies, called \u201celigible entities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the Commonwealth CSP contract separately includes Verizon\u2019s \u201cCustomer 38\u201d contract which grants, in essence, discounts on the monthly per-line charge or rate, with specific volume requirements. Verizon also offers a corporate rewards tariff to business customers, which provides an optional calling plan and various discounts such as usage on a per-line or per-minute basis, volume discounts, and loyalty discounts. The corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>rewards document expressly states that its usage rates are not available to any CSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The dispute that gave rise to DSCI\u2019s complaint occurred when DSCI wanted to resell the telecommunications services contained in the Commonwealth CSP to DSCI\u2019s commercial customers. Verizon maintained that DSCI only could resell the services to the eligible entities listed in the Commonwealth CSP, arguing, in essence, that the Commonwealth CSP was unique and thus fell under the Act\u2019s different \u201ccategory of subscribers\u201d exception. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(c)(4)(B). DSCI also argued that, even if it were limited to reselling to eligible entities under the Commonwealth CSP, it could apply Verizon\u2019s corporate rewards usage rates instead of the Customer 38 contract rates that are part of the Commonwealth CSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The parties submitted prefiled testimony, documents, and responses to record requests to the department. The department then conducted a hearing where three witnesses testified, two from Verizon and one from DSCI.</p>\n<p id=\"AqMD\">In its written decision, the department concluded that Verizon met its burden of proving that the restriction on the resale of the Commonwealth CSP was reasonable and nondiscriminatory. It noted that Verizon did not seek to prevent DSCI from all resale of services under the Commonwealth CSP contract, but only precluded DSCI from reselling the services to any customer other than the hundreds of eligible entities listed in the Commonwealth contract. The department concluded that the \u201csheer size of an especially large customer,\u201d while not dispositive in the dispute, \u201ccan be a distinguishing factor in arriving at a judgment whether customers are \u2018similarly situated.\u2019 \u201d The department also determined that the restriction is not unreasonable because no other entities are similarly situated to the eligible entities as the Commonwealth \u201cis a unique customer and . . . the legal framework under which contracts between Verizon and the Commonwealth are created\u201d justify the restriction on resale. Citing G. L. c. 30B and 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 21.04 (2003), it explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cPursuant to Massachusetts law and regulations, the Commonwealth is given the authority to delineate those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>entities that are eligible to use Commonwealth-negotiated contracts. This authority . . . imposes unique requirements on Verizon, as a successful bidder for the Commonwealth\u2019s custom, that justify the creation of a subclass of commercial customers that are eligible to take the service under the contract. For example, the Commonwealth\u2019s legal authority to enter into contracts is contained in procurement statutes and regulations that are non-negotiable. ... In addition, the Commonwealth requires the agreement of all carriers that seek to enter into CSP contracts with [it] to provide service to hundreds of entities that supply some service to the Commonwealth, and the list can, and likely does fluctuate over the duration of the contract . . . thus imposing a significant and uncommon contract management burden on the successful bidder. . . . Furthermore, the Commonwealth\u2019s standard contract terms and conditions prohibit termination liability [for the Commonwealth], likely a rarity among contracts with business customers in the telecommunications industry, and a provision that substantially alters the fundamentals of the contracting process.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The department also rejected DSCI\u2019s claim that it may combine Commonwealth CSP contract per-line rates with corporate rewards usage rates even for customers conceded by Verizon as eligible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The department determined that the restriction was reasonable and nondiscriminatory because the corporate rewards tariff specifically states that it is not available for use with CSP contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">3. Discussion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a. <em>Standard of review. </em>Where, as here, a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>seeks judicial review of the department\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cOur standard of review ... is well settled: a petition that raises no constitutional questions requires us to review the department\u2019s finding to determine only whether there is an error of law. . . . The burden of proof is on the appealing party to show that the order appealed from is invalid, and we have observed that this burden is heavy. . . . Moreover, we give deference to the department\u2019s expertise and experience in areas where the Legislature has delegated to it decision-making authority, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. We shall uphold an agency\u2019s decision unless it is based on an error of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\"><em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Where a \u201ccase involves interpretation of a complex statutory and regulatory framework,\u201d and the relevant Federal regulatory authority has delegated to the department the determination at issue, we will accord deference to the department\u2019s interpretation of the relevant Federal statutes and regulations. <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>435 Mass. 144, 150-151 (2001). Such deference is appropriate here because the FCC has declared that the \u201csubstance and specificity of rules concerning which discount and promotion restrictions may be applied to resellers . . . is a decision best left to [Sjtate commissions, which are more familiar with the particular business practices of their incumbent LECs and local market conditions.\u201d <em>Local Competition Order, supra </em>at 15971, at par. 952. See <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, supra </em>at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">b. <em>Resale of Commonwealth CSP. </em>DSCI contends that the department\u2019s conclusion that the restriction on the resale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Commonwealth CSP to eligible entities is reasonable and nondiscriminatory is legal error, arbitrary or capricious, and lacks record support.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">First, DSCI argues that the department\u2019s analysis failed to apply the governing Federal standards, namely, that the restriction is presumptively <em>invalid </em>unless found to be <em>both </em>reasonable and nondiscriminatory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is no merit to this claim. The department\u2019s decision sets forth the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, states that the burden was on Verizon to prove that its restrictions on the resale were reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and applies the relevant law in concluding that Verizon met its burden. We also reject DSCI\u2019s claim that the decision contains \u201calmost no analysis\u201d or evaluation of the statutory and regulatory framework concerning resale, local market conditions, or Verizon business practices. For each of the issues relevant to this appeal, the decision first presents the parties\u2019 respective arguments and then proceeds to an analysis section where the department explained its reasons for its conclusion that Verizon met its burden. Cf. <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>436 Mass. 233, 239, 242-243 (2002) (vacating portion of department\u2019s order where no substantial evidence); <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 868-869 (department\u2019s decision inadequate where insufficient subsidiary findings and no explanation for decision to accept certain methodology); <em>U.S. W. Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hix, </em>183 F. Supp. 2d 1249, 1256-1257 (D. Colo. 2000) (utility commission\u2019s approval of resale restriction was error of law, where ILEC did not attempt to rebut presumption of unreasonableness and commission did not explain whether or how presumption was overcome). In addi-' tian, nothing in paragraph 952 of the <em>Local Competition Order </em>requires the department explicitly to discuss local market conditions or Verizon\u2019s business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">DSCI next claims that the department misapplied the Federal standards when it concluded that Verizon met its burden, because the department improperly focused on the uniqueness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>of contracting with the Commonwealth. DSCI argues that, when comparing the end users of Verizon and DSCI, the department did not focus on quantity, time of use, manner and costs of service of DSCI\u2019s end users, and thus failed to identify a cost or other basis for differentiating Verizon and DSCI end users. DSCI relies in particular on a 2002 consultative opinion of the Florida Public Service Commission to support its assertion that Verizon\u2019s restriction on resale of the Commonwealth CSP is unreasonable and discriminatory \u201c[a]bsent [evidence of] cost to serve or other quantifiable differences\u201d to distinguish Verizon and DSCI end users.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The Florida consultative opinion is not persuasive. It is an assessment whether a local ILEC (BellSouth) complied with a checklist of requirements in \u00a7 271 of the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the discussion about resale was only one of fourteen factors, cited in \u00a7 271, that the commission was assessing, and not the focal point of the opinion. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(c)(2)(B)(i)-(xiv). Indeed, no analogous resale restriction is discussed in the opinion. Moreover, the cost factors on which DSCI relies are what a witness for BellSouth told the commission that it used to determine whether an end user is similarly situated for purposes of eligibility for resale of services. DSCI has not pointed to any part of the consultative opinion where the commission even indorsed those factors, let alone declared them to be the sole basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>for determining whether a resale restriction is reasonable and nondiscriminatory pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(c)(4)(B). Most importantly, DSCI cites no statute, regulation, or other law that limits review of a resale restriction by State commissions like the department, to issues of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">DSCI also claims that even if the department did not have to take into account cost differences in its analysis of Verizon\u2019s restriction on resale, it erred in relying on the procurement process as the basis for determining whether the eligible entities were similarly situated to DSCI\u2019s business customers pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(c)(4)(B). We disagree. It was not improper for the department to consider the procurement process, because different regulatory schemes may support different classifications, just as here, \u00a7 251(c)(4)(B) envisions different categories of subscribers. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>363 Mass. 589, 593-594 (1973) (rejecting claim of unequal treatment by tax commission where pawnbrokers licensed and regulated according to scheme different from other small loan agencies). The department also permissibly could credit the burden imposed on Verizon in carrying out the terms of the Commonwealth CSP contract, some of which are, by statute, nonnegotiable. See <em>Lafayette Place Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>427 Mass. 509, 523-524 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1177 (1999). As the department stated, the Commonwealth has the sole authority to designate (and change) the eligible entities and may terminate the contract without liability, thus \u201caltering] the fundamentals of the contracting process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">DSCI also argues that the department\u2019s decision was not based on substantial evidence. Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6), substantial evidence is evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d In determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s decision \u201cwe must carefully consider any evidence in the record that detracts from the agency\u2019s conclusion, [and] \u2018accord due weight to the \u201cexperience, technical competence and specialized knowledge\u201d of the department.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, supra </em>at 237, quoting <em>Martorano </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>401 Mass. 257, 261 (1987). We do not substitute our views as long as the department\u2019s deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>minations of fact are based on substantial evidence. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 Mass. 611, 617 (2006), quoting <em>Abramowitz </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 168, 173 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">DSCI has not met its burden to show that the department\u2019s conclusion was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, supra. </em>The crux of DSCI\u2019s argument is that the department failed to consider \u201ccosts, terms of service or other quantifiable differences between Verizon [and DSCI] customers,\u201d which has been addressed above. In addition, we note that the department, in considering Verizon\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth CSP was unique, relied on the documentary evidence submitted to it and heard testimony from two Verizon employees concerning the nature of contracting with the Commonwealth. The department is entitled to assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">c. <em>Applicable usage rates. </em>The department determined that, because of the plain language in Verizon\u2019s corporate rewards tariff, Verizon\u2019s prohibiting DSCI from combining the corporate rewards usage discount with the Commonwealth\u2019s CSP per-line rates was reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The department argues that this was a perfectly reasonable interpretation of this restriction because, by the terms of the corporate rewards program, Verizon itself could not combine the two discounts. Verizon also argues that the department was technically correct, given the understanding Verizon and the department had of DSCI\u2019s position at the time of the decision. However, DSCI argues, and now Verizon agrees, that DSCI may offer eligible entities either the corporate rewards usage rates or the Customer 38 contract usage rates, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">A careful reading of the record does suggest that DSCI wanted to be able to offer only one of the usage discounts, not both, and that it presented this position to the department. It also is not entirely clear that the department understood this. DSCI asks that we issue a declaratory judgment that it has been entitled, from March 24, 2005, to the corporate rewards discount so that it may seek damages. We decline to do so. The department\u2019s order is less than clear on this issue, the record is not helpful, and the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ties asserted contradictory positions at oral argument. There are potential financial implications to the outcome of this issue for which a record needs to be developed. As Verizon and DSCI now seem to agree concerning the applicability of the usage discounts, and the department is charged with enforcing this complex regulatory scheme, we remand the matter to the department for clarification of the issue in dispute and to fashion any remedy it deems necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the department\u2019s decision allowing Verizon\u2019s restriction on the resale of the Commonwealth CSP only to eligible entities. We remand the issue of usage rates to the department for further clarification and action.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In its brief, the department explains that, when reselling its telecommunications service, the ILEC generally continues to provide the physical connection and telecommunication service to the customer, while the CLEC maintains the customer relationship and billing arrangements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In <em>Matter of Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, </em>11 F.C.C.R. 15499 (1996) <em>(Local Competition Order), </em>the FCC adopted initial rules for States to apply in implementing \u00a7 251 of the Act, that is, to open the local exchange and exchange access markets to competition. <em>Id. </em>at 15507, 15509-15510, at pars. 6 &amp; 13.

See G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 19. These requirements are imposed because, with respect to a CSP, an ILEC, such as Verizon, responds to a competitive retail marketplace situation by negotiating rates, terms, and conditions for a particular customer that are different from (and usually more favorable than) standard tariffed retail prices, terms, or conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The eligible entities are defined in the contract and include \u201call constitutional offices,\u201d the Legislature, judiciary, cities, towns, municipalities, counties, schools, authorities, commissions, institutions of higher education, quasi public agencies, and certain nonprofit entities currently contracting with the Commonwealth to provide human and social services, and \u201cother eligible entities designated in writing by the State [pjurchasing [ajgency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The department stated: \u201cUsage-based rates are variable local and toll charges based on measured (usually per-minute) or unlimited use; per-line rates are monthly fixed line charges assessed for access to the network notwithstanding the amount of use.

Neither issue was appealed from the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>of the department and this court will not address them. We also do not address DSCI\u2019s argument that the department failed to consider Verizon\u2019s behavior in deciding whether its restriction was reasonable and nondiscriminatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">DSCI does not argue that the department (or Verizon) has erroneously set forth the governing law but, rather, that the department has wrongly applied that law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Section 271 of the Act allows Bell operating companies \u201cseeking to provide certain long-distance services [interLATA] [to] obtain permission from the FCC\u201d if they demonstrate compliance with the checklist of requirements listed in \u00a7 271. <em>Earthlink, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>462 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2006). InterLATA service is defined as \u201ctelecommunications between a point located in a local access and transport area and a point located outside such area.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Long distance markets were forbidden to Bell operating companies \u201cunder the antitrust consent decree that broke up AT&amp;T in the early 1980s.\u201d <em>Earthlink, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, supra. </em>The consent decree divided the former Bell territory into geographic units called LATAs. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Western Elec. Co., </em>569 F. Supp. 990, 993-994 (D.D.C. 1983). LATA is an acronym for \u201clocal access and transport area.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(25).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">DSCI also relies on <em>Matter of Application of Verizon New England Inc., &amp; Others for Authorization to Provide In-Region InterLATA Sevices in Massachusetts, </em>16 F.C.C.R. 8988 (2001), which is likewise an assessment whether Verizon met the requirement of \u00a7 271 of the Act to open its local exchange markets to competition in the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
