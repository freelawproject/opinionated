L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (Act), permissibly could consider whether there was a \u201cregional need\u201d for affordable housing after the town of Amherst had fulfilled its low or moderate income housing obligation under the Act (minimum affordable housing obligation).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the board properly took this consideration into account, and we affirm the judgment that upheld the grant of the comprehensive permit. We also affirm the order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The background of the case is as follows. The defendant HAP, Inc. (developer), is a nonprofit corporation that provides affordable housing services in western Massachusetts. In May, 2001, the developer<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> applied to the board for a comprehensive permit under the Act to build twenty-six units of affordable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>rental housing on a 4.1 acre parcel of land off of Route 116 in Amherst.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The project would involve the construction of three detached buildings, each containing eight units of townhouse-style housing; renovations to an existing farmhouse to create two new housing units; and the construction of an apartment for a resident manager within one of the new buildings. Two of the buildings would be three stories in height. Of the twenty-six units, the developer proposed three one-bedroom units, fourteen two-bedroom units, and nine three-bedroom units.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The site for the proposed project comprises property located in the R-O, or outlying residence, district of the residential zone.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The property lies on the eastern edge of a neighborhood known as Orchard Valley, which contains approximately 275 single-family homes. The proposed project violates various provisions of Amherst\u2019s zoning bylaw, including those pertaining to minimum lot area, maximum lot coverage, maximum floors on buildings, and parking. In addition, the bylaw provision pertaining to residential uses prohibits townhouses and apartments in the outlying residence district. During the relevant time frame, Amherst had fulfilled its minimum affordable housing obligation within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Following numerous public meetings and hearings, and several revisions to the project, the board voted unanimously to grant the comprehensive permit, subject to various conditions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On February 22, 2002, the board issued the comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>permit and a twelve-page decision. In its decision, the board concluded that the need for affordable housing in Amherst was not mitigated by the fact that the town had met its minimum affordable housing obligation. The board referred to a publication that concluded that an individual earning minimum wage would have to work ninety-seven hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Amherst. The board noted testimony presented to it that the vacancy rate in town is one per cent, and that 870 families are currently on the Amherst Housing Authority waiting list, having to wait three to six years for an affordable housing unit. The board concluded that the overwhelming need for affordable housing outweighed concerns about density, traffic, and other \u201cconstraints imposed by the zoning bylaw.\u201d The board went on to explain, detailing its reasoning, that the project would not have an adverse effect on the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiffs, residents of Amherst (including some abutters to the proposed project site), challenged the board\u2019s decision to grant the comprehensive permit by filing a complaint in the Land Court. The plaintiffs asserted that the town bylaw provisions could not be superseded by the Act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the board\u2019s decision was invalid due to prejudgment and conflict of interest on the part of at least one board member, and that the board had exceeded its authority in granting the comprehensive permit. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the applicability of the provisions of the bylaw after Amherst had satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation. A Land Court judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and allowed the defendants\u2019 motion, concluding that the Act permits a local zoning board to override restrictive zoning laws in its discretion even after a municipality has satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Further proceedings and a trial followed on the remaining issues. The Land Court judge entered judgment in favor of the defendants, affirming the board\u2019s decision. In his decision, in which he made numerous factual findings, the judge rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the board had \u201cno standard\u201d for acting on the comprehensive permit application. The judge explained that the same standard \u2014 whether the local bylaw is \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d \u2014 applies in situations where the town\u2019s affordable housing stock is either below, or over, the ten per cent statutory threshold. In either situation, the board must weigh the requirements of the local bylaw against the need for affordable housing, taking into account various factors set forth in the definition of the term \u201cconsistent with local needs.\u201d The judge found that the developer had satisfied its burden of proof at trial concerning the relevant factors, and that the comprehensive permit was properly granted. He also concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the condition of the comprehensive permit that set aside twenty per cent of the units in the proposed project for minority households. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>A judgment entered consistent with the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The plaintiffs moved to amend the judgment, asserting that the judge had erroneously determined that they lacked standing. The motion was denied. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the judgment and decision following trial, and from the denial of their motion to amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">1. The parties have framed the issue before us in differing terms. The plaintiffs expressly acknowledge, as they must, that a local board of appeals may override local \u201crequirements and regulations\u201d (local zoning laws) even when a municipality\u2019s minimum affordable housing obligation has been met. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354-355, 367 (1973) <em>(Hanover).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The issue, as articulated by the plaintiffs, is whether, in so doing, a local board of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>peals may employ the \u201cregional need test\u201d of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. The plaintiffs argue that a board of appeals may not use this test, and that, instead, \u201c[t]he usual zoning laws are imposed in the usual way,\u201d meaning that the applicant must apply for a special permit or variance to override the local zoning laws when a municipality has satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 21, authorizes a board of appeals to grant or deny an application for a comprehensive permit. The plaintiffs correctly point out that nothing in \u00a7 21 indicates what standard a board of appeals should use to evaluate an application. The plaintiffs also correctly point out that this deficiency in the Act was addressed by us in the <em>Hanover </em>decision in our rejection of the claim that the lack of standards in the Act rendered it unconstitutionally vague, and in our conclusion that, construing the statute as a whole, the \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d standard of \u00a7 23 (and defined in \u00a7 20) is the standard to be used by a local board of appeals in evaluating an application for a comprehensive permit. <em>Hanover, supra </em>at 363-368.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Section 20 of the Act defines the phrase \u201c[cjonsistent with local needs,\u201d first providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201c [Requirements and regulations shall be considered consistent with local needs if they are reasonable[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] in view of the regional need for low and moderate income housing considered with the number of low income persons in the city or town affected and the need to protect the health or safety of the occupants of the proposed hous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ing or of the residents of the city or town, to promote better site and building design in relation to the surroundings, or to preserve open spaces, and if such requirements and regulations are applied as equally as possible to both subsidized and unsubsidized housing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The plaintiffs refer to this portion of the definition as the \u201cregional need test,\u201d and we shall adopt this terminology for purposes of discussion. The definition of \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d goes on to state in the second sentence that \u201c[Requirements or regulations shall be consistent with local needs when imposed by a board of zoning appeals after comprehensive hearing in a city or town\u201d where a municipality has fulfilled its minimum affordable housing obligation as therein defined, see note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The plaintiffs assert that the two sentences in the definition of \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d create two separate standards, and that when a municipality has satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation, the local zoning laws, as a matter of law, cannot be bypassed (unless the applicant satisfies the standards for obtaining a variance or special permit), and that inquiry into the \u201cregional need test,\u201d as set forth in the first sentence, is improper. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument is based on the difference between the first sentence of the definition of \u201cconsistent with local needs,\u201d which states that local zoning laws \u201cshall be <em>considered consistent </em>with local needs\u201d if they are reasonable in view of various factors, and the second sentence of the definition, which states that when a municipality has satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation, local zoning laws <em>\u201cshall be consistent </em>with local needs\u201d (emphases added). G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We construe the provisions of the Act in connection with the purpose of its enactment and as a harmonious whole. See <em>Hanover, supra </em>at 354, 364. The second sentence of the definition of \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d sets forth \u201cprecisely the municipality\u2019s minimum [affordable] housing obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. The plaintiffs read too much into the absence of the word \u201cconsidered\u201d in the second sentence of the definition. A plain reading shows that, in circumstances where a municipality has failed to satisfy its minimum affordable housing obligation, the second sentence serves to foreclose a local board of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>from claiming that its decision to deny a comprehensive permit (and to enforce local zoning laws) is consistent with local needs and therefore automatically enforceable on review. This is so because \u201cthe municipality\u2019s failure to meet its minimum [affordable] housing obligations, as defined in \u00a7 20, will provide compelling evidence that the regional need for housing does in fact outweigh the objections to the proposal.\u201d <em>Hanover, supra </em>at 367. Thus, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, application of the second sentence, even when a municipality has satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation, serves a purpose and does not render the minimum affordable housing obligation in \u00a7 20 \u201cmeaningless surplusage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Nothing in the definition of \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d in \u00a7 20, or in other provisions of the Act, divests a local board of appeals of its authority to grant a comprehensive permit once a municipality satisfies its minimum affordable housing obligation. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>Use of the phrase \u201cwhen imposed by\u201d in the second sentence of the definition of \u201cconsistent with local needs,\u201d indicates that a local board of appeals has been given discretion to decide whether <em>or not </em>to impose local zoning laws. See <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984) (\u201cWherever possible, we give meaning to each word in the legislation; no word in a statute should be considered superfluous\u201d). Because, under the second sentence, local zoning laws are not consistent with local needs unless they are \u201cimposed\u201d \u201cafter [a] comprehensive hearing,\u201d local boards of appeals must deliberate about whether to impose or override local zoning laws when a municipality has satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation. If local boards of appeals were prohibited from issuing comprehensive permits beyond the statutory minimum, it would be meaningless to hold a \u201ccomprehensive hearing.\u201d When a local board of appeals decides <em>not </em>to enforce its local zoning laws, the second sentence of the definition ceases to apply, leaving the board of appeals to find, essentially, that the local zoning laws are <em>inconsistent </em>with local needs as assessed from the only remaining benchmark in \u00a7 20, namely, the regional needs test set forth in the first sentence of the definition of \u201cconsistent with local needs.\u201d Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>conclusion is bolstered by the central, overriding concern of the Act: consistency with local needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">This conclusion does not frustrate the purpose of the Act. A municipality\u2019s attainment of its minimum affordable housing obligation in many cases does not eliminate the need for affordable housing within its borders. Local autonomy is not compromised. Once a municipality meets its minimum affordable housing obligation, the local board of appeals may exercise its discretion to apply its local zoning laws, and the board is not required to grant a comprehensive permit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Hanover, supra </em>at 367. Application of the regional needs test, however, ensures that local boards of appeal will balance the competing considerations involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Some final observations are in order. If the Legislature had intended, in circumstances where a municipality had satisfied its affordable housing obligation, for a board of appeals to revert to granting variances or special permits in overriding local zoning laws, it would have so provided and would not have empowered a board of appeals with \u201cthe same power to issue permits or approvals as any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application, including but not limited to the power to attach to said permit or approval conditions and requirements with respect to height, site plan, size or shape, or building materials as are consistent with the terms of this section.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. We disregard the regulations cited by the plaintiffs because they only apply to appeals to the housing appeals committee by an applicant whose comprehensive permit application was denied or was granted' with conditions the applicant alleges render the proposed project uneconomic. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22; 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.02(1) (2004). Finally, our conclusion does not \u201cneedlessly infringe[]\u201d on the \u201csettled property rights of abutters.\u201d Rather, our conclusion takes into account that the Legislature \u201chas clearly delineated that point where local interests must yield to the general public need for housing.\u201d <em>Hanover, supra </em>at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>2. The plaintiffs maintain that the comprehensive permit is illegal because it contains an unconstitutional racial quota by requiring twenty per cent of the project\u2019s units to \u201cbe set aside for minority households.\u201d See note 8, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiffs base their claim of standing on the possibility that they, in the future, may \u201cneed to move to more affordable housing.\u201d \u201c[Ujnsubstantiated claims or speculative personal opinions\u201d do not constitute a sufficient predicate on which to confer standing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Denneny </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Seekonk, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 212 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">3. The judgment is affirmed.

In the <em>Hanover </em>case, we examined a municipality\u2019s affordable housing obligation as set forth in an earlier version of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, and stated that the provisions \u201cdefine precisely the municipality\u2019s <em>minimum </em>housing obligations\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 366. We went on to explain that, \u201conce the municipality has satisfied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>minimum [affordable] housing obligation, the statute deems local \u2018requirements and regulations,\u2019 including its restrictive zoning ordinances or by-laws, as \u2018consistent with local heeds\u2019 and thereby enforceable by the board <em>if it wants to apply them.\u201d Id. </em>at 367. We do not view these statements as dicta, and it necessarily follows that the converse of what is quoted above is true. That is, where a municipality has satisfied its minimum affordable housing obligation, a local board of appeals is not required to enforce local \u201crequirements and regulations,\u201d and nothing in the statute imposes such a mandate. To the extent that any ambiguity existed for this proposition, we now put it to rest. To conclude otherwise would frustrate the purpose of the Act.

The comprehensive permit must be read together with the board\u2019s decision granting the comprehensive permit. In its decision, the board makes clear that the developer must apply to the Department of Housing and Community Development (department) for approval of the aspirational \u201cset aside\u201d for minority households. The board, therefore, appropriately deferred the issue to the department, the entity that the parties all agree is responsible for compliance with fair housing laws and regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
