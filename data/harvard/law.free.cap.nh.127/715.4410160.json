The commissioner denied the plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim based on injuries allegedly suffered while she was employed by the defendants. After the filing of the appeal, the defendants requested that the plaintiff submit to an additional medical examination. Upon the plaintiff\u2019s refusal, the defendants filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>motion for discovery seeking to compel the plaintiff to submit to the exam. The plaintiff objected to this motion, claiming that the appeal provided by RSA 281:37 was limited to a rehearing of the evidence introduced at the labor department hearing. The superior court granted the defendants\u2019 motion and then ordered this interlocutory transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\">RSA 281:37,1, provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">\u201c[i]n the event of a controversey as to the responsibility ... for the payment of compensation . . . , any party . . . may petition the labor commissioner . . . for a hearing and award.... At such hearing ... it shall be incumbent upon all parties to present all available evidence. ... An appeal from a decision of the commissioner . . . may be taken to the superior court.... At such hearing a full trial shall be had before a justice of the superior court....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">When faced, as we are now, with a question of statutory interpretation, we must determine legislative intent. <em>Corson v. Brown Prods., Inc., </em>119 N.H. 20, 23, 397 A.2d 640, 642 (1979). The statutory language is \u201cthe touchstone of the legislature\u2019s intention.\u201d <em>Greenhalge v. Town of Dunbarton, </em>122 N.H. 1038, 1040, 453 A.2d 1295, 1296 (1982) (citations omitted). \u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, we will give the words their usual and customary meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Peabody, </em>121 N.H. 1075, 1077, 438 A.2d 305, 307 (1981) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\u201cFull trial\u201d is a clear phrase, which in normal English usage is understood to mean a trial in which all relevant evidence may be introduced, unless it must be excluded under the applicable evidentiary and procedural rules of the court. The extent of the evidence which may be presented at the \u201cfull trial\u201d is not limited by the duty imposed upon the parties to present \u201call available evidence\u201d at the labor department hearing. The legislature intended only to provide a \u201cquick informal hearing\u201d at the administrative level while providing the right to \u201cobtain a more formal and extensive hearing\u201d before the superior court. <em>Knight Broadcasting Co. v. Kane, </em>109 N.H. 565, 567, 258 A.2d 355, 356 (1969). The legislature knows how to limit the scope of appeal in cases originating before an administrative agency, <em>compare </em>RSA 282-A:56 (Supp. 1985) <em>with </em>RSA 282-A:64 and :67 (Supp. 1985). It has not done so in this instance, and \u201cfull trial\u201d will not be read to exclude from the full trial any evidence not presented at the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b732-7\">Souter, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Souter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQO\">dissenting: I respectfully dissent from the answer given by the majority of the court, that in the trial of an appeal under RSA 281:37,1, the superior court may receive evidence available at the time of the administrative hearing but not presented here. They cite <em>Knight Broadcasting Co. v. Kane, </em>109 N.H. 565, 258 A.2d 355 (1969) in distinguishing the \u201cfull trial\u201d of an appeal in the superior court from a more summary proceeding appropriate to ensure prompt adjudication at the administrative level. From this they infer that the legislature did not intend to exclude from the trial any evidence available but not presented at the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">I believe that neither <em>Knight </em>nor the statute supports this position. <em>Knight </em>held that the statutory \u201cfull trial\u201d on appeal to the superior court was not limited to questions of law, but was a trial <em>de novo </em>of all disputed issues. The court observed that the legislature evidently intended to provide for a quick and informal hearing before the labor commissioner, subject to a dissatisfied party\u2019s right to a full scale trial on appeal. <em>Knight Broadcasting Co. v. Kane, supra </em>at 567, 258 A.2d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">That evident legislative intent did not endure for long after <em>Knight, </em>however. In the 1971 legislative session the General Court enacted the present requirement of RSA 281:37, I, that \u201cit shall be incumbent on all parties to present all available evidence\u201d at the administrative hearing. Laws 1971, 539:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">This enactment of the \u201cavailable evidence\u201d requirement was apparently a response to <em>Knight, </em>indicating the legislature\u2019s intent to eliminate the option of treating the administrative hearing as a summary rehearsal and to require instead that there be full and serious litigation before the labor commissioner. But as this court recognized in <em>Charles &amp; Nancy, Inc. v. Zessin, </em>118 N.H. 556, 558, 391 A.2d 880, 882 (1978), that legislative intention and the statutory \u201cavailable evidence\u201d requirement are dead letters unless on appeal the superior court must exclude evidence available, but not presented, at the time of the administrative hearing. There is no other effective sanction to enforce the \u201cavailable evidence\u201d requirement. Consequently, I believe that the court\u2019s holding today effectively reads the 1971 amendment out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">I would not, however, rule in this case that the order requiring the further examination was error, or that the results of that examination would necessarily be inadmissible. The statute\u2019s exclusory effect is limited to evidence that was \u201cavailable\u201d but not offered at the administrative level. Evidence thus excludable in the superior court would not include evidence of changed conditions or evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>that could not reasonably have been obtained in time for the administrative hearing. Counsel for the defendants has represented to the court that the results of the examination ordered in this case would fall within the latter category, if not the former. If the superior court should find this to be so, the evidence would be admissible without violence to the general rule excluding from the superior court trial any evidence that was available but not presented below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
