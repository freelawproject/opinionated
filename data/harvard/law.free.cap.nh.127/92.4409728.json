In a Master\u2019s <em>{Robert C. Varney, </em>Esq.) report, approved by the Superior. Court <em>{DiClerico, </em>J.), the court permanently enjoined the defendant, Judith Hampe, and her tenants and agents from interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s use of the easement. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">The facts as found by the master are as follows. The plaintiff and the defendant own, adjoining properties located, respectively, at 33 and 35 Pleasant Street in Concord. Downing House purchased its property in 1983, by deed which conveyed in part: \u201call of grantors\u2019 rights in a certain passway westerly of and adjacent to the tract above conveyed. Said passway being ten feet wide, and extending back a distance of one hundred and fifty feet more or less from Pleasant Street.\u201d The plaintiff has since renovated and improved its building and premises, and seeks to use the passway to get to and from a parking lot in the rear of its building. The defendant purchased the 35 Pleasant Street property in 1981 and has since converted it from a residential to a commercial property.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The easement in question originated in 1882, in a recorded deed of Lucy Grover, the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title, granting to Lewis Downing, Jr., the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, \u201ca right over my land situate on the south side of Pleasant Street in said Concord ten feet wide and extending southerly from said Pleasant Street on the easterly side of my lot and adjoining land of said Downing one hundred fifty feet to be used as a passway by him and his heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In 1933, a wooden fence approximately four-and-one-half feet high was erected along a portion of the easement. Charles and Margaret Parsons, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title, recorded an affidavit to this effect in the Merrimack County Registry of Deeds. The affidavit reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201c. . . we caused a fence to be erected on both sides of a certain lot of land ... being a passway over the land formerly of Lucy M. Grover ... that this fence remained so erected for twenty-four hours ... so that said passway was open for our private use and travel unobstructed by encumbrances of any sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A portion of the fence remained in place <em>after </em>the twenty-four hour period, along the westerly side of plaintiff\u2019s property, apparently to protect the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors\u2019 garden and to keep dogs on the property. The fence contained no gates or openings and prevented any use of the passway for ingress or egress to or from the plaintiff\u2019s lot. In addition, two large elm trees approximately twenty-four feet apart had grown in the passway so that it would be impossible for vehicular traffic to drive into the plaintiff\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">In 1953 or 1954, Mrs. Parsons, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, informed Mrs. Mullin, the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title, that the Parsonses had an easement over their property for the purpose of maintaining the exterior of the westerly side of their building.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the master should have found that the easement over the passway had been abandoned, except for purposes of maintenance of the westerly side of the plaintiff\u2019s building, by the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title for forty years or longer by non-use as evidenced by the erection of a fence with no gate or opening and by the growth of the two large elm trees in the passway. The defendant further argues that the plaintiff\u2019s use of the passway as sole access to a seventeen-car parking lot is an unreasonable expansion of the original grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">We will not set aside a master\u2019s findings of factual determinations concerning abandonment if they are supported by the evidence, even if the evidence is conflicting, <em>Cricenti v. Bewley, </em>120 N.H. 352, 353, 415 A.2d 675, 676 (1980), especially when the master is aided by a view of the property, as was the case here. <em>Delaney v. Gurrieri, </em>122 N.H. 819, 822, 451 A.2d 394, 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number> It is well established that mere non-use of an easement does not result in its loss or destruction, even if continued for a long period of time. <em>Bruchhausen v. Walton, </em>111 N.H. 98, 104, 276 A.2d 6, 10 (1971); <em>Gagnon v. Carrier, </em>96 N.H. 409, 411, 77 A.2d 868, 869 (1951). Non-use may support a finding of intent to abandon, however, if the owner of the dominant estate performs \u201cclear, unequivocal and decisive acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 77 A.2d at 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">There was conflicting evidence presented to the master concerning when the fence was erected and for what purpose. The statement in the Merrimack County Registry of Deeds indicating that the fence was erected \u201c... so that said passway was open for our private use and travel and unobstructed by encumbrances of any sort\u201d was given particular emphasis by the master, who inferred from it that the Parsonses were thereby reaffirming their right to use the passway. Because there was evidence to support this finding, we cannot say that the master erred in finding as he did. <em>Cricenti v. Bewley, supra </em>at 354, 415 A.2d at 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The master further found that the growth of the two elm trees did not result in a permanent and total interference with the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors\u2019 use and enjoyment of the easement, and that allowing the trees to grow did not necessarily indicate the predecessors\u2019 intent to abandon the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"> While the defendant is correct in stating that an abandonment could have taken place after 1933, the maintenance of the fence is not sufficient to compel a finding of an \u201cunequivocal\u201d act of abandonment. <em>See Bruchhausen v. Walton, </em>111 N.H. at 104, 276 A.2d at 10. \u201cThe holder of an easement does not forfeit a part of it because he has no present need for it or because he is unlikely to exercise the whole of it.\u201d <em>Gagnon v. Carrier, </em>96 N.H. at 411, 77 A.2d at 869. Also, the court may consider the permanency of any structure or structures in determining whether their erection signals an intent to abandon. Restatement of Property \u00a7 504, comment e (1944). The master found that the fence and trees could easily have been removed at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The defendant next contends that the proposed use of the passway as the sole access to a seventeen-car parking lot is an unreasonable use of the easement because it creates a safety hazard, as well as other problems not foreseen by the original parties. She contends that the advantages to the plaintiff are outweighed by the disadvantages to the defendant, such as the loss of parking spaces on the street and loss of a place to pile snow. She also maintains that, because the plaintiff could have used its own driveway to gain access to the parking lot, but elected rather to grass over this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>driveway and use the ten-foot passway instead, the use is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">In considering what uses may be made of an easement, this court applies the \u201creasonable use\u201d theory. <em>Sakansky v. Wein, </em>86 N.H. 337, 339, 169 A. 1, 2 (1933). \u201cWhat is or is not a reasonable use of a way does not become crystallized at any particular moment of time.\u201d <em>Sakansky v. Wein, supra </em>at 341, 169 A. at 3. If the change of a use is a normal development from conditions existing at the time of the grant, such as an increased volume of traffic, the enlargement of a use is not considered to burden unreasonably the servient estate. <em>Logan v. Brodrick, </em>29 Wash. App. 796, 800, 631 P.2d 429, 432 (1981). The uses to which easements may be put are questions of fact to be arrived at by considering all of the surrounding circumstances, including location, the uses of both parties\u2019 properties and \u201c\u2018the advantage of one owner\u2019s use and the disadvantage to the other owner caused by that use.\u2019\u201d <em>Titcomb v. Anthony, </em>126 N.H. 434, 439, 492 A.2d 1373, 1376 (1985) (quoting <em>Delaney v. Gurrieri, supra </em>at 821, 451 A.2d at 395).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">When the easement in this case was conveyed and the uses authorized under it set forth, its use was intended to be incidental to a residential use. The master found and the evidence clearly indicates, however, that both properties, as well as the surrounding area, have been converted to commercial use. Although the passway was not intended in 1882 to be used for light passenger vehicles, what is reasonable today need not be determined by reference to the situation as it existed in 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff could have used its own driveway to gain access to the parking lot is in itself not evidence of an unreasonable use. The servient estate has no right to insist upon the use of any other land of the dominant estate, \u201cregardless of how little damage or inconvenience such use of the dominant estate might occasion.\u201d <em>Sakansky v. Wein, supra </em>at 340, 169 A. at 3. On the basis of the evidence before him, the master could reasonably conclude-that there was no abandonment of the easement, and that its present use is not an unreasonable expansion of the original grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-6\">SOUTER, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
