The sole issue on appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant assaulted Michael Marquis in an attempt to induce Marquis to withhold testimony in the defendant\u2019s burglary prosecution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The relevant provisions of RSA 641:5 state that \u201ca person is guilty of a class B felony if . . . believing that an official proceeding ... or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, he attempts to induce or otherwise cause a person to . . . withhold any testimony, information, document or thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The facts of this case relating to the witness tampering charge are disputed, but the background is clear. The defendant and Marquis committed a burglary in Manchester in which jewelry valued at approximately ten thousand dollars was stolen. The police suspected Marquis, who was 16 years old at the time of the burglary, and brought him in for questioning. Upon learning that someone else was involved, the police told Marquis that the charges against him would be dropped in exchange for evidence to convict the other perpetrator, the defendant herein. Marquis then implicated the defendant, against whom charges were later brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">About one year after the burglary, the defendant, who had heard that Marquis might testify against him, met Marquis on the street in Manchester. Words were exchanged between the two, after which the defendant assaulted Marquis by punching him and kneeing him in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The testimony pertaining to the events preceding the assault is contradictory. The defendant alleges that Marquis \u201cgot wise\u201d and stated that he could put the defendant \u201caway for so long until they have to pump daylight into you\u201d; Marquis alleges that he merely stated that the police had not charged him with any offense and that he did not know if he would be testifying against the defendant. In addition, Marquis stated that after the assault the defendant threatened to break Marquis\u2019s arm if he testified. The defendant disputes this testimony, and stated that he assaulted Marquis in a moment of anger.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The defendant and Marquis do not dispute the fact that before they committed the burglary, Marquis had agreed to take \u201cthe rap\u201d if charges were brought because Marquis was a juvenile at the time and probably would not have received a prison sentence for committing the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> We have often stated that in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence which led to a conviction the evidence must be considered \u2018\u201cin the light most favorable to the State with all reasonable inferences therefrom.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Holt, </em>124 N.H. 645, 647, 474 A.2d 1031, 1033 (1984) (quoting <em>State v. Gilbert, </em>115 N.H. 665, 666, 348 A.2d 713, 714 (1975)). We will deem the evidence insufficient only if \u201c\u2018no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. </em>Martin, 121 N.H. 1032, 1034, 437 A.2d 308, 309 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In addressing the burden of proof in criminal cases, we have said that \u201c[t]he State need not prove each evidentiary fact beyond a reasonable doubt, but, rather, \u2018[t]he decisive issue is whether on all the evidence, guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Stauff, 126 </em>N.H. 186, 189, 489 A.2d 140, 142 (1985) (quoting <em>State v. Palumbo, </em>113 N.H. 329, 330, 306 A.2d 793, 795 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In this case, we cannot say that no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant knew that Marquis might testify against him, and it was the province of the jury to decide whether the assault and the alleged threat after the assault provided sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to influence the witness\u2019s testimony. Whether the defendant acted in anger, or with the intent to attempt to induce the witness to withhold testimony, or both, are issues for the trier of fact. Moreover, the credibility of the witnesses is for the jury to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The defendant argues that the altercation occurred during a chance meeting in a public place, that a non-threatening conversation preceded the attack, and that Marquis did not call out for help. Moreover, the defendant implies that, given the fact that one year passed between the burglary and the assault, he would have acted sooner if he had wanted to coerce Marquis to withhold testimony. These are additional factors bearing on the issue of guilt, but it is clear that the jury did not accept this line of reasoning. Thus, as a matter of law, we will not alter the jury\u2019s findings based on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The defendant relies in part on <em>People v. Nix, </em>476 N.E.2d 797 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) in arguing that the evidence of intent was insufficient. In that case, which involved the offense of harassment of a witness, the court found that the defendant\u2019s statements were innocuous, that the encounter occurred by chance, that it occurred in a public place, and that the witness at no time called out for help. <em>Nix, supra </em>at 799. We distinguish the present case from <em>Nix </em>on two grounds. First, <em>Nix </em>involved a less serious altercation between the defendant and the witness <em>(Nix </em>was acquitted on charges <em>of </em>battery and aggravated battery). Second, there was no testimony similar to that of the alleged threat to break Marquis\u2019s arm. This testimony, together with the other evidence presented, was sufficient to support a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the judge, in his instructions to the jury, \u201cparticularized the indictment as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>proof required for conviction,\u201d and \u201csaid nothing about proof of \u2018threatening to break his arm.\u2019\u201d Since defense counsel failed to object to the jury instructions when they were given, this contention is not properly before us. <em>State v. Niquette, </em>122 N.H. 870, 873, 451 A.2d 1292, 1294 (1982). <em>Cf. </em>Super. Ct. R. 77-A. Even if it were, we find that the judge\u2019s instructions were sufficient. He clearly stated the charge, <em>i.e., </em>whether \u201cthe defendant purposely attempted to induce Michael Marquis to withhold his testimony at an upcoming burglary trial by punching him in the face and threatening to break his arm,\u201d and then stated that \u201cthe issue for you to decide is whether or not that element of the charge against the defendant has been proven to you from the evidence in this case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The instructions, therefore, were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We conclude that on the basis of the evidence presented a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
