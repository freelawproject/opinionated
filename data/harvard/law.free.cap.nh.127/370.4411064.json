The officers arrested the defendant and seized the bong, cigarettes, and papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">A search conducted at a later hour, pursuant to a warrant, revealed a baggie of marijuana in a shirt pocket and another baggie in a freezer located in the apartment. The defendant\u2019s girlfriend identified the shirt as belonging to the defendant. The defendant was subsequently tried in Superior Court (Johnson, J.) and convicted of possession of a controlled drug, second offense. <em>See </em>RSA 318-d'2,1, :26.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The defendant raises two issues on appeal. Relying on <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 471 A.2d 347 (1983), the defendant first asserts that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him, and that the cigarettes and drug paraphernalia they later seized should have been suppressed. In <em>Ball </em>we held that a police officer did not have probable cause to seize a partially smoked hand-rolled cigarette observed by the officer in the course of a lawful vehicle stop. The basis for our holding was that the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine did not apply because the incriminating nature of the evidence was not immediately apparent. <em>Id. </em>at 234-35, 471 A.2d at 352-53. We recognized, however, that if an officer can articulate additional corroborating facts, mere suspicion regarding possible contraband may be transformed into a reasonable belief based on probable cause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201cFor instance, it might be shown that the arresting officer had the ability to distinguish hand-rolled marijuana and tobacco cigarettes by sight, or that he perceived the odor of marijuana, or that the defendant made a furtive gesture in an attempt to conceal the cigarette, or that the defendant\u2019s conduct was otherwise incriminating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 236, 471 A.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">In this case the defendant\u2019s incriminating conduct and the presence of the bong provided ample justification for the arrest, and the seizure was therefore lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The defendant also argues that it was error to deny his motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. We find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-12\">Johnson, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
