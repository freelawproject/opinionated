We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">The indictment stated that the defendant \u201cintentionally\u201d attempted to induce one Elila Hadley to testify falsely in pending proceedings against him. Prior to trial the defendant moved to quash the indictment on the ground that it did not allege a culpable mental state as provided in RSA 626:2, and hence did not inform him of the charge with sufficient specificity. The Superior Court <em>(O\u2019Neil, </em>J.) denied the motion, and the defendant was tried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">On appeal the defendant makes the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-18\">(1) one is guilty of a crime only if he acts \u201cpurposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently\u201d with respect to each material element of the offense, RSA 626:2,1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-19\">(2) although RSA 641:5, I, does not specify which of these culpable mental states applies to the offense of wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>ness tampering, in such a case the State must prove that the defendant acted purposely, <em>State v. Kilgus, </em>125 N.H. 739, 743, 484 A.2d 1208, 1212 (1984); <em>see State v. Aldrich, </em>124 N.H. 43, 466 A.2d 938 (1983); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0MF\">(3) the indictment here stated that the defendant acted \u201cintentionally,\u201d rather than \u201cpurposely,\u201d and hence failed to allege the requisite <em>mens rea </em>and should have been quashed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We need not tarry in considering this argument. An indictment is sufficient if it sets forth the offense \u201cfully, plainly, substantially, and formally.\u201d RSA 601:4. We never have held that an indictment must follow precisely the language of the statute on which it is based. \u201cIt is not in general necessary, in an indictment for a statutable offence, to follow the exact wording of the statute. It is sufficient, if the offence be set forth with substantial accuracy and certainty to a reasonable intendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Bachelder, </em>24 F. Cas. 931, 932 (C.C.D.N.H. 1814) (No. 14,490) (Story, J.). <em>See State v. Hamson, </em>104 N.H. 526, 528, 191 A.2d 89, 91 (1963); <em>State v. Gove, </em>34 N.H. 510, 516 (1857). \u201cPurposely\u201d and \u201cintentionally\u201d are synonymous, and the grand jury\u2019s use of the latter term in the indictment is unobjectionable. <em>See Makley v. State, </em>49 Ohio App. 359, 368, 197 N.E. 339, 344, <em>petition dismissed as moot, </em>128 Ohio St. 571, 192 N.E. 738 (1934); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1112 (5th ed. 1979); c/. <em>State v.
