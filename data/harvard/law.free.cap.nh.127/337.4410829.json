Under RSA 651:2, Il-e (Supp. 1983), the trial court then added a disciplinary period of 150 days to each year of the minimum term. Defendant Rounds later moved to modify his sentence, and defendants Wheeler and Evans objected to their sentences, claiming that the minimum sentence exceeded one-half of the maximum, in violation of RSA 651:2, II. In each case, the sentencing judge <em>(DiClerico, </em>J., in Nos. 84-327 and 84-404, and <em>Pappagianis, </em>J., in No. 84-405) denied the motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The issue turns on the application of two statutes. The statute first enacted is RSA 651:2, II, which provides that in felony cases where the maximum term of sentence is less than life imprisonment the court shall impose \u201ca minimum which is not to exceed one-half of the maximum. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The later statute is RSA 651:2, Il-e (Supp. 1983), which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">\u201c[t]o the minimum sentence of every person who is sentenced to imprisonment for a maximum of more than one year shall be added a disciplinary period equal to 150 days for each year of the minimum term of his sentence, to be prorated for any part of the year. The presiding justice shall certify, at the time of sentencing, the minimum term of the sentence and the additional disciplinary period required under this paragraph. This additional disciplinary period may be reduced for good conduct as provided in RSA 651:55-b. There shall be no addition to the sentence under this section for the period of pre-trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>confinement for which credit against the sentence is awarded pursuant to RSA 651:55-c.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The history of this later statute demonstrates that the legislature intended to ensure that prisoners serve the full minimum sentence imposed by the trial court, without reduction by the warden of the State prison on account of a prisoner\u2019s good conduct. <em>See </em>N.H.H.R. Jour. 34-35 (1981-1982); <em>Hearings on HB 20 before the House Judiciary Committee, </em>at 2 (January 25, 1982) (statement of Representative Gregory Ahlgren). To effect this purpose, while retaining an inducement for good conduct, the quoted provision adds a further period above the minimum sentence, which the prisoner may then offset, and eliminate, with credits earned for good conduct as provided by RSA 651:55-b (now RSA 651-A:22 (Supp. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\"> \u201cIt is well established that where several statutes deal with the same subject matter, as is the case here, they should be construed, so far as reasonably possible, not to contradict each other.\u201d <em>State v. Woodman, </em>114 N.H. 497, 500, 323 A.2d 921, 923-24 (1974) (quoting 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02 (rev. 3d ed. G. Sands 1973)). This rule of construction is readily applied in the present case by recognizing that the \u201cminimum sentence\u201d or \u201cminimum term\u201d to which RSA 651:2, Il-e (Supp. 1983) refers is the minimum sentence imposed under paragraph II. Sub-paragraph Il-e does not direct that the \u201cminimum term\u201d be increased. It provides only that a \u201cdisciplinary period\u201d be added to the minimum term. By distinguishing between \u201cminimum term\u201d and \u201cdisciplinary period\u201d in subparagraph Il-e, the legislature made it clear that the disciplinary period is not part of the \u201cminimum term.\u201d Therefore, the addition of a disciplinary period to the longest minimum term possible under paragraph II does not violate the requirement that the minimum term may not exceed one-half the maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>No. 84-327 affirmed; No. 84-404 affirmed; No. 84-405 affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-8\">Johnson, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
