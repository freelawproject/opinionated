For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. In January 1982, following their participation in an undercover scheme known as \u201cOperation Glue\u201d conducted by the New Jersey State Police, the plaintiffs, Edwin Kelly, Abad Cabassa, and Rudolph Deljudice, were indicted by a New Jersey grand jury for conspiracy to rig a publicly exhibited contest and for accepting a bribe in violation of various New Jersey laws. The indictments were later dismissed following a finding that the scam operated by New Jersey officials in order to apprehend jockeys, trainers and owners who were violating racing laws was \u201coutrageous governmental behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>In May 1983, Cabassa and Deljudice applied for jockey licenses in New Jersey. Their applications were denied by the New Jersey Racing Commission because, as a result of their involvement in \u201cOperation Glue,\u201d they lacked sufficient integrity to be licensed in New Jersey. Kelly has not reapplied for a license in New Jersey since the suspension of his license in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In the spring and summer of 1984, all three plaintiffs applied for jockey licenses at Rockingham Park in Salem. After filing written applications, they were informally interviewed by Rockingham Park stewards who, although aware of the plaintiffs\u2019 involvement in \u201cOperation Glue,\u201d made no further inquiry and recommended the plaintiffs for licensure. Based on the stewards\u2019 recommendations, the Commission issued each plaintiff a jockey license. N.H. CODE Admin. Rules Ra. \u00a7 324.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">After the licenses were issued, the Commission learned of the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged involvement in \u201cOperation Glue.\u201d The Commission also learned that Cabassa and Deljudice were denied jockey licenses in New Jersey in 1983. A hearing on the revocation of the licenses was held at which each of the plaintiffs admitted that he had <em>agreed </em>to \u201chold\u201d a horse, but claimed he had not actually intended to carry out his agreement to do so. On October 5, 1984, the Commission revoked the plaintiffs\u2019 licenses for lack of sufficient integrity to be licensed in New Hampshire. It also ruled that the plaintiffs could not reapply for jockey licenses until January 1, 1986, after which time their improper conduct in New Jersey would no longer be considered for future applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The plaintiffs appealed, and the Superior Court <em>(Gray, </em>J.) approved the Master\u2019s <em>(R. Peter Shapiro, </em>Esq.) ruling that the entrapment defense was not applicable and that therefore the Commission could have properly considered evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 illegal actions in New Jersey before it <em>initially </em>granted the jockey licenses. The master also found, however, that the Commission, having once issued the licenses, was estopped from subsequently revoking them, and further, was enjoined from considering the plaintiffs\u2019 previous improper conduct in New Jersey upon review of any future license applications. The Commission appeals, and the plaintiffs have filed a cross-appeal concerning the applicability of the entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Before discussing the issues, we wish to point out that we have stated on a prior occasion that participation in horse racing is \u201ca privilege such as the State may grant or withhold at pleasure. . .. [Horse racing is a] private enterprise which, of its nature, is not only privileged, but which presents a social problem properly com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ing under the exercise and jurisdiction of the police power of the State and which requires strict regulation and supervision.\u201d <em>North Hampton &amp;c. Assn. v. Commission, </em>94 N.H. 156, 159, 48 A.2d 472, 475 (1946). The Commission\u2019s regulatory powers, therefore, are to be distinguished from those of other regulatory agencies because horse racing is \u201can activity which the State may prohibit altogether, not one which it may merely regulate.\u201d <em>Ratti v. Hinsdale Raceway, </em>109 N.H. 270, 272, 249 A.2d 859, 861 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">We first consider whether evidence obtained during an entrapment scheme in New Jersey is admissible in an administrative proceeding in New Hampshire. The master relied on <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 446 (1976), which held that the \u201cprime purpose of the [exclusionary] rule ... is to deter future unlawful police conduct.\u201d As a result, the court did not extend the rule to forbid the use, in the civil proceeding of one sovereign, of the evidence obtained by the enforcement <em>agency of </em>another sovereign. The rationale of <em>Janis </em>is that since there is an insufficient likelihood of deterring the conduct of State police by excluding evidence in another sovereign, the exclusionary rule should not extend to such proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 446-48,456-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"> The plaintiffs argue that proceedings to revoke a professional license are quasi-criminal and therefore the <em>Janis </em>rule does not apply. We disagree. Some State courts have permitted the use of an entrapment defense in proceedings involving the revocation of medical or dental licenses. <em>See Patty v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>9 Cal. 3d 356, 107 Cal. Rptr. 473, 508 P.2d 1121 (1973). In such instances, however, the entrapment was committed by the administrative agency\u2019s own investigators. Where an administrative body of another State in an entirely different proceeding seeks to admit evidence not admissible in a criminal proceeding, the entrapment defense is inapplicable. <em>Kee Wong v. State Bar, </em>15 Cal. 3d 528, 531, 125 Cal. Rptr. 482, 484, 542 P.2d 642, 644 (1975). This is especially true when the function of the administrative or governmental agency is more protective than punitive. <em>Rodriguez v. United States, </em>534 F. Supp. 370, 373-74 (D.P.R. 1982). We hold, therefore, that the master correctly concluded that the entrapment defense did not apply to the Commission\u2019s consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 applications for jockey licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We next consider whether the superior court erred in enjoining the Commission from considering the plaintiffs\u2019 activities in New Jersey in any subsequent applications for jockey licenses before January 1, 1986. The master ruled that the Commission had no authority under RSA chapter 284 or the New Hampshire rules of rac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ing to allow it to issue licenses to the plaintiffs on the basis of the recommendations of the stewards, and to later reconsider its decision based on evidence initially unknown or unavailable to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">The Commission\u2019s authority to revoke the plaintiffs\u2019 licenses following the granting of those licenses is derived from RSA chapter 284. It may revoke jockey licenses \u201cat any time for cause.\u201d RSA 284:19. In addition, the New Hampshire rules of racing, promulgated by the Commission itself, authorize the Commission to \u201crevoke any license if the holder . . . has violated any rule or regulation . . . governing his conduct ... or wher\u00e9 such conduct is objectionable, obnoxious or detrimental to the best interest of racing.\u201d N.H. Code Admin. Rules Ra. \u00a7 324.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The master found N.H. Code Admin. Rules Ra. \u00a7 324.08 inapplicable in this instance on the theory that once the Commission has issued a license, it may not later reconsider its decision using such information as might not have initially been available to it. Such a reading of N.H. Code Admin. Rules Ra. \u00a7 324.08 assumes that there is a time limit imposed on the Commission for discovery of \u201cobjectionable\u201d conduct. We find nothing in the rules of racing and specifically in N.H. Code Admin. Rules Ra. \u00a7 324.08 to support this theory. Such a reading of the rules of racing as they apply to the Commission\u2019s statutory authority under RSA chapter 284 also ignores the Commission\u2019s \u201cultimate control\u201d of the regulation of wagering and racing. <em>Seabrook v. Perkins, 112 </em>N.H. 37, 40, 288 A.2d 688, 690 (1972). The rules of racing do not limit the Commission\u2019s authority to revoke a license, nor do they provide exclusive grounds for revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The master also found that the Commission was estopped from revoking its prior approval of the licenses because, having delegated approval authority to the stewards and having itself granted the licenses, it could not review the issuance of these licenses. Although this court has recognized the use of estoppel against a municipal corporation under certain conditions, private parties when dealing with government officials are charged with \u201cnotice of the extent and limits of their authority\u201d and must \u201cinquire into the power of the corporation or its officers.\u201d <em>City of Concord v. Tompkins, </em>124 N.H. 463, 470, 471 A.2d 1152, 1156 (1984). The plaintiffs\u2019 application forms clearly indicated that \u201cthe [license] may be at any time revoked, cancelled, temporarily suspended or withdrawn by the Commission.\u201d Also, given the Commission\u2019s broad grant of authority under RSA chapter 284, the plaintiffs had notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>of the extent of the Commission\u2019s authority. <em>Id. </em>at 473, 471 A.2d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">We therefore hold that the master erred in ruling that the Commission improperly revoked the plaintiffs\u2019 licenses. We also hold that the plaintiffs, according to the original ruling of the Commission, are ineligible to apply for jockey licenses until January 1, 1986, after which time their conduct in New Jersey will not be considered with respect to future applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
