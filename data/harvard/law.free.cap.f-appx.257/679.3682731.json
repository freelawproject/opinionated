Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 854 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), was as follows. On June 13, 2006, Nobles and Steven Lamonds entered the Lexington State Bank in Davidson County, North Carolina, wearing t-shirts over their heads. Lamonds was holding a sawed-off shotgun; Nobles carried a blue bag. While Lamonds held the gun aimed at them, two of the tellers entered the vault, one carrying the blue bag handed to her by Nobles. The teller managed to include a dye pack in with the money she placed in the blue bag. Lamonds and Nobles left the bank with $190,940 in the blue bag and escaped in a pickup truck. The men were apprehended a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">The jury found Nobles guilty of all four counts of the indictment and the district court sentenced him to a total of 177 months imprisonment. Nobles\u2019 sole argument on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he \u201cwilfully\u201d participated in the robbery or firearms offenses because, as he testified at trial, he was acting under duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). \u201c[A] n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984). A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and inquires whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, this court does not review the credibility of the witnesses and assumes that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Where the evidence supports differing reasonable interpretations, the jury decides which interpretation to credit. <em>Wilson, </em>118 F.3d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Nobles\u2019 challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is predicated entirely on his contention that the jury should have credited his testimony that he acted under duress. However, whether to credit Nobles\u2019 version of events was entirely within the jury\u2019s province, and such credibility determinations will not be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We therefore affirm Nobles\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
