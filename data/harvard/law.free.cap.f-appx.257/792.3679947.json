For the first time on appeal, he argues that the 16-level enhancement he received, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), for having been deported following a prior aggravated felony conviction was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-23\">The instant appeal is barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision in Nino\u2019s plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>agreement, which waiver was knowing and voluntary and is enforceable. <em>See United States v. Melancou, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992); Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(N). The Government seeks to enforce the waiver, and Nino has abandoned any challenge to the validity of his plea or the waiver provision by failing to brief it. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>964 F.2d 365, 371 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
