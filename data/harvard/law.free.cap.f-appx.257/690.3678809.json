The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Powell has not made the requisite showing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-18\"> Because Powell's convictions became final pri- or to the effective date of the AEDPA, he had until April 24, 1997 (one year after the effective date of the statute), to file his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Hernandez v. Caldwell, </em>225 F.3d 435, 438-39 (4th Cir.2000). We therefore agree with Powell that the district court erred in concluding that he had only until November 28, 1995, to file a timely \u00a7 2255 motion. However, we conclude that a certificate of appealability is not warranted because the district court correctly held that Powell's Rule 60(b) motion was not timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
