Dyches was sentenced to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>each bank robbery offense, to run concurrently, and 84 months and 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively, for the firearms convictions, to run consecutively. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Dyches contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court should have granted his motion for a variance in the guidelines range based on his medical history of hypothyroidism and depression. However, the district court appropriately calculated the advisory guideline range and considered it in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>See United, States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006) . Dyches\u2019 medical history does not rise to the level required for an exception to the general principle that \u201cmental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3; <em>see also United States v. Withers, </em>100 F.3d 1142, 1147-48 (4th Cir.1996). Dyches\u2019 sentence, which is within the applicable guidelines range and the statutory maximum for each offense, is therefore reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
