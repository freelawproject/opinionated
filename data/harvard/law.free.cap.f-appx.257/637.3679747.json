He was sentenced to a term of 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Straws\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising as potential issues whether the district court fully complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11, and whether the district court properly handled Straws\u2019 pro se motions at sentencing. Although advised of his right to do so, Straws has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-20\">First, we have thoroughly reviewed the record and find that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 at Straws\u2019 guilty plea hearing. Next, our review of Straws\u2019 pro se motions and his colloquy with the district court at sentencing regarding those motions discloses that Straws knowingly and willingly withdrew the motions after ample opportunity to be heard and confer with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
