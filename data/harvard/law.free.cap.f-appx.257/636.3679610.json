Because Riggs\u2019 petition challenged the calculation of his sentence imposed upon revocation of his supervised release and he has now been released from federal custody, we conclude this appeal is moot. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for that reason. We also deny Riggs\u2019 motion to expedite his appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
