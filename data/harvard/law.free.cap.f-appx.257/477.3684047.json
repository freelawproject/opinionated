Because this appeal presents no substantial ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>tion, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In October 2003, McMillan pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to possession with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(c), and to carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). McMillan was sentenced in January 2004 as a career offender to 262 months in prison, a sentence at the lower end of the applicable guideline range of 262-327 months imprisonment. Despite the fact that McMillan explicitly agreed in the plea agreement that he would not appeal or collaterally challenge his sentence if the court did not impose a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum (which, in this case, was life imprisonment), McMillan filed an appeal to this Court. The government, in turn, filed a motion to enforce the appellate waiver and to dismiss McMillan\u2019s appeal. In an order dated July 15, 2004, we granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed McMillan\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 04-1227. We also denied his petition for <em>en banc </em>rehearing, wherein he challenged the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the ability of a sentencing judge to select and apply the career offender sentencing range set forth in U.S.S.G \u00a7 4B1.1 given the principles espoused by the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. Neto Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Supreme Court likewise denied McMillan\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari on February 22, 2005. <em>McMillan v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1153, 125 S.Ct. 1386, 161 L.Ed.2d 118 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">McMillan thereafter sought to challenge his sentence by filing a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, McMillan argued that he was entitled to resentencing based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that the District Court erroneously departed upward from an otherwise applicable guideline range because his convictions in the New Jersey state court were calculated as four separate offenses rather than a single prior offense. McMillan further asserted that counsel rendered ineffective assistance insofar as counsel did not fully advise him of the consequences of his appellate waiver, failed to advise him of his rights pursuant to <em>Apprendi, </em>and failed to fully investigate his guilty plea in New Jersey state court. In a Judgment Order entered on September 2, 2005, the District Court determined that McMillan was not entitled to collateral relief from his sentence and denied his \u00a7 2255 motion. The District Court concluded that McMillan knowingly, voluntarily and expressly waived his right to collaterally attack his sentence, and that enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. Moreover, the District Court concluded that, even if it could reach the merits of McMillan\u2019s claims, it would find each of them to be without merit. McMillan did not appeal the District Court\u2019s order disposing of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Instead, McMillan waited nearly two years and filed the underlying motion for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), arguing that the District Court was obligated to \u201crectify his applicable guideline to conform to his offense of conviction\u201d as mandated by Amendment 591 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) and recent Supreme Court decisions, including, <em>inter alia, Booker </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>McMillan further argued that the District Court was required, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36, to correct a \u201cclerical error\u201d by the United States Probation Office in his Pre-Sentence Investigation Report classifying him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>as a career offender on the basis of his state court convictions and calculating his sentencing exposure accordingly. The District Court summarily denied McMillan\u2019s \u00a7 3582 and Rule 36 motions as frivolous, noting that the claims raised therein were addressed by the court in its order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion and are wholly without merit. The court denied his motion for reconsideration as well, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s decision to summarily deny McMillan relief, and similarly dispose of his appeal. Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented by the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. The District Court properly concluded that McMillan was not merely attempting to have a clerical error corrected, and that the substantive allegations underlying his claims were addressed in its order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion and were not appropriately advanced in a \u00a7 3582 motion. Moreover, it committed no abuse of discretion in denying McMillan\u2019s reconsideration motion. <em>See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We note that, as a general matter, a court cannot modify a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed without specific authorization. <em>See, e.g., United States v. DeLeo, </em>644 F.2d 300, 301 (3d Cir.1981). McMillan argues that his sentence should be reduced based on Amendment 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines. While under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a District Court may reduce a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has <em>subsequently </em>been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ...,\u201d Amendment 591 became effective November 1, 2000, more than three years before McMillan was sentenced. Additionally, Amendment 591 changed the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(a) and lB1.2(a) which are used to determine the guideline to be applied to the offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>245 F.3d 294, 301-02 (3d Cir.2001). McMillan, however, was sentenced as a career offender. The offense level and criminal history for a career offender are determined using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">McMillan\u2019s argument for resentencing under <em>Booker </em>fares no better. While the effect of <em>Booker </em>was to make the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, 543 U.S. at 757, 125 S.Ct. 1172, <em>Booker </em>did not result in the amendment of any sentencing range. Thus, <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See, e.g., Cortorreal v. United States, </em>486 F.3d 742, 744 (2d Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1007 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d). <em>Cf. United States v. McBride, </em>283 F.3d 612, 614 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>did not provide a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it was unrelated to any change in the Sentencing Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment denying McMillan relief under both \u00a7 3582 and Rule 36. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">. We note that the Clerk issued a letter dated August 28, 2007, advising the parties that we would consider whether a certificate of appealability is required for this appeal. A certificate of appealability is required where the appeal is taken from \"the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Although some of McMillan\u2019s arguments reflect an attempt to challenge his sentence, any such attempts in the context of a motion for reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are prohibited. Having reviewed the District Court record, we do not consider the District Court\u2019s order as the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Accordingly, we conclude that a certificate of appealability is not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
