Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). On appeal, Martinez asserts the following arguments: (1) the district court erred in its summary judgment order by failing to address his FTCA claims, prior to dismissing his complaint in its entirety; (2) the district court erred by entering summary judgment, in favor of Defendants Minnis and James, on Martinez\u2019s retaliation claims, because those claims were either unexhausted or unsupported by the evidence; and (3) the district court erred by dismissing, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, several defendants because they were mere supervisors and Martinez had not shown a causal connection between them and the alleged constitutional violations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">The relevant facts are these. In August 2006, Martinez filed his original complaint, naming as defendants Leroy Minnis, a \u201cD-3 Unit counselor\u201d in the Special Housing Unit (\u201cSHU\u201d) of the United States Peni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>tentiary in Atlanta, Georgia (\u201cUSP-Atlanta\u201d) in which Mart\u00ednez was incarcerated; Lieutenant D. Cartrette of USP-Atlanta; R. James, a \u201cD-3 Unit Manager\u201d of the SHU; Captain R. Branch; Warden R. Wiley; the Director of the Southeast Regional Office of the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d); and the Director of the BOP. Martinez alleged that he had been harassed, retaliated against, and sexually assaulted during his incarceration at USP-Atlanta.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The district court dismissed, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the claims against Cartrette, Branch, Wiley, and the Directors of the Southeastern Regional Office and the BOP, based on Martinez\u2019s failure to assert that they were directly involved in the incidents on which Martinez based his <em>Bivens </em>claims and his failure to allege a causal connection sufficient to establish supervisory liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court entered summary judgment on Martinez\u2019s remaining claims based on the following conclusions: (1) on his sexual battery claim against Minnis, Martinez failed to present any evidence showing that Minnis\u2019s touching of Martinez\u2019s genitals was done with an intent to sexually assault Martinez, as opposed to pursuant to the BOP\u2019s policy requiring prison officials to conduct random \u201cpat searches\u201d of inmates, for the purpose of finding contraband; (2) on Martinez\u2019s retaliation claims against Minnis, there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning Minnis\u2019s lack of a retaliatory motive; and (3) on his retaliation claims against both Minnis and James, that Martinez had not exhausted his available administrative remedies. In its order, the district court did not mention the FTCA claims, but ordered the action \u201cdismissed in its entirety.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We first consider Martinez\u2019s argument concerning the district court\u2019s failure to address his FTCA claims. Where a district court fails to provide a sufficient explanation, so as to permit this Court the opportunity to engage in meaningful appellate review, we may vacate and remand to the district court with instructions to enter a fuller order. <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091-92 (11th Cir.2007). However, where the record is sufficient to determine that the district court\u2019s decision was correct, we may review such an order. See <em>Clay v. Equifax, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 952, 957-59 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">It is well-settled that we <em>must </em>address subject matter jurisdiction wherever it may be lacking. <em>Marshall v. Gibson\u2019s Prods., Inc. of Plano, </em>584 F.2d 668, 672 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>whether subject matter jurisdiction exists. <em>Asociacion De Empleados Del Area Canalera v. Panama Canal Comm\u2019n, </em>329 F.3d 1235, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">In the FTCA, Congress authorized a limited waiver of sovereign immunity when federal employees commit torts while acting within the scope of them employment. <em>Means v. United States, </em>176 F.3d 1376, 1378-79 (11th Cir.1999). As a prerequisite to bringing suit under the FTCA, a potential plaintiff must first present the claim to the appropriate Federal agency. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). A district court lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>jurisdiction over an FTCA action if the plaintiff has not complied with the notice requirements of \u00a7 2675(a). <em>Burchfield v. United States, </em>168 F.3d 1252, 1254-55 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also Barnett v. Okeechobee Hosp., </em>283 F.3d 1232, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]he administrative notice requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675 \u2018is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Lykins v. Pointer Inc., </em>725 F.2d 645, 646 (11th Cir.1984))). Moreover, \u201ca tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b); <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 771, 773 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">For purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b), a claim is \u201cpresented\u201d to a federal agency when written notification is received by that agency. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2(a). When a claim is received by an agency other than the appropriate agency, the claim must be forwarded to the appropriate agency, and is considered \u201cpresented\u201d when it is received by the appropriate agency. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2(b)(1). An FTCA claim filed against the BOP alleging an injury that occurred within the geographical boundaries of one of the BOP\u2019s administrative regions must be presented to that regional office (here, the Southeast Regional Office). 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 543.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Here, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Martinez\u2019s FTCA claims. The last of the allegedly tortious conduct occurred on November 19, 2003. Martinez mailed his administrative claim on November 4, 2005, to the Director of the BOP, where it was received on November 15, 2005 and was transferred to Southeast Regional Office of the Bureau of Prisons. It was received by the Southeast Regional Office on December 6, 2005. Because Martinez\u2019s did not \u201cpresent\u201d his FTCA claims, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2(a), to the appropriate agency within two years of the date the injury in question was alleged to have occurred, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Barnett, </em>283 F.3d at 1237-38 (holding that dismissal of a FTCA claim on statute of limitations grounds is a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1)). Accordingly, the claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Next, Martinez argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to Defendants Minnis and James on his First Amendment retaliation claims. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>McCormick v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>333 F.3d 1234, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence establishes that there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cThe evidence, and all reasonable inferences, must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, here [Martinez]\u201d. <em>McCormick, </em>333 F.3d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">As a preliminary matter, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) requires prisoners to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing suit with respect to prison conditions. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d). This exhaustion requirement \u201capplies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong,\u201d and mandates strict exhaustion, \u201cirrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Meadows, </em>418 F.3d 1152, 1155 (11th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2978, 165 L.Ed.2d 988 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1325-28 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that prisoner asserting <em>Bivens </em>claim must exhaust available administrative remedies, even when those remedies are futile or inadequate).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Martinez alleged that Defendant Minnis took a variety of actions against him, in retaliation for Martinez\u2019s filing of numerous grievances or requests for administrative relief. These actions included: (1) Martinez was fired as an orderly; (2) he was required to lift boxes heavier than his medical restrictions permitted; (3) he was sexually assaulted; (4) Martinez\u2019s cell was subject to excessive \u201cshakedowns\u201d; (5) Martinez was assigned to work in \u201cConstruction 5\u201d; (6) he was placed in the SHU; and (7) he was verbally abused. Martinez also alleged that Defendant James retaliated against him (8) by refusing him permission to transfer to the west yard, and (9) by approving Minnis\u2019s acts of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Of the foregoing alleged actions, Martinez filed administrative grievances, and thus exhausted his administrative remedies, only as to the allegations of sexual assault, being fired as an orderly, being required to carry heavy boxes, and being subjected to intimidation. As to the others, Martinez\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies defeats his claims, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">As for the remaining, exhausted retaliation claims, \u201c[t]he First Amendment forbids prison officials from retaliating against prisoners for exercising the right of free speech.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1249 (11th Cir.2003). To state a retaliation claim based on the First Amendment, it is not necessary for a prisoner to allege violation of a separate and distinct constitutional right. <em>Id. </em>\u201cRather, the gist of a retaliation claim is that a prisoner is penalized for exercising the right of free speech. A prisoner can establish retaliation by demonstrating that the prison official\u2019s actions were the result of his having filed a grievance concerning the conditions of his imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">A retaliation claim essentially entails three elements: (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) an adverse action was taken against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>conduct; and (3) there is a causal connection between elements one and two\u2014 that is, the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiffs protected conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><em>Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, </em>175 F.3d 378, 394 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In order to establish a First Amendment retaliation claim, a prisoner must show that the actions complained of\u2014which are otherwise constitutional\u2014were taken against him because he exercised his First Amendment rights. <em>Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1249. Martinez submitted no evidence to support his belief that retaliation was the motivation behind the shakedowns, being fired as an orderly, being sexually assaulted, or being forced to carry heavy boxes. Instead, he merely asserted, without evidentiary support, that these actions were motivated by a retaliatory animus. On this record, the district court did not err by entering summary judgment as to Martinez\u2019s properly exhausted claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Finally, Martinez argues that the district court erred in dismissing, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, his claims against Cartrette, Branch, Wiley, and Directors of the Southeastern Regional Office and the BOP. The district court concluded that these defendants were mere supervisors and Martinez had not shown a causal connection between them and the alleged constitutional violations. We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1908, 167 L.Ed.2d 568 (2007). We \u201cmay affirm the district court on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., </em>433 F.3d 794, 797-98 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Section 1915A of Title 28 requires district courts to screen civil complaints filed by prisoners against governmental entities or employees, and dismiss any portion of the complaint that is frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune to such relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a)-(b). Supervisory officials are not liable in a <em>Bivens </em>action on the basis of respondeat superior or vicarious liability. <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>325 F.3d 1228, 1234 (11th Cir.2003). Rather, \u201c[supervisory liability under <em>Bivens </em>occurs either when the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation or when there is a causal connection between actions of the supervising official and the alleged constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and editing marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">There is no suggestion that the supervisory defendants personally participated in the alleged constitutional violations. Accordingly, Martinez was required to show a causal connection between the actions of the supervisory defendants and the alleged constitutional violations. The causal connection can be established when: (1) \u201ca history of widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation, and he fails to do so\u201d; (2) \u201ca supervisor\u2019s improper custom or policy results in deliberate indifference to constitutional rights\u201d; or (3) there are \u201cfacts which support an inference that the supervisor directed the subordinates to act unlawfully or knew that the subordinates would act unlawfully and .failed to stop them from doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234-35 (citations, quotations, and editing marks omitted). \u201cThe standard by which a supervisor is held liable in. [his] individual capacity for the actions of a subordinate is extremely rigorous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Martinez\u2019s complaint made <em>no </em>allegations whatsoever against the Directors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the BOP and Southeastern Regional Office, and thus the district court correctly dismissed them from the case. As for the other three supervisory defendants, Martinez alleged that Minnis had threatened to come up with an excuse to assign Martinez to the SHU because Martinez had filed grievances about an error in the prison\u2019s computer system, that Minnis had carried out this threat, and that Martinez had informed Defendants Cartrette, Branch, and Wiley of the situation at a time when they could have prevented Martinez\u2019s placement in the SHU. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Minnis violated Martinez\u2019s First Amendment rights and that- Cartrette, Branch, and Wiley had been informed Minnis was acting unlawfully and failed to prevent him from doing so, because Martinez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to the alleged-</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">ly retaliatory placement in the SHU, the district court did not err by entering summary judgement in favor of the supervisory defendants. Therefore, even if Martinez\u2019s original complaint did allege a constitutional violation, his claims against Cartrette, Branch, and Wiley were due to be dismissed for failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In sum, we discern no reversible error in the district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915A dismissals or its grant of summary judgment and dismissal of Martinez\u2019s FTCA claims. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-11\">. For purposes of clarity, we have reordered these arguments. We discern no error relating to Martinez's other arguments, including that the district court abused its discretion by denying his second motion to amend his complaint and that the district court erred by entering summary judgment on his Eighth Amendment claim, relating to Defendant Minnis\u2019s touching of Martinez's groin area, including his genitals, during a routine random pat-down search of numerous inmates as they left the dining hall. The district court concluded that Martinez\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim satisfied neither the objective prong nor the subjective prong for such a claim since it was undisputed that Martinez suffered no more than a <em>de minimus </em>injury from the isolated incident(the objective prong) and he failed to present evidence that Minnis had a \"sufficiently culpable state of mind\u201d (the subjective prong). <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1111 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that \"severe or repetitive sexual abuse of a prisoner by a prison official can violate the Eighth Amendment\u201d and discussing objective and subjective components of such a claim), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1908, 167 L.Ed.2d 568 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">. Martinez does not challenge the district court's \u00a7 1915A dismissal of his claims based on alleged poor medical care and alleged unsanitary conditions. Therefore, he has abandoned any issues relating to those claims. <em>See Allison v. McGhan Med. Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1317 n. 17 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that issues not advanced in an initial brief are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-12\">. <em>See Bonner v. Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc) </em>(adopting as binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit, all decisions of die former Fifth Circuit announced prior to October 1, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\">. Martinez\u2019s allegations concerning problems with mail delivery are misplaced. The two-year deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional, <em>Burchfield, </em>168 F.3d at 1254-55, and even if the deadline was subject to equitable tolling, Martinez lias not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances justifying such tolling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. Although he filed a request for administrative remedy based on his placement in the SHU, the request alleged only that he was placed in the SHU \"without reasonable cause, but motivated for personal reasons by [Minnis].\u201d The request indicates that Minnis provoked, harassed, and insulted Minnis every day until he \u201cfound\" an excuse to place Minnis in the SHU. The request for administrative remedy makes <em>no </em>allegation that Martinez had filed any sort of grievance prior to Minnis's actions or as to why Minnis took action against Martinez. In fact, the request for administrative remedies did not mention retaliation or use any words synonymous with or indicating retaliation, nor did it provide the BOP with notice of allegedly retaliatory action or the opportunity to correct it. On this record, Martinez also did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the allegation that Minnis placed Martinez in the SHU as a retaliatory act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
