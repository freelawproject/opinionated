A Notice to Appear, issued by the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) on February 6, 2004, stated that in May 2003, petitioner, following travel abroad, applied for admission to the United States as a lawful permanent resident and was paroled as an alien who had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 15, 2005, at the conclusion of a removal hearing at which petitioner was represented by counsel, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), in the exercise of her discretion, refused to grant petitioner a waiver of inadmissibility under former Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), and ordered him removed pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Petitioner appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), contending that counsel was ineffective at the removal hearing in several respects, and that the IJ denied him due process with her hostile questioning and \u201cerred as a matter of law and discretion in deciding the case against him.\u201d Petitioner also moved the BIA to reopen the removal proceedings and remand the case to the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The BIA dismissed the appeal on August 7, 2006, and denied petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen. It held that petitioner had not demonstrated that he was \u201cdeserving of a discretionary grant of section 212(c) relief,\u201d that his attorney\u2019s performance had not prejudiced his case, that he had \u201creceived a full and fair hearing,\u201d and that the IJ had \u201cacted in an acceptable manner\u201d and had not demonstrated bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">On September 6, 2006, petitioner moved the BIA to reconsider its August 7, 2006 order and requested a 21-day extension in which to file a supporting brief. On September 29, 2006, he filed a supplemental motion to recuse the IJ and remand his removal proceedings. On October 26, 2006, the BIA denied his September 6, 2006 motion for reconsideration, as well as his September 29, 2006 motion to recuse the IJ and for remand. On November 15, 2006, petitioner moved the BIA to reconsider its October 26, 2006 order and resubmitted his motion to recuse the IJ and for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">On February 28, 2007, the BIA denied petitioner\u2019s November 15 motion for reconsideration, first noting that petitioner could not seek \u201creconsideration of an order denying a previously filed motion to reconsider.\u201d It then characterized his motion to recuse and for remand, which was attached to his November 15 motion, as a motion to reconsider its \u201cAugust 7, 2006, order because, in essence, it alleges that in that decision [the BIA] erroneously rejected [his] prior allegations of judicial bias.\u201d Thus, it found that the motion was successive and that the arguments made in the motion either were or could have been raised on direct appeal. On March 16, 2007, he petitioned us to review the BIA\u2019s orders dated February 28, 2007, October 26, 2006, and August 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s initial argument is that we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s orders of August 7 and October 26, 2006, because the issues pending at the time those orders issued were \u201cpreserved\u201d by his timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final February 28, 2007 order. Thus, he argues, we may review whether: (1) he received a \u201cfull and fair\u201d hearing from the IJ; (2) the IJ should have been recused; and (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">By statute, an alien seeking review of a final order of the BIA must file a petition for review within 30 days of the issuance of the final order. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). \u201c[T]he statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is mandatory and jurisdictional, [and, therefore,] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation omitted). The finality of a removal order is not affected by the filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Because petitioner failed to file timely petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s August 7 and October 26, 2006 orders, we lack jurisdiction to review any of the issues related to those underlying orders, and accordingly, the petition is dismissed, to the extent that it relates to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Petitioner next argues that, although the jurisdictional-stripping provisions of INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (C) apply to his petition for review, we still may review his constitutional claims, including his arguments that: (1) he did not receive a full and fair hearing before the IJ and thus was denied due process; and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel in derogation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Petitioner failed to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s August 7, 2006 order, where the BIA found that he received a \u201cfull and fail' hearing\u201d free from any bias on the part of the IJ, and his intervening motions did not toll the period in which to petition for review. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a); <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that we have jurisdiction to review his due process claims is without merit, as he failed to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order rejecting those claims. Accordingly, his petition is dismissed to the extent that it relates to due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Petitioner\u2019s final argument is that the BIA abused its discretion by denying reconsideration of its August 7 and October 26, 2006 orders. He further contends that the BIA erred by: (1) denying his September 6, 2006 motion for reconsideration; (2) construing his September 6, 2006 motion as merely a motion for a time extension; and (3) recharacterizing his November 15, 2006 motion to recuse the IJ and for remand as a motion to reconsider its August 7, 2006 order and finding it to be successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Judicial review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>omitted) (addressing a motion to reopen). Furthermore, an alien \u201cmay file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(5); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in issuing its February 28, 2007 order by holding that: (1) petitioner statutorily was barred from filing a motion to reconsider the denial of an earlier motion to reconsider; and (2) his motion to recuse the IJ and for remand actually was a successive motion for reconsideration, as it was identical to his September 29, 2006, supplement to his first motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review of the BIA\u2019s February 28, 2006 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">DISMISSED, in part; DENIED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\">. The Notice to Appear stated that in December 1985, petitioner was convicted in New York of two counts of second degree grand larceny, and that in March 1991, his parole (following imprisonment for those offenses) was revoked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
