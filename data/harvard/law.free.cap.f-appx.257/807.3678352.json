He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>argues that the district court erred by denying him a safety valve adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. Of the five criteria for a \u00a7 5C1.2 adjustment, the only one at issue here is the requirement that the defendant truthfully provide the Government with all the information and evidence he has concerning the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). The district court heard directly from Gonzalez-Torres and concluded that his story, including that a man he barely knew asked him to transport approximately 200 kilograms of marijuana on the spur of the moment, was incredible. The district court\u2019s credibility determination, which is entitled to deference, was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457-58 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1120, 126 S.Ct. 1931, 164 L.Ed.2d 679 (2006); <em>United States v.
