The district court sentenced Lewis to 60 months of imprisonment on the conspiracy to interfere with commerce charge and 120 months of imprisonment on the interference with commerce charge, to run concurrently, and 10 years on the first firearm charge and 30 years on the second firearm charge, to run consecutively to each other and to Lewis\u2019s other sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">Lewis argues that the district court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence of 30 years of imprisonment on the second firearm charge pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i) because that provision requires an intervening conviction between the commission of the prior and subsequent firearm-related offenses and thus should not be applied to multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions obtained in the same proceeding. Lewis concedes that this issue is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), but he contends that he is raising the issue to preserve it for further Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-21\">As Lewis concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Deal, </em>508 U.S. at 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993; <em>United States v. Hebert, </em>131 F.3d 514, 525 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-16\"> Pursuant to <em>5th </em>Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
