Sherod Williams filed an employment discrimination action against the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDefendant\u201d), asserting that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based upon race and retaliation and that Defendant retaliated against him. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismissed the action. \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Sec\u2019y of State for Def v. Trimble Navigation Ltd., </em>484 F.3d 700, 705 (4th Cir.2007). \u201c[W]hen ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (citations omitted). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \u201c[fjactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\u201d and have \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the record on appeal and conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Williams\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Baqir v. Principi, </em>434 F.3d 733, 745-47 (4th Cir.) (discussing elements of hostile work environment and retaliation claims), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 659, 166 L.Ed.2d 512 (2006). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. We express no view on the ultimate disposition of Williams\u2019 claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
