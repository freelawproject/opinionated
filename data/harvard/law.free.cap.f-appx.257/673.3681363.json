We lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000), even in light of the passage of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231. <em>See Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 747-48 (6th Cir.2006) (collecting cases); <em>see also Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 510 n. 5 (4th Cir.2007). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Huang\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-22\">Huang also contends that the Board and the immigration judge erred in denying her request for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [s] he faces a clear probability of persecution because of h[er] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rush v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2007). Based on our review of the record, we find that Huang failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We therefore uphold the denial of her request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-24\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-25\"> In her brief before this court, Huang has failed to raise any challenges to the denial of her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We therefore find that she has waived appellate review of this claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>See Ngarurih v.
