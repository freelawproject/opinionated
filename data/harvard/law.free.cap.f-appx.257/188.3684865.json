Torres\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">Torres, a native and citizen of Colombia, testified that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Torres, he was a leader in a political movement affiliated with the Liberal Party of Colombia, and his political activities resulted in his persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d). Torres testified that he became affiliated with the Momiento C\u00edvico Colajuno political movement in 1996, and that he supported Pedro Orjuelo\u2019s campaign for councilman in approximately 1997, as well as Antonio Galan-Sarmiento\u2019s campaign for councilman in approximately 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">Torres testified about several incidents relating to his asylum claim. First, Torres explained that in October 1997, he attended a meeting in his hometown of Mesitas Del Colegio, and at the meeting, he was in charge of distributing pamphlets and other political propaganda for Orjuleo. Torres testified that upon leaving the meeting, his car was cut off by a jeep, and three men wearing military uniforms exited the jeep, pointed rifles at Torres, forced him out of his ca\u00ed', and pushed him to the ground. They looked through Torres\u2019s political materials, warned him to stop causing problems in town, kicked him in the ribs, and took his car keys. Torres\u2019s asylum application states that these men identified themselves as FARC members.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">In a second incident later in October 1997, three self-identified FARC members approached Torres while he was at a res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>taurant and told Mm he had to go with them. Torres escaped through a back door. That night, Torres\u2019s wife received a telephone call durmg which the caller told her that Torres was a \u201ccoward\u201d and could not hide, and the next day, Torres decided to move from Mesitas Del Colegio to Bogota.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">A third incident occurred in March 1998, while Torres was visiting Mesitas Del Colegio with his wife and mother-in-law. Two self-identified FARC members approached Torres at a market and instructed Torres to accompany them. After Torres\u2019s wife started screammg and a number of people crowded around, the FARC members ran away. Torres went to the police to report the incident, and the police told him that they would look for the two FARC members but refused to draw up an official police report because such Mcidents \u201chappened frequently in town.\u201d A few months thereafter, in August 1998, Torres\u2019s wife received a threatening phone call from the FARC at their home in Bogota, and the FARC told Torres\u2019s wife that he could not hide from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The fourth and final incident detailed by Torres in his testimony and asylum application occurred in July 2000, when two gunshots were fired at Torres\u2019s vehicle from an adjacent vehicle. Torres\u2019s car was struck by the bullets, and he sped away, thinking that the gunman was trying to rob or kill him. That night, Torres received a phone call from the FARC telling him that he was a \u201cmilitary target\u201d and that he would not be able to escape. Torres then came to the United States and has not returned to Colombia since.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The IJ (1) found that Torres\u2019s testimony was \u201clargely consistent\u201d with his asylum application, but still (2) denied Torres asylum, concluding that Torres did not meet his \u201cburden of proof and persuasion\u201d to show that he had been persecuted by the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on legal determinations, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is deferential and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">\u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative finding is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004). Because we cannot make factual findings in the first instance, if the IJ failed to make necessary factual findings, remand to the BIA for such findings is appropriate. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1236 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>III. Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It is the fact finder\u2019s duty to determine credibility. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Here, the IJ failed to make a \u201cclean\u201d adverse credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the IJ found that Torres\u2019s testimony was \u201cmostly consistent with his written application.\u201d Thus, we must accept Torres\u2019s testimony as credible for purposes of this appeal. <em>See id,.; see also Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1216-17 (11th Cir. 2007); <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">IY. Torres\u2019s Asylum Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Any alien who is physically present in or arrives in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). Any alien may establish eligibility for asylum if he shows that he has suffered \u201cpast persecution\u201d or has a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish past persecution, or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, on account of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The burden is on the alien to establish asylum eligibility. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. The alien can carry this burden solely through his testimony if it is credible, specific, and persuasive. INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>see Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201-02; <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. While credible testimony may be sufficient alone to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden of proof for asylum, \u201c[t]he weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Although the INA and the regulations do not define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution may be established by showing (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2), (3)(i). Once the alien demonstrates his well-founded fear of future persecution, the burden shifts to the government to show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) there is a fundamental change in circumstance such that the alien no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution, or (2) the alien could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his country or place of last habitual residence and under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the alien to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">Based on our precedent, we conclude that the record as a whole compels a determination that Torres suffered past persecution by the FARC. Specifically, Torres\u2019s undisputed, consistent, and detailed testimony regarding the July 2000 shooting incident (further detailed in his application documents) and three other separate incidents involving the FARC (including one in which he was pushed to the</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ground at gunpoint and kicked), cumulatively compels a finding that Torres suffered past persecution by the FARC in Colombia. <em>See Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257-58; <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1233; <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 (11th Cir.2007). In short, Torres\u2019s evidence cumulatively includes not only the shooting incident, but also an incident in which he was stopped and actually attacked by the FARC; two incidents in which he was confronted personally by the FARC but escaped without harm; and multiple threatening phone calls from the FARC to do further harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Given that Torres has established past persecution by the FARC, he is entitled to the rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia, and the BIA and in turn the IJ must allow the government to attempt to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">V. Torres\u2019s Withholding of Removal and CAT Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The evidentiary burden for withholding of removal is greater than that imposed for asylum; accordingly, if an alien has not met the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Here, the IJ denied Torres\u2019s application for withholding of removal based solely on the asylum findings discussed above. Thus, on remand, the IJ should make independent findings regarding Torres\u2019s application for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">We grant the petition, vacate the denial of Torres\u2019s application for asylum and for withholding of removal, and remand the case to the BIA to remand to the IJ for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">PETITION GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-12\">. The claims of Torres\u2019s family rely on Torres\u2019s claims, and thus we refer only to \"Torres\u201d in this opinion, except where otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-13\">. While Torres also indicated on his asylum application that he was persecuted on account of membership in a particular social group, Torres\u2019s petition for review only addresses persecution on account of political opinion, and so we do not address Torres's membership in a social group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">. Torres only mentions the IJ's denial of CAT relief in passing in his brief before this Court. When a party fails to offer argument on an issue, or mentions it only in passing references, the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. As such, Torres has abandoned any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
