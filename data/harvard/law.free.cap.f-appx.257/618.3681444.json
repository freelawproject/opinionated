Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">Henderson argues he has newly discovered evidence to justify a new trial. He claims the Government failed to acknowledge there was an immunity agreement in the case and the court failed to disclose grand jury testimony. However, Henderson cannot demonstrate that any of his claims constitute newly discovered evidence. Henderson also objects to the form of the district court\u2019s oral order. Based on our review of the record, we find no evidence that Henderson was prejudiced by either an oral ruling on his motion or the district court\u2019s entry of a \u201cdocket text order\u201d denying his motion. <em>Cf. Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 281-82 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Henderson\u2019s motion for a new trial. We also deny Henderson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
