He argues that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law because this court\u2019s use of a presumption of reasonableness for sentences imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range effectively reinstates the mandatory guidelines regime struck down in <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This argument is foreclosed. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Marmolejo challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-21\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
