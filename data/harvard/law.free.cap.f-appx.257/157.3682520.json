McCallum, a Florida prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of his federal habeas corpus petition, filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as \u201csecond or successive.\u201d After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In 1990, in the Florida state court, McCallum pled guilty to second-degree murder with a firearm, two counts of armed burglary, and grand theft and received concurrent 60-year sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">McCallum filed a Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a) motion alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his sentence for second-degree murder exceeded the statutory maximum sentence. In March 1994, the state court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In 1997, McCallum filed his initial \u00a7 2254 petition in which he alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his 60-year sentence for second-degree murder exceeded the statutory maximum. The district court denied this initial \u00a7 2254 petition on the merits and McCallum\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">McCallum subsequently filed a motion for clarification of judgment and sentence in state court. In October 2000, the state court granted the motion as to his second-degree murder sentence and ordered that an amended judgment and sentence be entered that reduced his sentence for second-degree murder from 60 years\u2019 imprisonment to 40 years. The state court noted, however, that the sentence for second-degree murder still would run concurrent with his two 60-year sentences for the armed burglary counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">In March 2006, McCallum filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition in the district court. McCallum alleged that his plea was involuntary because (1) he would not have pled to a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum for the second-degree murder count, and (2) he would not have pled to 60-year sentences for the armed burglary counts if his counsel had advised him that he could be sentenced to no more than 40 years\u2019 imprisonment on the second-degree murder count. The magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommended that McCallum\u2019s present \u00a7 2254 petition be dismissed as second or successive because McCallum had filed a prior \u00a7 2254 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed McCallum\u2019s present \u00a7 2254 petition based on his failure to obtain prior authorization from this Court as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">McCallum then filed a motion for a COA in the district court. The magistrate judge\u2019s R <em>&amp; </em>R recommended that the district court grant McCallum a COA on the issue of whether McCallum should \u201cbe granted leave to file a successive petition.\u201d The district court granted McCallum a COA on the ground stated in the R &amp; R. After the State moved to dismiss this appeal, we denied the State\u2019s motion and construed the district court\u2019s COA as including the issue of whether McCallum\u2019s \u201chabeas corpus petition was a \u2018second or successive\u2019 petition requiring authorization from this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See McCallum v. Sec\u2019y for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>No. 06-13431 (11th Cir. Oct.18, 2006) (order denying motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) requires that \u201c[b]efore a second or successive application ... is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). A district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas corpus petition that has not been previously authorized by an appellate court. <em>Hill v. Hopper, </em>112 F.3d 1088, 1089 (11th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Because \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 is not self-defining,\u201d its meaning is derived from judicial interpretation in decisions that both predate and postdate the AEDPA. <em>Panetti v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 2853, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007). The Supreme Court \u201chas declined to interpret \u2018second or successive\u2019 as referring to all \u00a7 2254 applications filed second or successively in time, even when the later filings address a state-court judgment already challenged in a prior \u00a7 2254 application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A habeas corpus petition is not subject to the restrictions against \u201csecond or successive\u201d petitions if it \u201cattacks the constitutionality of [the] re-sentencing proceeding only, and not the validity of [the] conviction.\u201d <em>In re Green, </em>215 F.3d 1195, 1196 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Hepburn v. Moore, </em>215 F.3d 1208, 1209 (11th Cir.2000) (commenting in a case applying the AEDPA limitation period that \u201c[e]very circuit that has addressed the issue has agreed that, under the AEDPA, when new claims originate at resentencing, those claims may be brought in a subsequent habeas petition without the necessity of obtaining permission from the circuit court before filing the petition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">McCallum\u2019s present \u00a7 2254 petition claims that his guilty plea was involuntary and seeks to withdraw his plea. Thus, McCallum\u2019s present \u00a7 2254 petition is a \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas corpus petition because it attacks the validity of his convictions, not his resentencing on the second-degree murder count. <em>See In re Green, </em>215 F.3d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">MeCallum argues that his convictions claim in his present \u00a7 2254 petition \u201coriginates\u201d at his resentencing on the second-degree murder count because he did not realize that his plea was based on faulty advice from his trial counsel until 2000 when the state court declared that his second-degree murder sentence exceeded the statutory maximum and resentenced him. The problem for MeCallum is that he clearly was aware, before resentencing, of the claims that his murder sentence exceeded the statutory maximum and, that, thus, his guilty plea was involuntary. As early as 1994, MeCallum argued in state court that his second-degree murder sentence exceeded the statutory maximum and raised this claim again in his initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u00a7 2254 petition in 1997. Because, before any resentencing, McCallum was aware of the argument that his 60-year second-degree murder sentence exceeded the statutory maximum of 40 years, he also was aware of the derivative argument that his plea was involuntary because his counsel provided him with erroneous sentencing advice about that statutory maximum. The fact that the premise of McCallum\u2019s argument that his plea was involuntary\u2014 his second-degree murder sentence exceeded the statutory maximum\u2014was not validated until his resentencing in 2000 does not mean that the argument itself only \u201coriginated\u201d at resentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Accordingly, because McCallum\u2019s present \u00a7 2254 petition attacks the validity of his convictions, and not his resentencing, the district court properly dismissed his present \u00a7 2254 petition as \u201csecond or successive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">. The R &amp; R also concluded that McCallum\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely. Because the COA is limited to the issue of whether McCallum's \u00a7 2254 petition was second or successive, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-10\">. In the event the district court\u2019s COA still encompasses the question of whether McCallum should be granted leave to file a second or successive habeas corpus petition, we note that applications for such leave must be filed in the appellate court, not the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Indeed, we previously denied an application from McCallum in 2005 seeking leave under \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) to raise an identical claim to the claim raised in his present 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>In re McCallum, </em>No. 05-15706 (11th Cir.2005). However, if McCallum's present \u00a7 2254 petition was not a second or successive habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>corpus petition, then \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) was not required. Thus, our opinion addresses only whether McCallum's present \u00a7 2254 petition is truly a \"second or successive\u201d habeas corpus petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas corpus petition as \u201csecond or successive.\" <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002) (reviewing a federal prisoner\u2019s motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). The statutory language which permits a state prisoner to file a \"second or successive\u201d petition is \"materially identical\u201d to that which permits a federal prisoner to file a \"second or successive\u201d motion to vacate a sentence. <em>In re Dean, </em>341 F.3d 1247, 1249 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-15\">. We need not, and do not, decide whether a habeas corpus petition is \"second or successive\u201d when it raises a claim the existence of which the petitioner was not aware until re-sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
