Wright, a Georgia inmate proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We granted a certificate of appealability to decide the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing as proeedurally barred appellant\u2019s claim that the state court improperly enhanced his sentence based on an uncounseled prior conviction.\u201d Wright argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his habeas petition as proeedurally barred because a sentence based on an uncounseled prior conviction is void even if no objection was made at sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a habeas petition. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">District courts are required to dismiss a habeas petition summarily \u201c[i]f it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Rule 4. When a state prisoner fails to present his claim in state court, the federal habeas court cannot hear the merits of the claim absent a showing of cause for the default and actual prejudice or proof that the failure to consider the claim would cause a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Bailey v. Nagle, </em>172 F.3d 1299, 1302-03, 1306 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cA \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice\u2019 occurs in an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has resulted in the conviction of someone who is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Campbell, </em>353 F.3d 880, 892 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Wright\u2019s argument that a void sentence is not subject to procedural default is without merit. Wright cites our decision in <em>Gonzalez v. Abbott, </em>967 F.2d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir.1992), for the proposition that a void conviction cannot be a legal cause of imprisonment, notwithstanding any procedural default, but Wright has not argued that either his conviction is void or he is actually innocent. Wright argues that his sentence is void, but an illegal sentence is not a recognized exception to a procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The dismissal of Wright\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
