Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). In analyzing a case on summary judgment, we must consider all of the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\u201d and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) states that summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Where, as here, there is no \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of discrimination, the plaintiff still may prevail by presenting circumstantial evidence of discrimination under the framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Morrison v. Booth, </em>763 F.2d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir.1985). Under this framework, \u201c[t]he plaintiff first has the burden of proving a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. The burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the alleged discrimination. If the defendant produces such a reason, the plaintiff must then prove that the legitimate reason offered was a mere pretext for an illegal motive.\u201d <em>Mulhall v. Advance Sec. Inc., </em>19 F.3d 586, 597 (11th Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, a plaintiff must show that: \u201c(1) [s]he belongs to a [protected class]; (2) [s]he was subjected to adverse job action; (3) [her] employer treated similarly situated employees outside [her] classification more favorably; and (4) [s]he was qualified to do the job.\u201d <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). If the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the defendant\u2019s burden is only to produce some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions, and that \u201cburden is exceedingly light.\u201d <em>Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, NA, </em>36 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (11th Cir.1994) (internal citations and quotations omitted). To show pretext, a plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. The plaintiff may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State of Alabama State Tenure Comm\u2019n., </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment on McCloud\u2019s racial and gender discrimination claims based on its conclusion that McCloud neither alleged a <em>prima facie </em>case, nor rebutted USPS\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying her light duty. McCloud was unable to show any proper comparators because no other employees were similarly situated, but treated differently. Even assuming that McCloud had presented a <em>prima facie </em>case, however, she still failed to rebut USPS\u2019s legitimate reason for denying her light duty request, based on the company\u2019s policy of denying light duty to all employees with a lifting limit of less than 20 pounds. Therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment because McCloud did not show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>that she was discriminated against based on her race or gender. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-12\">. As an initial matter, McCloud does not challenge the court\u2019s findings regarding her disability discrimination and retaliation claims, and therefore, she has abandoned these claims on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201d[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned,\u201d and passing references to the issue are insufficient to prevent abandonment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
