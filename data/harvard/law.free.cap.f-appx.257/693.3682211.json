He was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months in prison. On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-25\">We will not reverse a conviction on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>unless the prosecution has clearly failed to present evidence supporting a conclusion of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984). Here, Wheeler contends that the testimony of two eye witnesses that he distributed crack on five separate occasions was insufficient to support his convictions in the absence of fingerprints and further corroboration, especially given the background of a cooperating witness. However, the uncorroborated testimony of one witness may be sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997). In addition, while Wheeler questions the reliability of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, we will not reexamine credibility findings. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Accordingly, we find that sufficient evidence supported Wheeler\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">With regard to Wheeler\u2019s sentence, the district court lacked the authority to sentence Wheeler below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>450 F.3d 565, 568-69 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, Wheeler\u2019s sentence, which was within the presumptively reasonable guideline range, was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Wheeler\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
