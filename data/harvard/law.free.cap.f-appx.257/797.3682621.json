He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his post-judgment motion to question jury members. He argues that the district court erred by denying his motion because the jury was exposed to a prejudicial exhibit admitted into evidence at his trial. He additionally asserts that the district court erred by denying his previously filed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. For the first time on appeal he argues that his convictions should be vacated because the trial judge was biased against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">We do not consider Dixon\u2019s claim that the trial judge was biased against him because it is raised for the first time on appeal of the denial of a collateral attack upon his convictions. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). This appeal is \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
