Cano-Munoz argues that (1) the IJ failed to create a record that provides for meaningful appellate review because the IJ\u2019s decision did not provide a rational explanation and is devoid of any reasoning, and (2) the IJ violated her right to due process by acting in an unprofessional and biased manner. The Attorney General responds that Cano-Munoz abandoned any challenge to the credibility finding because she did not raise the issue in her initial brief, and this court does not have jurisdiction to hear the due process claim because she failed to exhaust her claim with the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-21\">\n<em>Meaningful Appellate Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-22\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">We remand when an order does not contain a sufficient explanation of the ruling. <em>See Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091-92 (11th Cir.2007) (remanding to a district court because one sentence sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>mary denials precluded meaningful appellate review) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 case). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence (1) establish past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Issues not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. </em>SW. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The IJ stated that the reason for denying Cano-Munoz\u2019s claims was that the claims were not credible. Moreover, the IJ stated her reasons for deciding that the claims were not credible. Thus, the record is sufficient to conduct a meaningful appellate review. Because Cano-Munoz did not challenge the adverse credibility finding, we deem the issue abandoned. Accordingly, we deny the petition on this issue. <em>Jurisdiction to Consider the Due Process Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u201cWe review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d See Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner exhausted her administrative remedies with respect to those claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Sundor v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). In order to exhaust all administrative remedies, an alien must raise her claims before the BIA. <em>Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1323. Exhaustion is required when the alleged due process violation is the denial of a full and fair hearing before a neutral fact finder. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). This court liberally reads briefs filed <em>pro se. Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997) (allowing a <em>pro se </em>petitioner to adopt a board member\u2019s dissent as his appellate argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">After a thorough and liberal reading of Cano-Munoz\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief on appeal to the BIA, we conclude that she only claimed that the IJ did not consider the complete record, and not that she was denied due process because the IJ was biased and acted disrespectfully. Because Cano-Munoz did not make a claim of bias on the part of the IJ in her appeal to the BIA, the claim has not been exhausted. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider her due process claim. Accordingly, we dismiss her due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
