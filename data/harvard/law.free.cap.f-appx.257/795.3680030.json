He urges that the sentence, which exceeded the suggested guidelines range, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">This court has not yet determined what standard of review applies to sentences imposed on revocation of supervised release in the wake of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). It need not do so in the instant case because the sentence passes muster even under the exacting reasonableness standard. <em>See United States v. Sherman, </em>213 Fed.Appx. 281, 282 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Neal, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 328, 330-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 44, 169 L.Ed.2d 41 (2007); <em>United States v. Weese, </em>199 Fed.Appx. 394, 396 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1374, 167 L.Ed.2d 163 (2007); <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>188 Fed.Appx. 315, 318 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-25\">Lennington contends that, under reasonableness review, the district court\u2019s failure in the instant case to specifically address the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors renders his sentence unreasonable. However, the district court was not required to explicitly mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is implicit in the record, specifically its consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the nature of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant, as well as consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), the need for the sentence imposed to provide the defendant with medical treatment. Lennington had a history of drug abuse, the violations underlying revocation involved drug use, and Lennington specifically requested psychological help for his drug problem. The district court found that a 24-month sentence would enable Lennington to get the help he sought through the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 drug program. Lennington\u2019s argument is, in essence, that this court should reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which this court will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-26\">Lennington\u2019s sentence of 24 months of imprisonment was neither <em>Booker </em>unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See Sherman, </em>213 Fed.Appx. at 282; <em>Neal, </em>212 Fed.Appx. at 330-31. The district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summaiy affirmance is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
