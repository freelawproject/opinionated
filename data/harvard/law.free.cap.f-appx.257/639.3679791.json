We remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) for further proceedings because (1) it is impossible to discern from the record whether the IJ and the BIA evaluated Rivas\u2019s removability status in light of the correct version of the statute under which Rivas was convicted; (2) the BIA should have the first opportunity to determine whether the version of the statute under which Rivas was convicted is \u201cdivisible;\u201d and (3) the BIA should have the first opportunity to consider the import of intervening authority on Rivas\u2019s removability status.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Rivas, a native and citizen of Spain, was admitted to the United States in August 1990. In November 1996, Rivas was convicted in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, of Destruction of Property under \u00a7 18.2-137 of the Virginia Code. The court sentenced Rivas to two years imprisonment, suspending all but forty-five days of that sentence. On November 14, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service served Rivas with a Notice to Appear, charging him removable pursuant to \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, namely, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, for which the term of imprisonment is one year or more. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">On March 2, 2004, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), in an oral decision, declared that the offense of Destruction of Property found in Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-137 constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, as incorporated by INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F). <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Reasoning that Rivas\u2019s crime was (1) a felony that (2) involves a risk of physical force against property, the IJ ordered him removed to Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">On November 4, 2005, the BIA affirmed without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, making it the final agency determination. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). Rivas filed a motion to reconsider, which the BIA denied on January 30, 2006. Rivas filed petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>for review of both orders with this court, which this court consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">For the reasons that follow, we remand this case to the BIA for a determination of whether Rivas\u2019s conviction constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The basic principles governing remand are well-established. It is a fundamental principle of administrative law that \u201ca \u2018judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 186, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (quoting <em>SEC v. Cheuery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943)). Thus, as a general matter, we should remand a case to an agency \u201cfor decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands.\u201d <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). This principle rests on the \u201cbasic proposition that a reviewing court may not decide matters that Congress has assigned to an agency.\u201d <em>W. Va. Highlands Conservancy, Inc. v. Norton, </em>343 F.3d 239, 248 (4th Cir.2003). Federal law entrusts the Attorney General with the task of determining whether an alien is removable from the United States for having been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Here, we remand to the BIA for consideration of whether Rivas\u2019s conviction constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), and thus renders Rivas removable from the United States as an aggravated felon. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). We remand to the BIA so that it can clarify whether, in affirming without opinion the IJ\u2019s determination that Rivas\u2019s conviction constituted a crime of violence, it was applying the correct version of the statute under which Rivas was convicted. Rivas was convicted in 1996 under the version of Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-137 then in effect. However, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s brief to the IJ contained a version of \u00a7 18.2-137 that was enacted in 1999 and differs in material ways from the 1996 version. Indeed, the record of proceedings for Rivas\u2019 s initial petition for review does not include the version of \u00a7 18.2-137 in effect at the time of Rivas\u2019s conviction. Thus, it is unclear whether either the IJ or the BIA was considering the correct version of \u00a7 18.2-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Remand is appropriate for two additional reasons. First, the BIA should have an opportunity to consider in the first instance whether the version of \u00a7 18.2-137 in effect in 1996 is \u201cdivisible.\u201d This determination bears directly upon the analysis of whether Rivas\u2019s conviction constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d If the BIA\u2014after looking at the statutory definition of the offense pursuant to the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)\u2014determines that the version of \u00a7 18.2-137 under which Rivas was convicted is \u201cdivisible,\u201d the BIA would be obliged to consult other conclusive court documents permitted under the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d to determine whether Rivas\u2019s conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007); <em>Soliman v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 276, 284 (4th Cir.2005). Moreover, the BIA would then have the opportunity to analyze whether it can consult documents beyond those generally permitted under the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d to determine whether Rivas was convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See In re Babaisakov, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 306, 316-21 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Second, remand will give the BIA a chance to consider whether Rivas was convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in light of our recent decision interpreting that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). <em>Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 465 (4th Cir.2006). In <em>Garcia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>we made clear that for a conviction to qualify as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), \u201cthe substantial risk involved [must] be a substantial risk that force will be employed as a means to an end in the commission of the crime, not merely that reckless conduct could result in injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. Neither the IJ nor the BIA had the opportunity to determine whether the crime for which Rivas was convicted met this standard. Therefore, it is appropriate to remand to the BIA for consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In essence, this court is unable to review Rivas\u2019s petition at this point because the BIA has given us nothing to review. \u201cIt will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency\u2019s action; nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). While the BIA may of course issue summary decisions, <em>see Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 281-82 (4th Cir.2004), in light of the foregoing circumstances and issues requiring resolution, this court needs more in this case than the BIA has provided. Accordingly, it is the BIA, not this court, that should have the first opportunity to \u201cbring its expertise to bear upon the matter\u201d: \u201cit can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.\u201d <em>Ventura, </em>537 U.S. at 17, 123 S.Ct. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
