We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">An alien may file one motion to reopen within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C) (West 2005 &amp; Supp. 2007); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2007). We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Nibagwire v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir.2006). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). In explaining the degree of deference given to the agency\u2019s discretionary review, this court has observed that the decision to deny a motion to reopen \u201cneed only be reasoned, not convincing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310 (quotation marks and citation omitted). We will reverse a denial of a motion to reopen only if the denial is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 745 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1147, 166 L.Ed.2d 997 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">There is no doubt that Menbere\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. We further find no error with the Board\u2019s finding that Menbere did not show due diligence excusing the late filing. Accordingly, we find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
