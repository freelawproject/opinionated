His pleadings are construed as a motion to proceed IFP on appeal and as a brief in support of his motion to proceed IFP on appeal. Holmes is challenging the district court\u2019s denial of IFP and its certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">In <em>Holmes v. Johnson, </em>No. 97-20855 (5th Cir. April, 27, 1998), Holmes was barred \u201cfrom filing any pro se, in forma pauperis civil appeal in this court without the prior written approval of an active judge of this court.\u201d Given the bar, the district court did not err in denying Holmes permission to proceed IFP on appeal. Moreover, Holmes makes only a conclusory assertion to this court that the issues he wishes to raise on appeal are nonfrivolous, and he does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 claims. Although Holmes is correct that the district court should have construed his postjudgment motion as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion, he does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for denying that motion. Accordingly, any challenge to the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit or to the reasons for its denial of his postjudgment motion has been abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Because Holmes fails to identify what information outside his complaint was relied upon in the district court\u2019s decision, Holmes has failed to adequately brief that issue, and it is also deemed abandoned. <em>See id. </em>Finally, Holmes\u2019s argument that the district court could not consider his third IFP motion because his notice of appeal had already been filed is without merit. This court retained jurisdiction over the case during the limited remand of the case to the district court for an IFP ruling. <em>See e.g., Donaldson v. Ducote, </em>373 F.3d 622 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-20\">Holmes has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201c \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His motion to proceed IFP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>on appeal is therefore denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cib. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Holmes\u2019s civil rights suit based upon this court\u2019s bar and, alternatively, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 461-64 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also Boles v. Matthews, </em>173 F.3d 854, 1999 WL 183472 (6th Cir.1999). This court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal in the present case as frivolous also counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). Holmes has previously accumulated one strike for our affirmance, <em>see Holmes/Richards v. Garcia, </em>No. 96-20395, 1996 WL 661136 (5th Cir. Oct.18, 1996), of the district court\u2019s dismissal of <em>Holmes/Richards v. Garcia, </em>No. H-93-1577 (S.D.Tex. Jan. 31, 1996). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 388. In addition, the dismissal of <em>Richards v. Bacarisse, </em>No. 03-CV-3170 (S.D.Tex. Aug. 22, 2003), counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Patton, </em>136 F.3d at 461-64; <em>Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 385-87; <em>see also Boles, </em>1999 WL 183472. Because Holmes has accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from bringing a civil action or an appeal from a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under \u00a7 1915 unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
