Counts one and two of the indictment involved a July 27, 2004 robbery at a Bank One location, and counts three and four pertained to a robbery on August 9, 2004, at a Frost Bank location, both banks located in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Isaacs argues that there was no probable cause to arrest him and therefore the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress his confession, that the district court improperly admitted extraneous offense evidence, and that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for aiding and abetting the use and carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a bank robbery. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">Isaacs asserts that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the confession made following his warrant-less ai\u2019rest. He argues that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him and, as a result, all statements should have been suppressed as the fruit of that illegal arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review factual findings, including credibility choices, for clear error, while legal conclusions are reviewed <em>do novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">Of course, law enforcement officials may arrest an individual in a public place without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that individual committed a felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cProbable cause for a warrantless arrest exists when the totality of the circumstances within a police officer\u2019s knowledge at the moment of the arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When considering what a reasonable person would have concluded, we consider the expertise and expeiience of the law enforcement official.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The probable cause must be analyzed under the totality of the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>stances to determine whether there is a fair probability that a crime occurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A \u201c \u2018fair probability\u2019 is something more than a bare suspicion, but [it] need not reach the fifty percent mark.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Suppression hearing testimony indicates that law enforcement officials who were investigating the Frost Bank robbery learned that the getaway vehicle used in the robbery had been rented earlier that morning by Laffoon and a second man. Shortly after the robbery, officials learned that Laffoon was returning the car to the rental agency. Based on information obtained during the investigation of the robbery at Frost Bank, law enforcement officials were certain that Laffoon was the Frost Bank robber and that he was involved in previous robberies. Isaacs, who returned to the rental agency with Laffoon, was identified as the man with Laffoon earlier that morning, prior to the robbery, when the car was rented. Although one witness raised a question whether Laffoon\u2019s getaway driver at the Frost Bank was male or female, the law enforcement officials knew that the driver of the getaway vehicle had long hair. A witness at the Bank One robbery described the driver as a Caucasian male with long ham. Therefore, the descriptions of the getaway driver at both crime scenes resembled Isaacs, and he was placed in the vehicle used in the robbery both before and after it transpired.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Thus, the totality of the circumstances and facts within the law enforcement officials\u2019 knowledge when they arrested Isaacs was sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that Isaacs was Laffoon\u2019s driver in the Frost Bank robbery. Probable cause therefore existed, and the district court did not err in denying Isaacs\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">We review for abuse of discretion cases involving the admission of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Irrespective of the threshold determination regarding whether the evidence is intrinsic or extrinsic,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the district court did not err in admitting the evidence. Before admitting Rule 404(b) evidence, a trial court must apply a two-step inquiry set forth in <em>United States v. Beechum: </em>(1) whether the offense evidence is relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character and (2) whether the evidence possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, meeting the requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 403.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To meet the relevancy requirement, the government need only produce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find the preliminary facts by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>A police officer testified that on August 3, 2004, he stopped a Black Dakota truck driven by Isaacs, the vehicle used in the Bank One robbery. After having gained consent to search the vehicle, the officer found a firearm and ammunition-the same type and caliber weapon used in the Frost Bank robbery. The firearm had a different, but sequential, serial number as the weapon used in the Frost Bank robbery and was procured by Laffoon. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the evidence was not offered to show propensity or bad character.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The evidence was appropriately before the jury as proof of intent, identity, and absence of mistake or accident.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Isaacs also contests the admittance of evidence regarding four non-charged bank robberies. Isaacs asserts that this evidence is irrelevant, cumulative, and prejudicial. However, when the evidence closely parallels the charged offense, then the probity of the evidence may outweigh its unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Again, the district court did not abuse its discretion in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Isaacs moved for a judgment of acquittal regarding the firearm counts at the close of the Government\u2019s case and at the close of evidence. We review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We will affirm the jury\u2019s verdict if a reasonable trier of fact could conclude from the evidence that the elements of the offense were established beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and drawing all inferences from the evidence to support the verdict.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">In order to prove aiding and abetting, the Government must show that Isaacs (1) associated with the criminal venture, (2) participated in the venture, and (3) sought by action to make the venture succeed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Isaacs drove the vehicle used in the robberies, and he participated in the decision making that led to the Frost Bank robbery.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Isaacs satisfies these three elements of aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>In a conviction for aiding and abetting an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) offense, the prosecution must prove that the defendant acted with the knowledge or specific intent of advancing the use of the firearm. The jury is entitled to draw reasonable inferences of knowledge or intent from the defendant\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There must also be proof that the defendant performed some affirmative act relating to the firearm.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Knowledge of the underlying offense or knowledge that a firearm will be used in the commission of the underlying offense is insufficient to sustain a conviction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There must be evidence that the defendant took some action to facilitate or encourage the use or carrying of a firearm rather than simply assist in the crime underlying the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) violation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Isaacs argues that the government failed to establish an affirmative link between himself and the firearm that Laffoon used in the robberies. Trial testimony refutes Isaac\u2019s argument Laffoon carried a firearm during both of the charged bank robberies, and Isaacs, who drove the car in both robberies, knew that Laffoon carried the firearm. The government argues that \u201conce knowledge on the part of the aider and abetter is established, it does not take much to satisfy the facilitation element.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlQ\">Although Isaacs did not enter the banks with Laffoon,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Isaacs confessed to his involvement in other robberies with Laffoon, to knowing that Laffoon carried a firearm in all of the robberies in which Isaacs participated, and to knowing that the firearm that had been used in the Frost Bank robbery was in the vehicle, at the time of Isaacs\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Also, between the dates of the Frost Bank and the Bank One robbery, in a traffic stop of the Dakota truck that Isaacs was driving, but which had been rented by Laffoon, police found the same make and model of firearm as that which was used by Laffoon in the Frost Bank robbery. Isaacs consistently participated in robberies during which Laffoon used a firearm, knowingly conveyed to and from the robberies the firearm that was to be used in the robberies, and also independently transported a firearm in a vehicle while not in Laffoon\u2019s presence. Moreover, the government argues that once Laffoon re-entered the getaway car, Isaacs, with the intent of alluding police, commenced carrying the firearm.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The government also suggests that Isaacs ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>efitted from Laffoon\u2019s use of the gun, as it decreased the time Laffoon was in the bank and provided more time to escape.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Though the government cites three Fifth Circuit cases,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> only <em>Sorrells </em>is on point, yet it is factually distinguishable.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Still, quoting Bennett, we stated: \u201c \u2018From this evidence a jury could find that Bennett knew that one of his companions was carrying the gun when they committed the attack, and facilitation is essentially undisputed since Bennett provided his car to transport himself, his co-conspirators, and the gun to execute the raid.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The government then cites persuasive extra-jurisdictional cases to further support its contention.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">From the foregoing evidence the jury could have reasonably inferred that Isaacs facilitated or encouraged the use or carrying of a firearm rather than simply assisted in the crime underlying the 18 U.S.C \u00a7 924(c)(1) violation. When viewed with all reasonable inferences made in support of the jury\u2019s verdict, the evidence supports Isaac\u2019s conviction for aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm during and in relation to a bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-11\"> Pursuant to the 5th Cir.
