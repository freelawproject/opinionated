On appeal, Carmelo claims only that the district court erred by allowing the Government to present testimony about a suppressed firearm, thereby making Carmelo choose between exercising his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him and his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. According to Carmelo, had he challenged the witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding the suppressed firearm\u2019s existence, he would have opened the door to the firearm\u2019s admission and vitiated the district court\u2019s suppression, order. Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-21\">Because Carmelo asserts this constitutional error for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>112 F.3d 163, 166 (4th Cir.1997). To demonstrate plain error, Carmelo must establish that error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48 (4th Cir.2005). Carmelo has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-22\">Because police arrived at Carmelo\u2019s residence in response to a 911 call and therefore had a legitimate reason for peering into Carmelo\u2019s vehicle, the district court correctly determined that police could testify about initially seeing the firearm in the vehicle even if the firearm was later suppressed as unlawfully seized. <em>See Alvarez v. Montgomery County, </em>147 F.3d 354, 358 (4th Cir.1998) (recognizing that an officer\u2019s lawful entry onto a defendant\u2019s property is not diminished even if the officer later violates the Fourth Amendment). Moreover, several months after the weapon was observed in Carmelo\u2019s vehicle, Carmelo admitted to police that the weapon belonged to him. Because it is undisputed that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>evidence did not emanate from the unlawful seizure by police, the district court correctly allowed the Government to present testimony about the firearm. <em>Cf. Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 804, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984) (holding that the exclusionary rule precludes the introduction of evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">In any event, given the overwhelming evidence presented by the Government regarding Cannelo\u2019s possession of three other firearms, we find that even if the district court did err, the error was harmless. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 548 (holding that the error must \u201cactually affect[] the outcome of the proceedings\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
