The probation officer made the following recommendations in Santiago\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d): the base offense level was 20 under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (2006); following the cross-references in USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l) and \u00a7 2X1.1, Santiago\u2019s base offense level was increased to 28 because he possessed the weapon while also possessing with intent to distribute crack cocaine, a crime with a base offense level of 28 under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6); two levels were added under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because Santiago possessed a dangerous weapon; the adjusted offense level of 30 was decreased by three levels for acceptance of responsibility, under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, giving him a total offense level of 27; with his criminal history category of IV, Santiago had an advisory sentencing range of 100-125 months, which was reduced to 100-120 months because ten years was the maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-22\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court granted Santiago\u2019s objections to his eight-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l) and his two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The record is undisputed that the district court granted Santiago\u2019s objections on the basis of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>fense counsel\u2019s argument that the enhancements were legally precluded by the Sixth Amendment. Counsel relied on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and related cases as the basis for granting this legal objection. The Government timely appeals, alleging that the enhancements are not precluded by the Sixth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006). Although we review a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence for reasonableness, requiring the district court to consider \u201cthe extent to which the sentence imposed by the district court comports with the various, and sometimes competing, goals of \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006), underlying legal determinations are still reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate Sentencing Guidelines range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007), and impose a sentence. If a district court imposes a sentence outside the advisory range, the court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Here, the district court failed to properly calculate Santiago\u2019s advisory sentencing range as required by <em>Hughes </em>and related cases. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006) (noting a sentencing court\u2019s first step is to properly calculate the sentencing range under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines). Rather, the court determined it was precluded by the Sixth Amendment from enhancing Santiago\u2019s sentence based on facts not admitted by him or found by a jury. This was error. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThis Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment cases do not automatically forbid a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not determined by a jury and to increase the sentence in consequence. Nor do they prohibit the sentencing judge from taking account of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s factual findings or recommended sentences.\u201d (citations omitted)). Thus, without commenting on the propriety of the calculations in the PSR or the factual findings contained therein, we vacate and remand to the district court noting that the court is not precluded by <em>Booker, </em>or its progeny, from considering facts not admitted by Santiago or found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
