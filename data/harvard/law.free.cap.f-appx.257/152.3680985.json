He now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-22\">In his brief, appellant contends that the-court erred in increasing his base offense level by 16 levels\u2014because he was deported after having been convicted in Florida of carrying a concealed weapon\u2014because that offense was not a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He contends in addition that the court erred in failing explicitly to address the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to find that his sentence is \u201cnot greater than necessary,\u201d and to allow a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 because of the disparity between his sentence and sentences given to defendants in \u201cfast track\u201d jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-23\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether a prior conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a-question of law to be determined by interpreting the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2005). A line of cases from this court establishes as a matter of law that a conviction for carrying a concealed firearm in Florida is a crime of violence under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998) (interpreting \u00a7 4B1.1); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2006) (same). We are bound by our prior rulings. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(en banc). </em>In sum, the district court committed no error in finding that appellant\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence. We turn, then, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the question of whether the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors\u2014specifically, whether the court found that his sentence was not greater than necessary\u2014and should have allowed a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">It is clear from the record of the sentencing hearing that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and used language closely related to the factor at issue when it stated, in part, that the \u201csentence is sufficient, and a greater sentence is not necessary.\u201d As for appellant\u2019s request for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K3.1, the district court was prohibited from considering sentence disparities between judicial districts which have the \u201cfast track\u201d program and those, like the district here, that do not. <em>See United, States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Appellant\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-20\">. The Government argues that plain error review is appropriate because appellant failed to raise this issue in the district court. We need not consider the argument because we reach the same result regardless of the applicable standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
