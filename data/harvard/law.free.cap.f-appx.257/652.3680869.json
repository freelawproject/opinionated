We vacated the district court\u2019s first order and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See United States v. Foster, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 374 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">On remand, the Government filed a response to Foster\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion averring Foster\u2019s sentencing guidelines calculations would not change even if Foster were afforded the benefit of Amendment 505. The district court denied Foster\u2019s motion a second time, again by a brief written order indicating Foster\u2019s life sentence was proper. Foster timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-24\">Foster asserts the district court failed to follow our instructions on remand. The record, as supplemented by the Government\u2019s response to the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, however, made clear a reduction in Foster\u2019s sentence was not warranted. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>though the district court again briefly denied Foster\u2019s motion, we find no abuse of discretion pursuant to <em>United States v. Legree, 205 </em>F.3d 724 (4th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s June 26, 2007 order denying Foster\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-11\">. In deciding whether to grant a motion to reduce sentence based upon a guideline amendment, a district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) \"to the extent that they are applicable\u201d and must determine whether \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In Legree, we held the district court\u2019s consideration of these factors was implicit, absent contrary indications. 205 F.3d at 728-29. As in <em>Legree, </em>the district court presided over Foster\u2019s trial and sentencing and thus possessed an \"intimate familiarity\u201d with Foster's case. <em>See id. </em>at 729. Furthermore, we may affirm the district court's order for any reason supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Swann, </em>149 F.3d 271, 277 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-24\">. To the extent Foster's argument pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is properly before the court, we find no reason to disagree with our sister circuits that have held <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Pena, </em>470 F.3d 431, 433 (1st Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1007 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1185, 126 S.Ct. 2365, 165 L.Ed.2d 289 (2006); <em>United States v.
