Chavez argues that the district court plainly erred by assessing him a \u201ccareer offender\u201d enhancement based on his two prior Texas convictions for controlled-substance offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance based on the waiver-of-appeal provision in Chavez\u2019s plea agreement. The Government asserts that Chavez knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Our review of the record shows that Chavez\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and that, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Burus, </em>433 F.3d 442, 445-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Chavez\u2019s appeal waiver bars review of the issue he seeks to raise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b823-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
