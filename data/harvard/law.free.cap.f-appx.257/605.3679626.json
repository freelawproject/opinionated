Appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the issue of whether Washington\u2019s sentence\u2014in particular, his term of supervised release\u2014is reasonable, but alleging no error by the district court and concluding there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Washington was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">This court will affirm a sentence that is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Washington\u2019s 120-month sentence was the statutory mandatory minimum sentence because, as he acknowledged in his plea agreement, Washington had \u201cat least one prior conviction\u201d relating to abusive sexual conduct involving a minor.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Absent a government motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000), the district court lacked authority to sentence Washington below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>450 F.3d 565, 568-69 (4th Cir.2006). Moreover, the life term of supervised release was proper under both the applicable statute, <em>see </em>former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k) (2000) (supervised release term for violation of \u00a7 2552A \u201cis any term of years or life\u201d), and guideline, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 5D1.2(c)(policy statement) (if sex offense committed, the statutory maximum term of supervised release is recommended). Accordingly, we find Washington\u2019s sentence is presumptively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Washington\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> Washington had prior state convictions for indecent liberties with a child and second degree exploitation of a minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
