Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Wirba fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Wirba cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Further, we find that Wirba did not establish eligibility for protection under CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). Finally, Wirba\u2019s claim that the IJ and Board erred in finding that Wirba filed a frivolous asylum application is without merit. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(d)(4), (6) (West 2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.20 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
