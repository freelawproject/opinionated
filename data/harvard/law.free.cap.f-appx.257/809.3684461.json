Jackson now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. This court reviews a district court\u2019s refusal to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">Jackson\u2019s contention that his sentence is subject to modification in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is without merit. Section 3582(c)(2) is inapplicable because <em>Booker </em>did not involve a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28; \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-22\">Jackson\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, 707 </em>F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). We caution Jackson that further frivolous filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary penalties, and restrictions on his ability to file appeals in this court and actions in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b833-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
