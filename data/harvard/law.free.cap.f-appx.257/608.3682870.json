With regard to the appeal in No. 07-6513, we find that, because White did not actually file a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the original judgment of conviction, he is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying the motion for an extension of time. <em>See Woodford v. Garceau, </em>538 U.S. 202, 210, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003) (holding that \u201ca case does not become \u2018pending\u2019 until an actual application for habeas corpus relief is filed in federal court\u201d). Thus, we deny his motion for a certificate of appealability as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Turning to the pi\u2019opriety of the district court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s motion for an extension of time, the district court denied the motion on the ground that lack of access to White\u2019s legal documents did not warrant equitable tolling. We conclude, however, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion in the first place because White had not filed a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the original judgment of conviction and his motion did not raise any potential grounds for relief. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>203 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir.2000). Accordingly, in No. 07-6513, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief on the alternate ground that the court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>395 F.3d 516, 518-19 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe are not limited to evaluation of the grounds offered by the district court to support its decision, but may affirm on any grounds apparent from the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In appeal No. 07-7095, White may not appeal the district court\u2019s order unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dis-positive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that White has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal in No. 07-7095.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">\n<em>No. 07-6513 AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">\n<em>No. 07-7095 DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
