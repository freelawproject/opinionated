The district court imposed a 262-month sentence, the bottom of the advisory sentencing guideline range. Blount\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), suggesting that Blount\u2019s sentence violates the Sixth Amendment but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Blount was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">Counsel suggests that the district court violated Blount\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights at sentencing by applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), courts must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA sentence within the proper Sentencing Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-21\">Here, the district court sentenced Blount in accordance with <em>Booker, </em>properly calculating the guideline range, appropriately treating the guidelines as advisory, and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Blount\u2019s 262-month sentence is the bottom of the guideline range and is below the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2007). Finally, neither Blount nor the record suggests any information so compelling as to rebut the presumption that a sentence within the properly calculated guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>range is reasonable. We therefore conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
