He appeals the sentence imposed in his case following this court\u2019s remand for resentencing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Rivera-Gareia challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). A panel of this court rejected Rivera-Garcia\u2019s Apprendi-based argument in his initial appeal. <em>United States v. Rivera-Garcia, </em>167 Fed.Appx. 989, 989-90 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 829 (2006). This court\u2019s previous decision stands as the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 752-53 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Rivera-Gareia also contends that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law because it was imposed pursuant to a de facto mandatory sentencing scheme. He argues that <em>post-Booker </em>rulings issued by this court have effectively reinstated the mandatory sentencing system found unconstitutional in <em>Booker. </em>This court must follow its precedent addressing post-<em>Booker </em>sentencing unless an intervening en banc or Supreme Court decision renders the decisions inapplicable. <em>See In re Brown, </em>457 F.3d 392, 395 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006). Rivera-Gareia has cited no such decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Rivera-Garcia\u2019s sentence, which falls within his properly calculated sentencing guideline range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Giving \u201cgreat deference\u201d to that sentence, and recognizing that the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that RiveraGareia has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
