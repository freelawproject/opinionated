This court affirmed. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>187 Fed.Appx. 418 (5th Cir.2006). Bell appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial, filed under the authority of Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1), in which he argued that newly discovered evidence warranted resentencing. Bell argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to conduct a hearing on the motion and abused its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Bell\u2019s postjudgment motion challenging his sentence following a guilty plea was \u201cnot properly characterized as one for a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>921 F.2d 563, 564 (5th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s jurisdiction to correct or modify a defendant\u2019s sentence is limited to those specific circumstances enumerated by Congress in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b). <em>See United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997). Bell does not assert, and the record does not show, that his motion in the district court falls under any provision of \u00a7 3582. Although the motion could be construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court did not suggest that it was so construing the motion, and it did not provide Bell notice. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-83, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Consequently, the motion did not arise under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">Bell\u2019s motion was an unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to consider. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
