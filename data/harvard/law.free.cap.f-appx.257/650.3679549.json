Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002). However, under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005), we do have jurisdiction over constitutional claims and questions of law raised by an aggravated felon. <em>Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 278 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007) (finding jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to review aggravated felon\u2019s claim of entitlement to a cancellation or waiver of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Green first asserts that the Board erred in finding him ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. Our review of the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision, however, reveals that the Board was correct in finding that, at the time of his plea agreement and subsequent guilty plea to a controlled substance offense in Maryland state court, Green was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. This is so because section 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1277, enacted on April 24,1996, rendered aliens deportable due to convictions for aggravated felonies and certain other offenses ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, Green\u2019s claim of eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">Green also contends that the immigration judge denied him due process by prejudging his claim of eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. However, our review of the administrative record reveals that the immigration judge, after stating his understanding of the applicable statutes and subsequent amendments, allowed the parties to file legal arguments supported by exhibits before entering a thoughtful, thorough and correct decision finding Green ineligible for the \u00a7 212(c) waiver. Therefore, Green\u2019s due process claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">Accordingly, we deny Green\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-12\"> On September 30, 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 0\u2018IIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, was enacted, repealing former \u00a7 212(c) in its entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
