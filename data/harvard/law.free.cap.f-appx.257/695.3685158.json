On appeal, he contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to address his arguments in support of a variance sentence. Specifically, Moore asserted that a within-guideline sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>subjected him to \u201cunwarranted sentencing disparity\u201d prohibited under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (2000), failed to account for his assisting law enforcement personnel in the investigation of a jailhouse solicitation-for-murder scheme, and failed to address his personal history and characteristics\u2014 especially his youth, expressed remorse, family support, and willingness to work in his family\u2019s business upon his release from prison. Our review of the record discloses no reversible error; accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">We find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the seventy-month sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). The court considered Moore\u2019s arguments in support of a variance sentence and determined that a variance was not warranted in this ease and that a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range would achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). The district court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record or \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We find that the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated [guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of correctness of within-guideline sentence). Accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
