Miller (\u201cMiller\u201d), a Florida prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of Miller\u2019s civil rights action. We see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s order; we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-18\">Miller, a Florida prisoner held at Glades Correctional Institution (\u201cGCI\u201d), filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against several GCI officials, alleging the violation of Miller\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. Miller alleged that, in July 2006, a GCI officer issued a disciplinary report that falsely stated that Miller had lied to the officer. The complaint further alleged that the prison disciplinary team that found Miller guilty of disrespect to an official failed to investigate the charge adequately, was biased against Miller, and committed other procedural errors. As a result of this finding of disrespect, Miller was sentenced to 25 days of disciplinary confinement and 60 days\u2019 loss of gain time. Miller also alleged that the supervisory officials at GCI acted with deliberate indifference to Miller\u2019s due process rights by approving the disciplinary team\u2019s finding and sentence and by denying Miller\u2019s grievances and appeals. Miller sought expungement of the disciplinary report and monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-19\">The magistrate judge recommended that Miller\u2019s complaint be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b)(ii) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. The magistrate determined that Miller\u2019s suit was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>L.Ed.2d 906 (1997): Miller\u2019s \u201callegations, if true, would necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of gain time alleged in the complaint,\u201d and Miller had not alleged\u2014and could not prove\u2014that the prison disciplinary proceeding had been invalidated. After reviewing the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation and Miller\u2019s objections thereto, the district court dismissed Miller\u2019s complaint. Miller now appeals, arguing that <em>Heck </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We review the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of an <em>in forma pawpeHs </em>complaint for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>viewing the allegations in the complaint as true and construing the <em>pro se </em>pleading liberally. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Thus, where \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentenee[,] ... the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. In <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court applied <em>Heck </em>to a section 1983 action in which a prisoner alleged that the procedures used in his disciplinary proceeding violated the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 643-44, 117 S.Ct. 1584. The Court reached this conclusion even though the prisoner sought only declaratory and monetary relief and did not request restoration of the good-time credits he had lost as a result of the disciplinary action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 643, 117 S.Ct. 1584.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Miller attempts to distinguish his case from <em>Heck </em>and <em>Edwards </em>by contending that he is merely challenging prison conditions rather than his conviction or the length of his sentence. But this argument overlooks that, if Miller\u2019s allegations are true, he would be entitled to have the misconduct finding reversed and his gain time restored, which would result in a shorter sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 646, 117 S.Ct. 1584. Miller\u2019s suit is thus distinguishable from the section 1983 action at issue in <em>Jenkins v. Haubert, </em>179 F.3d 19 (2nd Cir.1999), on which Miller relies, because the challenge in Jenkins merely addressed the conditions\u2014not the overall length\u2014of the prisoner\u2019s confinement. <em>See id. </em>at 27 (concluding that Heck did not bar prisoner\u2019s section 1983 action challenging a term of disciplinary segregation).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Because Miller\u2019s section 1983 action necessarily implicates the validity of the duration of his confinement, and Miller has not alleged that the disciplinary decision has been invalidated, his action is barred by <em>Heck </em>and <em>Edwards. </em>We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>fore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Av7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\">. The Court suggested that the prisoner had purposefully structured his section 1983 action to avoid application of <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), in which the Court determined that the sole federal remedy for a prisoner seeking restoration of good-time credits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>was a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 643-44, 117 S.Ct. 1584.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-18\">. Miller also contends that, because the district court filing instructions provided that the required filing fee for his section 1983 complaint was $150, the district court erred in imposing a $350 lien on his prison account to cover the fee. But Miller did not object in district court to the amount of the fee and continued to litigate his suit after being notified of the $350 fee; he cannot now properly argue that the district court erred in assessing the fee. <em>See Access Now, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 133 \u00cd (11th Cir.2004) (noting that \"an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
