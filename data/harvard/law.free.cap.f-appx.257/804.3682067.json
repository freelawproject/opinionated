Gutierrez argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a finding that his 2000 Oklahoma conviction for first degree manslaughter is a crime of violence. He contends that the Oklahoma statute does not have the intentional use of force as an element of the offense and does not have a mens rea requirement of recklessness and therefore cannot be considered a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359-61 (5th Cir.2005). Gutierrez was convicted of first degree manslaughter under 21 Okl. St. Ann. \u00a7 711(1), which defines manslaughter as a homicide committed \u201cwithout design to effect death\u201d while the offender is engaged in the commission of a misdemeanor. It is undisputed that Gutierrez was convicted of causing the death of a person as a result of driving a vehicle while intoxicated. The offense does not require the offender to avail himself of the intentional use of force. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 605 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">Nor does the offense qualify as the enumerated offense of manslaughter. In <em>United States v. Dominguez-Ochoa, </em>386 F.3d 639, 644-46 (5th Cir.2004), this court held that the generic, contemporary meaning of manslaughter encompassed a mens rea requirement of recklessness. In <em>United States v. Valenzuela, </em>389 F.3d 1305, 1306 (5th Cir.2004), this court determined the Florida statute criminalizing DUI/manslaughter did not have a mens rea requirement of recklessness. The statute at issue in the instant case is similar to that in <em>Valenzuela </em>in that it is a strict liability offense and does not require a mens rea of recklessness. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 316.193(3)(C)(3). Because Gutierrez\u2019s 2000 Oklahoma conviction for first degree manslaughter is not a crime of violence, the district court erred by increasing his offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Accordingly, Gutierrez\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Gutierrez also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. He argues that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law because this court\u2019s application of a presumption of reasonableness to sentences imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is in violation of the Sixth Amendment and the principles announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because his sentence is vacated as a result of the district court\u2019s incorrect application of the Guidelines, it is not necessary consider his argument. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 526 (5th Cir.2006). Regardless, the argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), wherein the Supreme Court affirmed the use of a presumption of reasonableness to review sentences imposed within the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Gutierrez also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Gutierrez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Gutierrez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENC-ING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
