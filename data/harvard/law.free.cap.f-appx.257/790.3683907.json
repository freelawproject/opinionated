He contends that the sentence is unreasonable because it exceeds the recommended guidelines range without legally sufficient reasons and because the district court failed to address specifically the concerns of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Because Parker raises these arguments for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 791 (5th Cir.2007). The sentence thus must be upheld unless there is error that is plain and that affects both the appellant\u2019s substantial rights and the integrity of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The sentence imposed, though in excess of the recommended guidelines range, was within the statutory maximum and thus was not plainly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>The district court was not required to mention explicitly the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its consideration of the requisite factors is implicit in the record. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
