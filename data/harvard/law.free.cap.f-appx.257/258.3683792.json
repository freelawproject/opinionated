After unsuccessfully seeking administrative review and collateral relief against the Parole Commission in state court, Chambers petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The petition was denied as untimely. Chambers then filed a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for reconsideration, which was also denied. This appeal of the Rule 60 motion followed. This Court granted a certificate of appealability on the limited issue of \u201cwhether application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) to appellant\u2019s challenge to his parole board revocation constituted a mistake of law such that the district court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">Our review of a Rule 60(b) motion is for abuse of discretion and considers only the motion for relief from judgment, not the underlying judgment itself. <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993). Thus, to prevail on appeal Chambers must show \u201ca justification so compelling that the court was required to vacate its order,\u201d not merely that it could have done so. <em>Id. </em>Relief is available under Rule 60(b)(1) for mistakes of law or its application, <em>Parks v. U.S. Life and Credit Corp., </em>677 F.2d 838, 839-40 (11th Cir.1982), but typically the district court is not required to grant relief unless the legal error is obvious. <em>Fackelman v. Bell, </em>564 F.2d 734, 736 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Properly framed, then, our inquiry is whether the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 2244(d)(1) barred Chambers\u2019 habeas petition was such an obvious error of law that the district court was required to reopen its final judgment. It manifestly was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">First, we note that the \u00a7 2244(d)(1) statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 2254 petitions that challenge parole revocations. <em>Peoples v. Chatman, </em>393 F.3d 1352, 1353 (11th Cir.2004) (\u00a7 2244 applies to collateral attack on parole revocation entered after allegedly deficient waiver of revocation hearing). Thus, Chambers\u2019 limitations period expired one year from the latest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>four events, two of which are pertinent here: (i) the date on which direct review of the revocation ended, \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), or (ii) the date on which the factual predicate of the habeas claim could have been discovered through due diligence, \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). The district court\u2019s order dismissing the petition as time-barred did not specify which provision triggered the start of Chambers\u2019 limitations period, and there is no Circuit law on point. The Certificate of Appealability seemed to believe that the district court applied \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); other Circuits have held in similar circumstances that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) provides the appropriate triggering event. <em>See, e.g., Dulworth v. Evans, </em>442 F.3d 1265, 1267-68 (10th Cir.2006) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">We conclude that regardless of whether \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) or \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) governs, Chambers\u2019 limitations period began running, at the latest, September 11, 2003. Chambers does not contest the district judge\u2019s findings (i) that Chambers was present for his parole revocation hearings, (ii) that the order revoking his parole entered September 10, 2003, and (iii) that Chambers discussed his release date with a Florida Department of Corrections officer the next day, September 11, 2003, and that this release date reflected the parole revocation. Chambers was clearly on notice of the revocation by September 11, 2003, and thus, the factual basis for his habeas claim was known to him or could have been known through the exercise of due diligence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Moreover, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the parole revocation proceedings are within the scope of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), those proceedings clearly became final with the entry of the revocation order on September 10, and not with the subsequent denial of Chambers\u2019 attempts to obtain \u201crehearing\u201d before the Commission. In this regard, Chambers attempted to challenge the revocation of his parole via Fla. Admin. Code \u00a7 21-21.0051(3). That provision permits a member of the Parole Commission to place a matter before the full Parole Commission for a vote; it does not permit a parolee to do so, as Chambers sought to do. Thus, Chambers\u2019 attempt to obtain rehearing before the full Commission is simply not a form of \u201cdirect review\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), such that Chambers\u2019 limitations period did not begin until the matter was resolved. Accordingly, Chambers\u2019 limitations period began running September 11, 2003, at the latest.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Importantly, Chambers\u2019 efforts to obtain review of his parole revocation by the full Commission also do not entitle him to equitable tolling, which is available only when a petitioner shows that his untimely filing is the result of extraordinary circumstances beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence. <em>See, e.g., Spottsville v. Terry, </em>476 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2007). Nothing prevented Chambers from filing a timely \u00a7 2254 petition rather than pursuing \u201cadministrative remedies\u201d that were clearly unavailable under state law. We also hold that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), which tolls the limitations period while a \u201cproperly-filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d is pending, does not apply to Chambers\u2019 efforts to obtain review of his parole revocation by the full Commission. Chambers\u2019 motion in this regard did not seek post-conviction or collateral review within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In sum, the \u00a7 2244(d) limitations period began running September 10 or 11, 2003, and Chambers\u2019 motion for review of his parole revocation by the full Commission was not a tolling event. Thus, the limitations period expired one year thereafter\u2014 before Chambers even filed his state habeas petition on October 13, 2004. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Therefore, the subsequent federal habeas petition filed on February 6, 2006 was untimely. The district court did not err in concluding that Chambers\u2019 petition was untimely, let alone abuse its discretion by refusing post-judgment relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-13\">.
