He argues that the district court plainly erred by ordering that his sentence be served consecutively to state court sentences that had not yet been imposed, but he concedes that the issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds, United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006). The Government seeks to enforce the appeal waiver provision in Johnson\u2019s plea agreement and moves for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Johnson\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary, and therefore, the waiver is enforced. <em>See United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). Moreover, contrary to Johnson\u2019s argument, he is not entitled to appeal based on the exception to the waiver for appeals of sentences exceeding the statutory maximum punishment because his sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum term of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). Thus, we do not address the merits of Johnson\u2019s challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
