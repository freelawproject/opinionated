The IJ granted Al Momani\u2019s request for voluntary departure, and the BIA ordered him to depart voluntarily from the United States within forty-seven days from the BIA\u2019s January 17, 2007, order. Al Momani apparently failed to depart as ordered, and his current deportation status is listed as a \u201cfugitive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201c[T]he fugitive disentitlement doctrine limits a criminal defendant\u2019s access to the judicial system whose authority he evades.\u201d <em>Bagwell v. Dretke, </em>376 F.3d 408, 410 (5th Cir.2004). We recently have extended the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to the immigration context where the petitioners were fugitive aliens who evaded custody and failed to comply with a removal order. <em>Giri v. Keisler, </em>507 F.3d 833, 835-836 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Because Al Momani has failed to depart from the United States as ordered and became a fugitive after filing his petition for review with this court, the fugitive disentitlement doctrine bars further review of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
