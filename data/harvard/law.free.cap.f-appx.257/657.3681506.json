He received an enhanced sentence under the Aimed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.CA. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). Godley timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-18\">Godley\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the ACCA enhancement violated his constitutional rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Counsel states, however, that he has found no meritorious grounds for appeal. Godley filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Finding no meritorious grounds for appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-19\">Godley asserts that the ACCA enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights because his prior convictions, upon which the court based the enhancement, were not submitted to a jury, proved beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by him. This court rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1010, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1005, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-20\">Godley also contends that the ACCA is unconstitutional after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny, and that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is no longer good law. He relies in particular on Justice Thomas\u2019 concurrence in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). However, Justice Thomas\u2019 concurring opinion is of no precedential value. Godley acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by existing Supreme Court precedent and by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Thompson, </em>but urges that the decision in <em>Thompson </em>be reconsidered in light of Chief Judge Wilkins\u2019 dissent in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>case. However, a panel of this court may not overrule a prior published decision of the court. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm Godley\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">This court requires that counsel inform Godley, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Godley requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Godley. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"><em> </em>In his pro se supplemental brief, Godley argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a downward departure under USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.12 or 5K2.13. A defendant usually must bring ineffective assistance claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion unless it conclusively appears from the record that counsel did not provide effective representation. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1203, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006). Here, no such error is apparent from our review of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
