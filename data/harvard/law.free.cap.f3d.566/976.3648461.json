Aid-rich argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement at sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) based on a finding that Aldrich\u2019s masturbating for a minor female<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in front of his web camera constituted a \u201csexual contact.\u201d Aldrich also raises a due process argument based on the alleged inaccuracy of the statement in his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that Aldrich was masturbating \u201cin front of\u2019 a minor when in fact he was in front of his web camera.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A), a two-level increase applies to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the base offense involves \u201cthe commission of a sexual act or sexual contact.\u201d A \u201csexual contact\u201d is defined as \u201cthe intentional touching ... of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of <em>any person </em>with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">The district court applied the two-level enhancement based on its finding that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cany person,\u201d as used in the definition of \u201csexual contact,\u201d unambiguously referred to the touching of all people, including Aldrich himself, and that therefore, contrary to Aldrich\u2019s position, masturbation constituted \u201csexual contact\u201d for purposes of the enhancement. The district court also rejected Aldrich\u2019s argument \u2014 made for the first time at sentencing \u2014 that \u201cany person\u201d could not include oneself, because it was not possible for Aldrich to \u201charass\u201d himself, one of the six potential motives of \u00a7 2246(3). Aldrich argued that an individual must be able to perform all six prohibited acts under the statute in order to violate it. Finally, the district court rejected Aldrich\u2019s argument that the rule of lenity should apply in his favor, because the statute was ambiguous and there was no controlling precedent. <em>United States v. Santos</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 2025, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). Aldrich reiterates his arguments on appeal, and we address each below.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">The Supreme Court has held that the \u201cstarting point\u201d of statutory interpretation is \u201cthe language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>Randall v. Loftsgaarden, </em>478 U.S. 647, 656, 106 S.Ct. 3143, 92 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986). The \u201ccardinal canon\u201d of statutory interpretation is that \u201ccourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\u201d <em>Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). Finally, statutes should be construed so that \u201cno clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u201d <em>United States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218, 1236 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Cir.2005) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Based on our review of the record and the relevant law, we conclude as the district court did that the plain meaning of \u201csexual contact\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3) includes the act of masturbating. The statute\u2019s operative phrase \u201cany person\u201d applies to all persons, including Aldrich himself. We come to this conclusion based on our observation that \u00a7 2246(2)(D) defines a \u201csexual <em>act\u201d </em>as the \u201cintentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of <em>another person </em>who has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of <em>any person.\u201d </em>(emphases added). We believe that \u00a7 2246(2)(D) clearly indicates that Congress used the phrase \u201cany person\u201d when it meant to include the offender himself, as well as another individual, and the phrase \u201canother person\u201d when it meant to exclude the offender. Therefore, the use of the phrase \u201cany person\u201d in the \u00a7 2246(3) definition of \u201csexual contact\u201d demonstrates Congress\u2019s intent to include masturbation among the acts to which the definition and the \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) enhancement was meant to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We also reject Aldrich\u2019s argument that because one cannot \u201charass\u201d oneself, the definition of \u201csexual contact\u201d must not include masturbation. Section 2246(3) uses the conjunction \u201cor\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d in its list of potential motives; therefore a defendant need only intend to \u201cabuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, <em>or </em>arouse or gratify\u201d in order to violate the statute. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). That Aldrich could not do one of these things is immaterial so long as he could do another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Finally, we find no merit to Aldrich\u2019s due process argument, because the PSI did not contain invalid factual premises that infringed on Aldrich\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Compare United States v. Stephens, </em>699 F.2d 534, 537 (11th Cir.1983). There is no constitutionally significant difference between masturbating in front of a minor in person versus doing so via web camera, and we see no other indication that Aldrich lacked proper notice of the sentence he faced. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-10\">. In fact, the \"minor\u201d was an undercover officer posing as a fifteen year-old female.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-11\">. We \"review a district court's finding of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\" United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1329 (11th Cir.2003). We also review <em>\"de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. Because we have held that the statute is unambiguous, the rule of lenity does not apply, and we therefore reject Aldrich\u2019s argument on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
