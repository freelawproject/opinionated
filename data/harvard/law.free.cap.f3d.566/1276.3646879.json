United States, </em>546 F.Supp.2d 1312 (M.D.Fla.2008). We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of \u201c[wjhether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the trial court erred by enhancing appellant\u2019s sentence based on abuse of a trust position.\u201d Payne, who received the enhancement based on his status as a pastor, asserts his appellate counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to challenge his two-level sentencing enhancement for abuse of a position of trust. He notes this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>Court reversed the abuse-of-trust enhancement given to one of his codefendants who was also a pastor in <em>United States v. Hall, </em>349 F.3d 1320 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">An ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim presents a mixed question of law and fact, which this Court reviews <em>de novo. Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). To prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) this deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). An attorney\u2019s performance is deficient if he does not provide reasonably effective assistance. <em>Id., </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064. \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. In evaluating an attorney\u2019s conduct, a court must avoid \u201cthe distorting effects of hindsight\u201d and must \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id., </em>104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">The Supreme Court has held a criminal defendant\u2019s appellate counsel is not required to raise all nonfrivolous issues on appeal. <em>Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 751-54, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 3312-14, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). In so holding, the Court noted, \u201c[e]xperienced advocates since time beyond memory have emphasized the importance of winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on one central issue if possible, or at most on a few key issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751-52, 103 S.Ct. at 3313. Therefore, it is difficult for a defendant to show his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise certain issues on appeal, particularly if counsel did present other strong issues. <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 287-88, 120 S.Ct. 746, 765-66, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">Section 3B1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level sentencing enhancement in a case in which \u201cthe defendant abused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d Whether the defendant occupied a position of trust is judged from the perspective of the victims. <em>United States v. Garrison, </em>133 F.3d 831, 837 (11th Cir.1998). In the context of fraud, we have held abuse of a position of trust occurs in two situations: \u201c(1) where the defendant steals from his employer, using his position in the company to facilitate the offense, and (2) where a fiduciary or personal trust relationship exists with other entities, and the defendant takes advantage of the relationship to perpetrate or conceal the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837-38 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">In <em>Hall, </em>we held the defendant did not occupy a position of trust under the Sentencing Guidelines and reversed his U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 sentencing enhancement for abuse of a position of trust. 349 F.3d at 1321. In determining whether Hall occupied a position of trust, we focused on the relationship between Hall and the victims from the perspective of the victims. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Instead of presenting evidence to show there was in fact a personal trust relationship between Hall and one of the victims, the government relied solely on Hall\u2019s status as a pastor as the basis for the enhancement. <em>Id. Hall </em>was the first time this Circuit addressed the abuse-of-trust enhancement in the context of a defendant who is a pastor. Payne cannot show deficient performance by his appellate counsel. Payne\u2019s appellate counsel did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hall </em>at the time he prepared Payne\u2019s direct appeal. Avoiding \u201cthe distorting effects of hindsight\u201d and \u201cevaluating] the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time,\u201d it was not deficient performance for Payne\u2019s appellate counsel to conclude Payne would likely not be sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>cessful in challenging his abuse-of-trust enhancement on appeal. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Payne\u2019s codefendants raised many other issues, and the case also presented a lengthy record. <em>See United, States v. Payne, </em>No. 01-14746, manuscript op. at 3-5. Therefore, it was a reasonable strategy for counsel to focus this Court\u2019s attention on those issues that he felt were the strongest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Because Payne\u2019s appellate counsel provided him with-reasonably effective assistance, counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude Payne\u2019s appellate counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to challenge his abuse-of-trust enhancement on appeal, and the district court did not err in denying Payne\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1280-14\">. Because Payne has failed to meet the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, we need not address whether he can meet the prejudice prong. <em>See Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
