No liquors were found in the saloon except a bottle half full of whiskey behind the bar. One of the glasses in the saloon smelled of beer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-4\">There was evidence tending to show that Mrs. McCullow, the mother of the defendant, occupied a portion of the building in which the defendant\u2019s tenement and store were, and that the portion occupied by her could be reached from the defendant\u2019s store only by passing through the tenement where his family lived, and that the tenement of Mrs. McCullow, the mother of the defendant, was kept by her separate and apart from the other tenement in the house, and that she kept house by herself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\">It appeared that under another search-warrant the chief of police of Waltham searched the said premises of Mrs. McCullow at the same time that the defendant\u2019s premises were searched. Against the objection of the defendant, the government was permitted to show that two cases of lager beer were found by the door, one being a full case and the other having only seventeen bottles left therein, and also a quart of whiskey in two bottles, and a pint of wine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-6\">Upon cross-examination the officer testified that the liquors found upon the premises of Mrs. McCullow -jvere subsequently returned to her by order of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty ; and to the admission of evidence concerning the search of the premises of Mrs. Mc-Cullow, and the finding of intoxicating liquors on her premises, and the kind and quantity thereof, the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-8\"><em>3.

A large quantity was found in a room adjoining the tenement of the defendant, which had a door communicating with his tenement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The facts that a large quantity was found, that the mother kept house by herself, and would not be likely to have so large a supply for her own use, that the defendant had access to the room, joined with the fact that no evidence was offered to show that the liquors belonged to any other person, tended to show that the defendant kept these liquors for the purpose of supplying the bar in his saloon. The weight of the evidence was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"A6S\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
