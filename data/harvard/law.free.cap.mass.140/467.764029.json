The prayer of the petition was, that the city, its officers, agents, and servants, might be restrained from paying said sum of $200; and that such other orders and decrees might be made as were necessary or proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-10\">The Case was heard and reserved by Holmes, J., for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-11\"><em>L.

Sts. c. 28, \u00a7 13, (St. 1861, <em>e. </em>165,) can be interpreted to authorize a city to appropriate money for public concerts by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>a band. The statute was passed just after the decision in Hood v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of </em>Lynn, 1 Allen, 103, that the celebration. of the Fourth of July was not among the \u201c other necessary charges\u201d for which towns were authorized to expend money. Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>27, \u00a7 10. It provided that, by a yea arid nay vote of two thirds of the members of each branch present and voting, city councils might appropriate a comparatively small sum \u2014 not over one fiftieth of one per cent of the valuation for the year \u2014 for armories, \u201cfor the celebration of holidays, and for other public purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The word \u201c other \u201d implies that the celebration of holidays is a public purpose within the meaning of the act, and indicates that purposes which are public only in that sense are included within its scope, although they look rather more obviously to increasing the picturesqueness and interest of life than to the satisfaction of rudimentary wants, which alone we generally recognize as necessary. We know of no simple and merely logical test by which the limit can be fixed. It must be determined by practical considerations. The question is one of degree. But, in reply to the petitioners\u2019 argument, we may say that, if the purpose is within the act, we do not see why the city council may not create the occasion. Taking into account the history and language of the act, the safeguards attached to the exercise of the power, the smallness of the sum allowed to be expended, and the fact that it has long been assumed to be within the power of cities to give such concerts in the open air, , we are not prepared to say that a case is presented for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"A7Z6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
