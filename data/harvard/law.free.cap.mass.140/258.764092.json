Trial in the Superior Court, before Staples, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2IM\">There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff owned on the east side of the line which was in controversy between the parties, and the defendant on the west; and the question in the case was as to the exact location of the west line of the plaintiff\u2019s premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">It was agreed by the parties, at the trial, that the south end of said west line of the plaintiff\u2019s premises was at a stake and stones in the line of land of one Samuel A. Orr, and the precise location of the stake and stones was also agreed. It was also agreed that there was a well upon the premises, about twenty feet southerly from the highway. The plaintiff put in evidence a deed to him from Aaron Hobart, describing the land conveyed as follows: \u201c Begin at the road, at the westerly corner of Maguire\u2019s homestead; thence south forty-three and one half degrees east, twenty-six rods, sixteen links; thence south seven and one fourth \u25a0degrees east, twenty-two rods, three links; thence north about \u25baeighty-three and one half degrees west, five rods in line of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of Dr. Samuel A. Orr; thence north forty-two degrees west, forty-four rods, to the fence at the highway; thence easterly by the road to the point of beginning, being in a straight line sixteen rods and five links; \u201d and covenanting that the premises were free from all incumbrances, \u201c except a right, which is reserved, to draw water at the well on the west line of said land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">Upon this evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that, by a legal construction of said deed, the west line of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, beginning at the stake and stones agreed, must extend through the centre of the well referred to in the deed; and that the plaintiff, by his deed, was estopped from claiming any land west of a line running northerly from said stake and stones, through the centre of said well, to the highway, and could not be permitted to show by any evidence any line extending any farther westerly than the centre of the well.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">The judge refused so to rule, and admitted evidence tending to show the location of the west line of the plaintiff\u2019s lot as shown by the course and distance, north forty-two degrees west, forty-four rods, and the other descriptive part of said deed. The line so shown ran about eleven feet westerly of the centre of the well.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-7\"><em>H. </em>Kingman, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-8\"><em>JR. 0. </em>Harris, <em>QB. W. Harris </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A1m3\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A-6\">Looking at all the parts of the deed from Hobart to the plaintiff, it is clear that it was not the intention of the parties that the well should be a monument fixing the west line of the lot conveyed. It is not mentioned in the description in the granting part of the deed. The west line starts at a fixed point, where the parties agree there were a stake and stones, and thence runs \u201c north forty-two degrees west, forty-four rods, to the fence at the highway.\u201d The description leaves the well on the plaintiff\u2019s lot, about eleven feet from the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The clause in the latter part of the deed, \u201cexcept a right, which is reserved, to draw water at the well on the west line of . said land,\u201d was not intended to make the well a monument; it was inserted, <em>alio </em>intuitu, for the purpose of creating in the grantor an easement in the plaintiff\u2019s land. If the well were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>a monument, the line would run through its centre, each party would have an equal right to use it, and there would be no occasion for the grantor to reserve a right to draw water from it. In order to carry into effect the intention of the parties, the expression \u201c on the west line of said land \u201d must be interpreted as meaning near the west line, or on the west part of said land.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
