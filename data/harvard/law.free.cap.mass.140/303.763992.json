Exposure means an exhibition and showing of the liquors, as contradistinguished from a concealment and non-exposure ; keeping for sale means a having on sale with intent to sell for pay to others, as distinguished from a personal use, either medicinally or as a beverage for one\u2019s self, or for like use and purpose by others; and that the defendant was the one who so exposed and kept for sale the liquors there found, and put in evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The judge declined to instruct the jury as requested; but instructed them as follows: \u201cIf any part of the liquors was kept and sold, it is enough; and whether or not it was concealed is immaterial. The government must prove, first, that the defendant was the proprietor of, and kept, the liquors seized, or some part of the seized liquors, and that they were under the control of the defendant; and, secondly, that they were there for the purpose of sale.
