Tarnham, five or six years old, whose parents were out of this State; that she, desiring to have a surgical operation performed on the child for a club-foot, was advised by her physician to go to said hospital; that, about a week before the accident, she went to the hospital, and applied to have the child treated there, and then made an arrangement or contract with the proper officer of the corporation to have the child boarded and treated there for such length of time as would be required for her proper treatment, and she agreed to pay one dollar per day for the board and attendance which the child was to receive at the hospital; that the next day she took the child there under such contract or arrangement ; that she had permission or an invitation from the proper officer of the corporation to enter the hospital and visit the child, and to see when it was a proper time to take her away, out of the regular visiting days and hours, and was informed how to get in when she came out of the regular visiting days and hours; that she went once or twice to visit the child before the day of the accident; that on the day of the accident, between three and four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, she went to the hospital for the purpose of seeing when the child could be taken home, and of making arrangements therefor, and entered the hospital building up the centre or main staircase, or entrance; that she saw the superintendent\u2019s assistant, and arranged to take the child away the next day, and, by his permission, was shown by a porter upstairs to the ward where the child was; that she remained there until about five o\u2019clock, when a nurse informed her that it was time for her to leave, and called a porter or attendant, who showed her downstairs, through a hall, to an outside door, near the top of the stairs where she was injured, and opened the door, and directed her to go out that way; and that, in going down the staffs, she tripped and fell, and received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>injuries complained of. It appeared that the plaintiff had never before been over these stairs. ' .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-4\">There was also evidence tending to show that said stairs consisted of eleven or twelve steps, made of plain hewn granite, and were on the outside of the building, and leading from the main floor to a paved walk and driveway leading directly out of the grounds to Harrison Avenue; that the superintendent had charge of the stairs, and, about a week before the accident, he covered them or caused them to be covered with boards; that these board coverings were put on in an improper and unsafe manner, and were, at the time of the accident, negligently left in an unsafe condition, and by reason thereof the plaintiff was injured; and that the plaintiff was in the buildings on that day, by an invitation, express or implied, from the superintendent of the hospital, elected by the corporation under the authority given by the St. of 1880, and, in going out over the stairs, was in the exercise of due care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">The plaintiff admitted that the stairs, as originally built, and without the board covering, were safe and sufficient. It appeared that the board coverings were originally made or furnished by the city before the corporation was chartered, and were used by the city on these stairs, in the winter, as long ago as 1879; that the coverings were taken off and apart, and packed away in the spring, and then put on in the fall and used through the winter; that the superintendent at the time of the accident was superintendent before the incorporation of the defendant; that there had been no change in the ownership or occupation of the hospital from June, 1879, when the superintendent took charge, until the time of the trial, except such as was effected by the incorporation of the defendant, and by its acts herein recited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">It also appeared that the city of Boston appropriated some $150,000 annually towards the support of the hospital; that the corporation receives from paying patients and non-residents, for the board and attendance of such paying patients boarded and treated there, from $12,000 to $14,000 annually, which sums are added to the appropriations and used in the support of the hospital ; that physicians and surgeons who perform professional services at the hospital for the patients there receive no compensation from the city or from the corporation; that, the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>day after the accident, said child was taken away, and the charges for her board and attendance were paid, according to the contract made by the plaintiff; that nothing was paid to, or to be paid by, the city or the corporation to the physician or surgeon who attended upon the child for their services so rendered ; and that the corporation had received no gifts or bequests since its incorporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\">Upon the above facts and evidence, the judge ruled that the action could not be maintained; and directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-4\"><em>0.

There is no evidence of negligence on the part of the trustees as a corporation. There is evidence of negligence on the part of the superintendent, but there is no evidence that he was not a proper person to be appointed superintendent. But we think that this is a hospital maintained by the city, with such aid as may be derived from donations, and the sums received from paying <em>patients; </em>and that the trustees are in a sense managing agents only in maintaining the hospital, subject to the laws and to the ordinances of the city. The donations, if any are ever made, must be used according to the terms of the gift. The money appropriated by the city of Boston must be used according to the terms of the appropriation. The sums received from paying patients are by the ordinance to \u201cbe credited to the account of the hospital,\u201d and are, as stated in the exceptions, \u201c used in the support of the hospital.\u201d All the funds are used for the purpose of maintaining the hospital in accordance with the St. of 1858, <em>c. </em>113. The corporation of the Trustees of the City Hospital of the city of Boston has in fact no property. The St. of 1858, c. 113, is a special, and not a general statute, and it is permissive, and not imperative; but these distinctions would not render the city liable for negligence in the management of the hospital, as has been shown in <em>Tindley </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>137 Mass. 171. The trustees are a body created for the performance of a duty, which, under the authority of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the city of Boston has assumed for the benefit of the public, and from the performance of which no profit or advantage is derived either by the trustees or the city. The trustees as a corporation are no more liable for the negligence of their officers and agents than the city would be. The case is governed by the principles declared in <em>Hill </em>v. Boston, 122 Mass. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
