This was all the evidence introduced by the government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that there was a variance between the allegations of the complaint, describing the alleged licensed premises, and the evidence; that the complaint did not describe the licensed premises; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>defendant was entitled to an acquittal. But the judge refused so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-5\"><em>J. L. </em>Eldridge, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-6\"><em>E. J. </em>Sherman, Attorney General, <em>\u00bf- H. N. </em>Shepard, Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b320-7\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AsL\">The offence charged is that the defendant, being licensed to sell intoxicating liquors in a room described in the complaint, used by him for the sale of such liquors, placed and maintained upon the said premises a curtain and shutter in such way as to interfere with a view of the business conducted upon the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The evidence proved all the allegations of the complaint. The fact that the defendant\u2019s license included the cellar under the room is immaterial. The complaint need not, and does not, set out the exact form and extent of the defendant\u2019s license, so as to make it a part of the description of the offence; it is enough that it alleges that the defendant, having a license to sell in the room named, maintained therein curtains or shutters, against the law. If the license produced proves the allegations of the government, the fact that it proves more, namely, that the defendant is also licensed to sell in another room, does not constitute a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"Acl\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
