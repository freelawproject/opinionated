Wolcott, be approved and allowed as the last will and testament of said Allen Wolcott, and that letters of administration, with the will annexed, be issued to said Hilas O. Wolcott; that from said decree an appeal was duly taken to this court; that, at April term, 1866, of this court, said decree of the Probate Court was affirmed, and the case was remitted to that court for further proceedings; that thereupon Hilas O. Wolcott qualified as administrator, and, by the provisions of said will, became seised and possessed of all the property, real and personal, of said Allen Wolcott; and that said written instrument, so approved and allowed, was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>last will and testament of said Allen Wolcott, but was a contrivance and forgery, fraudulently procured by said Hilas O.
