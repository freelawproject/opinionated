The St. of 1884, <em>o. </em>37,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was passed after the injury complained of, and does not apply to this action. <em>Bucher </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>131 Mass. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The only evidence that the plaintiff was engaged in a work of necessity or charity was his own testimony, \u201c that the train was made up of box and stock cars, and that there was stock on the train ; \u201d \u201c that there was no convenience for feeding or watering stock at Pittsfield,\u201d the place he had left; and \u201c that he did not know how they were to be fed and watered there.\u201d This i4 not sufficient to prove that there was stock on the train which could not have been fed and watered at Pittsfield, and that the purpose of running the train was to transport stock to a place where it could be fed and watered, or that the work was necessary for the proper and humane treatment of living creatures being transported upon the road, or for compliance with the requirements of the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>207, \u00a7 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">As the work in which the plaintiff was engaged upon the Lord\u2019s day contributed to his injury, and was not a work of necessity or charity, the ruling of the court was correct, without regard to the question whether there was any evidence that the negligence of the defendant caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\"><em> </em>Section 1 of the St. of 1884, c. 37, which took effect on February 27, 1884, is as follows : \u201c The provisions of chapter ninety-eight of the Public Statutes relating to the observance of the Lord\u2019s day shall not constitute a defence to an action for a tort or injury suffered by a person on that day.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
