Hanley, who was the son of Francis Hanley, deceased, and the plaintiff contended that Francis Hanley acquired a settlement in the defendant town under the provisions of the Pub.

A printed book, entitled \u201c Record of the Massachusetts Volunteers 1861-1865, published by the Adjutant General under a Resolve of the General Court. Boston, Wright &amp; Potter, Printers to the State, No. 79 Milk Street, 1870.\u201d In this book, volume 2, in a list of the soldiers of the Fifteenth Regiment, appears the name of Francis Hanley, and opposite his name, in a column marked \u201c Residence or place credited to,\u201d is printed \u201c Northborough.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">The resolve referred to in said title, e. 98 of the' Resolves of 1866, was put in evidence. There was no further evidence in relation to this book. To the admission of this book as evidence the defendant objected, but the judge admitted it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">Walter A. Kezar, called by the plaintiff as a witness, testified that he had been a clerk in the office of the Adjutant General of this Commonwealth from July, 1863, to the present time; and, against the objection of the defendant, was permitted to testify that in 1862 Francis Hanley was assigned by the Adjutant General to the town of Northborough as a part of its quota, that he was able to state this from an inspection of the descriptive roll (No. 1) ; that this department in 1862 was governed by the place of residence stated on the descriptive rolls in assigning credits to towns ; that he was able to state this from his knowledge of the custom of the department after he was employed there in July, 1863; that in said table (No. 4) Francis Hanley was included in the number of men credited to the town of Northborough ; that the Adjutant General made up said table (No. 4) from the residence stated in the descriptive rolls ; that the fact that the town of Westborough claimed Francis Hanley in its return (No. 3) had no effect in making up said table (No. 4), as the name of the regiment in which he was enlisted was not stated in said return. It further appeared from the evidence of Kezar, that there were no records of the department showing any assignment of credits by name to towns, and that he (Kezar) had no knowledge of what was done in the department until after his employment there in July, 1863, except as the same appeared of record, or what he had learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>after his said employment. To the admission of all this evidence the defendant objected, but the judge admitted it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\">There was no other evidence that Francis Hanley was ever assigned to, or allowed as a part of, the quota of Northborough, under any call of the President during the civil war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule- as follows: \u201c1. There is no sufficient and competent evidence to prove that Francis Hanley was ever assigned to, or allowed as a part of, the quota of Northborough. 2. The plaintiff cannot in this action recover for the board and attendance furnished to Johanna Hanley by the plaintiff city prior to February 9, 1882, and can only recover the sum of $9.85, the amount paid, by the overseers of the poor of the plaintiff city for the board of the child and for the board and attendance of the mother which was furnished within two years prior to the date of this writ.\u201d The judge declined so to rule, but ruled that the foregoing evidence was competent and sufficient to show that Francis Hanley was assigned to the town of Northborough as a part of its quota, and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $83.58, being the full amount claimed, with interest from the date, of the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">To the admission of the foregoing evidence, and to the above rulings and refusals to rule, the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-7\"><em>H.

It is not denied that the printed book put in evidence was in fact one of the volumes printed under <em>c. </em>98 of the Resolves of 1866, as it purported to be. This being so, it was properly admitted. Assuming that the resolve could not directly affect the rules of evidence, it made the document a public document, and it would seem to have been passed with the purpose of causing the facts to be recorded, while still fresh, for the benefit of the public. It was recognized by an act of the Legislature. St. 1866, <em>e. </em>301, \u00a7 1. The facts collected in it were public facts. Stark. Ev. (10th Am. ed.) 273. They were known to the Adjutant General, <em>ex officio. </em>See <em>Brockton </em>v. <em>Uxbridge, </em>138 Mass. 292. Moreover, this class of evidence is not strictly confined to facts within the personal knowledge of the officer making the record. See <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>South Scituate, </em>115 Mass. 336; <em>Whiton </em>v. <em>Albany Ins. Co. </em>109 Mass. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>2. The clerk, Kezar, was properly allowed to testify, that in 1862 the Adjutant General\u2019s department was governed by the place of residence stated in the descriptive rolls in assigning credits to towns, although Kezar was not employed in that office until July, 1863, and only professed to be able to state this from his knowledge of the custom of the department after he was employed there. It would be difficult to say that the jury might not have inferred what was the practice of the office in 1862 from direct evidence of what it was in 1863. But it is evident that Kezar\u2019s testimony was more than a naked inference of that sort. A clerk who is in the same office, and taking part in the same routine a year later, and who continues there for a long time, .practically knows from a multitude of small details, which he cannot hope to reproduce, whether the course of business which he finds is new or long established. Moreover, Kezar\u2019s testimony seems to have been, not merely the best, but the only evidence that could have been obtained upon this point. See <em>Townsend </em>v. Pepperell, 99 Mass. 40, 43, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">3. It follows, that the court rightly refused to rule that there was no evidence that Hanley was ever assigned as part of the quota of Horthborough.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">4. The last ruling requested should have been given, \u2014to the effect that the plaintiff could only recover for the board and attendance furnished within two years of the date of the writ. Pub. Sts. <em>e. </em>84, \u00a7 14. We agree with the defendant, that a town furnishing relief to a pauper is not required to wait until it has stopped giving relief before it can bring suit. The services were rendered and the liability accrued <em>de die in diem. </em>On this ground alone, the exceptions must be sustained, unless the plaintiff remits all but $15.56.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac1\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
