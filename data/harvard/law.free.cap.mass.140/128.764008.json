The defendant asked the judge to rule that, if such person was a material witness, \u201cit was the duty of the government, rather than of the defence, to hold him as a witness but the judge declined so to rule. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">Indictment charging the defendant with burning, on June 22, 1882, a certain building, owned by one Joseph Cushing, situate in Fitchburg, and used by the defendant as a candy manufactory. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Staples, </em>J., whp allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">It appeared in the evidence put in by the government, that the defendant and one York, who was his partner in the manufacture of candy in the building burnt, were in the factory on the night of the fire, about half an hour before the burning; that York had that afternoon taken away to Ayer a load of candy, and had returned to Fitchburg that evening for a sample case ; that York was arrested for participation in the burning, and was discharged after a hearing before the Fitchburg Police Court, and he thereafter testified as a witness for the defendant at his first trial. Upon cross-examination of the defendant, who testified in his own behalf, he was asked as to the present whereabouts of York, and replied that he was in Iowa. It further appeared that, at a former trial, the, defendant testified that York and his wife were both at the shop on the evening of the fire. The first trial of the defendant took place at August term, 1882, the second trial at October term, 1884, and the third and last at January term, 1885. York was not a witness at the last two trials, and was absent from the Commonwealth and in Iowa at both times. In his argument before the jury, the district attorney commented on the fact that the defendant had not called York as a witness, or had his deposition taken; and contended that he dared not do either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury as follows : \u201c If York was a material witness, it was the duty of the government, rather than of the defence, to hold him as a witness; \u201d but the judge declined so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-5\"><em>J.

The court rightly refused to rule, as matter of law, as requested by the defendant, that \u201c it was the duty of the government, rather than of the defence, to hold him as a witness.\u201d There is no law which required the government, rather than the defendant, to hold or call him as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
