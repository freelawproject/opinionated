Sts. c. 190, for flowage. After the former decision, reported 138 Mass. 222, the ease was tried in the Superior Court, before <em>Staples; </em>J., who ruled that, if the respondent\u2019s dam was effectively raised by him, and thereby flowed the complainant\u2019s land, doing damage, it presented a case under the mill act; and excluded evidence offered by the respondent, tending to show that the dam was not higher in its effective height than a former dam, in place of which this dam had been constructed, and afterwards raised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The jury found for the complainant; and the respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-4\">A. <em>Be Wolf, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-5\"><em>L.

This rule applies to the case before us. In <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>13 Allen, 274, which, like this case, was a complaint under the mill act, exceptions were taken to a ruling at the hearing, upon the question whether a warrant should issue to empanel a jury to assess the complainant\u2019s damages, and were entered in this court before the jury trial was had; and it was held that they must be dismissed as prematurely entered, because there had been no final determination of the case in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>.Exceptions dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
