Norris, of a lot of machinery. The case was sent to an auditor, whose report was in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The plaintiff claims title to the replevied articles as a part of the personal estate of the debtor. The defendant is the owner of the real estate and building in which the replevied property was situated, and contends that the machinery was part of the realty, and passed to him by the deed by which he acquired title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\">The real estate, consisting of about twenty-five thousand feet of land in Woburn, with buildings thereon, was conveyed, on November 29, 1870, by James Tweed to A. J. Parker. There was no machinery in the building at the time of this purchase. Parker on the same day mortgaged the property to Tweed for $3000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">He put in an engine and boiler, and necessary shafting, and the following machinery: one planing machine, one moulding machine, one jointing saw, one combination saw, one jig saw, and one turning-lathe. These are a portion of the articles replevied. Parker occupied the building as a planing-mill and wheelwright\u2019s shop.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">On June 1, 1871, Parker gave a second mortgage for $1500 to James Tweed, of the same real estate. On September 18,1875, Parker gave a third mortgage for $3000 upon the real estate to said Lawrence B. Norris. In none of the above conveyances is any reference made to machinery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">On September 18, 1875, A. J. Parker, with John F. Parker, described as his copartner, executed to said Norris a mortgage for $3000 of the personal property on said real estate, namely: \u201c One1 planing machine, one moulding machine, one stationary engine and boiler, and all other machinery and tools that are now in our shop, situate on the westerly side of Prospect Street, in the Centre Village of said Woburn.\u201d This mortgage was duly recorded in the office of the town clerk of Woburn, and was subsequently foreclosed and sold; and by conveyances under said sale came to said Norris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\">Norris took possession under the mortgage of September 18, 1875, and foreclosed and sold the real estate to John W. Johnson, by deed dated June 22, 1877. On the same day Johnson conveyed the real estate to Norris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-9\">In March, 1878, Norris formed a copartnership with R. C. Huntress and W. B. Beatty, under the style of R. C. Huntress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and Company. He put in a new foundation for the planer (which is hereinafter described) and added the following machinery : one cutting-off saw, one fitting saw and matcher. This firm occupied the mill for planing and box-making until September 1, 1878, when it dissolved. Norris then took the business in his own name, and from time to time, down to 1882, put in the other machinery named in the writ. He continued to use the mill as a planing and box mill, with a sign on the outside, \u201c Planing and Moulding Mill,\u201d which sign continued on the building till its purchase by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\">Early in 1883, Norris gave to one Samuel M. Barker a bill of sale of the above-described machinery, whereupon involuntary proceedings in insolvency were commenced against Norris, and on January 18,1883, the plaintiff was appointed assignee. The property was not removed from the building by Barker, but suits were instituted by the plaintiff against Barker, which were adjusted, and on May 11, 1883, Barker conveyed his title in the machinery to the plaintiff. The machinery remained in position in the building until replevied, and until after a view had by the auditor in 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">On April 30, 1883, Sarah H. Tweed and Henry Tweed, as executors of the will of James Tweed, deceased, under the power of sale in the mortgage from Parker to Tweed, dated June 1, 1871, and in execution of said power, conveyed the real estate to the defendant Park.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">The machinery was in the mill at the time of the sale to Park, affixed to the building as hereinafter described. Park entered into, and has since retained,' possession of the real estate. There was no evidence of any declaration at the sale as to whether or not the machinery went with the building, and no reference to it in the notice of sale or in the deed to Park. The defendant contended that, by his purchase of the real estate, he acquired the title to the machinery, and refused to deliver it to the plaintiff upon his demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">The following is a description of the machinery replevied, and a statement of the manner in which it was affixed to the building:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">1.

Norris, and claims title under a mortgage of the machinery as personal property, given on September 18, 1875. The defendant claims title to the machinery under a mortgage of the land and building given on June 1, 1871. The engine, boiler, shafting, and a part of the machinery, were put in the building by the mortgagor before making this mortgage, and a part of the machinery was subsequently put in by Norris, who was the third mortgagee of the land and building, and took possession under and foreclosed his mortgage on June 22, 1877. The defendant took possession on April 30, 1883, having purchased the land and building at a sale under the power of sale contained in the mortgage of June 1, 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">The question is whether the machinery was so affixed to the building that it became real property, as between mortgagee and mortgagor. The description, in the auditor\u2019s report, of the machinery, and of the manner in which it was affixed to the building, is somewhat brief, and it is plain that all the facts are not before us that were brought before the auditor, as his view of the premises would be evidence before him. There are no questions of law raised in his report, and the auditor found for the plaintiff. It is not found for what purposes the building was erected, or to what uses it was by its construction adapted, or that the removal of the machinery would in any way injure the building, or impair its value for any of the uses to which it was suited. All of the machines appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>have been separately constructed, and fit for use in any building in which they could be placed; and were secured in position by bolts, screws, nails, or cleats, and could be removed without injury to themselves or the building. The engine, boiler, and necessary shafting, are not included in the writ, and were not replevied.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">It has been said, that \u201c the object, the effect and the mode of annexation are all to be considered in determining whether any specific articles are removable fixtures.\u201d <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>131 Mass. 541. In <em>Allen </em>v. Mooney, 130 Mass. 155, it was held that a portable furnace set in a house upon brick foundations might or might not be a part of the realty, \u201c dependent upon the intention and understanding of the party who devotes it to the use of the building, whether it shall be merely personal property, or whether it shall constitute a part of the building; \u201d and that, as a question of mixed law and fact, the finding of the judge, who tried the case without a jury, could not be revised by this court, if there was competent evidence to support it. It does not appear in the present case that the machinery could not be removed, and other machinery of a different kind put in, and the building be used as beneficially for the new business as for the old. It does not appear that the machinery was put into the building \u201c to carry out the obvious purpose for which it was erected, or permanently to increase its value for occupation.\u201d <em>McConnell </em>v. Blood, 123 Mass. 47. There is great difficulty in determining, as matter of law, upon an agreed statement of facts, whether articles of the kind here described have or have not become a part of the realty, particularly when all the facts which would be competent upon the question are not contained in the agreed statement. The indications afforded by the mode of annexing a machine to a building, and by the use made of it, must clearly show an intention of permanently making it a part of the building, to enable the court, from these facts alone, to declare that, as matter of law, it is a part of the realty in cases where the machine is portable, complete in itself, and can be used elsewhere as well as in the building, and can be removed without injury to itself or to the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">If this case had been submitted to the Superior Court upon the auditor\u2019s report alone, without making it an agreed statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>of facts, it would certainly have been competent for that court to have affirmed the finding of the auditor in favor of the plaintiff. It is not entirely clear what the effect is of the parties submitting the case to that court upon the auditor\u2019s report as an agreed statement of facts, as the auditor has found that the plaintiff is entitled to the property, if that is a finding upon a mixed question of law and fact. However that may be, we are inclined to think that the case falls within the principles of the decision of <em>Hubbell </em>v. <em>East Cambridge Savings Bank, </em>132 Mass. 447; and that the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
