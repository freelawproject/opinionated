Both ponds were used for ice-cutting purposes only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">The defendant requested the judge to rule, that, \u201c If, because of the defendant\u2019s opening up new sources of supply to his pond, the overflow or amount that ran down to the plaintiff\u2019s pond was equal to or larger than before, then the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-8\">The judge declined so to rule, saying to the jury, that, if they were satisfied that the defendant had wrongfully interfered to prevent the flow of a natural watercourse to the plaintiff\u2019s pond, they were not authorized to find that he had furnished in the manner claimed an equivalent supply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $22.27; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the refusal to rule as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-10\"><em>B.

It was limited to this: that, if by the defendant\u2019s opening up new sources of supply to his pond, the overflow or amount of water that ran down to the plaintiff\u2019s pond was equal to or larger than before, the plaintiff could not recover. The judge refused to give this instruction, but ruled that, if the defendant had wrongfully interfered to prevent the flow of a natural watercourse to the plaintiff\u2019s pond, the jury were not authorized to find that the defendant had furnished, in the manner claimed, an equivalent supply. The manner claimed by the defendant was by \u201c the raising of the defendant\u2019s draw-gate from time to time, the overflow of the pond, and leakage.\u201d This was not in compliance with the rule of law governing the use of water by a riparian proprietor upon a natural stream, which is that he should use the water in such a manner that every riparian proprietor. farther down the stream should have the use and enjoyment of it substantially according to its natural flow, subject to such interruption as is necessary and unavoidable by the reasonable and proper use of the water in the stream above. <em>Chandler </em>v. Howland, 7 Gray, 348. The supply must not depend upon the convenience or caprice of the owner up the stream, upon accident, or mere chance. The proprietor below is entitled to have the water flow to him in its accustomed channel, as it had been wont to run through his land.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Even if the plaintiff hitherto, and since the acts of the defendant complained of, has received all the water which ran to his pond before the excavation of the plaintiff\u2019s pond, the instruction prayed for should not, upon the evidence, have been given. The law is well settled, that, where an act is done which violates the right of another, and which is of such a character \u201cthat, if it be continued for a sufficient period of time, the wrongdoer may acquire a title by adverse possession or presumption of a grant, the person whose rights are violated may maintain an action therefor without proof of any other actual damages.\u201d <em>Lund </em>v. <em>New </em>Bedford, 121 Mass. 286, 290. <em>White </em>v. Chapin, 12 Allen, 516. The invasion of a right, if persisted in for sufficient length of time, may result in the extinction of such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>In the case at bar, the water to the plaintiff\u2019s pond came, in addition to overflow and leakage, from the raising of the draw-gate at the defendant\u2019s pond. If the water overflowed the defendant\u2019s pond at all times, so that the plaintiff would always have all the water which he was accustomed to have before the acts of the defendant complained of, the prayer requested by the defendant should have been given. But the evidence shows that the plaintiff obtains his equivalent volume of water, not from the natural, continued, and uninterrupted flow of the water from the defendant\u2019s pond, but by the opening of his draw-gate, at his pleasure, and whenever he thinks proper. In time, by furnishing water to the stream in such manner, the defendant may acquire an absolute right, under which he may refuse to open his draw-gate, and thus supply water to the plaintiff\u2019s pond. The instruction given to the jury recognizes this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The evidence disclosed the fact, that, in excavating for his pond, the defendant tapped a spring in land adjoining his own, and conducted the water flowing therefrom to his pond, and that the water from this spring supplied his pond to a very large extent. If the spring was situated upon the adjoining land, in such way that the owner thereof could divert the water flowing therefrom to the defendant\u2019s pond, as he would have the right to do, this is an additional reason why the prayer of the defendant should have been refused, and the instruction objected to given.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The plaintiff relies upon <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Fitchburg </em>Railroad, 10 Cush. 191. In that case, the presiding judge instructed the jury that, unless the plaintiff suffered actual perceptible damage in consequence of the diversion of water by the defendant, he could not recover, and that if the defendant, by excavating a reservoir and spring above its dam, or by digging ditches, had increased the flow of water in the brook equal to the quantity of water it had diverted therefrom, it was not liable. The instructions given were sustained. There was no question raised of any encroachment upon the rights of the plaintiff, by which in time he might be entirely deprived of them. This marks the distinction between that case and the one at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
