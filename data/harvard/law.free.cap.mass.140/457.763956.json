Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Knowlton, </em>J,, who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">The government offered evidence tending to show that the defendant, on and before January 13,1885, kept a certain saloon in Weymouth; that, on said January 13, three officers, who were witnesses, visited the saloon, which then contained a bar, bottles, jugs, glasses, and a barrel of cider on tap, and, under a search-warrant, seized the cider. These officers also testified that, at the time, there were four glasses and a number of bottles and jugs, all of which smelt of whiskey, in the saloon. The defendant then stated that he had the cider there for sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">There was also evidence that, on two prior occasions, certain intoxicated persons were seen upon the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">The defendant put in evidence the record of said District Court, of a complaint made therein against the defendant, charging him with keeping and maintaining a certain tenement at said Weymouth on October 1, 1884, and on divers days between that day and April 1, 1885, for the illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors; also the record of the trial of the defendant on said complaint, and of his acquittal upon the merits thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-12\">The defendant also introduped evidence tending to show that the same witnesses testified at the trial of that complaint, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>reference to the same saloon, the same visit and seizure of said January 13, the finding and seizure of the cider, and the presence of the glasses, bottles, and jugs smelling of whiskey, in said saloon, and the proprietorship of the defendant; also to the same statements of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">The defendant did not testify as a witness at the present trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury, that the judgment of not guilty was a conclusive adjudication that the cider and the whiskey, on said January 13, were not kept for illegal sale by the defendant; and that they should not consider the evidence as to said day, place, and contents. But the judge refused to give this instruction, and instructed the jury that said judgment was evidence competent for their consideration in favor of the defendant upon that question, but was not conclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury, that the defendant might be able to explain the keeping of the cider, and the presence of the bottles, jugs, and glasses which smelt of whiskey, in some satisfactory way, and consistent with his innocence; and that the jury might draw such inferences, and might infer that the defendant could and would have, if he had become a witness in his own behalf, given some such satisfactory explanation consistent with his innocence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">But the judge instructed the jury that, under the statute, a defendant in a criminal case might testify in his own behalf if he desired; but, if he did not see fit so to do, no inference for him or against him could be drawn from that fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-9\"><em>J.
