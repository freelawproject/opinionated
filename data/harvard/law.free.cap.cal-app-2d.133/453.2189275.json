McGee died January 18, 1954. By a Will dated September 16,1953, he left all of his property to Beulah Layne and Lewis Layne. He named Beulah Layne Executrix. She presented the Will for probate. Dorothy Hall, his daughter, whom he had not seen from the time she was about one year of age, until she was about thirty-five years of age, contested the probate on the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-18\"><em>\u201c1. </em>Unsoundness of mind;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-19\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Lack of execution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-20\">\u201c3. Undue influence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u2018 \u2018 The latter two issues were submitted to the jury. The jury found that the Will was duly executed. The jury found that the Will offered for probate was the result of undue influence exercised from the testator, Herschel B. McGee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201cJudgment denying probate was thereupon entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cAppellants contend the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings of undue influence and that the Court committed prejudicial error in the giving and refusal of certain instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">As recited in respondent\u2019s brief,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201cBeulah Layne and Lewis Layne, her husband, are not related to the decedent. Dorothy Hall is the decedent\u2019s daughter and only lineal deseendent. Dorothy Hall was thirty-eight years of age at the time of the trial. Her mother and the decedent were divorced when she was a very young child. Dorothy Hall did not see her father after the divorce nor did not know his whereabouts until in 1937 when Dorothy Hall was about twenty-one years of age, she learned her father\u2019s address in Los Angeles and wrote to him. Thereafter Dorothy Hall and her father corresponded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\u201cIn 1938, the decedent wrote Dorothy Hall a letter, dated September 26, 1938, which, together with the envelope, was introduced into evidence as Contestant\u2019s Exhibit No. 3 and is a part of the record on this appeal. A portion of the letter is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">\u201c \u2018I have no will made out, but if anything should happen to me, I want you to have what little I have. It isn\u2019t much, but it will help some. With love and best wishes to you and family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">Love,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">Daddy. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-13\">\u201cIn the summer of 1947 Dorothy Hall, together with her husband and children, came to Los Angeles to attend a religious convention and while here, visited the decedent. The first day in Los Angeles, Dorothy Hall and her family called upon the decedent and, although he did not recognize her at sight, when she told him who she was, there was a family reunion typical of that to be expected of a father and daughter long separated. The decedent posed for pictures with Dorothy Hall\u2019s husband and the decedent\u2019s grandchildren while they were here on this visit and two such pictures are in evidence and part of the record on this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-14\">\u2018 \u2018 The decedent sent Christmas presents to his grandchildren <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>both before and after the 1947 visit and Dorothy Hall sent him Christmas presents and Father\u2019s Day gifts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cOn or about August 29, 1953, the decedent suffered a severe heart attack and was taken to White Memorial Hospital where he remained for a period of twenty days. While in the hospital the decedent signed two powers of attorney in favor of Beulah Layne during the first week of September, 1953, and a third power of attorney on or about September 15, 1953, the powers of attorney being prepared by Harry V. Leppek. Said latter power of attorney gave Beulah Layne authority to handle the money and property of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cThe alleged will bearing date of September 16, 1953, was executed while the decedent was still in the hospital. This will was prepared by Beulah Layne\u2019s attorney in this action, Harry V. Leppek. While decedent was in the hospital, Beulah Layne discussed a will with him and when she called Harry V. Leppek and in response to that call Harry V. Leppek went to the hospital and thereafter drew the will for the decedent. Beulah Layne was present at the hospital and at the bedside of the decedent when the alleged will of September 16, 1953, was executed. Her attorney in this action, Harry V. Leppek, had possession of the alleged will from the time of its execution until it was filed for probate. Beulah Layne admitted discussing a will with the decedent on several occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cDorothy Hall was not notified of her father\u2019s illness of September, 1953. Beulah Layne told Mrs. Sherman, Dorothy Hall\u2019s aunt, that she, Beulah Layne, would notify Dorothy Hall of the decedent\u2019s illness but she, in fact, did not. When confronted with this, Beulah Layne first told Dorothy Hall that she did not notify her because she did not know her address and then later told her that her father requested her not to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cAfter the decedent was discharged from the hospital, he went to live at the Layne home and paid Beulah Layne $50.00 per week for his care. Around Christmas of 1953 the decedent moved out of the Layne home. The decedent told Anna Luck that he paid the Laynes $50.00 a week to take care of him and that they had him sign checks every other day or so and that he didn\u2019t have that kind of money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201cDuring the period after the decedent\u2019s discharge from the hospital in September, 1953, up until the time of his death the decedent had many conversations with Lee McGee who roomed in the same building as decedent and who is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>related to the decedent in any way although having the same last name. The decedent told Lee McGee that he, the decedent, had not heard from his daughter and that he could not understand why not. (Dorothy Hall wrote letters to her father during this period and in November of 1953, which was at the time the decedent was living at the Layne home, wrote her father about her daughter\u2019s wedding.) The decedent further stated to Lee McGee that he had dictated letters to Beulah Layne to his daughter, Dorothy Hall. Dorothy Hall testified that she did not receive these letters and although Beulah Layne took the stand she did not deny they were dictated to her. All parties testified that the decedent was paralyzed in his left arm as a result of the illness and that he was left-handed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cIn January, 1954, Lee McGee had another conversation with the decedent, and in that conversation decedent told Lee McGee that he was going to the hospital for a checkup and when he got back he was going to get a lawyer and make a will. The decedent further said that Beulah Layne had been trying to get him to make a will. The decedent further said that he had never made a will but that he was going to get his own lawyer up to his room and wanted Lee McGee to be present. The decedent further told Lee McGee that he had three bank accounts of about $15,000.00 and that he wanted his daughter, Dorothy Hall, to have one-half of it, or $7,500.00, and that he wanted $1,000.00 to go to Mrs. Vera Arnold, $500.00 to Beulah Layne and the balance to his brothers and sisters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u201cBeulah Layne testified that she didn\u2019t see a copy of the alleged will and didn\u2019t know its contents until after decedent\u2019s death; whereas, casual friends testified they knew of the contents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The record supports the foregoing summary of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">That there was substantial evidence to support the verdict of the jury there is no question and the reviewing court is without power to disturb the verdict in such circumstances. <em>(Estate of Pohlmann, </em>89 Cal.App.2d 563 [201 P.2d 446].)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the complaint contained no allegation of confidential relationship is without merit. To make such an objection for the first time on appeal is too late.  \u201cEven where a complaint entirely omits an essential allegation, if the parties have treated it as sufficient throughout the trial and have permitted the issue to he tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>as though properly presented, a defendant cannot for the first time on appeal urge that the complaint, which could have been cured below if the objection had there been made, is defective.\u201d (3 Cal.Jur.2d, p. 620.) And the amendment to the complaint to conform to the proof was timely made. <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>119 Cal. 364 [51 P. 549, 955].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The instructions as to the law relating to confidential relationship were correct and the findings, as well, are supported by the evidence and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">There are no prejudicial errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 5, 1955, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 3, 1955.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
