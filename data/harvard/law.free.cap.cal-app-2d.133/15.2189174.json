At the time of death, an action for fraud against the decedent was pending, instituted by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Mr. Alvarez died on January 14, 1951, and on September 24, 1951, letters of administration were issued to Lola G. Alvarez. On December 27th, appellants filed a creditors\u2019 claim against the estate setting forth the pendency of the action and the nature and amount of the claim, which claim was duly rejected by the administratrix. Thereafter Lola G. Alvarez, administratrix, was regularly joined as a party defendant in the appellants\u2019 action, and appeared in said action.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">On June 16, 1952, the administratrix filed in said estate a first and final account and petition for distribution, which together with a supplement to the account were heard on July 16, 1952. The present appellants appeared at such hearing and objected to approval of the account and distribution and closing of the estate without providing for payment of the appellants\u2019 claim hereinbefore referred to. The account was approved and distribution of all assets ordered to Lola G. Alvarez, administratrix and widow of the deceased, which distribution was accordingly made, the distributee\u2019s receipt therefor being filed on August 18, 1952, since which date the administratrix has had no estate assets. No appeal was taken from the order approving the final account and ordering distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Thereafter, appellants\u2019 action came on for trial in the superior court, and on January 27, 1954, a written stipulation was entered between appellants and Lola G. Alvarez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>that appellants have judgment in the sum of $5,000. The judgment entered was against Mrs. Alvarez personally and as administratrix. This stipulation specifically provides that certain personal property should be sold and the proceeds applied on account of the judgment; that Mrs. Alvarez obtain a $1,000 loan, also to be applied on the judgment, and that in addition to the foregoing, Mrs. Alvarez should pay $25 per month, or more, on the judgment. The judgment entered on February 11, 1954, provided that \u201cpayment of said judgment is to be made pursuant to the written stipulation of the parties filed concurrently herewith.\u201d On July 1, 1954, the appellants filed an abstract of said judgment in the estate proceedings, and on July 13th filed a \u201cpetition for order for payment of claim,\u201d which petition was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">It is appellants\u2019 contention that since section 954 of the Probate Code makes an administrator personally liable for the payment of an allowed claim, the judgment in appellants \u2019 action \u2018 \u2018 is and was at the time of the hearing in the probate proceedings, res adjudicataand that therefore \u201cThe Court in probate erred in refusing to order the administratrix to pay said judgment.\u201d It is also claimed that \u201cThe administratrix has waived any grounds she might possibly have to evade the effect of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The appellants\u2019 position is untenable.  As stated in respondents\u2019 brief: \u201cWhen the court overruled the appellants\u2019 objections and ordered a final distribution of the estate the appellants\u2019 remedy was to appeal from the court\u2019s order if they wished to protect their rights. The order decreeing distribution became final and is now conclusive as to all unpaid creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Section 931 of the Probate Code provides that \u201cThe order settling and allowing the account, when it becomes final, is conclusive against all persons interested in the estate.\u201d In section 952, it is provided that \u201cIf the property of the estate is exhausted by the payment order, such account shall constitute a final account, and the . . . administrator shall be entitled to his discharge on producing and filing the necessary vouchers and proof showing that he has complied with the decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">In this case the administratrix did file a distributee\u2019s receipt showing compliance with the court\u2019s order. The fact that Mrs. Alvarez, the administratrix, was also the sole heir and distributee in no manner affects the situation.  \u201cCer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tainly it is the law, \u2019 \u2019 states the court in <em>Estate of Mailhebuau, </em>218 Cal. 202, 205 [22 P.2d 514], \u201cthat an order allowing an account which has become final is conclusive upon all unpaid creditors.\u201d  Likewise, in <em>Federal Farm Mortg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>35 Cal.2d 1 [215 P.2d 721], it was said that \u201cin the absence of extrinsic fraud or mistake, when the decree (of distribution) becomes final, it is res judicata as to the rights of all persons interested in the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">It is also significant that the judgment, following the stipulation, provided explicitly how the judgment was to be paid by Mrs. Alvarez, and it must certainly be assumed that such terms were agreeable to appellants as well as to the other party signing such stipulation. As respondents say: \u201cit is obvious from the written stipulation that the plaintiffs in that action (appellants herein) did not expect or intend to be paid out of or through the estate of the deceased. \u2019 \u2019 Under these circumstances, the probate court could hardly be expected to take any other action than that of denying appellants\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">White, P. J., and Drapean, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
