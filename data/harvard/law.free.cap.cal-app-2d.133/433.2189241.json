The complaint alleges that the defendant, as owner of the Keystone Auto Court in Santa Maria, negligently maintained a gas heater therein, and that while Mr. and Mrs. Brandwein occupied a room in said auto court, both the wife and husband became asphyxiated by carbon monoxide from the heater, resulting in the wife\u2019s death and the husband\u2019s injuries. Joel David Brandwein was about 22 years of age; Renee Brandwein, the wife, approximately 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Thereafter, on the defendants\u2019 motion, the trial court granted a new trial on two grounds, namely: (1) Irregularity of the proceedings of the court and jury, and (2) Insufficiency of evidence to justify the verdict. The present appeal is from the order granting defendants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The record discloses evidence to the effect that the defendant had purchased the Keystone Auto Court on October 24, 1950; that on February 21, 1951, at about 11:30-12 p. m. in the evening, defendant showed Mr. and Mrs. Brandwein to Room 2 in said court, and informed plaintiffs that the gas heater was burning. The defendant testified that when \u201cthis room was turned over to Mr. Brandwein and his wife\u201d both the front window and the bathroom window were open; that the next morning when Mr. and Mrs. Brandwein were found unconscious in the room, the windows \u201cwere shut tight,\u201d and the heater was still burning.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The gas heater in question was an unvented heater set in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the wall, and carried the seal: \u201cComplies with the National Safety Requirements, Approved, American Gas Association. \u2019 \u2019 Immediately after the accident the heater was inspected by Prank Brandon, general service foreman for Southern Counties Gas Company, who \u201cfound the heater to be in good adjustment; the flame height was proper for that type of a heater, and there were no gas leaks. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">There was testimony by Dr. Missal, who was called in to examine the asphyxiated persons, to the effect that ' \u2018 If there is sufficient oxygen in the room, you wouldn\u2019t get carbon monoxide poisoning\u201d; also, that even in the case of a vented heater with an open flame, the flame will consume air in the room. Plaintiff denied doing anything to the heater, and did not open any windows or ascertain if any windows were open before retiring. Brandwein had had no previous experience with heaters of this type; and was unable to detect any odors emanating from the gas heater.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial upon the ground of irregularity in the proceedings of court and jury, and that if any irregularity existed, no prejudicial error resulted. Prom the trial court\u2019s memorandum of opinion on sustaining defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial, it appears that \u201cAfter the jury had been deliberating for some period of time the Bailiff . . \u2022. advised the Court that the jury desired all of the exhibits. Whereupon the Court ordered that the exhibits ... be given to the jury and among the exhibits so handed to them . . . was Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit No. 11, the deposition of the said Phil Steffan.\u201d This procedure was contrary to the provisions of section 612 of the Code of Civil Procedure permitting a jury to \u201ctake with them all papers which have been received as evidence in the cause except depositions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">As observed in respondents\u2019 brief, \u201cThe testimony given by this witness was, if believed by the jury, extremely damaging to the defendant. In the deposition in question, Philip Steffan testified to stopping at defendant\u2019s auto court in February when Mr. and Mrs. Brandwein stopped there, and previous thereto, and occupied the same room; that Steffan became sick from gas escaping from the heater, and told the defendant that \u201csomebody was going to get in trouble with this gas of yours\u201d; that on another occasion Steffan refused to take that room because of the gas. This episode was denied by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The trial court observed that \u201cthe question of liability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>particularly the question of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff and the deceased wife, Renee Brandwein, were extremely close ones. In view of this fact the Court is convinced that it was prejudicial error to permit the jury to have this deposition in the jury room during its deliberations. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">As stated in respondents\u2019 brief, \u201cIt is not difficult to conceive how the jury could, and no doubt did, give great weight to such written testimony when it was considered in the jury room. It was down in black and white and could be referred to again and again, whereas the testimony given in Court would escape their recollection. . . . Certainly it is probable that the jury did give the testimony of the witness Steffan undue weight and consideration when it was before them in the jury room in this manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument that, at most, this procedure was mere harmless error and insufficient ground for the granting- of a new trial, cannot be sustained. Permitting the jury to have this isolated portion of the evidence, contrary to the provisions of the statute, centered its attention on the Steffan testimony, stressing the importance of this one item and exalting it above all other evidence given at the trial. The obvious result of such procedure could well be that the verdict for plaintiff was based upon this deposition rather than upon a proper consideration of all evidence placed before the jury. The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in' granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The other ground on which the trial court granted a new trial was that of insufficiency of evidence to justify the verdict. It is appellant\u2019s contention that there was \u201cnegligence as a matter of law upon the part of defendant\u201d in view of \u201c (1) The admissions of the defendant that the gas heater in question was defective, and (2) that said defect was a latent and dangerous one.\u201d Cited in support thereof is the defendant\u2019s testimony that \u201cthere was nothing in it for a vent pipe,\u201d and \u201cNever has been.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s transcript, p. 80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The quoted testimony is, of course, only a small part of the evidence bearing on the matter of negligence and contributory negligence, and in any event does not establish negligence as a matter of law. [2] As pointed out in respondents \u2019 brief, section 16900 of the Health and Safety Code merely requires the venting of a gas appliance \u201cwhich is designed to be a vented appliance, as shown by the presence of a vent collar to which a vent may be attached,\u201d and does not declare that the use of an unvented heater, not designed to be vented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>as in the present situation, is unlawful or to be deemed negligence <em>per se. </em>Moreover, the question of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence in retiring without either turning out the heater or leaving a window open, enters in the question of liability. The defendant testified that windows were open when plaintiff: took over the room; in the morning the windows were found closed. And reference has previously been made to expert testimony that the gas heater was found to be in good condition with no gas leaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">It is well established that \u201cthe trial judge is familiar with the evidence, witnesses and proceedings, and is in the best position to determine whether, in view of all the circumstances, justice demands a retrial.\u201d  The presumptions on appeal are in favor of the order, and the appellate court does not independently redetermine the question.  Review is limited to the inquiry whether there is any support for the ruling, and the order will be reversed only where there is a strong showing of abuse of discretion. <em>(Perry </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>102 Cal.App.2d 808 [229 P.2d 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In the instant case the evidence as to negligence and contributory negligence was in conflict, and for the reasons hereinbefore given, the granting of a new trial cannot be deemed an abuse of discretion nor without support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
