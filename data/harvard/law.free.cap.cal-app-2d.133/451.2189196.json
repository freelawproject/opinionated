Courts prefer to rest their decisions upon the merits of causes, rather than to spend time on matters collateral to questions on appeal. <em>(Strauss </em>v. <em>Kroop, </em>207 Cal. 39 [276 P. 993].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">So far as the motion to strike irrelevant portions of the brief is concerned, it is concluded that it will be better to consider the appeal on all of the briefs submitted, rather than to spend time determining what, if any, portions of briefs are or are not relevant, or should or should not be stricken out.  Irrelevant matters in briefs do not have any persuasive weight in determining an appeal. And, in any event, this is a matter committed to the discretion of the reviewing court. <em>(Carpenter </em>v. <em>Pacific M. Life Ins. Co., </em>10 Cal.2d 307 [74 P.2d 761].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
