The jury returned a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">As recited in appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cThe auto collision in question occurred on -February 20, 1952, at approximately 2:20 A. M., at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and Western Avenue, in the City of Los Angeles. Decedent Benjamin Zeidman, operating a Plymouth automobile, was proceeding in a general westerly direction along and upon Washington Boulevard, and the defendant, Margaret Hulsey Anticouni, operating a Ford station wagon, was proceeding in a southerly direction along and upon Western Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>That death of Benjamin Zeidman resulted from this collision, is admitted. The issues, in general, concern themselves with the negligence of the defendant, and the contributory negligence of the decedent, which issues, when refined, amounted to whether the defendant, and/or the decedent, entered the aforementioned intersection with the right of way; whether the defendant and/or decedent were proceeding at a lawful rate of speed at the time immediately prior to the collision. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\u201cPlaintiff requested, among other instructions, the following, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201c \u2018The presumption is that every man obeys the laws, and the presumption in this case is that plaintiff\u2019s husband, Benjamin Zeidman, was travelling at a lawful rate of speed, and entered the intersection while the signals controlling westbound traffic on Washington Boulevard were \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cgo\u201d. This presumption is in itself a species of evidence, and it shall prevail and control your deliberations until, and unless it is overcome by satisfactory evidence. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201cThe Court amended said requested instruction to read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c \u2018The presumption is that every person obeys the law with respect to the traffic signals. This presumption is in itself a species of evidence, and it shall prevail and control your deliberations until, and unless it is overcome by satisfactory evidence. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u201cThere was no other instruction, covering the point as to the presumption of due care by the decedent, given by the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">Appellant argues, \u201cThis instruction was not given. Had it been given, it would have, by its very terms, become a species of evidence, that decedent had traveled at a lawful rate of speed and that he did enter the intersection while the signal guiding his travel was \u2018green\u2019 or \u2018go.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">\u201cIt would have then become a question for the Jury as to whether the presumption, weighed with or against the evidence introduced by the respondent and her witnesses, would prevail or be overcome, but this question was not presented to the Jury, because the instruction, as requested was not given. This is precisely the error complained of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">Appellant contends that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">\u201c1. The Court committed prejudicial error in refusing to give the plaintiff\u2019s instruction as submitted and by giving the instruction as amended by the Court, plaintiff was substantially deprived of the presumption of due care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201c2. The Court committed prejudicial error in giving to the jury, the instruction as amended, which told the jury that a presumption of due care applied to the defendant.\u201d Respondent, on the other hand, points out that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201cThe instruction as amended obviously extended the benefit of the presumption to both parties. Moreover, at appellant\u2019s request, the Court gave the following instruction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201c \u2018The law presumes that Benjamin Zeidman, now deceased, in his conduct at the time of and immediately preceding the accident here in question, was exercising ordinary care and was obeying the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201c \u2018 These presumptions are a form of <em>prima facie </em>evidence and will support findings in accordance therewith, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. When there is other evidence that conflicts with such a presumption, it is the jury\u2019s duty to weigh that evidence against the presumption and any evidence that may support the presumption to determine which, if either, preponderates. Such deliberations, of course, shall be related to, and in accordance with, my instructions on the burden of proof. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201cThis latter instruction applied specifically to the decedent\u2019s conduct only.\u201d In this connection respondent argues that, \u201cappellant was not deprived of the instruction of due care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">There are, of course, many cases on the subject involved but it would serve no useful purpose to quote from them for the law is well settled. Obviously, appellant\u2019s contention that the modification of the instruction misled the jury is of course an assumption. As a matter of fact and as a matter of law, it appears that the jury was adequately instructed on the subject and that no prejudice could have resulted from the modification as argued by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">That the evidence supports the verdict there can be no question and a review of the record reveals no prejudicial errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
