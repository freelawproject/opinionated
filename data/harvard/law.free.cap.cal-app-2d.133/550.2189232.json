Mr. and Mrs. Stuart filed the original complaint; thereafter a cross-complaint was filed by Mr. and Mrs. Harper. There was a jury trial which resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the Harpers and against the Stuarts in the sum of $7,700, from which the Stuarts now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">As stated in appellants\u2019 brief, \u201cRespondents (Harpers) were traveling from Pomona to Los Angeles. Westbound traffic goes over the crest of the hill, then goes on down to another area, then comes to a rise, and then goes down a second hill. ... At the place of the accident the highway had a center divided line area and two westbound lanes separated by a single line. According to Mr. Harper\u2019s testimony, at the time of the collision Appellant\u2019s ear was partly in both of the westbound lanes at an angle, and the lefthand side of Respondent\u2019s car came in contact with the lefthand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>side of Appellant\u2019s side. When Mr. Harper first observed the Stuart automobile it was not moving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The respondents\u2019 version of the accident is that the Stuarts had been eastbound \u201cand were going uphill on Kellogg Hill when they began having mechanical trouble with their car. . . . then the Stuarts being unable to make it up the hill, coasted backwards making a semi-circle in an effort to turn around and go back to Los Angeles. In making this maneuver, they were in a position where they were headed in a general southwesterly direction at about a 30 or 45 degree angle with the traffic lanes with their car blocking the westbound traffic lane next to the center dividing strip at the moment the Harper\u2019s westbound automobile came over the crest of the hill in this same traffic lane, and after its brakes were applied, collided with the left rear (principally on the side) of the Stuart car with the right front of their own car. . . . The U-turn made by the Stuart automobile was made within 200 feet of the crest of the second hill and the crest did obscure visibility of westbound vehicles. Further, the U-turn was made across a dividing strip in violation of Vehicle Code, Section 525(e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Appellants present three issues, the first of which is that \u201cIt was error for the trial court to refuse appellants\u2019 request to introduce Deputy Sheriff Jessup\u2019s notebook into evidence.\u201d It is appellants\u2019 argument that the question of liability turned on the question \u201cDid Appellant turn around at the intersection of Via Verde or did he back his car across the center dividing strip and attempt to proceed westerly in that manner?\u201d and that the cross-complainants\u2019 ease depended largely upon alleged admissions concerning this matter made by Stuart to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Officer Jessup was questioned concerning notes made at the time, and the fact (admitted by Jessup) that part of the notations \u201cwere somewhat lighter in appearance,\u201d which might indicate that the notes had been \u201cdoctored\u201d after the event. Appellants contend that the noebook should have been admitted as impeaching evidence. In this same connection it appears that Mr. Stuart had been acquitted in a criminal trial at West Covina of a charge growing out of the same occurrence, for which reason appellants argue that the officers \u201cwere out to \u2018get\u2019 Mr. Stuart because they had been rebuffed by the trial court\u2019s decision,\u201d and that Officer McArthur had stated, \u201cas far as I am concerned, you are guilty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>you will take my advice and stay out of Pomona, because we have got your number.\u201d This was denied by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The trial court refused to admit in evidence the officer\u2019s notes in reference to the accident, saying: \u201cYou have read the entire thing in evidence.\u201d Appellants now argue that \u201cIf the trial court had permitted into evidence Officer Jessup\u2019s notes, and if upon examining them the jury had come to the conclusion that because of the dissimilarity between the light and dark penciled notes and because of the variation between his testimony about the sequence of securing the information and the way it was written down in the book, that Officer Jessup had made them at a different time, contrary to his testimony on the stand, the jury would have been justified in disregarding his testimony regarding the alleged admissions of Mr. Stuart.\u201d A part of these notes read, \u201cFuel failure, and let the vehicle roll backwards down the hill, then turned around by coasting.\u201d It was this latter notation, says appellants\u2019 brief, \u201cwhich was lighter in appearance than the balance of the notes, as though written by a different pencil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">There is no merit in this contention. As stated by the trial court, the entire notes made by the officer were read into evidence, and Officer Jessup had admitted that a part thereof appeared \u201csomewhat lighter in appearance,\u201d for which the officer could give no reason but stated that the entries were made with the same pencil. Appellants\u2019 assumption that the jury would have believed the Stuarts\u2019 testimony but for this refusal to admit the officer\u2019s notes in evidence, is not borne out by the record. As respondents\u2019 brief points out, \u201cthe case turned on several salient points long before Officer Jessup took the stand.\u201d Skidmark photographs, pictures showing damage to the automobiles, oral testimony and other evidence was before the jury, from which a reasonable conclusion could be reached that Mr. Stuart was in fault. In view of these facts, appellants can have sustained no prejudice from the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the officer\u2019s notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Appellants\u2019 contention that \u201cIt was error for the trial court to give California Vehicle Code, Section 542,\u201d which provides that \u201cNo vehicle shall be turned so as to proceed in the opposite direction upon any curve, or upon the approach to, or near the crest of, a grade, where such vehicle cannot be seen by the driver of any other vehicle approaching from either direction within 200 feet,\u201d is likewise untenable. The respondents\u2019 brief correctly points out that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>a conflict of evidence as to the exact point where Mr. Stuart attempted to turn around, that \u201cThe reason the officers could not specify the point of impact in relation to the second crest is because the accident occurred on an open highway at night and there were no signposts or other artificial objects in the immediate vicinity.\u201d From the photographs and other evidence disclosed by the record, the jury could and evidently did believe that the accident occurred \u201cvery close to the crest\u2014close enough to be dangerous\u2014and that the crest did obstruct the visibility of westbound drivers. \u2019 \u2019 The entire question resolved itself to one of fact, and the verdict of the jury is not without support. The giving of the instruction in question cannot be deemed prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">It is further contended that \u2018 \u2018 It was error for the trial court to instruct the jury that each party was entitled to the presumption of law that every person takes ordinary care of his own concerns and that he obeys the law.\u201d As respondents state, even \u201cAssuming that the presumption instruction was academically erroneous, it would require a healthy imagination to perceive any prejudicial effect.\u201d The judge had correctly instructed the jury that the first issue to be decided was \u201cWas either party negligent?\u201d As already indicated, there were two widely varying versions and theories as to the conduct, movement and position of the Stuart vehicle, and the instruction in question was so worded as to benefit either or both parties. There were other adequate instructions as to negligence, contributory negligence, burden of proof, etc., and in view of the entire charge, the instruction given cannot be deemed prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 11, 1955.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
