Gorton, to recover from the defendants Potter and one Burdick possession of certain lands owned by said Gorton while living. The first count of the declaration charged a wrongful dispossession by both defendants. The second count charged the defendant Potter with having been tenant of \u201c Alma Gorton, administratrix, and as agent of the plaintiffs,\u201d and with holding over after the expiration of the term of tenancy. The tenancy rested on a sealed instrument signed by \u201c Alma Gorton, administratrix,\u201d and by \u201c William A. H. Potter.\u201d Alma Gorton was widow and administratrix of Benjamin T. Gorton. Judgment was given for the plaintiffs, and the defendants excepted. The questions involved sufficiently appear from the opinion following.</summary>\n<court data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b529-15\">Providence,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ae1\"><em>March </em>2, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AZT\">Matteson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">We are of the opinion that this suit should have been brought either by Alma Gorton alone, in which case she as lessor would have been entitled to recover possession of the land sued for as against the defendant Potter, the lessee, and also against the defendant Burdick if holding as a tenant under Potter, on the principle that the lessee and those holding under him are estopped to deny the lessor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>title; or that it should have been brought by the other plaintiffs as the owners of the land sued for, who, upon proof of their ownership, would be entitled to recover against both or either of the defendants, if wrongfully detaining the possession. But we do not think that Alma Gorton can properly be joined as plaintiff in the same suit with the other plaintiffs, she having, so far as appears, no interest in the land sued for except a mere right of dower. In ejectment, to entitle the plaintiffs to recover, <em>all </em>of them must have the right to demand possession from the defendant, or the action will fail. <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>14 R. I. 589, 599, and cases cited.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b530-8\"><em>Dexter B. Potter, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aeo\"><em>Samuel W. K. Allen, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We think, too, that the declaration is defective as against the defendant Burdick. The first count charges the wrongful detention of the property by both defendants, but contains no averment that the premises sued for were an estate let. We think such an averment was necessary, the action being in a Special Court of Common Pleas. <em>Champlin </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>12 R. I. 123. The second count sets forth a letting to the defendant Potter, and a wrongful detention by him, but contains no averment respecting the defendant Burdick.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We think the court below erred, in so far as its rulings were inconsistent with the views herein expressed, and we sustain the defendant\u2019s exceptions to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Under the broad powers conferred upon the court by Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 204, \u00a7 34; cap. 210, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5; cap. 220, \u00a7 20, we think we have the power, and that it is our duty, to permit such amendments to the writ and declaration as may be necessary to sustain the action. For a similar exercise of such power, see <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Colt, </em>14 R. I. 209, 214; <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>14 R. I. 589, 599. We will, therefore, upon motion, permit the writ and declaration to be amended conformably hereto, on condition that no costs to this date be recovered against the defendants or either of them ; and will then remit the case to the Special Court of Common Pleas for new trial, unless the defendants assent that judgment be entered here for the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such amended suit, for possession, ,without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
