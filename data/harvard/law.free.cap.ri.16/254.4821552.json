Lorillard, all articles ordered by me for the decoration and furnishing of the dwelling and place hereby devised (if any remain undelivered at the time of my decease), including, among other things, any rugs, tapestries, or stained glass which may have been ordered by me for those purposes.\u201d . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">\u201c <em>Nineteenth. </em>With regard to all the rest and residue of the estate, real and personal, which may belong to me in my own right at the time of my decease, and whether derived to me by purchase, gift, or devise, I give, devise, and bequeath the same in equal shares absolutely and forever to such of the following cousins of mine on the part of both my father and mother as may survive me, that is to say.\u201d . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">The will was dated and executed February 14, 1884.

These buildings were partly on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>one tract and partly on the other, and were used in connection with her house situated on the land bought of the executors and trustees of Lawrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">The present petition was filed on a case stated by Louis L.

Wolfe on the 29th of May, A. D. 1884, did not pass under the twelfth clause of her will, but that it did pass under the nineteenth clause as a part of the residuary estate, said nineteenth clause extending in express terms to real property belonging to the testatrix in her own right at the time of her decease. The parcel was purchased after the will was made, and therefore could not pass by it unless by virtue of the statute, Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 182, \u00a7 1, the familiar rule of the common law being that, in order to pass real estate by will, the testator must be seized of it when he makes the will. Our statute empowers a testator to devise after acquired real estate, \u201cprovided his intention to devise the same appears by the express terms of the will.\u201d In <em>Church </em>v. <em>Warren Manfacturing Co. </em>14 R. I. 539, this court held that \u201c the proper construction of our statute requires that the intention appear in direct and explicit terms on the face of the will.\u201d The twelfth clause devises two parcels of land \u201crecently purchased at Newport\u201d by the testatrix, which of course means two parcels which she had previously acquired, and it contains no \u201c express terms \u201d from which it appears that it was her intention to devise still a third parcel to be subsequently acquired. We do not think there would be any question but that the devise included only the two parcels which the testatrix then had, if she had not purchased one of said parcels from the same person from whom she subsequently purchased the third parcel, and had not afterwards erected a valuable building partly on both of the two latter parcels, which were contiguous' and formerly constituted a single tract, since it is natural to suppose that she must have intended the building for use as a whole in connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>tion with the real estate devised by the twelfth clause. Admitting this, however, it does not follow that she had this intention when she made her will. She may have formed it after purchasing the third parcel, and have intended to make it effectual by codicil or a new will. Or, even if we suppose she had the intention when she made her will, still it is only by way of conjecture or inference that we can so suppose; the intention does not appear in \u201c express terms,\u201d as the statute requires, and an intention which the will does not duly demonstrate is as inoperative as if it had never existed. As to the suggestion that there is some inadvertence in the language of the twelfth clause, we can only say that we do not find the slightest reason for thinking that that clause is not in word and letter precisely as the testatrix intended to have it.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b293-6\"><em>Samuel R.
