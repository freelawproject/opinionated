It is declared to be the sense of the Congress that any person who is restored to a position in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b) [of this section] should be so restored in such manner as to give him such status in his employment as he would have enjoyed if he had continued in such employment continuously from the time of his entering the armed forces until the time of his restoration to such employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b691-10\">KILEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Plaintiff Witty, a reemployed veteran, sued under Sec. 9 of the Universal Military Training and Service Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming restoration of job seniority rights. After allowing System Federation No. 91 of the Railway Employes\u2019 Department, AFL-CIO, bargaining representative for Witty\u2019s Union \u2014 Brotherhood of Railroad Carmen \u2014 to intervene as a defendant, the court granted summary judgment against Witty, and he has appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Witty was a \u201ccarman helper\u201d at the Railroad\u2019s Howell, Indiana shops when he was inducted into the armed forces on September 1, 1950. In his absence, because of a shortage of carmen mechanics, the Railroad and Witty\u2019s Union made an agreement under which carmen helpers could be upgraded temporarily to carmen mechanics. In April, 1951, nine helpers were upgraded to mechanic. One of them, Mitchell, had been junior to Witty in the helper grade. When Witty returned from military service, he accepted the higher grade employment as mechanic and was advanced to that status provisionally on April 14,1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-15\">After satisfactory performance as a mechanic for a period of 1,040 days, a requirement of the upgrading contract, a temporarily upgraded carman had the right to the carman mechanic grade with seniority rights from the end of that period. If he exercised the right he lost his seniority as carman helper; if not, he could relinquish the mechanic status and revert to the helper grade with full seniority in that grade. In the latter event he could not be upgraded temporarily again.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">Witty and the other upgraded employees completed the required 1,040 days as mechanics, the others meeting that requirement before Witty did. He was given seniority as a mechanic from the date he completed the 1,040 days work and accordingly was made junior to Mitchell. Witty\u2019s demand to be restored to seniority over Mitchell by virtue of Sec. 9 was denied by the Railroad. This suit, brought by the United States Attorney in Witty\u2019s behalf,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-17\">An affidavit submitted by the Railroad in support of its summary judgment motion tends to show that the advancement from carman helper to mechanic was \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d An opposing affidavit for Witty tends to show that the advancement was \u201cautomatic.\u201d Presumably the district court decided the affidavits did not present a genuine issue of material fact, under F.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In support of its conclusion the district court cited only the decision of the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Tilton v. Missouri Pac. R., 306 F.2d 870 (1962). The Eighth Circuit in Tilton relied upon McKinney v. Missouri-Kan.-Tex., R., 357 U.S. 265, 78 S.Ct. 1222, 2 L.Ed.2d 1305 (1958), in holding that a returning veteran was not entitled to advanced seniority where he could not show with certainty that had he remained on the job he would, have accepted the opportunity for advancement and completed the training period in the shortest possible time. The Supreme Court rejected this \u201cabsolute foreseeability\u201d interpretation of McKinney, and reversed the court of appeals judgment. Tilton v. Missouri Pac. R., 376 U.S. 169, 84 S.Ct. 595, 11 L.Ed.2d 590 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The Railroad urges affirmance of the summary judgment under the rule announced in McKinney v. Missouri-Kan.-Tex. R., 357 U.S. 265, 78 S.Ct. 1222, because of the \u201cdiscretion\u201d reserved to the Railroad and Witty\u2019s Union in the agreement for temporary upgrading of the carmen helpers. The Supreme Court in Tilton, 376 U.S. at 180, 84 S.Ct. at 602, reads McKinney as holding that \u201cwhere advancement depends on an employer\u2019s discretionary choice not exercised prior to entry into service, a returning veteran cannot show within the reasonable certainty required by the Act that he would have enjoyed advancement simply by virtue of continuing employment during the time he was in military service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The facts in McKinney are different from those in the case before us. There the provision of the bargaining agreement governing McKinney\u2019s right of advancement was expressly dependent upon \u201cfitness and ability\u201d and the \u201cexercise of a discriminating managerial choice.\u201d 357 U.S. at 272, 78 S.Ct. at 1227. The complaint was dismissed for failure to state a cause of action, and the court of appeals and the Supreme Court affirmed. After announcing its holding, however, the Supreme Court, because McKinney claimed that the promotion he sought was not actually discretionary, remanded to give him an opportunity to make proof of that allegation. We think the McKinney case does not require us to affirm the summary judgment in favor of the railroad. On the contrary, it supports Witty\u2019s claim that he should be permitted to prove his allegations. The Supreme Court in Tilton adverted to the remandment in McKinney as an indication that the seniority right claimed did not require \u201cabsolute foreseeability of automatic advancement.\u201d 376 U.S. at 180, 84 S.Ct. at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The Supreme Court in both McKinney and Tilton referred to the \u201cescalator principle\u201d announced in Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock and Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, 284-285, 66 S.Ct. 1105, 1111, 90 L.Ed. 1230 (1946), entitling a reemployed veteran to step back on the \u201cseniority escalator\u201d at the \u201cprecise point he would have occupied had he kept his position continuously during the war.\u201d This principle was incorporated into the Act as See. 9(c) (2) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and is the basic reason for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Tilton that had the plaintiffs there remained continuously on the job they would have qualified as journeymen in advance of those who passed them in seniority. 376 U.S. at 177, 84 S.Ct. 595. \u201cBut for their absence,\u201d the Court said, they would have achieved the seniority they claimed in the suit. The same principle was applied in Brooks v. Missouri Pac. R., 376 U.S. 182, 185, 84 S.Ct. 578, 580, 11 L.Ed.2d 599 (1964), filed contemporaneously with Tilton, that \u201cbut for petitioner\u2019s military service, he [Brooks] probably would have achieved, by virtue of continued satisfactory employment, seniority status * * * \u201d claimed by him. The principle governs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>whether the advancement is before induction into military service as in Tilton, or after induction as in Witty\u2019s case. The question in either event is whether the advancement would have occurred but for the induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We think that Witty\u2019s affidavits, if taken as true, establish that in practice promotions from helper to mechanic were not discretionary but were virtually automatic, despite the language of the agreement. Applying Sec. 9(c) (2) of the Act and the rules in McKinney and Tilton to Witty\u2019s suit, the affidavits raise a genuine issue of material fact whether \u201cbut for his absence in military service\u201d Witty would have attained the seniority status he now claims. Tilton v. Missouri Pac. R., 376 U.S. 169, 181, 84 S.Ct. 595 (1964); Brooks v. Missouri Pac. R., 376 U.S. 182, 84 S.Ct. 578 (1964); Diehl v. Lehigh Valley R., 348 U.S. 960, 75 S.Ct. 521, 99 L.Ed. 749 (1955), rev\u2019g per curiam 211 F.2d 95 (3d Cir. 1954). Witty asks us to remand for a determination of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The terms themselves of the upgrading agreement do not determine whether in practice the advancement of the helpers was discretionary. On remand the district court must decide upon what is submitted by Witty and the Railroad what the practice was. The Railroad\u2019s argument that the maner of exercising discretion is immaterial begs the question to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The district court decided laches did not bar Witty\u2019s suit. It found that Witty since his reemployment has persistently claimed seniority over Mitchell; that from 1952 to 1960 his demand has been subject of correspondence between the Department of Labor and the Railroad ; that late in 1960 his case was referred by the Labor Department to the Department of Justice which delayed filing his suit in anticipation of decisions it thought would induce the Railroad to grant the claim voluntarily; that the suit was begun within the applicable fifteen year limitation -period in Indiana; and that the facts are -insufficient to establish an equitable estoppel. We see no error in the conclusion on this undisputed history of the dispute. Crittenden v. Lines, 327 F.2d 537, 543 (9th Cir. 1964); Boris v. Hamilton Mfg. Co., 253 F.2d 526, 528-529 (7th Cir. 1958). The district court made no mention of the facts stated here in the Railroad\u2019s brief bearing on its claim of prejudice from changing circumstances during the delay. We have considered the arguments in the briefs of both parties on this point and are not persuaded that the likelihood of prejudice equitably precludes Witty\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">For the reasons given, the judgment is reversed. We remand for trial of the issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-13\">. 62 Stat. 604, 50 U.S.C.App. 451, 459.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-18\">. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 459(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
