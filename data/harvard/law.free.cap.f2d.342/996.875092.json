Asserting that the plaintiff was an executive employee not covered by the Act the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment accompanied by supporting affidavits. The plaintiff filed no counter affidavits, relying solely upon a stipulation which his counsel alleges he entered into with counsel for the defendant in open court but which the record fails to substantiate. The district court entered a summary judgment for the defendant which is fully supported by the opinion filed by Judge Gordon in the district court. 230 F.Supp. 23. Upon that opinion the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
