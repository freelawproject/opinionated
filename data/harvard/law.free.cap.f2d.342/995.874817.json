Appellant presented two theories of recovery, namely, (1) negligence of appellee, its servants, agents or employees and (2) unseaworthiness of appellee\u2019s vessel. A jury trial was had. At the close of the evidence, the trial court concluded that there was no substantial evidence either of actionable negligence on the part of appellee, its agents, servants or employees or of the vessel being unseaworthy and granted appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and entered judgment for the appellee. Appellant, in this appeal, complains of that action of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">A careful review of the record convinces us that the trial court was correct in its determination that there was no substantial evidence to support either appellant\u2019s theories of recovery.
