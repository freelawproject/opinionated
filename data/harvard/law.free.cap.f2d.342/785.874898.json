The trial court\u2019s judgment was premised upon the undisputed fact that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused solely by the personal negligence of a federal employee with whom plaintiff had entered, in consideration of payment to him of $5,275.00, into an agreement designated as a \u201ccovenant not to execute.\u201d For the reasons stated by the trial court in his memorandum decision, 231 F.Supp. 883, we hold that under the law of Oklahoma the agreement and settlement with the employee relieved the United States from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
