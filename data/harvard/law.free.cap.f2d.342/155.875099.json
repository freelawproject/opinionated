In the first, No. 14966, the defendant is a New Jersey non profit corporation organized exclusively for hospital purposes. The claim against it is for alleged negligence in connection with personal injuries sustained by plaintiff while a patient in defendant\u2019s hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-22\">Admittedly the provisions of New Jersey Statute 2A:53A-7, 8, N.J.S.A. limiting liability for negligence to $10,-000 in the type of action before us, applies to the defendant. It is further necessarily conceded in this court that as a consequence, the matter in controversy does not exceed \u201cthe sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(a) and therefore that the district court did not have jurisdiction of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">In that situation appellant, in the district court, moved to add the corporate defendant in his first suit as a party defendant in No. 14967. In the latter, it is alleged that Joseph A. Piccolella the defendant, was employed at the hospital while plaintiff was there as a patient and that plaintiff injured himself \u201cby reason of the negligence of the defendant.\u201d In denying this motion Judge Shaw in the district court correctly held that \u201cThe only thing that brings these cases together is an order to consolidate for the purpose of trial. In every other respect each action stands as a separate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The summary judgment in the district eourt in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff in No. 14966 will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The order of the district court in No. 14967 denying the motion of plaintiff to add Alexian Brothers, a corporation of the State of New Jersey, as a party defendant in this cause will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
