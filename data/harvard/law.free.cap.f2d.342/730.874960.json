This summary has been taken from appellee\u2019s brief to which appellant offers no objection in his reply brief, and which we find from our review of the transcript to be fair and fully supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-20\">On May 26, 1961, the First National Bank of Arizona, 33rd Street and East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona, was chartered by the Controller of Currency of the Treasury Department of the United States and the deposits at this particular branch were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-21\">At approximately 3:00 P.M., on May 26,1961, James Raymond Neal approached Mr. Russell Lee Findlay, Assistant Branch Manager of the First National Bank of Arizona, 33rd Street and McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona, who was at the officers\u2019 platform located at the south end of the bank, while Mr. Findlay was facing the lobby and talking on the telephone. When Mr. Neal had entered the bank at 3:00 P.M., he was seen by Dorothy Kuhfuss, who was at the back drive-in window closest to the north end of the bank. She had met and known Mr. Neal before May 26,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-22\">At about this time, Mr. Neal confronted Mr. Findlay with an automatic weapon approximately eighteen (18) inches from Mr. Findlay\u2019s face. Mr. Findlay was then informed by Mr. Neal that this was a robbery and he was forced at gun point to walk through the swinging gates to the tellers\u2019 area to approximately teller window number three (3), about five (5) feet in from the counter in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>inside of the tellers\u2019 area. Teller number three (3) was the third teller from the south end of the bank. This robber was identified by Mr. Findlay as the defendant, James Raymond Neal. In addition, Mr. Neal was unequivocally identified by other witnesses as the bank robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Mr. Neal then went from teller to teller distributing a paper sack to each of the five tellers and encouraged them to hurriedly fill the bags with cash. During all of this time the appellant had a revolver. He then proceeded to collect only three of the five bags which the tellers had filled from the respective tellers\u2019 buses. Each of the three tellers included in his respective bag a pack of $50.00 bills, totaling $250.00 each, which serial numbers had been previously recorded. One of the unfilled paper sacks was left at the front drive-in window at the south end of the bank by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">At that time, Mr. Neal told everyone to get down on the floor. Then Mr. Neal left the bank through the east door. Immediately a telephone call was made to the police reporting the robbery. After he left the bank the appellant was seen proceeding in a northerly direction over the bank parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">At about 3:20 P.M., May 26, 1961, the paper bag was recovered from the floor of the drive-in teller cage at the south end of the bank where Mr. Neal had thrown it.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Subsequently, on that same date, between 4:00-4:15 P.M., since no business was conducted after the robbery by the bank tellers, cash sheets of tellers numbers 1, 2 and 3 were prepared reflecting the loss incurred by the bank as a result of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Shortly after the robbery a 1953 Ford was observed speeding south on 32nd Street, near McDowell Road, and it proceeded to cut across a service station lot. Since several violations had occurred the vehicle was then followed by a police officer of the Phoenix Police Department. The chase continued west on McDowell Road during which the police officer received a radio call that the bank had been robbed. At this time, the siren of the police car was turned on and the pursuit continued down several side streets during which time the 1953 Ford was attempting to evade the police automobile. Subsequently, the 1953 Ford stopped on Diamond Street, west of 32nd Street, at which time the Phoenix police officer radioed that that the other vehicle was stopping and that the occupant was possibly a suspect in the bank robbery. The police officer drew his service weapon and ordered the occupant of the 1953 Ford to put up his hands and proceed to the police car which the appellant did. Thereupon, the appellant was searched by the police officer and a loaded .38 automatic weapon was found in the right front pocket of Mr. Neal and a knife in his left rear pocket. The time was about 3:15 P.M., on May 26, 1961. Handcuffs were put on the appellant and he was put into the rear seat of the police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">At approximately this time a detective of the Phoenix Police Department arrived at the scene and observed the appellant with the Phoenix police officer. Then the detective proceeded to look in the 1953 Ford vehicle and observed four brown paper sacks on the front seat. Upon viewing the paper bags they were then opened and three were full of money and the fourth bag had a loaded .22 revolver with a four (4) inch barrel. Thereafter, the money was compared with the list of recorded serial numbers of certain $50.00 packs taken from the bank tellers and the numbers matched.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">The paper bag that was recovered from the floor of the drive-in teller cage at the south end of the bank where Mr. Neal had thrown it was submitted to the Phoenix Police Department, Identification Division, for the purpose of possible fingerprint identification. During the processing of the paper bag at the Phoenix Police Department Identification Division Laboratory several latent fingerprints were discovered thereon. After a comparison of the processed latent fingerprints on the paper bag and the known fingerprints of the appellant, it was con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>eluded that the fingerprints on the paper bag were those of Mr. Neal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">On May 26,1961, subsequent to the appearance and preliminary hearing of Mr. Neal before the United States Commissioner, Phoenix, regarding the charge which is the basis for the appellant\u2019s conviction, Mr. Neal was interviewed. Present was a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a detective of the Phoenix Police Department. Mr. Neal was then advised that he did not have to talk, that any statement he made would be voluntary on his part, that he had the right to consult with an attorney, that if he did make a statement it could be used in a court of law against him. The appellant then stated that he had cased the bank prior to the robbery of the bank at 33rd Street and McDowell. Mr. Neal also said: that the car used was to be abandoned in Phoenix; that the guns used in the bank robbery had been loaded but he hadn\u2019t intended to use them during the robbery; that he had several chances to shoot the arresting officer during the time that he was being arrested but he had no intention of using the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\"><em>We </em>shall first consider the first specification of error. On September 8, 1961, appellant and Thompson filed a motion for an order \u201csevering the offenses charged against defendants in the indictment herein from the offenses charged against the defendant James Raymond Neal or for such other relief as justice may require, on the grounds that defendant Thompson, is prejudiced by the joinder of defendants herein.\u201d Following hearing on September 18, 1961, the District Court denied the motion. It does not appear that appellant on this appeal questions the propriety of such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The jury trial of appellant and Thompson commenced at 1:30 o\u2019clock p. m., on ..October 10, 1961. Counsel for the Government and for the defendants announced themselves ready for trial. Twenty-eight jury veniremen were present. Counsel for the defendants advised the court that he wished to make a motion in the absence of the jury, whereupon the court and counsel repaired to the chambers of the District Judge. In chambers, counsel for appellant announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">\u201cI have been requested by the defendants to renew a motion for severance in this matter. You will recall you have heard this one motion for severance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">\u201cCOUNSEL: There is a new ground for the motion for severance, and that is that since the prior motion was argued, there have been certain occurrences at the County jail resulted in adverse publicity to particularly one of the defendants, Defendant Thompson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-12\">\u201cDefendant Neal feels that this adverse publicity has resulted in a prejudice to him by being joined with Defendant Thompson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-13\">\u201cHe would also like to move for a change of venue, based upon the newspaper articles and television news commentaries which have carried the names of at least Thompson, and in some cases Defendant Neal, as being members of a Kangaroo Court involved in the beating up of another prisoner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-14\">\u201cHe feels [Neal] that these charges against him are unfounded and unproven and tend to color the opinion of the community so that he may not obtain a fair trial here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-15\">\u201cTherefore, on those grounds, I would like to move for a severance of the two defendants and for a change of venue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">The District Court stated to counsel for appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-17\">\u201cYou can inquire about whether they [veniremen] heard any adverse newspaper publicity, or not, on either of these defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-18\">\u201cCOUNSEL: I will be allowed to inquire as to whether there is bias or prejudice in reference to the newspaper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I always do that in any case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, because every case tried here receives some publicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">\u201cI merely ask whether they have read anything in the newspapers about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201cCOUNSEL: May I ask that you ask \u2018or about the defendants\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Whereupon the District Court denied the motions made by appellant\u2019s counsel. It appears that on the afternoon on which the trial commenced, the Phoenix evening newspaper contained an article displayed in the right-hand corner of page 9 concerning the beating and torturing of a prisoner in the County Jail. The articles contained the names of appellant and co-defendant and referred to them as \u201cex-convicts\u201d and as having participated with the most enthusiasm in the torturing and beating of a fellow prisoner. The next day, October 11,1961, the Phoenix morning newspaper carried an article on .page 12 containing similar references to appellant and his co-defendant. The articles are not a part of the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">Following the hearing in chambers, trial was resumed in open court and the twenty-eight veniremen were called into the jury box and properly sworn for examination upon voir dire. Following the reading of the indictment, the District Court questioned the entire panel as to their qualifications to serve as jurors and asked the panel \u201cHave you ever read about this case in the newspapers or discussed it with anybody?\u201d Two veniremen stated that they had previously read newspaper accounts but stated that they had formed no opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendants. The remainder of the veniremen gave a negative response. The court also asked \u201cHas any juror heard any remarks which .caused him to formulate or to have any opinion as to the possible guilt or innocence of the defendants? to which question there was a negative response. Following voir dire examination by the court, counsel for the appellant requested, and was granted, permission to question the veniremen. The transcript of such examination is as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">\u201cCOUNSEL: May I ask the prospective jurors if any person here has read anything in the newspapers, not of this particular case, but of these defendants, Thompson and Neal? Let me have your hands, if you have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-14\">\u201cA (No show of hands by jurors.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-15\">\u201cQ May I ask the panel if any of you currently receive a government pension ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-16\">\u201cA (By a Juror) : I draw compensation for a service disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-17\">\u201cQ Do you feel in'any way this economic benefit to you would influence how you feel about this particular case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-18\">\u201cA By the Juror: I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-19\">\u201cQ I will ask if any person here is related to an employee of the First National Bank, or if any of you own stock in the First National Bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-20\">\u201cA (Negative indication by Jurors.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-21\">\u201cCOUNSEL: That is all the questions I have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-22\">Following such examination twelve of the veniremen were selected as members of the jury to try the case. The two veniremen who had stated that they had read newspaper accounts were not among the twelve selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-23\">During the course of the trial and pri- or to each recess when adjourning, the court admonished the members of the jury not to discuss the case among themselves or permit anybody to discuss it with them, and to avoid forming or expressing any opinion on any subject connected with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>At the commencement of the second day of the trial, October 11th, counsel for appellant, in chambers, moved the District Court for a mistrial calling the court\u2019s attention to the newspaper articles which appeared in the evening paper of October 10th, and to the article which appeared in the morning paper of October 11th. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u201cI will agree with you. I read both articles, and if the jury, or any member of the jury read them, why, you are entitled to a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201cBut we are confronted with this: We don\u2019t know whether the jury read those stories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">\u201cI will ask whether they have.\u201d Counsel for appellant then stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">\u201cI have no knowledge of the television coverage, whether or not it contained any of this material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">\u201cI would, if your Honor would, I would ask that you request if any of them heard any television coverage of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-12\">Counsel then stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-13\">\u201cBut I will leave it, then, to your Honor to ask the questions this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axz-dedup-0\">\u201cCOUNSEL: I think your honor realizes the significance of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Why, no question about it, if they read the story, you are entitled to a mistrial, that\u2019s all there is to it, in my humble opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS8\">Thereafter the following proceedings were had in open court, in the hearing and presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-16\">\u201cTHE COURT; Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there is a question or two I would like to ask before we proceed this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-17\">\u201c\u2018There was some coverage of this case in the Gazette yestefday afternoon, and some in the Republic this morning,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-18\">\u201cHow many of you people read those articles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-4\">\u201c(There was no affirmative response by any member of the jury.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Did you see any television program last night that had anything to do with this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-21\">\u201c(Negative response by all members of the jury.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you know nothing whatever about what was published?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-24\">\u201c(Negative response by all members of the jury.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-25\">\u201cTHE COURT: Your motion is denied. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-26\">Counsel for appellee: \u201cI wonder if it would be in order to admonish them not to read anything further, so we won\u2019t have this again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-27\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-28\">\u201cAs long as I have called your attention to this, I will ask the jury not to read any newspaper articles concerning this case during the course of the trial; and I will ask you not to look at any television programs, either, that might have anything to do with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-29\">The proceedings in open court, before the jury, then continued and was concluded Friday afternoon, October 11, 1961, including arguments of counsel, instructions by the court, and the return of the guilty verdict by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-30\">It appears to be appellant\u2019s position that because of the newspaper publicity, the minds of the members of the community from which the veniremen were drawn were so inflamed and prejudiced that it was impossible to find a panel of jurors from that area so as to secure to the appellant a \u201cfair trial\u201d, and that the record before us requires, as a matter of law, that we reverse the conviction. We note that outside of calling to the attention of the court that such articles were published, there was no showing that such articles had been read by any member of the community. No member of the jury sworn to try the case had read or heard of such articles. There is noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ing in the record showing that there was any television or other media coverage on the matters contained in the newspaper articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">We find no \u201cmanifest\u201d error on the part of the trial court either in denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial or in denying appellant\u2019s motion for change of venue, even if it be assumed that appellant\u2019s earlier motion, which was denied by the District Court, had been properly renewed. See Beck v. United States, 298 F.2d 622 (9th Cir. 1962), C.D., 370 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 1558, 8 L.Ed.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Appellant also complains that as a matter of law the court \u201cshould have sequestered the jury\u201d or should have examined on voir dire each juror separately or individually We have carefully reviewed the voir dire examination of the impanelled jurors and are satisfied that it was so conducted as to result in the selection of a fair and impartial jury. Furthermore, our examination of the entire record demonstrates to us that the appellant was not denied his right to a fair trial. We find it unnecessary to analyze in this opinion the decisions cited by appellant wherein convictions have been reversed where special circumstances existed which operated to deny the accused a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We shall now consider appellant\u2019s second specification of error. On the afternoon of the second and last day of the trial, the Government called as a witness an F.B.I. agent who was ostensibly called to testify concerning certain purported admissions which had been made by the defendant when first taken into custody. The transcript of the proceedings reveals as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\">\u201cGOVERNMENT COUNSEL: Will you please tell us what was said at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u201cA. At that time we told Mr. Neal first that we wanted to talk to him about a bank robbery that had occurred -in Phoenix, at 33rd Street and East McDowell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">\u201cWe advised him that he didn\u2019t have to talk to us, that any statement that he made would be voluntary on his part, that he had the right to consult with an attorney, that if he did make a statement to us, it could be used in a court of law against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\">\u201cHe told us that 'he didn\u2019t object to talking to us about his past criminal history, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-12\">\u201cCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT: I object, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQZ\">\u201cGOVERNMENT COUNSEL: We yield to the objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8n\">\u201cTHE COURT-; Disregard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acg-dedup-0\">\u201cCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT: I move that it be stricken from the record, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, disregard that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-16\">\u201cGOVERNMENT COUNSEL: Will you please confine your remarks to what was said by the defendant Neal with respect to this bank robbery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">Appellant contends that the District Court \u201ccommitted reversible error in failing to declare a mistrial <em>sna sponte.\u201d </em>No motion for mistrial was made by appellant\u2019s counsel. We note that among the instructions given by the trial court to the jury, and to which no objection was made by counsel, is the following-:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-18\">\u201cIn determining what your verdict shall be, you are to consider only the evidence before you. Any testimony as to which an objection was sustained, and any testimony which was ordered stricken out must be wholly -left out of account and disregarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-19\">Our problem is to determine what effect the uncalled for statement of the witness had, or reasonably may be taken to have had, upon the jury\u2019s verdict. To make such determination the statement of the witness must not be considered in isolation but must be considered against the entire setting of the case. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). We have carefully re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>viewed the entire record. The proof of appellant\u2019s guilt [apart from the moment the uncalled-for statement of the witness] was overwhelming and reaches the stage of demonstration. It is our conviction that such statement had little, if any, effect upon the jury\u2019s verdict,</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The grievous error appearing in the record is appellant\u2019s error in robbing the bank and not appellant\u2019s specifications of error, either singly or in combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-14\">. \u201c\u00a7 2113. <em>Bank robbery and incidental crimes</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-15\">\u201c(a) Whoever, by force and violence, * * * takes, * * *, from the person or presence of another any property or money * * *, or in the care, eus-tody, control, management, or possession of, any bank * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-24\">\u201cShall be * * * or imprisoned not more than twenty years * * * * * * * \u00bb\u00bb</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
