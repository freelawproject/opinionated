Insured\u2019s policy also, however, contained an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, which, if applicable here, would make the coverage unavailable to the appellant because at the time of the injury brought about by the uninsured motorist, appellant was also protected as a passen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ger in an automobile of another insured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We conclude that there is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the statute requires that the protection provided in appellant\u2019s own policy be available to him as against an uninsured motorist, notwithstanding any other provisions of his policy, since we conclude that the public policy of the state of Florida, in providing for such protection, was to afford the public generally the same protection that it would have had if the uninsured motorist had carried the minimum of $10,000 and $20,000 limits as public liability coverage. The protection afforded by the \u201cother insurance\u201d on the car in which appellant was a guest affords that amount of protection, even though it is obvious from the stated facts that there will not be adequate protection to protect all of the persons injured in the accident to the full extent of their claims against the uninsured motorist. This results from the fact that the State\u2019s limits of protection provided for the public against injuries caused by uninsured motorists are $10,000 for a single claimant and $20,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
