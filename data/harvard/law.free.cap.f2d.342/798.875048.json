The Board\u2019s decision and order appears in 145 NLRB at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-21\">Action Wholesale resists the granting of the relief sought from this court, on the sole ground that the Board\u2019s findings upon which the order is rested are not supported by any substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">This contention is entirely lacking in merit. The record reveals a conflict in the testimony, but nothing appears that would permit this court to disbelieve the proof unfavorable to Wholesale and draw factual conclusions contrary to those approved by the Board, N.L.R.B. v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">The Board\u2019s order is valid and should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-24\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
