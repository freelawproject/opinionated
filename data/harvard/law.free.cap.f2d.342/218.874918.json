He was convicted on all thirty-four counts in the indictment. The cashier entered a plea of guilty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>all counts and testified in the Government\u2019s case at defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We agree with the trial judge that there was ample evidence to warrant the submission of the question of defendant\u2019s guilt on all counts to the jury. The evidence of alleged prior offenses was allowed under the careful instructions of the judge which limited it to the purpose of showing intent and knowledge during the indictment period. There was no error in the court\u2019s ruling in that regard. Nor was there any error in the court\u2019s refusal to permit palpably improper cross-examination of the cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
