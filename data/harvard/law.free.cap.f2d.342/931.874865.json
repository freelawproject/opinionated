Perhaps, as appellants suggest, federal laws, or their enforcement, in this area are indeed inadequate. But I agree that an investigation as to the adequacy, or the execution, of these laws is not a matter within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of this Government.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
