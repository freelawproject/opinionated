Such interpretation is incorrect. We consider the opinion of the District Court sufficiently informative, and a correct disposition of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">Accordingly, it is ordered that the petition for rehearing be, and the same is hereby denied, 5 Cir., 340 F.2d 319, which affirmed D.C., 221 F.Supp. 191.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
