He was granted leave to perfect appeal therefrom <em>in forma pawperis </em>by his sentencing Court. He seeks reversal of his conviction on several grounds: (1) there was a variance between the charge set forth in his indictment and proof adduced at his trial; (2) the verdict of guilt is not supported by the evidence; (3) error as to the admission of specified testimony; and (4) refusal of his trial Court to charge the jury as requested in relation to the testimony of an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-25\">There is no substantial dispute as to the operative facts appearing of record in this wholly circumstantial evidence case. Since the \u201cstatement of facts contained in appellant\u2019s brief is adopted by appellee as being accurate,\u201d the facts hereinafter emphasized are all that need be stated to posit the disposition made of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-26\">On June 13,1963, Armour &amp; Company, in Kansas City, Kansas, consigned a shipment of meat to one of its plants, in Elmira, New York. That meat was loaded in refrigerator car No. ARL-9090, which thereafter was duly sealed. The Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (Mo. Pac.), the originating carrier, moved that car during the nighttime as part of a transfer from Armour\u2019s plant in Kansas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>City, Kansas, to Mo. Pac.\u2019s transit yards in Kansas City, Missouri. In the course of the movement thereof, it passed through the G. M. &amp; 0. freight yards at a rate of speed between 10 and 15 miles per hour, between 9:00 and 10:00 P.M., when a refrigerator car thereon was seen by two yard employees, with a door open and \u201ca man standing on the step had a bunch of meat laying in front of him and there was another fellow riding the coupler.\u201d The only identification made of such persons is, \u201cthey were colored.\u201d Mo. Pac\u2019s special agents were alerted to that development. Shortly thereafter, the above-mentioned yard employees observed a Santa Fe train traveling west through the yards, and there was a refrigerator car on that train ' with a door open. A \u201ccolored man\u201d riding that train got off in front of the G. M. &amp; O. yard office and walked west through the railroad yards. Later that night, a Mo. Pac. security officer, while making an investigation in the Mo. Pac. yards, found car ARL-9090 with the seal broken and door open. After observing it was loaded with meat, he closed the door and resealed it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">On the same night, around 11:15 P.M., another Mo. Pac. security officer met appellant on a public street in Kansas City, Missouri, in the vicinity of, but not in, the railroad yard above mentioned. Because that security officer \u201cknew this man from past experiences\u201d he stopped him and inquired what he was doing in that vicinity. It is that officer\u2019s testimony that appellant told him he was there with a friend and the car broke down and he was going for help.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officer testified, \u201cI noticed he was wearing a beige colored shirt and on the shirt there was leavings of meat grease\u201d which led him to suspect appellant had some connection with the theft of meat from railroad car ARL-9090, supra. As a consequence, that officer and one of the yard men above mentioned followed appellant for several blocks, until Kansas City police officers were accosted, who placed appellant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">On cross-examination, the above-mentioned Mo. Pac. special officer testified, there was more than one refrigerator car entered in the same transit yard on the night here considered. The only reasonable inference to be made from his testimony is, that the other refrigerator car was part of a Santa Fe train, and also contained a shipment of meat; that entry was made therein and meat taken therefrom in the same vicinity and was found in weeds in close proximity to the place where the Government\u2019s evidence reveals meat from car ARL-9090, ante, was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">The most damaging testimony adduced at appellant\u2019s trial, circumstantially connecting him with the only crime for which he was here charged, was that given by an admitted accomplice, Barnabas Farrell, who testified as a witness on behalf of the Government. It was that witness\u2019s testimony that he had been slightly acquainted with appellant prior to the time of the above-related facts. On the day in question appellant approached him and made a request to be driven \u201csome place\u201d that evening, for which he would pay $15.00. Farrell testified that at appellant\u2019s direction he drove an automobile to the vicinity of Troost and Guinotte Streets, in Kansas City, Missouri, near, but not in, the railroad yards above mentioned, at about 7:30 or 8:00 P.M. After arriving at that location and parking the car, appellant got out and said: \u201cCome on, let\u2019s catch the train.\u201d In answer to the question: \u201cDid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>he say anything alse about why he wanted to catch the train ?\u201d Farrell\u2019s answer was: \u201cHe said he was going to throw something off and wanted me to throw it off the track.\u201d Thereafter, Farrell testified, he and appellant boarded a train, otherwise unidentified, moving through the above-mentioned yards; that the appellant boarded first, and he (Farrell) got aboard two cars behind appellant; that he did not thereafter see appellant \u201center any freight car\u201d or see him \u201cinside any freight car,\u201d nor did he see appellant \u201cthrow anything out of any freight car,\u201d although \u201cI was watching for something to be thrown off, I didn\u2019t know what * * Upon seeing two boxes on the ground beside the tracks, Farrell got off the train, picked up the boxes and secreted them in some weeds. While doing so, he saw the word \u201cArmour\u201d on one of the boxes. Such are all the salient facts contained in this record circumstantially connecting appellant with the crime for which he was here prosecuted and stands convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Appellant\u2019s Court-appointed counsel, by argument, premises the first assignment of error, ante, thus: There was a fatal variance between the language of appellant\u2019s indictment and the evidence presented at his trial, in that there was no proof adduced, either directly or circumstantially, that appellant might, could, or did \u201cbreak the seal\u201d or make entry into refrigerator car No. 9090, traveling in interstate commerce, as the Government here contends; and the submission of that issue for consideration by the jury under the particular proof here adduced was prejudicial error. It is not necessary that we follow appellant\u2019s counsel in all the logic and presentation he makes in support of that assigned error. It is sufficient to note that as a part of the premise for such claim of \u201cvariance\u201d Court-appointed counsel points out that it is wholly related to the \u201csufficiency of the evidence\u201d to sustain the only charge made against appellant, namely, unlawful \u201centry\u201d into a boxcar moving in interstate commerce, in violation of \u00a7 2117, supra; and that his trial Court \u201ccharged the jury\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">\u201c * * * If you find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did <em>break the seal </em>of this boxcar, ARL-9090 and enter it in the intent to commit a larceny * * you should find the defendant guilty.\u201d (Emp. added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">That appellant\u2019s counsel asserts, was error because his indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">\u201c * * * does not charge the defendant-appellant with breaking the seal of any boxcar but merely with entering a boxcar, namely, ARL-9090, with the intent to commit a larceny. It is further submitted that it was never proved by circumstantial evidence, or otherwise, that defendant entered any boxcar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Be the above-quoted contention, as it may, counsel for the Government, by brief filed before us, concedes the instruction, ante, as given by appellant\u2019s trial Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">\u201c * *\" * presents two issues to the jury. One, whether the defendant <em>broke the seal </em>of the car in question, and, secondly, whether he did enter that car with the intention of committing a felony therein. The Government concedes that the only issue \u2022 before the jury was whether the defendant did in fact enter the car with the requisite intent and that the mention by the Court (below) of \u2018breaking the seal\u2019 should have been omitted.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief, p. 4. Par. and italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">In the light of the character of the proof adduced at appellant\u2019s trial, we can only agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">Appellant by indictment was only charged with the crime of entering a boxcar moving in interstate commerce with \u201cintent to commit a larceny.\u201d The gravamen of such crime is stated with clarity in United States v. Carpenter, 143 F.2d 47, 48 (7 Cir. 1944). This Court has previously ruled that instructions given to the jury in a criminal case should not include, or comment be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>on, that part of a statute defining an offense which is not charged in an indictment. De Mayo v. United States, 32 F.2d 472 (8 Cir. 1929); Bishop v. United States, 16 F.2d 406 (8 Cir. 1926). That is so because a defendant in a criminal case is entitled to be tried only on the charge brought against him. Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252; Epstein v. United States, 174 F.2d 754 (6 Cir. 1949). Any material variance from an indictment charge by proof, or submission of a criminal case for consideration by a jury, if found prejudicial,, is reversible error. Cf. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314; United States v. Russano, 257 F.2d 712 (2 Cir. 1958). Whether error committed in a criminal case is harmless or prejudicial under Rule 52, F.R.Crim.P. may often be determined by a consideration of whether the testimony of the defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming or whether the Government\u2019s case is weak. Cf. United States v. Levi, 177 F.2d 827 (7 Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">As above noted, the matter of variance as presented in this appeal arises wholly from the \u201cstate of the proof\u201d as made at appellant\u2019s trial which Court-appointed counsel asserts we cannot ignore. As that counsel points up, the latter proposition does not involve the weight of the testimony adduced at appellant\u2019s trial, but arises from a consideration of the sufficiency thereof to support the verdict of the jury as returned in this wholly circumstantial evidence case. From that counsel\u2019s argument and an examination of the record before us, it appears that such contention is premised thus. In addition to the facts hereinabove related, the evidence is that approximately two hours after the time the Government\u2019s proof establishes entry was made into refrigerator car 9090, ante, and meat was taken therefrom, two Missouri Pacific special officers \u201cwalked out the tracks\u201d in an endeavor to locate meat that may have been taken from that car. The evidence is that those officers \u201centered (the) tracks\u201d approximately at the place where the Government\u2019s evidence reveals appellant and his accomplice boarded a moving train under circumstances as above mentioned. Those two officers \u201cwalked east * * * about ten blocks (where they) found on the north side of the tracks two cartons (of meat) in weeds and grass\u201d which were identified at appellant\u2019s trial as containing meat from the shipment made in refrigerator car 9090, ante. Two days later, one of the above-mentioned special officers, while making further investigation, found other meat in weeds alongside the tracks, in close proximity to the same place where the first-above-mentioned meat was located. The latter meat was \u201cdeteriorated\u201d and was identified at appellant\u2019s trial as having come from the shipment of meat made in refrigerator car ART-91627, which was a complement of the above-mentioned Santa Fe train.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">It is in the light of all the proof adduced at appellant\u2019s trial that the claim of error on the ground of \u201cvariance\u201d must be considered, measured and weighed. Here the Government concedes that appellant was only charged by indictment with unlawful \u201centry\u201d in refrigerator car No. 9090, ante, and that \u201cbreaking the seal\u201d thereof was not pertinent to the charge. However, by the charge as given to the jury, ante, it clearly appears it was informed that it was necessary to first find appellant did \u201cbreak the seal\u201d to that car before it could make a finding as to \u201centry\u201d therein. Hence a finding of fact in respect to the only charge made against appellant by his indictment required an auxiliary finding that he did \u201cbreak the seal\u201d to car 9090, ante; and such was an absolute predicate and <em>sine qua non </em>without which a finding of guilt as charged could not be made. Therefore, if a findings of the predicate fact, i. e. \u201cbreaking the seal\u201d of refrigerator car No. 9090, cannot be inferred from the evidence adduced at appellant\u2019s trial, the only conclusion to be reached is that the submission of that issue in the Court\u2019s charge to the jury was prejudicial and erroneous as a matter of law. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>so, because it is axiomatic that sufficiency of the evidence in every criminal case, to sustain a conviction, must be judged with respect to proof of the offense actually alleged in the indictment. Walker v. United States, 4 Cir., 104 F.2d 465. Whether a variance is prejudicial can only be determined from the facts adduced in each case. United States v. Russano, supra. The question here is this: Was the \u201cvariance\u201d which counsel for appellant asserts exists in the case at bar, prejudicial? We think it was for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">From the scanty, indefinite and indecisive proof adduced at appellant\u2019s trial, it is wholly inconceivable, by any process of logic or reasoning from the facts disclosed in this record, how appellant might, could, or did, board a moving freight car, traveling ten (10) to fifteen (15) miles per hour, and within a distance of \u201cten blocks\u201d i. e. less than one (1) mile, or within at the very most four to six minutes, \u201cbreak the seal\u201d of the refrigerator car here considered, make \u201centry\u201d therein with intent to, and did throw meat therefrom, under the scanty circumstantial facts relied on by the Government to establish appellant\u2019s guilt of the only charge made against him. How that phenomenon might, could, or did, within any degree of reason take place cannot be inferred from the state of the proof before us; and Government\u2019s counsel does not undertake to elucidate, enlighten, or explain how that happenstance could possibly have occurred or have been brought about. The only valid conclusion to be reached is that the \u201cbreaking of the seal\u201d under the above stated conditions is inherently unbelievable \u2014 opposed to natural law, common knowledge and experience; which from this record creates a substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the proof made at appellant\u2019s trial to sustain the verdict of guilt as returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">As counsel for appellant points up in this wholly circumstantial evidence case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">\u201c * * * When there is a total absence of direct proof of essential facts * * * the evidentiary facts viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution must fairly warrant (the) inference (of guilt and) if they do not and the inference is so tenuous as to amount to mere speculation, the verdict is conjectural and must be set aside.\u201d Citing Moore v. United States (CA-4, 1959) 271 F.2d 564, l. c. 568.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-11\">This Court has many times stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-12\">\u201cWhere the evidence for conviction is circumstantial, all the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that accused is guilty, and inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d (Citing cases.) Tri-Angle Club, Inc. v. United States (8 Cir. 1959) 265 F.2d 829, l. c. 833.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">Also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-14\">\u201cInferences (to be made in every case) must be based upon proven facts or facts of which judicial notice [may] be taken and one inference cannot be based upon another inference. To sustain a finding of fact the circumstances proven must lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty and must be of such probative force as to create the basis for a legal inference and not mere suspicion.\u201d Wesson v. United States, 172 F.2d 931, 933 (8 Cir. 1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">More recently we had occasion to say, in a civil action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-17\">\u201cWe are cognizant of the general rule that a verdict cannot be based on evidence which cannot possibly be true, is inherently, unbelievable, or is opposed to natural laws. 32 C.J.S., Evidence \u00a7 1042, pp. 1125-1126; 20 Am.Jur., Evidence \u00a7 1183, pp. 1033-1034. Where undisputed physical facts are entirely inconsistent with and opposed to testimony necessary to make a case for the plaintiff, the physical facts must control. No jury can be allowed to return a verdict based upon oral testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>mony which is flatly opposed to physical facts, the existence of which is incontrovertibly established. Stolte v. Larkin, 8 Cir., 110 F.2d 226, 229 (1940).\u201d Born v. Osendorf, 8 Cir., 329 F.2d 669, 672.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Such is applicable law in the light of the proof adduced in this circumstantial evidence case where the burden of proof demands guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In the light of what is above said, appellant\u2019s conviction cannot be allowed to stand. We do not consider that outright reversal should here be made. The only defense proffered by appellant \u2014 an alibi \u2014 was rejected by a jury of his peers. Seemingly, from the brief the Government has lodged with us, there is other evidence available to it that should be considered at another trial of defendant on the only indictment charge here made against him. Hence, remand for a new trial is all that should here be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We need not ventilate the other assignments of error presented by appellant\u2019s Court-appointed counsel. We have thoroughly considered the same. As said in D.e Mayo v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">\u201cIt is improbable that the irregularities to which attention has been called will be repeated in another trial of the case; but we cannot forbear calling attention to the serious damage which may accrue to the administration of the criminal laws if counsel permit their zeal * * * to obscure their judgment in the heat of trial. A prosecution may fail and the cause of justice may suffer quite as completely through overtrying as through lack of -preparation and neglect.\u201d Cf. 32 F.2d 1. c. 475 (8 Cir. 1929).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial. We acknowledge with gratitude the excellence of briefs filed by Phillip S. Brown, a member of the bar of this Court, and his representation of appellant under appointment of this Court without hope of remuneration therefor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\">. Substantial evidence was adduced at appellant\u2019s trial there was a shortage of meat in that shipment on arrival at its destination, some of the type and kind pertinent to the meat involved in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-14\">. Other evidence adduced at appellant\u2019s trial established there was an automobile parked in the vicinity where appellant was stopped, and, on inspection thereof, it was \u201cfound the back seat floorboards (were) covered with newspapers.\u201d That automobile was identified at appellant\u2019s trial as one driven by Barnabas Farrell, a confessed accomplice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b790-10\">BLACKMUN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AVa\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">I must dissent for I feel that the government has proved a submissible case and that no prejudicial error is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">It is true that there is no direct testimony that this defendant entered Car ARL-9090 or that he threw meat cartons out its door. Farrell was not positioned so as to be able to testify to those details. But the testimony of Farrell, although that of a convicted felon, provides, with the circumstantial evidence, a strong case of damaging character to the defense and one not physically impossible of commitment. His testimony as to meeting the defendant that night; as to being offered payment for his transportation; as to their use of the automobile ; as to being directed where to go as they moved along; as to being invited by the defendant to catch the train together; as to the defendant\u2019s saying he would throw something off that train; as to seeing boxes on the ground; as to moving them into the weeds, provides material which, with the other evidence, if believed, is not consistent with inno-cense of the crime with which the defendant was charged. The existence of some references to Car ART-91627, also violated that night, does not lessen the vigor of the case against the defendant. We should, after all, view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. McIntosh v. United States, 341 F.2d 448 (8 Cir. 1965), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">Further, I see here no variance, let alone a material one. This was nothing more than a harmless error in instructions. The court\u2019s charge to the jury, when considered in its entirety, as it must be, is to the effect that entry plus intent were the factors of the crime. I am not persuaded that the jury could have been adversely confused in any way. If prejudice was present, it was in favor of the defendant and not against him. The quoted portion of the charge required, at the most, that the jury find one additional (not alternative) adverse factual detail than the indictment embraced. United States v. Heine, 149 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>485, 488 (2 Cir. 1945), cert. denied 325 U.S. 885, 65 S.Ct. 1578, 89 L.Ed. 2000. This is- not the kind of thing which concerns substantive rights, affects the preparation of the defense case, or fails to protect against another prosecution for the same offense. Neither is this a situation where a jury convicts of one crime under a charge and trial of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
