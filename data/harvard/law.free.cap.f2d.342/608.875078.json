The plaintiff corporation was adjudicated a bankrupt and the plaintiff-appellant, R. Arthur Ludwig, Trustee in Bankruptcy of Wisconsin Screw Company, was substituted in its stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">The complaint seeks recovery of $15,000 from each of the defendants as the insurer for that amount of a warehouse property of the Wisconsin Screw Company which was totally destroyed by fire. Interest is sought from September 25, 1957, the sixtieth day following submission of proof of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-17\">Each of the defendant insurance companies had issued a separate policy in the amount of $15,000 covering the property involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-18\">The action was tried before the court which found the actual cash value of the building at the time of its destruction by fire was $12,264.80, and the damages sustained as a result of the fire were un-liquidated and could not have been ascertained with reasonable certainty. The court concluded the Wisconsin \u201cvalued policy\u201d statute (Section 203.21, Wis. Stats., 1955) is not applicable. It further concluded the plaintiff is not entitled to pre judgment interest. Accordingly, the court entered judgment for the plaintiff trustee in the amount of $6,132.40 against each of the defendant insurance companies, a total of $12,264.80, rather than the $30,000 plus interest claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-19\">Plaintiff contends the District Court erred in holding \u00a7 203.21 of the Wisconsin statutes inapplicable and in limiting plaintiff\u2019s recovery against each of the two insurers to its proportionate share of plaintiff\u2019s actual loss pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the provisions of \u00a7 203.11, Wis.Stats., 1955, which relates to losses covered by multiple policies. The precise issue raised in this connection was decided, and the arguments advanced by plaintiff in support of his position were considered and rejected, in a scholarly and discerning opinion filed by the trial judge, in connection with his denial of a motion for summary judgment previously filed by the plaintiff in this cause. The opinion is reported as Wisconsin Screw Co. v. Detroit Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., D.C., 183 F.Supp. 183. We are convinced by Chief Judge Tehan\u2019s studied analysis that his conclusion correctly reflects the status of the Wisconsin law. On this phase of the appeal we adopt his opinion and conclude the District Court did not err in limiting the plaintiff\u2019s recovery to actual loss and limiting the liability of the defendants to a proration of that loss between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">On the issue of the denial of pre-judgment interest we perceive no basis, from our examination of the record, for concluding that the District Court\u2019s finding the loss or damage sustained was unliquidated is clearly erroneous. If the Wisconsin law entitled plaintiff to recover the face amount of the policies, as urged by plaintiff, the loss or damage would be properly characterized as liquidated. But we have concluded \u00a7 203.11 limited plaintiff\u2019s recovery to its \u201cactual loss\u201d rather than the specific amounts for which the building had been insured. And, there is nothing in the record which establishes that the actual value of the plaintiff\u2019s warehouse at the time of its destruction by fire was readily ascertainable with reasonable certainty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this connection plaintiff points to an appraisal and affidavit, made by a civil engineer employed by a general contractor, who plaintiff characterizes as \u201cdefendant\u2019s expert\u201d, to the effect the \u201csound value\u201d of the building was $12,264.80. This affidavit was filed by the defendants in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It is obvious this affidavit and appraisal represented only the opinion of the affiant. It does not serve to establish the actual value of the building was readily ascertainable with reasonable certainty. It attests only to the fact this individual had an opinion as to what that value was. The ultimate probative value of the opinion on the issue of the building\u2019s actual value, especially in the absence of countervailing evidence, as is the case here, does not serve to demonstrate or establish the actual value of this industrial warehouse, estimated to be some twenty-five years old, was readily ascertainable with a degree of reasonable certainty which would require that damages payable for its total loss be regarded as \u201cliquidated\u201d. Wisconsin Screw Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., 7 Cir., 297 F.2d 697, 701. Moreover, the policies here involved contained the same standard fire policy provision, required by Wisconsin statute, as was alluded to in the case above cited, and which .provides that the amount of loss is payable sixty days after proof of loss is received by the insurer and \u201cascertainment of loss is made either by agreement between the insured and this Company expressed in writing\u201d or such loss is ascertained by an award of appraisers selected in accordance with the policy. We pointed out in the case cited (297 F.2d 697, 702) that such policies \u201cinfer contractual intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>that the payment of loss becomes due only after the amount either has been agreed upon or actually determined in a manner binding on the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We are of the opinion that under the applicable Wisconsin law the District Court did not err in denying the plaintiff pre-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The judgment order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-13\">. Chris. Schroeder &amp; Sons, -Inc., designated in the title of this appeal as a defendant-appellee, was dismissed from the case pursuant to stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-5\">. In Wisconsin Screw Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., 7 Cir., 297 F.2d 697, it was recognized (p. 701) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cThere are situations where Wisconsin law permits recovery of .pre-judgment interest on unliquidated damages or claims. Laycock v. Parker, 103 Wis. 161, 79 N.W. 327; J. I. Case Plow Works v. Niles &amp; Scott Co., 107 Wis. 9, 82 N.W. 568; Necedah Mfg. Corp. v. Juneau County, 206 Wis. 316, 237 N.W. 277, 240 N.W. 405, 96 A.L.R. 4. But the cited cases restrict such allowance to instances where the pecuniary amounts due are \u2018liquidable or measurable in money with reasonable certainty\u2019; where there is a \u2018reasonably certain standard of measurement by the correct application of which one can ascertain the amount he owes\u2019; and where the damages although wholly un-liquidated \u2018may be fixed by known and reasonably certain market values or other definite standards\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
