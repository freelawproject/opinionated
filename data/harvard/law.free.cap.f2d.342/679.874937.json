He did not appeal from the judgment of conviction. After serving nearly five years, Edwards filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis in the court in which he was convicted. The court appointed counsel to represent the petitioner and ordered Edwards brought to the Shelby County Jail in order that he and his court-appointed counsel might have an opportunity to confer and prepare for the hearing. Thereafter the court denied the application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\u201cOn this hearing only testimony was submitted to the court by witnesses who testified at the main trial of this case. No facts were brought to the knowledge of the Court, which were not previously known, nor in the trial of this case which would have prevented the rendition of the judgment as rendered in the case\u2014 no facts were presented such as would have prevented a conviction on the trial of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201cIt is, therefore, the judgment of the Court that the application for writ of error coram nobis is not well taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Twenty days after that order, Edwards filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama. There was another full hearing following which the court denied the petition for habeas corpus. That judgment and the judgment denying coram nobis were both affirmed by the Supreme Court of Alabama on the same day, February 28, 1963.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *In the coram nobis proceeding certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Edwards then filed the present petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">The court appointed able counsel to represent Edwards. Since findings of fact and conclusions of law had not been made in the State coram nobis proceeding, the federal district court granted a full evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issues as framed in a formal pretrial order and as decided by the court were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">\u201c1. Whether or not petitioner Edwards was denied the right and opportunity to secure and have counsel of his own choosing during each essential stage of the proceeding in the Circuit Court of Shelby County, Alabama, in criminal case No. 8693, which proceeding terminated in his being found guilty of murder in the first degree, with punishment fixed at life imprisonment in the penitentiary of the State of Alabama;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-13\">\u201c2. Whether or not the State of Alabama, during the course of the prosecution in Shelby County, Alabama, in said criminal case, 8693, acting through any of its officers or agents, coerced from petitioner Edwards a confession through the use of cruel and inhuman treatment or threats;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">\u201c3. Whether or not the State authorities, acting through the officials of Shelby County, Alabama, denied to petitioner Edwards the right and opportunity to subpoena and secure witnesses in criminal case No. 8693; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-15\">\u201c4. Whether or not the State authorities, acting through the officials of Shelby County, Alabama, denied petitioner Edwards an adequate time and opportunity to prepare his defense in criminal case 8693.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Upon the hearing, the petitioner Edwards testified in his own behalf, and the respondent introduced the deposition of the State judge who presided at Edwards\u2019 trial for murder and the testimony of eight witnesses <em>ore terms. </em>The district court entered full findings of fact and conclusions of law comprising some five pages of the typed record, and denied the petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Upon appeal, this Court appointed different counsel to whom we are indebted for an unusually vigorous and able presentation of the issues in behalf of Edwards. Each of the questions decided in the district court against Edwards was based upon the court\u2019s findings of fact which cannot be set aside as clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed after a careful study of the record, we are in full agreement with those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Resourceful counsel, however, by putting a different gloss upon the first issue, present as a question of law \u2014 the contention that under Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, Edwards should have been provided \u201cthe assistance of counsel\u201d as soon as he became a suspect in the murder case. The state court had appointed counsel after the indictment was returned but prior to arraignment. Understanding and consideration of this issue require a brief statement of some of the essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Edwards had previous convictions for \u201cviolation of prohibition law\u201d and for \u201cwhite slavery.\u201d He was arrested in Jefferson County, Alabama, in October 1956 on a warrant charging him with burglary. He was held in the jail at Birmingham for two weeks, during which time he was questioned about various burglaries of which he was suspected. The interrogation was extensive. Tom Ellison, a criminal investigator for the sheriff's office, testified that he was with Edwards as much as sixteen hours a day \u201cfor a purpose.\u201d However, Edwards himself testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">\u201cQ. What type of treatment did you receive while you were in the Birmingham jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">\u201cA. Good treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">Edwards further testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-11\">\u201cWe stayed in jail a week before they ever commenced to question about a murder in Birmingham.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-12\">As to the reason for Edwards removal from Jefferson County to adjacent Shelby County, Tom Ellison testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: What prompted you to take him from Jefferson County to Shelby County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-15\">\u201cWITNESS: Well, most of the burglaries that he had admitted that he was involved in was\u2014 were in Shelby County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: I take it, then, that he admitted being involved in the murders prior to the time he was transported to Shelby County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-17\">\u201cWITNESS: He hadn\u2019t admitted it; no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Had you interrogated him about them\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-20\">\u201cWITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014before you transported him to Shelby County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-23\">\u201cWITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-24\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you take him to the cemetery where the victim or victims were buried on the way from Birmingham to Co-lumbiana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-25\">\u201cWITNESS: Not that I recall, but I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t say, it has been so long, we \u2014 we could \u2014it could have been possible, but I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-26\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you or anyone in your presence threaten to chain him out in the cemetery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-27\">\u201cWITNESS: Threaten to chain him in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Or handcuff him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC2\">\u201cWITNESS: No, sir; no, sir. And it is my opinion that we \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 well, we may have passed by the cemetery, but I don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t believe we carried him in the cemetery, but we could have. I just don\u2019t have any memory of it at the time, but I certainly deny that, we didn\u2019t threaten to chain him in any cemetery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Edwards had testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">\u201cWell, they brought me \u2014 they took me out of Birmingham jail at twelve o\u2019clock one day, took me to the City jail and locked me up to dark, when they left, Tom Ellison and another deputy left the City jail with me a little after dark, they brought me over there to that graveyard where that woman had been buried, they said it was a graveyard there, anyhow, they stopped there and was going to handcuff me out there. And a car pulled up behind them, they carried me on down to the Colum-biana jail and jumped on me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-19\">Tom Ellison testified (and his testimony was not disputed) that while Edwards was in Birmingham jail he was advised of his rights to remain silent, to consult an attorney, and that any statement he made could be used against him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-20\">After arrival at the Shelby County jail, Edwards was questioned about the murders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no finding as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the exact period of questioning prior to Edwards\u2019 oral confession. The estimates of various witnesses ranged from forty-five minutes to four hours. Two hours seems to be the most frequently stated time. At the time of his confession the prime suspect of the murder was his woman companion, Inez Able. As testified by Sheriff Sims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">\u201cWITNESS: Actually, when Charlie made this confession, I didn\u2019t believe it, and that is why we made the arrangements that he had to go and point these things out in this house. As I say, my \u2014 my leads had actually led to the other party of the two, and I believed then, and I still believe, and I am under oath, that the other party was the agitator and the leader in this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: That was the woman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">\u201cWITNESS: That was the woman. And I \u2014 I have told Charlie the night we carried him out there that, T don\u2019t \u2014 I want you to be sure, now, don\u2019t you do something for Inez Able.\u2019 Then we\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: What did he say to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">\u201cWITNESS: He said, \u2018Well, got to get it off my conscience.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">After Edwards had orally confessed, he was taken to the scene of the murders where he gave further details. He was then taken back to the jail where his statement was taken down and signed. Over objection, that statement was introduced in evidence at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">No preliminary trial was ever conducted, nor was Edwards ever carried before a committing magistrate. Edwards was not advised by an attorney until after his indictment on April 10, 1957. The admissibility of Edwards\u2019 confession, however, was not affected by his subsequent detention before his indictment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The federal rule requiring an arrested person to be taken without unnecessary delay before a committing magistrate has no application to one arrested on a state charge and in the custody of state officers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">The circumstances under and extent to which the Supreme Court has advanced the point where the criminal process shifts from investigatory to accusatory need not be restated, but can best be determined by a reading and study of Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977. The present case is distinguishable from that holding in several particulars: (1) there the accused was a 22-year-old of Mexican extraction, while here Edwards had a number of previous convictions for crime; (2) there no one had advised the accused of his constitutional rights, while here Edwards had been so advised; (3) there \u201c [petitioner had become the accused, and the purpose of the interrogation was to \u2018get him\u2019 to confess his guilt despite his constitutional right not to do so\u201d (378 U.S. 485, 84 S.Ct. 1762), while here Edwards was no more than a suspect and not even the prime suspect; (4) there the accused had a lawyer with whom he requested an opportunity to consult and his request was denied, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>here it does not appear that Edwards requested or was denied assistance of counsel prior to his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">We find no error in the record and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AST\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">.

How long after his arrest was he allowed to see anyone?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">\u201cA. I asked Charlie several times, I stayed with him I guess some sixteen hours a day, seven days a week for several weeks in the Birmingham county jail, and asked him several times if he would like to consult an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">\u201cQ. That was in the Birmingham jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">\u201cA. That was in Birmingham; yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">\u201cQ. And you stayed with him sixteen \u2014approximately sixteen hours a day for</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-11\">\u201cA. Sixteen hours a day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-12\">\u201cQ. For seven days or two weeks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-13\">\u201cA. Seven days a week for several weeks. During that time I gave him cigarettes, would go to the kitchen in the jail and bring him coffee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-14\">\u201cQ. While you were with -him the sixteen or seventeen hours a day .for several weeks, what was your discussion with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-15\">\u201cA. I was just \u2014 first talking to Charlie about his activities during the week of the Faulkner murder, and he related to me where he and Inez went on Monday, and he admitted several burglaries that I didn\u2019t have knowledge of at all at the time, and then on this particular Friday, of course, he didn\u2019t know at the time he was a suspect in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-16\">\u201cQ. Uh, huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-17\">\u201cA. He said on this particular Friday, he drew me a map which I have \u2014 still have in my possession that I don\u2019t have any personal knowledge of this location he was describing of the route that -they took on this particular Friday leaving Birmingham about eleven thirty going by way of \u2014 out 31 South to Alabaster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-22\">\u201cQ. In other words, what your discussion was, were you attempting to obtain from him a confession or information regarding this murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-23\">\u201cA. Information regarding this incident\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-24\">\u201cQ. Uh, huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-25\">\u201cA. \u2014-yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-26\">\u201cQ. Uh, huh; and you questioned him continually during this period of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-27\">\u201cA. Well, it wasn\u2019t necessarily questioning, just more or less talking, and he was telling me about the different places he had burglarized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-28\">\u201cQ. You were there for a purpose, wasn\u2019t you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-29\">\u201cA. Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-30\">\u201cQ. You were there for a purpose; you were there with him sixteen hours a day for a purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-31\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-32\">\u201cQ. And \u2014 and what was that purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-33\">\u201cA.
