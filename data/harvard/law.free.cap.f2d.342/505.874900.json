This was the net amount paid by the government to Home Savings and Loan Association of Los Angeles following default on a loan guaranteed by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1803(c) (1). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-26\">About October 20, 1953 Rossi received a $8,789 loan from Home Savings for the purchase of a new home from a Mr. Fisher. The loan was evidenced by a note to Home Savings and secured by a deed of trust on the property. After approval of the loan by Home Savings, the Veterans Administrator accepted an application for guaranty of $5,273.40 of the loan. The escrow was then closed and title conveyed to Rossi, but he did not learn of this until he was several months in arrears in payments due under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the note. Rossi was unable to make the payments. Fisher advised him to see the Veterans Administration, indicating that if its approval could be secured, he would be willing to take the property off Rossi\u2019s hands. The Rossis then went to the Los Angeles Veterans Administration office, where they \u201cwere met by a fellow at a desk,\u201d whose name they did not know, who told them in regard to the property: \u201cIf wou can get somebody to take it off your hands, go ahead and do it.\u201d Rossi testified that no representations were made concerning further liability on his loan, but Mrs. Rossi testified that the man behind the desk told them that they \u201cwould not be liable for the loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Acting upon this advice, the Rossis then saw Fisher, who \u201cassumed to take the house off [their] * * * hands,\u201d through a new escrow arrangement by which Rossi conveyed the property to Fisher in return for Rossi\u2019s down payment. Fisher, however, was not substituted for Rossi in the escrow arrangement with Home Savings, and the record does not show that he either assumed the obligation under Rossi\u2019s note and deed of trust or became the substitute beneficiary of the Administrator\u2019s guaranty of the loan made under the note. Fisher then resold the property, there was eventually a default, the Home Savings deed of trust was foreclosed, and the property was sold. The Administrator was required to pay the net sum of $1,-039.48 under his guaranty. Following demand upon Rossi for this sum, which was refused, this suit was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The district court concluded that the action was for a deficiency on the secured loan, that the United States was estopped because of the oral release of Rossi from liability by the \u201cfellow at the desk,\u201d and that, because of the failure of the United States to give notice of the foreclosure proceedings and the possibility \u2022of a deficiency when it knew that the property was being sold and someone other than Rossi was making payments on the note, Rossi was precluded from paying the note and recovering the property, and the United States was thus barred from recovery against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Rossi was under an independent obligation to indemnify the United States for the amount paid under the guaranty, and the terms of that guaranty are governed by federal law. The obligation was not released by the Administrator. There was no estoppel that prevents enforcement of the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">38 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.4323(e) provides: \u201cAny amounts paid by the Administrator on account of the liabilities of any veteran guaranteed or insured under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. Ch. 37 shall constitute a debt owing to the United States by such veteran.\u201d In United States v. Shimer, 1961, 367 U.S. 374, 81 S.Ct. 1554, 6 L.Ed.2d 908, it was held that the procedures outlined in the regulations governing guaranty procedures were intended by Congress to provide a uniform system for determining the Administrator\u2019s obligation as guarantor and to displace state law in their operation, and that they provide an independent right of indemnity to the Veterans Administration, regardless of the failure of a lender\u2019s rights against the principal. See also McKnight v. United States, 9 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 540. The amount of this obligation is to be determined at the time of default. See United States v. Shimer, supra, 367 U.S. at 384, 81 S.Ct. 1554. Thus the district court\u2019s conclusion that this action was one for a deficiency judgment to be governed by the notice and other provisions of California law cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The statements of the \u201cfellow at a desk\u201d in the Los Angeles Veterans Administration office did not result in an estoppel, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1817 provides that when a veteran disposes of property secured by a guaranty the Administrator may issue to him a release from further liability, after investigation and determination that certain requirements have been met. Such a procedure was not followed here. Where an official of the United States acts outside his actual authority, the United States is not estopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>by that action. See Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 1947, 332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10; United States v. Stewart, 1940, 311 U.S. 60, 61 S.Ct. 102, 85 L.Ed. 40; United States v. Zenith Godley Co., 2d Cir., 1961, 295 F.2d 634; United States v. Willoughby, 9 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the court is directed to enter judgment for the United States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
