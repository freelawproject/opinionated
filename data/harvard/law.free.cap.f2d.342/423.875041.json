A motion by the appellant for summary judgment to dismiss the complaint was denied in the same order. In its opinion upon which the order was.based the District Court ruled that even though the issuance of the injunction anticipates the action of the Union, the law is so clear that union disciplinary action in this case would violate section 609<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, that no harm is done by so enjoining the Union from trying Baron and Lewis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Union has appealed from the District Court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">Without reaching the merits of the propriety of the Union\u2019s disciplinary action which may be taken in the future, we find that appellees\u2019 suit against the Union is premature, and that the complaint should have been dismissed. It is to be noted that in circumstances where relief from past union action is sought, courts have required the exhaustion of intra-union remedies except in those rare instances where a showing has been made that a union cannot do substantial justice because of the inadequacy of procedural mechanisms or the existence of clear substantive bias against the party seeking judicial relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Analogizing from this developing concept, it would be anomalous indeed to refuse to apply such a standard when union action jeopardizing a member\u2019s rights has yet to be taken, and exceptional circumstances have neither been demonstrated nor even alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">The order of the United States District Court of December 13, 1963, will, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>fore, be reversed and the case will be remanded to that Court for the dissolution of its injunction and for the granting of appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment to dismiss appellees\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-12\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 529 (Supp. IV, 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-13\">. 224 F.Supp. 85, 86 (D.N.J.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-14\">.
