We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">In 1992, Daniel Wright, Antoine Washington, and Glen Early, Jr., were arrested following a high-speed car chase through the streets of Washington, D.C. The police found drugs in the car in which the three men were traveling. All three were indicted and charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Washington and Early went to trial later that year and were convicted and sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in prison and 14 years and 6 months in prison, respectively. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>12 F.3d 1128, 1132 (D.C.Cir.1994). But Wright disappeared before trial after having been released on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">Wright was eventually caught and brought back to the District of Columbia in 2008 to face the 1992 drug charges. Attorney Douglas Wood was appointed to represent Wright. A few weeks after his appointment, Wood recalled that he had previously represented Washington in Washington\u2019s appeal (albeit not at Washington\u2019s trial). Wood recognized that his prior representation of Washington might result in a conflict of interest in his representation of Wright. Wright soon also became aware of the potential conflict, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>he did not object to Wood\u2019s continued representation. Although Wood continued to represent Wright during several months of plea negotiations, Wood brought in conflict-free counsel Jenifer Wicks to consult with Wright before and during the entry of his guilty plea. Wright eventually pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). He was sentenced to eight years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Wright now appeals. He claims that Wood\u2019s prior representation of Washington created an impermissible conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">A defendant asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must show (1) that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance affected the outcome of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Conflict of interest claims such as that asserted by Wright in this case are a \u201cspecific genre\u201d of ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>United States v. Bruce, </em>89 F.3d 886, 893 (D.C.Cir.1996). In <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant who asserts a conflict of interest claim on appeal or in habeas proceedings generally must demonstrate only that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). The defendant typically need not demonstrate the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test\u2014 that the lawyer\u2019s deficient performance affected the outcome of the case. <em>See id. </em>at 349-50,100 S.Ct. 1708.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>the conflict of interest had been caused by the defense attorneys\u2019 <em>concurrent </em>representation of multiple clients in the same case. In this case, Wood\u2019s representation of Washington apparently ended before Wood\u2019s representation of Wright began. Wright\u2019s claim therefore may involve a conflict caused by <em>successive </em>representation of multiple clients in the same matter. In <em>Mickens v. Taylor, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the language of <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>\u201citself does not clearly establish, or indeed even support,\u201d applying the <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>standard \u201cunblinkingly\u201d to cases involving successive representation of multiple clients. 535 U.S. 162, 174-75, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002). But the Court ultimately did not decide the question of whether <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>applied to cases of successive representation, saying that the question remained \u201copen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176,122 S.Ct. 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Since <em>Mickens, </em>this Court has likewise not decided whether the <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>standard applies to cases involving successive representation. <em>See United States v. Berkeley, </em>567 F.3d 703 (D.C.Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Here, we again need not decide that question. Even under the <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>standard, Wright still has to demonstrate that Wood\u2019s alleged conflict of interest adversely affected his performance. Wright has not done so. Wright claims that Wood\u2019s performance was defective because Wood allegedly coerced Wright into pleading guilty. But the record conclusively shows that Wright\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary, not coerced. Three pieces of record evidence make that clear:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\"><em>First, </em>six months before Wright\u2019s guilty plea, Wood recognized that a conflict might arise if Washington was a witness in Wright\u2019s trial. <em>See </em>Tr. Status Hearing at 9, Jan. 7, 2009. To address the possible conflict, Wood enlisted conflict-free counsel, Jenifer Wicks, to \u201cconsult with Mr. Wright and to be present\u201d before and during the entry of his guilty plea. Tr. Plea Hearing at 3, July 2, 2009. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>plea hearing, Wicks stated that she had talked with Wright about the range of sentences that Wright could face by pleading guilty. Wicks and Wright each signed the Government\u2019s plea agreement, statement of offense, and waiver of trial by jury forms. Conflict-free counsel\u2019s prominent role in the plea discussions and in Wright\u2019s decision to enter a plea belies Wright\u2019s claim that he was coerced by Wood into entering the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><em>Second, </em>during the plea colloquy, Wright made clear that he understood the ramifications of his guilty plea and was voluntarily choosing to plead guilty. Wright stated that he had read his plea agreement and had reviewed it with his attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Wright admitted that he had possessed powder and crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 14. Wright confirmed that nobody had \u201cforced,\u201d \u201cpressured,\u201d or \u201ccoerced\u201d him \u201cin any way\u201d into pleading guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. Wright stated that he was \u201cpleading guilty voluntarily\u201d and of his \u201cown free will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Those statements, made in Wood\u2019s absence, contradict Wright\u2019s current contention that he pled guilty because of Wood\u2019s coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><em>Third, </em>after his plea and in advance of sentencing, Wright submitted a letter to the District Court. Wright\u2019s letter confirmed that his choice to plead guilty had been voluntary. Wright wrote that he \u201cwanted to explain\u201d his decision and \u201cwhy\u201d he had chosen to plead guilty. Letter from Daniel Wright to Judge James Robertson at 1, <em>United States v. Wright, </em>No. 92-cr-00131 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 2009). Wright acknowledged his role in the conduct underlying his offense and admitted that he had been on a self-destructive path and that it was time to face the consequences of his actions. <em>See id. </em>The next day, in open court, Wright again apologized to the District Court for his conduct. See Tr. Sentencing Hearing at 17, Oct. 15, 2009. Those candid and unsolicited admissions further contravene Wright\u2019s claim that Wood coerced him to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Because the record conclusively rebuts Wright\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we affirm the judgment of conviction. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>721 F.3d 711, 713 (D.C.Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
