(\u201cRobertson\u201d), and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (\u201cDean Witter\u201d). As frequently happens,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the price of VeriFone stock jumped up on the first day of trading to substantially more than the initial offering price, closing at $19V4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The stock price continued to climb during the spring and early summer of 1990, reaching a high of $25V4 on July 11, and then slid down during August and September, until the fourteenth of that month, a Friday, when it closed at $14<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>/s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-11\">The following Monday, September 17, 1990, VeriFone issued a press release stating that its revenue growth in the second half of 1990 had fallen short of \u201cinternal expectations\u201d and \u201ccurrent estimates by Wall Street analysts who have been following the Company.\u201d Declaration of Jordan Eth in Support of Defendant Verifone\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, filed April 12, 1991 (\u201cEth Deck\u201d), Exh. I. The press release quoted VeriFone\u2019s CEO as stating that business in the company\u2019s \u201ccore financial market and in our rapidly expanding International markets continues to exceed our expectations, but not sufficiently to offset the shortfalls in other areas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The press release announced that VeriFone had implemented cost containment measures and expansion controls in anticipation of slower revenue growth. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1533-13\">On that day, the stock price declined 13.4% to close at $12%. The stock price then dropped to $7% on the following day, a further decline of 40.8%. Since September 1990, the stock has made a steady recovery. During the week of June 3, 1991, the stock reached $19%, and closed at $18V2 on June 6, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-15\">On September 20, 1990, three days after VeriFone\u2019s press release, this litigation was initiated by the filing of a class action brought by eight of the leading law firms which specialize in securities practice,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on behalf of plaintiffs Minichino, Steen, Mar-chesi, and the Steinbergs. The next day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>two other leading firms,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a class action on behalf of plaintiff Halkin. On November 8, 1990, the cases were reassigned to the undersigned. An amended consolidated complaint was filed on March 22, 1991 by all of these law firms on behalf of all plaintiffs in the <em>Minichino </em>and <em>Halkin </em>actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-4\">The amended complaint alleges seven causes of action under sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act, section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, section 20A of the Exchange Act as amended, California Corporations Code section 1507, and state law torts of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. VeriFone and some or all of ten individual officers and directors of VeriFone (collectively, \u201cthe VeriFone defendants\u201d) are named in all of the seven causes of action. Plaintiffs also name Morgan Stanley, Robertson and Dean Witter (collectively, \u201cthe underwriter defendants\u201d), as representatives of a class of underwriters participating in the VeriFone public offering. The underwriter defendants are also named in all of the causes of action, but the underwriter class is named only in the causes of action arising under sections 11 and 12(2) of the Securities Act and section 1507 of the California Corporations Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">The complaint alleges that defendants are responsible for misleading statements in and omissions from (1) VeriFone\u2019s March 13, 1990 registration statement and prospectus; (2) VeriFone\u2019s Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 1990, filed with the SEC in May and August 1990; (3) press releases issued by VeriFone in April and July 1990 announcing the company\u2019s first and second quarter 1990 earnings; and (4) stock analysts\u2019 reports issued by some of the underwriter defendants in April, May and July 1990. Defendants have provided the court with all of the documents in which the allegedly false and misleading statements are contained. Eth Deck, Exh. A-I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-11\">Finally, the complaint alleges that over 717,900 of the 3.9 million shares of Veri-Fone common stock in the IPO were sold by officers and directors of VeriFone while in possession of material nonpublic information, and that defendant Caufield on August 20, 1990 sold nearly 500,000 shares while in possession of material nonpublic information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-12\">Defendants have moved to dismiss all counts of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-13\">I. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1534-14\">VeriFone designs and manufactures products used by retail merchants and others to automate a variety of transactions, such as authorizing credit card purchases. First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\u201cCompl.\u201d), \u00b6 5. Since its founding, VeriFone has been financially successful, earning profits in each year from 1985 to 1989. Compl., \u00b6 18. For example, in the two years prior to the IPO VeriFone\u2019s revenue had grown by 65.2% (in 1988) and 68.2% (in 1989). Compl., \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-15\">VeriFone\u2019s March 13, 1990 registration statement and prospectus described the company\u2019s past growth trends in revenues and earnings, included a list of its well-known customers, described markets for potential future growth, and listed other well-known companies that were evaluating VeriFone\u2019s products. The prospectus also contained a detailed discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d associated with purchase of the stock. Eth Deck, Exh. A at 6-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-16\">Plaintiffs contend that the risk factor discussion was uninformative boilerplate which did not disclose with sufficient detail the risks faced by holders of VeriFone stock. In particular, plaintiffs claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>the company\u2019s historic revenue growth trends had ceased and that the company was \u201cfacing a brick wall\u201d both in the company\u2019s existing markets and in the company\u2019s attempt to finish new products and open new markets. Opposition to Veri-Fone\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (\u201cOpp.\u201d) at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-4\">Plaintiffs do not allege that any statement in the prospectus is literally untrue. Instead, plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that the omission of facts known to defendants, and only to defendants, at the time of the IPO, made the true statements in the prospectus materially misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-5\">In paragraphs 21 and 41 of the complaint, plaintiffs present a most unfavorable description of VeriFone\u2019s business prospects at the time of the March 13, 1990 public offering. According to the complaint, some of VeriFone\u2019s target markets were growing slower than in the previous years; historic sales channels and core markets were showing little future potential; future growth was dependent on new markets in which VeriFone had little marketing expertise, no customers and no reasonable expectation of success; near-term future sales and growth figures would be inflated by atypically large one-time sales; and the introduction of new products was suffering from delays in development and weak customer interest. Compl., TMT 21, 41. In short, plaintiffs allege that VeriFone\u2019s future was to be as dim as its past had been bright.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-6\">Plaintiffs further claim that defendants\u2019 effort to mislead the market in the manner described above continued for the six months after the March 13 IPO. In addition to the matters omitted from the prospectus, plaintiffs find the same allegedly misleading omissions, and others, in Veri-Fone\u2019s press releases, in VeriFone\u2019s quarterly reports filed with the SEC, and in analysts\u2019 reports prepared by Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-7\">On April 16, 1990, VeriFone issued a press release announcing its results for the quarter ending March 30, 1990. The document reported revenue and income growth, of 49% and 20% respectively, over the same period in the prior year. The press release further announced that the company was \u201cpleased\u201d with the continued growth and discussed the new products introduced during the quarter. Compl., \u00b6 45; Eth Deck, Exh. C. However, the press release again failed to disclose the adverse information which plaintiffs assert should have been present in the March 13 prospectus. Furthermore, the press release did not explain that, according to plaintiffs, VeriFone\u2019s first quarter results were atypically \u201cboosted\u201d by large onetime orders. Nor did the press release provide detail showing that certain of Veri-Fone\u2019s markets were experiencing \u201cflat\u201d sales growth. Compl., \u00b6 46. Not surprisingly, plaintiffs find similar fault with Veri-Fone\u2019s Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 30, 1990, filed on May 14, 1990. Compl., 1151; Eth Deck, Exh. E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-10\">VeriFone\u2019s July 17, 1990 press release, announcing results for the quarter ending June 29, 1990, also described a successful quarter. Again, revenue and net income grew in comparison to the same period in the previous year (this time, by 37% and 33%, respectively). Combining first and second quarter results, the July 17 press release calculated first-half revenue growth of 42% and income growth of 29%. Defendant Tyabji is quoted in the press release as being \u201cpleased with the continued growth,\u201d and he discussed VeriFone\u2019s second quarter success in reaching new markets. Eth Deck, Exh. F. The content of the July 17 press release is repeated in VeriFone\u2019s Form 10-Q for the second quarter, filed August 7, 1990. Eth Deck, Exh. H.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-11\">Again, plaintiffs find fault. Compl., 1111 53, 58. Neither the press release nor the Form 10-Q reported any of the information plaintiffs claim is also missing from earlier VeriFone disclosures. In addition, by this time, say plaintiffs, orders for Veri-Fone products had slowed, so that future revenue and income figures would be far lower than the past trend would indicate. But VeriFone did not report this decrease in new business, nor did the company project declining future earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>The underwriter defendants also touted VeriFone\u2019s success in the period following the IPO. In April, Morgan Stanley issued a report giving a \u201cpurchase recommendation\u201d for VeriFone common stock and predicting that VeriFone would continue to grow. Compl., \u00b6 42; Eth Deck, Exh. B. Plaintiffs allege that Morgan Stanley had \u201cno reasonable basis\u201d for such a prediction, particularly in light of the \u201cadverse facts and trends\u201d described above. Compl., 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">Dean Witter issued two reports on Veri-fone. In May, Dean Witter made earnings growth estimates \u201cidentical to those made by Morgan Stanley,\u201d and projected earnings growth for certain of VeriFone\u2019s target markets and for the transaction automation industry as a whole. Compl., 1147. This report opined that current holders of VeriFone common stock should continue to hold the stock, but cautioned potential new investors that the post-IPO \u201cprice surge\u201d made the stock an unattractive new investment. Eth Decl., Exh. D. Dean Witter issued a further report in July, \u201creaffirming its earlier earnings estimates and projected growth rates, but touting <em>even greater upside potential.\u201d </em>Compl., 1154 (emphasis in original). The July report contained the same \u201chold\u201d recommendation as the May report. Eth Deck, Exh. G. Plaintiffs complain that nowhere in either the May or July reports did Dean Witter discuss the information also omitted by VeriFone in its disclosures, nor did Dean Witter disclose certain technical problems experienced by VeriFone in new product development. Compl., 111149, 56. Plaintiffs further assert that Dean Witter had \u201cno reasonable basis\u201d for its projections. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1536-5\">Plaintiffs allege that the Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter reports were based on information provided by VeriFone. Comph, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48, 55. The complaint also alleges that defendants were in contact with stock market professionals, analysts, money managers, and similar members of the investment community. Compl., \u00b6 60. Finally, plaintiffs allege that from March 13 to September 19, analysts, including employees of the underwriter defendants, made projections of VeriFone\u2019s financial prospects based on information from the defendants and confirmed those projections with VeriFone before publication. Compl., \u00b6 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-9\">Plaintiffs allege that the \u201ctruth\u201d about VeriFone only became known after Veri-Fone released the September 17 press release. That disclosure, and the market\u2019s quick and negative reaction, form the basis for most of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-10\">II. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LEGAL CONTENTIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-11\">A. <em>The Fraud-On-The-Market Theory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1536-12\">Defendants\u2019 liability is predicated on the \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory seemingly approved in principle by four justices of the Supreme Court in <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). This theory posits that information regarding a corporation\u2019s expected future value is quickly and accurately incorporated into the price at which the corporation\u2019s securities trade in public markets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants are therefore held liable for any material misrepresentation which is proved to have caused the price of a security traded on an open and developed securities market to deviate from the security\u2019s efficient price which, under the theory, is presumed to reflect the price at which the security would have traded in the absence of the misleading information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 246, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>108 S.Ct. at 991. Persons who purchase or sell the security during the period of the price deviation, and who are injured as a result, are entitled to recover from the responsible defendants without regard to whether the persons trading knew of the misrepresentation or misleading omission which caused the price deviation. In this way, the fraud-on-the-market theory dispenses with the traditional requirement of individual reliance in securities fraud cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-4\">The fraud-on-the-market theory recognizes that average investors in a developed securities market do not personally need access to the elaborate disclosure of documents and accounting data required by our securities laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Market professionals obtain information from myriad sources, including the issuer, market analysts, and the financial and trade press. The professional traders analyze information about securities, and the trading activity of these knowledgeable investors pushes the price of the security toward a value which reflects all publicly available information. In this way, securities prices on the national exchanges reflect (albeit not perfectly) the expected future cash flows from the security. An investor making trades who has not relied on particular disclosures is presumed under the fraud-on-the-market theory to rely on the integrity of information reflected in the market price of the security. <em>Basic Inc., </em>485 U.S. at 247, 108 S.Ct. at 991. In this way, an investor who has never seen or heard of a fraudulent disclosure is no less a victim than one who pored over its details.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">The fraud-on-the-market theory thus shifts the inquiry from whether an individual investor was fooled to whether the market as a whole was fooled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hence, the theory not so much eliminates the reliance requirement as subsumes it in the fraud-on-the-market analysis. In the same way, the theory also subsumes the inquiry into materiality, causation and damages. For if a misleading or fraudulent disclosure or omission could have had no effect on the security\u2019s market price, the information cannot have been material. Similarly, if a misstatement or omission had no effect on the market price (because, for example, the market already had the correct information from other sources) then there could be no causation and no damages. The case at bar calls upon the court to explore materiality in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-12\">The class alleged in the complaint are persons who purchased VeriFone common stock in the initial public offering on March 13, 1990 through September 18, 1990, the day following the press release. For there to be recoverable damages under the fraud-on-the-market theory, plaintiffs must allege that the prices paid by them were inflated by the difference between the efficient price of the common stock and the higher amount the class members actually paid for the stock. Of course, if defendants\u2019 alleged fraud did not inflate the price of the stock purchased by plaintiffs over that which would have prevailed had defendants fully complied with their obligations under the securities laws, then plaintiffs were not damaged and cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-13\">The starting point for analyzing a pleading under the fraud-on-the-market theory, therefore, is to identify the false statement or misleading omission which could have caused the stock price to deviate from its efficient price. In this case, the starting point lies in the September 17 press release. According to plaintiffs, that release disclosed to the market the true facts which, in turn, had the effect of reducing the price of VeriFone common stock from its artificially high price to its efficient price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-14\">It may be asked what was contained in the September 17 press release that disclosed the falsity or misleading nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>the statements made prior to that release? For, to put the matter concretely, if defendants\u2019 statements or omissions before the September 17 press release were not false or misleading <em>to the market, </em>then plaintiffs cannot have suffered damages attributable to these statements or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-4\">It is at this point in the analysis \u2014 the very beginning \u2014 that plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case begins to break down.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-5\">B. <em>The Duty to Disclose Forward-Looking Information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1538-6\">Plaintiffs do not allege that any of the factual statements made by the defendants are false. Instead, plaintiffs claim that the defendants omitted to disclose the information, discussed above, which would be necessary for investors to properly value Veri-Fone common stock. In the absence of the omitted information, say plaintiffs, the information provided by defendants to the market was misleading and caused, as the fraud-on-the-market theory suggests, a deviation between the market price of Veri-Fone stock and its efficient price. Plaintiffs argue that because financial analysts measure the value of a share of stock by \u201cthe reasonable estimated future earnings\u201d of the issuer, VeriFone and other issuers of securities perpetrate a fraud on the market when they disclose only a portion of the information which investors would find necessary to estimate future earnings. Opp. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-7\">Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the securities laws do not require an issuer of stock to disclose every bit of information that has some bearing on the issuer\u2019s future earnings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a matter of law, silence is not misleading in the absence of a duty to disclose. <em>Basic Inc., </em>485 U.S. at 239 n. 17, 108 S.Ct. at 987 n. 17. Thus, for plaintiffs to prevail on a claim that the literally truthful information provided by defendants was insufficient to prevent a fraud on the market, plaintiffs must show not only that a particular piece of information would have been helpful to investors, but also, as a threshold matter, that the information was of a kind which the defendants had a legally cognizable duty to disclose. <em>Id.; Alfus v. Pyramid Technology Corp., </em>764 F.Supp. 598, 601 (N.D.Cal.1991) <em>(\u201cAlfus II\").</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1538-11\">Plaintiffs point to three sources of a duty placed upon defendants to disclose the omitted information described in the complaint. First, plaintiffs argue that under Sections 11, 12(2), 10(b), and Rule 10b-5, defendants have a duty to reveal all information necessary to insure that statements actually made are not misleading. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k, 771(2), 78j. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.-10b-5. Second, plaintiffs point to Regulation S-K, which the SEC promulgated to govern the drafting of registration statements, annual reports and certain other filings required by the Securities and Exchange Acts. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.10(a). Item 303 of Regulation S-K requires that issuers of securities disclose trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties known to the issuer that are likely to affect the corporation\u2019s liquidity, net sales or revenues. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.303(a)(l)-(3). Finally, plaintiffs point to the reporting and disclosure requirements which govern members of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>1. Materially misleading omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-4\">Plaintiffs assert that the failure of the defendants to disclose the adverse information identified in the complaint is actionable on the grounds that this information was necessary to prevent the literally truthful information from misleading the market. Plaintiffs describe defendants\u2019 disclosures as \u201chalf truths,\u201d Opp. at 10, which, under the guise of accurate historical reporting, served only to mislead investors about VeriFone\u2019s likely future. Compl., 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-5\">At the time of the hearing, defendants relied upon <em>Alfus v. Pyramid Tech. Corp., </em>745 F.Supp. 1511 (N.D.Cal.1990) <em>(\u201cAlfus I\"), </em>in which the court determined that accurate historical reporting and general statements of optimism do not imply a misleading projection of future results. <em>Id. </em>at 1516. Subsequent to argument, the Ninth Circuit handed down <em>In re Convergent Technologies Securities Litigation, </em>948 F.2d 507, 513 (9th Cir.1991), which, in essence, adopted <em>Alfus I </em>as the law of this Circuit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also In re Apple Computer Securities Litigation, </em>886 F.2d 1109, 1118-19 (9th Cir.1989) (generally optimistic statements regarding the future are not actionable absent evidence that the corporation did not believe the statements at the time they were made). The <em>Convergent Technologies </em>court further held that an issuer\u2019s internal projections need not be disclosed, even if those internal projections contain more detailed information than the data publicly disclosed. 948 F.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-6\">Although the Ninth Circuit did not spell out any reasoning for its holding in <em>Convergent Technologies, </em>the result reached is sound. Shareholders and potential investors are most in need of \u201chard\u201d information, such as sales and profit data, because such information is in the exclusive control of the corporation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, the corporation is not merely the \u201cleast cost provider\u201d of this information, it is probably the only source of it. This information, when accurately reported, is rarely subject to misinterpretation, even if the disclosure is accompanied by generally optimistic statements about the future by corporate officers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Professional investors, and most amateur investors as well, know how to devalue the optimism of corporate executives, who have a personal stake in the future success of the company. <em>Wielgos v. Commonwealth Edison Co., </em>892 F.2d 509, 515 (7th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-13\">Conversely, the corporation\u2019s own officers are not likely to be the most reliable source of projections of future corporate performance. Officers and internal analysts may be biased by their personal goals in evaluating the corporation\u2019s prospects for short- and long-term success. As long as the corporation provides accurate hard data to the market, professional analysts and investors are in at least as good and probably a better position to make the predictions about a corporation\u2019s future which are relevant to the valuation of corporate securities.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1539-14\">This is true for a number of reasons. First, the professional analyst has more interest in making the most accurate prediction possible, because the analyst\u2019s reputation and livelihood depend solely on the analyst\u2019s ability to be correct. The corporate officer\u2019s success does not depend primarily or even significantly on an ability to predict stock prices. Second, the analyst has the benefit of objectivity because the analyst is removed from the daily operations of the corporation, whereas the corporate officer is in the thick of these developments. Finally, and most importantly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>analyst is skilled in combining the specific data disclosed by the corporation with general knowledge about the industry and the national and international economies in which the corporation competes. Corporations call on their officers for other skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-4\">Thus, it is in the best economic interests of shareholders and other investors for the corporation to provide accurate historical data to the market, and leave the task of predicting the future to others.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1540-5\">This is not to suggest that a corporation should never make predictions, and the securities laws do not prohibit a corporation from doing so. Securities Act Release No. 5992, 43 Fed.Reg. 53246 (1978) (Disclosure of projections and other items of forward-looking information in Commission filings is permitted but not required.) In fact, under the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of Rule 175, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.175, a corporation may disclose a forecast, if made in good faith and with a reasonable basis, without exposing itself to liability should that forecast turn out to be wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-6\">The SEC regulations allowing, but not requiring, the disclosure of good faith forecasts were the result of a carefully considered change in SEC policy, and is founded on the understanding that reliable information, regardless of its source, may help investors make more informed decisions and that investors are capable of properly valuing the predictions made by the corporation itself.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1540-7\">The rule in <em>Convergent Technologies </em>fits well into the disclosure scheme created by the securities laws. A public corporation is under an absolute duty to provide certain material \u201chard\u201d data about the corporation\u2019s past performance. This information is known only to the corporation, and thus the corporation is strictly liable for the failure to disclose accurate and non-misleading data. Disclosure of this hard data enables investors to combine such firm-specific information with general knowledge obtained from other sources in order to develop some estimate of the corporation\u2019s future performance. This estimate is then used to value the securities issued by the corporation. The corporation may also provide the market with good faith predictions of its own future success, information which is not in the exclusive control of the corporation. Disclosure of this soft information by the corporation is optional, and liability will not attach for good faith, but erroneous, disclosure. Investors, knowing the inaccuracy inherent in forecasting, may choose to use or disregard predictions by the corporation at their option, after considering the value of such a prediction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-12\">A rule which required the corporation to disclose its own internal forecasts or otherwise provide the market with the corporation\u2019s prediction of its own future would, somewhat paradoxically, be less beneficial to investors than the current SEC policy. Because of the inherent imprecision of such \u201csoft\u201d information, the disclosing corporation most likely would surround the prediction with \u201cboilerplate\u201d warnings drafted to discourage reliance by investors on the prediction. Corporations might also eschew otherwise valuable forecasting activity in an attempt to minimize liability for actionable disclosures.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1540-13\">Often, \u201cdisclosure\u201d of predictions is du-plicative of information already known to most analysts. As Judge Easterbrook has observed, a firm need not \u201cdisclose\u201d Murphy\u2019s Law or the Peter Principle, even though these have substantial effects on business. <em>Wielgos, </em>892 F.2d at 515. Similarly, a firm need not disclose that 50% of all new products vanish from the market within a short period of time, because this forward-looking \u201cfact\u201d is known to all serious analysts. <em>Id. </em>Duplicative disclosure is a hinderance, not a benefit, to investors, and the securities laws do not require a corporation \u201cto bury the shareholders in an avalanche of trivial information \u2014 a result that is hardly conducive to informed deci-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>sionmaking.\u201d <em>TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 448-49, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 2132, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976); <em>Convergent Technologies, </em>948 F.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-4\">Information is not a free good. There are social costs to the creation and dissemination of accurate information.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Still other social costs may be created by a lack of information. SEC policy attempts to balance these costs by imposing disclosure obligations on the least cost information providers.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For the reasons noted, the corporation itself is the most efficient source of historical corporate data, and there are few social costs created by its disclosure. Mandatory disclosure of \u201csoft\u201d information by the corporation, by contrast, may create its own costs. Although a corporation has sound business reasons for creating internal forecasts, there are equally sound business reasons for a corporation to keep these forecasts confidential. Disclosure could provide information to competitors and potential future customers which would be to the detriment of the disclosing corporation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To impose a disclosure obligation for such information simply cannot be in the best interests of investors and shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-5\">2. Regulation S-K.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-6\">The above analysis also informs the court\u2019s understanding of the disclosure requirements in SEC Regulation S-K. Although Item 303 specifies that the corporation is to \u201c[i]dentify any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties,\u201d Instruction 7 to Item 303 provides that corporations \u201care encouraged, but not required, to supply forward-looking information\u201d and any forward-looking information so disclosed is protected by the Rule 175 \u201csafe harbor.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.303, Instruction 7. Regulation S-K thus governs the disclosure of known historic trends, but does not provide a basis of liability where a corporation fails to \u201cdisclose\u201d the future. <em>Convergent Technologies, </em>948 F.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-11\">3. Exchange rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-12\">Although plaintiffs refer to the rules of the various public securities exchanges, Compl., 1168(b)-(d), in the Ninth Circuit the violation of an exchange rule will not support a private cause of action. <em>Jablon v. Dean Witter &amp; Co., </em>614 F.2d 677 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Carrott v. Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 821 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-13\">III. VERIFONE DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-14\">Upon motion by defendant, a complaint is to be dismissed if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In considering a motion to dismiss, the court must presume that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are true, and is to grant the motion to dismiss if it appears that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts which would entitle plaintiffs to relief. <em>Sun Savings &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Dierdorff, </em>825 F.2d 187, 191 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Wool v. Tandem Computers Inc., </em>818 F.2d 1433, 1439 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Alfus I, </em>745 F.Supp. at 1514. A complaint may be dismissed as a matter of law for two reasons: (1) lack of a cognizable legal theory or (2) insufficient facts under a cognizable theory. 2A J. Moore, <em>Moore</em>'s <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 12.08 at 2271 (2d ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-15\">A. <em>Misstatements or Omissions Under Sections 11 and 12(2), and Rule 10b-5.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1541-16\">The <em>Convergent Technologies </em>court determined that neither the disclosure of accurate historical data accompanied by general statements of optimism nor the failure to disclose internal forecasts of future performance is actionable. Thus, the task before the court in this motion is to determine whether plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges facts other than those found in <em>Alfus I </em>and <em>Convergent Technologies </em>not to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>Defendants contend that the complaint does not state a claim for any material misstatements or omissions under any cause of action because it fails to allege that defendants made untrue statements of material fact or omitted any material fact necessary to make any statements which were made not misleading.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-4\">1. Statements made by the VeriFone defendants in the prospectus and post-prospectus filings and press releases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1542-6\">Defendants argue that the prospectus\u2019 representations about past growth and success, current customers, and general plans for the future contained no misstatements, and more importantly for this motion, contained no future projections of VeriFone\u2019s future earnings or financial performance. Hence, defendants argue, plaintiff\u2019s allegations that the prospectus failed to warn that the company \u201cfaced a brick wall\u201d do not allege a misleading omission because, even if true, the prospectus had not represented otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-7\">The characterization of the complaint as alleging that defendants concealed their knowledge that VeriFone was going to \u201chit a brick wall,\u201d while glib, is no substitute for a coherent theory of liability. Nothing in plaintiff\u2019s dexterously drafted 66-page complaint suggests that plaintiffs have developed such a theory to support their claims. Every allegation of misrepresentation or material omission ultimately relies on the failure to disclose a forecast of future sales or revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-8\">In \u00b6\u00b6 21 and 41 of the complaint, plaintiffs detail the \u201cadverse material facts and trends\u201d which were allegedly known by defendants but not disclosed in the March 1990 prospectus. Subparagraphs 21(a), 21(b) and 21(c) claim that the prospectus failed to disclose estimated future growth rates in revenue and unit sales. These claims call for disclosure of internal forecasts, and therefore do not support liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-9\">Subparagraphs 21(d), 21(e), 21(f) and 21(g) discuss difficulties that VeriFone would be facing in marketing new products and competing in new markets. As discussed above, the securities laws presume that skilled investors are aware that a corporation\u2019s performance with a new product or in a new market is unlikely to replicate past successes. <em>Wielgos, </em>892 F.2d at 515. Nevertheless, Veri-Fone\u2019s March 13 prospectus, on page 6, cautioned investors about the risks inherent in VeriFone\u2019s new business ventures. Eth Decl., Exh. A. Further disclosure is not necessary, as these claims call for projections of future performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-12\">Subparagraphs 21(h), 21(i) and 21(j), discussing future sales and revenue in certain of VeriFone\u2019s sub-markets, amount to nothing more than a failure of VeriFone to predict the future. Subparagraphs 41(a), 41(c) and 41(d) also allege that VeriFone failed to \u201cdisclose\u201d the future in the March 1990 prospectus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-13\">Only subparagraph 41(b) claims that VeriFone failed to disclose an actual fact, that VeriFone did not have current orders with the \u201ccustomers\u201d listed on page 27 of the prospectus. However, the prospectus neither expressly states or implies this fact. Inserted in the context of a discussion of VeriFone\u2019s historical marketing strategy, the list is obviously a compilation of past and current customers, and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-14\">In fact, nowhere in either of these two paragraphs do plaintiffs establish a link between a misleading statement or implication in the prospectus and an actual fact, not a speculation about the future, omitted from the document. The prospectus makes no projections whatsoever and contains a detailed discussion of risk factors. Although the risk factors section might not have been adequate to alert an investor to potential risks if the prospectus had in fact made affirmative projections of the company\u2019s prospects, here, where no projections were made, the risk factors section was adequate and the prospectus as a whole is not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-15\">Accordingly, even if defendants had knowledge of certain facts which would support internal forecasts, disclosure of such facts is not required to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>the prospectus not misleading. <em>Convergent Technologies, </em>948 F.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding omissions from Verifone\u2019s post-prospectus disclosures similarly fail to state a claim that the VeriFone defendants omitted information they were under a duty to disclose. In Ml 46 and 51 of the complaint, plaintiffs claim that VeriFone\u2019s April 16, 1990 press release and first quarter form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on May 14, 1990, failed to disclose, in addition to the projections detailed in \u00b6\u00b6 21 and 41, that Veri-Fone\u2019s first quarter sales were \u201cboosted\u201d by large one-time sales which would not recur in future quarters, a prediction, and that \u201csales growth\u201d was \u201cflat\u201d in certain of VeriFone\u2019s markets. To the extent that this last claim is not a demand that Veri-Fone predict its future sales, the information regarding past sales trends is accurately and adequately disclosed in the press release. Analysts reading VeriFone\u2019s press release and prior disclosures, such as the prospectus, can easily calculate Veri-Fone\u2019s historic sales and growth trends, and determine for themselves if any slowdown in historical growth is cause for concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-5\">The same defects are contained in plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding VeriFone\u2019s July 17, 1990, press release and second quarter form 10-Q, filed on August 7, 1990. Plaintiffs again claim, in 1\u00cd11 53 and 58, that defendants did not disclose that sales in the quarter were atypically large and that the future would not be as bright as the past. Again, this type of allegation in effect calls upon VeriFone to predict future sales, and thus does not state a claim under the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-6\">Curiously, given plaintiffs\u2019 repeated claims that VeriFone failed to disclose the future, plaintiffs also allege in 11 53 that VeriFone \u201chad no reasonable basis\u201d for the \u201cearnings estimates\u201d reported in the July 17, 1990 press release, even those estimates were repeated as actual earnings in the second quarter form 10-Q, a document plaintiffs do not allege to contain erroneous data. This type of allegation highlights the inconsistency inherent in plaintiffs\u2019 legal theory: plaintiffs seek to place defendants in the awkward position of being required to disclose all estimates of the future but liable for reporting estimates even if they turn out to be factually correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-9\">Because defendants had no duty to disclose any of the \u201comissions\u201d detailed by plaintiffs in the complaint, the omission of this information cannot be materially misleading under the fraud-on-the-market theory. Thus, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all claims relating to purported misrepresentations or omissions in the prospectus and post prospectus disclosures by Veri-Fone is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-10\">When a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, district courts have discretion to deny plaintiffs leave to amend if amendment of the complaint would be futile. \u201cIf the court determines that the \u2018allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency,\u2019 then a dismissal without leave to amend is proper.\u201d <em>Albrecht v. Lund, </em>845 F.2d 193, 195 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-11\">The initial burden of an amorphous and diffuse securities class action complaint is placed on the defendants. This burden ultimately comes to rest on shareholders who, directly or indirectly, pay for the compliance with and private enforcement of the securities laws. To the extent that private securities litigation discourages misconduct, shareholders receive something in return.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But a complaint unable even to identify the fraudulent conduct it supposedly targets serves no useful purpose. The costs imposed by such a plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>ing, while not precisely measurable, become a deadweight loss for society.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1544-4\">Here, the complaint itself reflects the best efforts of at least ten distinguished law firms that specialize in this area<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and could not be improved. It incorporates allegations of the two actions filed on September 20 and 21, 1990. Because no fee shifting is available to internalize the social costs of this litigation, the court determines that it would be unwise and an unfair burden on shareholders to give these law firms more than two bites at an apple they have not been able to get their teeth into. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the federal securities law claims based on the prospectus and the other reports and press releases issued by VeriFone is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-5\">2. VeriFone defendants\u2019 liability for statements in stock analysts\u2019 reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-6\">Although accurate reporting of historical data does not create a misleading impression of future growth, where actual forecasts are made liability may be premised on false or misleading projections under Rule 10b-5. <em>Marx v. Computer Sciences Corp., </em>507 F.2d 485, 489 (9th Cir.1974); <em>Alfus II, </em>764 F.Supp. at 602. As for all 10b-5 actions, plaintiffs must plead and ultimately prove scienter. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). In the context of an allegedly misleading projection, it is not sufficient to allege in hindsight that the projection turned out to be wrong. <em>Marx, </em>507 F.2d at 490. Plaintiffs can only satisfy the scienter requirement by presenting facts which tend to show that, at the time the projection was made, there was no reasonable basis for the defendants\u2019 belief that the projection might come true. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1544-7\">Plaintiffs bear an additional burden when claiming that the corporate defendants are liable for the allegedly misleading forecasts issued by others. In <em>Elkind v. Liggett &amp; Myers, </em>635 F.2d 156 (2d Cir.1980), the court held that analysts\u2019 reports cannot be attributable to the corporation even though it had initiated contacts with analysts and corrected their reports. <em>Elkind, </em>an opinion of the Second Circuit, has been followed in this district. <em>See Alfus II, </em>764 F.Supp. at 603. In order to be liable for unreasonably disclosed third-party forecasts, defendants must have put their imprimatur, express or implied, on the projections. <em>Elkind, </em>635 F.2d at 163. Where a corporation has \u201cso involve[d] itself in the preparation of reports and projections by outsiders,\u201d the corporation incurs a duty to disclose information necessary to correct errors in the projections and prevent the projection from being materially misleading. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1544-10\">In \u00b6\u00b6 42, 47 and 54 of the complaint, plaintiffs allege that Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, two of the underwriter defendants, issued analysts\u2019 reports which contained misleading projections of VeriFone\u2019s future performance. Plaintiffs further allege, in \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48 and 55 of the complaint, that VeriFone contributed to these analysts\u2019 reports. Plaintiffs claim that VeriFone supplied nonpublic \u201cbackground information\u201d to the analysts, reviewed and confirmed the content of the finished report, was given the chance to correct the report, and obtained copies of the analysts\u2019 reports for redistribution. At the same time, according to plaintiffs, the VeriFone defendants were aware of internal forecasts and projections, see discussion in section III.A.l., <em>supra, </em>which projected a far less positive future for the company. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 21, 41, 44, 46, 49, 51, 53, 56, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-11\">In <em>Alfus II, </em>the court found that similar allegations stated a claim under Rule 10b-5. 764 F.Supp. at 604-05. The complaint in <em>Alfus II, </em>however, stated facts with suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>ficient particularity to show both how the corporate defendants had \u201cadopted\u201d the analysts\u2019 reports and why the corporate defendants had no reasonable basis to believe that the projections made could come true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-4\">Even if the VeriFone defendants had adopted and helped distribute the analysts\u2019 reports, the complaint here, unlike the amended complaint in <em>Alfus II, </em>presents no facts which indicate that the Verifone defendants ever knew that the projections in the Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter reports lacked a reasonable basis. Nor do plaintiffs plead facts which show that the company defendants knew that the analysts\u2019 reports lacked a reasonable basis and withheld that information from investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-5\">In 10b-5 cases, where knowledge of certain matters pertaining to fraud is peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge, the particularity requirement of Fed. R.Civ.P. 9(b) is relaxed. <em>Wool, </em>818 F.2d at 1439. Nonetheless, this special rule does not read Rule 9(b) out of existence. Mere conclusory allegations of fraud are insufficient. Statements of the time, place and nature of the fraudulent activities are required, so that defendant can prepare an adequate answer to the allegations. <em>Wool. </em>818 F.2d at 1439.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-6\">Here, plaintiffs do particularly describe the time and place that the projections were made. Plaintiffs do not, however, describe the nature of the fraud, other than to make the conclusory assertion that the projections issued by the analysts lacked a reasonable basis. This type of unsubstantiated conclusion is insufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim amounts to a legal theory that it is <em>per se </em>unreasonable for a corporation to disclose only one of two projected futures. The complaint merely describes that the VeriFone defendants were aware of two potential futures, and then asserts that the one disclosed lacked a reasonable basis. Plaintiffs assume that the projections made in the analysts\u2019 reports are outside of the reasonable range at the time they were made because (1) other, more negative projections were available to the defendants and (2) the future fell below the projections disclosed. However, the law requires more than an assumption. Plaintiffs must show why the projection disclosed lacked a reasonable basis. The fact that defendants had contradictory projections available to them cannot, by itself, support an inference that the disclosed projection was unreasonable at the time it was made. As the <em>Wielgos </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1545-10\">Issuers need not reveal all projections. Any firm generates a range of estimates internally or through consultants. It may reveal the projection it thinks best while withholding others, so long as the one revealed has a \u201creasonable basis\u201d \u2014 a question on which other estimates may reflect without automatically depriving the published one of foundation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar4b\"><em>Wielgos, </em>892 F.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-11\">For this reason, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims against the VeriFone defendants arising out of the analysts\u2019 reports is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-12\">The question now is whether to dismiss the claims based upon the Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter analysts\u2019 reports without prejudice. All of the reasons described in the preceding section militate in favor of a dismissal with prejudice. Plaintiffs\u2019 law firms have extensive experience in these actions and know full well their obligation to establish a factual basis for their claim that the VeriFone defendants distributed fraudulent projections. Moreover, these law firms had six months after the initial pleadings to fill these factual gaps before filing the amended consolidated complaint on March 22,1991. Still, they failed to come forward with factual allegations establishing a disclosure obligation on the part of the VeriFone defendants. It would not be unreasonable to assume that if plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers of the skill and experience of those at bar did not make such allegations, there is no basis for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-13\">Yet the court is inclined to afford plaintiffs\u2019 counsel one more opportunity to allege a set of facts supporting a theory that the Verifone defendants had no reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>basis for adopting and distributing the Morgan Stanley report in April and the Dean Witter reports in May and July. The court is aware that if these allegations ultimately prove unfounded, this litigation will have served no useful purpose. Out of an abundance of caution, however, plaintiffs will be given 30 days from the date of this order to file a third complaint, but one directed solely to these issues. In preparing such amended complaint, counsel should note that Rule 9(b) does not require rococo factual detail, but does require straightforward pleading of facts which, if true, constitute the elements of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-4\">B. <em>State Law Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1546-5\">The state law claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of California Corporations Code Section 1507 must also be dismissed for failure adequately to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-6\">The California Court of Appeal recently reviewed the state common law and securities laws and concluded: \u201cCalifornia law does not permit the application of the fraud-on-the-market theory of reliance to causes of action based on fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, or violation of section 1507.\u201d <em>Mirkin v. Wasserman, </em>227 Cal.App.3d 1537, 234 Cal.App.3d 719, 278 Cal.Rptr. 729, 746 (1991). The California Supreme Court has granted a petition for review in <em>Mirkin. </em>282 Cal.Rptr. 840, 811 P.2d 1024 (1991). If <em>Mirkin </em>is affirmed by the California Supreme Court, the claims here fail because plaintiff has failed to plead actual reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-7\">Even if the California Supreme Court reverses the decision in <em>Mirkin </em>and adopts the fraud-on-the-market theory, plaintiffs have not stated a claim based on alleged misrepresentations in the prospectus. The above analysis discussing the federal fraud-on-the-market requirements would be equally applicable, and plaintiffs\u2019 claim fails for the purposes discussed in part III.A.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-8\">Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for relief under California state law. Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the state law claims is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-10\">C. <em>Insider Trading Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1546-11\">The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act, Section 20A of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t-l (\u201cITSFEA\u201d), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-12\">Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder by purchasing or selling a security while in possession of material, nonpublic information shall be liable * * * to any person who, contemporaneously with the purchase or sale of securities that is the subject of such violation, has purchased * * * or sold * * * securities of the same class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1546-13\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t-l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-14\">A careful parsing of the somewhat tangled initial sentence of \u00a7 20A discloses that an insider \u2014 one who trades while in the possession of material, nonpublic information \u2014 is liable only where an independent violation of another provision of the securities laws has occurred. The few reported decisions which have already interpreted \u00a7 20A have reached this conclusion. <em>See T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, Inc. v.

The meaning of the term \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d is not defined by statute.

All three cases discuss the \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d trading in the context of an implied 10b-5 action against an insider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-4\">In <em>Shapiro </em>and <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 trades occurred less than a week apart, and the courts found that plaintiffs had stated causes of action for insider trading under 10b-5. <em>Shapiro, </em>495 F.2d at 241; <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>559 F.Supp. at 803. The <em>O\u2019Connor </em>court further held that plaintiffs who trade prior to the time that the defendant does are not harmed. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Wilson, </em>the court recognized that a rule which allowed all parties who purchased or sold securities during the full period from when the insider traded to when the insider disclosed would not serve the purpose of the insider trading cause of action because noncontemporaneous traders do not require protection. Thus, the <em>Wilson </em>court held that parties who trade a month after defendants do not trade \u201ccontemporaneously.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>648 F.2d at 94-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-5\">By reference to these cases, the drafters of ITSFEA meant to protect and compensate investors who trade at the same time as the insider or for some short period thereafter, and that a reasonable period of liability could be as short as a few days, but no longer than a month. In <em>Alfus I, </em>the court considered these cases and others in the context of a 10b-5 cause of action and, without determining one way or another whether an implied 10b-5 cause of action for insider trading exists in the Ninth Circuit, held that \u201cthe contemporaneous requirement is not met if plaintiff\u2019s trade occurred more than a few days apart from defendants\u2019 transactions.\u201d <em>Alfus I, </em>745 F.Supp. at 1522 (citing <em>Wilson, </em>648 F.2d at 94-95).</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-6\">Defendants\u2019 two alleged insider trades occurred (1) at the time of the March 13, 1990 IPO, when VeriFone and many of the individual defendants sold shares of VeriFone stock, and (2) on August 20,1990, when defendant Caufield allegedly sold almost 500,000 shares of VeriFone stock. Compl., 11 69. The representative plaintiffs are alleged to have purchased their stock on April 4, 1990, July 24, 1990, August 3, 1990 and August 6, 1990. Plaintiffs do not state a claim under \u00a7 20A on the basis of these trades.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-9\">The IPO sales by the individual defendants fail to state a \u00a7 20A claim because, as discussed above, no violation of the securities laws occurred in connection with the IPO. As plaintiffs\u2019 complaint merely asserts that the defendants failed to disclose projections in connection with the IPO, neither the issuer or the individual defendants were under an obligation to disclose any \u201cmaterial, nonpublic information\u201d other than that which was disclosed in the prospectus. <em>See </em>part III.A.l, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1547-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 insider trading claims against Caufield fail because no plaintiff traded \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d with Caufield\u2019s sale on August 20. All of the named plaintiffs had completed their trading activity before the date in which defendant Caufield allegedly sold his shares. Insiders are under a duty to refrain from trading until the material, nonpublic information in their possession is disclosed. No liability can attach for trades made by plaintiffs before the insider engages in trading activity. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>559 F.Supp. at 803; <em>T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, Inc., </em>749 F.Supp. at 710; <em>Alfus I, </em>745 F.Supp. at 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-11\">Thus, even if the plaintiffs are able to state a claim under 10b-5 for the allegedly misleading analysts\u2019 reports, and even if plaintiffs can show that Caufield was in possession of material, nonpublic information which would have made the statements in the analysts\u2019 reports not misleading, the representative plaintiffs nonetheless cannot state a \u00a7 20A claim against Caufield because each of the plaintiffs\u2019 trades occurred prior to Caufield\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-12\">Plaintiffs argue that even if the representative plaintiffs cannot assert an individual claim against the defendants under \u00a7 20A, they may nonetheless maintain a class action for the benefit of those who did trade contemporaneously with defendants. Not so. Where a plaintiff lacks standing to bring a claim personally, that plaintiff cannot represent the class. <em>Si</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number><em>mon v.

H &amp; B Novelty and Loan Co., </em>489 F.2d 461, 465-66 (9th Cir.1973); <em>In re Seagate Technology II Securities Litigation, </em>Fed.Sec.L.Rep. If 95,427, 1990 WL 134963 (N.D.Cal.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-4\">The class action \u201crepresentative\u201d requirement embodied in Rule 23(a) is often considered to be a question of standing. Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d </em>\u00a7 1761. Some commentators, however, have observed that Rule 23(a) will also bar certain class actions where all of the requisites for Article III standing are established.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In these cases, Rule 23(a) serves to deter litigation by making it difficult for counsel to locate representative plaintiffs. In some situations, this judicial deterrence of private law suits creates under-enforcement of the law. In the case at bar, however, the deterrent effect of the \u201crepresentative\u201d requirement serves the Congressional' enforcement scheme for insider trading litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contrary argument that \u00a7 20A will be rendered \u201cmeaningless\u201d if plaintiffs who do not have \u00a7 20A claims are prohibited from asserting class actions on behalf of investors who have valid \u00a7 20A claims is absurd. Those investors who did trade contemporaneously with defendants have an incentive to bring suit, and all the incentive that Congress wished to create rests with those contemporaneous traders. By limiting actions under \u00a7 20A to investors who traded contemporaneously with insiders, and by limiting recoverable damages to the amount by which the defendant benefited, Congress deliberately created a narrow private cause of action. The drafters of \u00a7 20A could have created as broad a private enforcement scheme as the courts have created under Rule 10b-5, but chose not to do so. Significantly, the final version of ITSFEA deleted provisions for an express cause of action for non-contemporaneous trading which had been present in earlier versions of the legislation. H.R.Rep. 910 at 27. Plaintiffs cannot persuade this court that \u00a7 20A is \u201cuseless\u201d if it does not apply as broadly as 10b-5 might.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-8\">Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims under \u00a7 20A is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-9\">IV. THE UNDERWRITER DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-10\">The underwriter defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint on many of the same grounds as the VeriFone defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-11\">A. <em>Statements in the VeriFone Documents.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1548-12\">For the reasons discussed in parts III. A.l. and III.B., <em>supra, </em>the underwriter defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all federal and state law claims against the underwriters arising out statements in VeriFone\u2019s prospectus, VeriFone\u2019s Forms 10-Q, and Veri-Fone\u2019s press releases is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-13\">B. <em>Statements in the Analysts\u2019 Reports.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1548-14\">As discussed above, part III.A.2. <em>supra, </em>the research reports of the underwriter defendants did make actual projections, and liability attaches under Rule 10b-5 for projections that lacked a reasonable basis at the time they were published. <em>Marx, </em>507 F.2d at 489; <em>Alfus II, </em>764 F.Supp. at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b1548-15\">However, the complaint against the underwriter defendants fails for the same reasons as does the complaint against the VeriFone defendants.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 conclu-sory assertion, repeated in \u00b6\u00b6 44, 49(e), 53 and 56(b) of the complaint, that the defendants lacked a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for the projections disclosed, does not satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>As discussed above, plaintiffs can satisfy the scienter requirement for a 10b-5 cause of action in the context of an allegedly misleading projection only if they can assert facts which show that the underwriter defendants had no reasonable basis for the projections made in the analysts\u2019 reports at the time that those reports were published. It is insufficient to allege merely that the forecasts did not come true, <em>Marx, </em>507 F.2d at 490; it is insufficient to allege merely that other, less positive forecasts were known to the underwriter defendants; and it is insufficient merely to allege that the VeriFone defendants were aware of internal information so that the VeriFone defendants would have had no reasonable basis for publishing the reports. The scienter of the underwriter defendants must be established to state a claim against them. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst, </em>425 U.S. at 206, 96 S.Ct. at 1387 (\u201cThere is no indication that Congress intended anyone to be liable for such practices unless he acted other than in good faith.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-4\">The underwriter defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims against them arising out of the projections in the analysts\u2019 reports is GRANTED. Plaintiffs will be given 30 days from the date this order is filed to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-5\">V. <em>CONCLUSION.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1549-6\">For the reasons discussed, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1549-7\">A. The VeriFone defendants\u2019 and the underwriter defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state law claims arising out of statements in the March 13, 1990 prospectus, VeriFone\u2019s Forms 10-Q, and Veri-Fone\u2019s press releases is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1549-8\">B.

As no claims can be asserted against Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., the clerk shall enter judgment in favor of that defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1549-12\">VI. ORDER FOLLOWING HEARING ON PLAINTIFFS\u2019 MOTION TO VACATE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-13\">Following the court\u2019s order granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, plaintiffs moved to vacate same. The court heard argument on February 14, 1992, and has considered the briefs filed by counsel. For the reasons stated by the court at the February 14 hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-14\">The court\u2019s order, affording plaintiffs 30 days to file an amended complaint with respect to the analysts\u2019 reports only, was originally filed on December 21, 1991. At the February 14 hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate that order, the court observed that the 30 day period had expired and inquired whether plaintiffs would seek to file an amended complaint following the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate. Counsel for plaintiffs informed the court that plaintiffs had no additional facts to allege and that no amended pleading was anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-15\">Accordingly, this matter is hereby DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE in its entirety. The clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of all remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-16\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1533-9\"> This order supersedes the court\u2019s Order Granting Motions to Dismiss, filed December 21, 1991.
