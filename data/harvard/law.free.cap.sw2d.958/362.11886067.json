He contends that the trial court erroneously enhanced the three, ten-year sentences it previously imposed in this case by applying improperly two enhancement factors and ignoring an applicable mitigating factor. Because we conclude that the trial court was without the authority to increase the defendant\u2019s sentence, we vacate the amended judgments of the trial court and order that the defendant serve the original ten-year, concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">On May 7, 1992, the defendant pled guilty to three cocaine-related Class B felonies and received three, concurrent ten-year sentences in the custody of the Department of Correction. Judgments of conviction were entered on that date and he was transferred to the Department of Correction and began serving his time. The Department of Correction placed him in the boot camp program, <em>see </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-20-201, -207, and then, effective April 13, 1993, placed him on probation for the remainder of his sentences. <em>See </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-20-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">After issuing a probation revocation warrant in August 1993, the trial court entered a series of orders. The first stated that the defendant was to serve ten years in the community corrections program, from October 15, 1993 to October 15, 2003, and listed conditions of his release. The second order revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and ordered that he serve ten years in the Department of Correction but noted, in a footnote, that the defendant was placed on the alternative community corrections program. The third order provided for the defendant\u2019s immediate release and stated that he was to be placed in the community corrections program.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In May 1994, the trial court issued a warrant alleging that the defendant again violated his probation. After a hearing, the trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence and sentenced him to twelve years in the Department of Correction for each of the three offenses. The trial court cited the defendant\u2019s history of criminal behavior, <em>inability </em>to abide by conditions of a sentence involving release into the community, and lack of mitigating factors. The trial court entered amended judgments that reflect that the defendant\u2019s sentences were increased upon revocation of a community corrections sentence. Although we agree with the trial court that enhancement of the defendant\u2019s sentence would have been appropriate had the court been revoking a sentence under the Tennessee Community Corrections Act of 1985, <em>see </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-36-106(e)(3), it was not proper under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">We begin our analysis by recognizing the distinction between the revocation of a community correction sentence and a probation revocation. When a trial court revokes a community corrections sentence under the Tennessee Community Corrections Act of 1985, it has the authority to \u201cresentence the defendant to any appropriate sentencing alternative, including incarceration, for any period of time up to the maximum sentence provided for the offense committed, less any time actually served in any community-based alternative to incarceration.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-36\u2014106(e)(3). By contrast, a trial court that determines that a probation violation has occurred can cause execution of the original judgment as it was originally entered, <em>see </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-85-310, -311, or can modify the defendant\u2019s conditions of supervision, including extending the defendant\u2019s probationary period for up to two years. <em>See </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">In this case, the defendant initially received a ten-year sentence in the Department of Correction. Once the defendant was transferred to the Department of Correction, the trial court lost jurisdiction. <em>See </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-212(d). Pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 40-20-206, when the Department of Correction placed the defendant on probation for the remainder of his ten-year sentence, the trial court had jurisdiction to use the procedures set forth in T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-311 to revoke the probation. Although the trial court properly ordered that the defendant\u2019s probation be revoked and that he serve his ten-year sentence in the Department of Correction, <em>see </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-311(d), it also ordered that the defendant serve ten years in the community corrections program, from October 15, 1993 until October 15, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>It is apparent that the trial court intended to convert the defendant\u2019s ten-year sentence into a community corrections sentence. However, neither the Community Corrections Act nor the statutes dealing with probation authorize a court to impose a new sentence under the Act after a defendant has partially served his sentence in the Department of Correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Although the trial court lacked jurisdiction to impose a community corrections <em>sentence </em>when it determined that the defendant violated his probation, it did have the authority to order the defendant\u2019s participation in the community corrections <em>program </em>as a <em>condition </em>of his continuing on probation. <em>See </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-108 (allowing more onerous probation conditions resulting from a revocation hearing); T.C.A. \u00a7 40-36-106(f) (providing for use of a community corrections program as a condition of probation). Thus, the orders the trial court entered in 1993 effectively resulted in the modification of the defendant\u2019s conditions of probation, not the imposition of a community corrections <em>sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">When the trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence in August of 1994, the defendant was serving the remainder of his original ten-year sentence on probation, and the trial court was to proceed under the probation revocation statutes. The trial court had the authority to commence execution of the original judgment as it was originally entered, <em>see </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 49-35-310, -311, or the authority to modify the defendant\u2019s conditions of supervision and to extend his probationary period for up to two years, <em>see </em>T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-308, but it did not have the authority to increase the defendant\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Accordingly, the amended judgments of conviction of the trial court are vacated and the ease is remanded to the trial court for reinstatement of the ten-year sentences imposed in the original judgments of conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b394-8\">PEAY and HAYES, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
