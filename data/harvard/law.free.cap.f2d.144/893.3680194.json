Oppenheim Cigar Co., 5 Cir., 11 F.2d 773; Tinker v. M. F. Patterson Dental Supply Co., 53 App.D.C. 37, 287 F. 1014; American Tobacco Co. v. Wix, 62 F.2d 835, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 835; In re Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., 86 F.2d 830, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 804; Barber-Colman Co. v. Overhead Door Corporation, 65 F.2d 147, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1118; and In re American Cyanamid &amp; Chemical Corporation, 99 F.2d 964, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 712, strengthened his conviction \u201cthat no words should be registered, except under the conditions prescribed by the statute, if it is likely to be regarded by the public as merely the name of an individual, even though it may have one or more other meanings. That the word \u2018Sawyer\u2019 is likely to be so regarded I think there can be no doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-27\">The question involved here is whether the contention of appellant\" is correct that the prohibition of the statute applies to a word that is only the name of an individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>ual, but when it has other meanings it is error to refuse its registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">It has long been settled that every person has a right to do business under his own name as a trade-mark even though such right might be restricted so as not to confuse the goods of his business with those of another of the same name who had long been in the same business.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The Trade-Mark Registration Act adds nothing to or takes nothing from the common law rights relating to trade-mark-ownership and use. It merely provides that owners of such marks may have them registered and made public, and for remedies in the enforcement of such rights. This doctrine is so elementary that no citation of authorities is deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">It is further well-established that a mark consisting of an ordinary surname is not the subject of exclusive appropriation as a common law trade-mark. American Tobacco Co. v. Wix, supra; Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids Mfg. Co., 233 U.S. 461, 34 S.Ct. 648, 58 L.Ed. 1046; Brown Chemical Co. v. Meyer, 139 U.S. 540, 11 S.Ct. 625, 35 L.Ed. 247; Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans &amp; Benedict, 198 U.S. 118, 25 S.Ct. 609, 49 L.Ed. 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Appellant has set out at great length the various meanings that properly may be attached to the word sought to be registered. The same might be done in respect of a very large number of surnames. Appellant contends in effect that if the name of an individual may be the name of other things, it is not \u201cmerely\u201d the individual\u2019s name and therefore is registrable. We cannot agree with that conclusion. The word \u201cmerely\u201d is an adverb modifying the verb \u201cconsists.\u201d The dictionary definition of \u201cconsists\u201d when followed by the word \u201cin\u201d is \u201cTo have as its foundation, substance, or nature; be:\u201d. Therefore any of its synonyms may be substituted in the statute for the word \u201cconsists.\u201d Applying that reasoning the statute must be read to mean that any mark which has as its foundation, substance or nature or is merely the name of an individual may not be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">\u201cMerely\u201d is defined as \u201cWithout including anything else; purely; only; solely.\u201d A mark which has as its foundation only the name of an individual may not be registered under the statute unless it be \u201cwritten, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner, or in association with a portrait of the individual, * * Sji <em>ff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">Appellant has called our attention to dicta in the decision of this court in American Tobacco Co. case, supra [62 F.2d 838, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 835], in which it was stated that \u201cWe do not wish to be understood in this opinion as holding that under no circumstances is a surname registrable. Many names have a significance other than as names, and are not regarded by the public as merely names.\u201d It was further stated that it was not necessary there to determine in such cases whether a name is subject to the involved proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">It is not to be inferred from the opinion in that case that all surnames which are also nouns, adjectives or adverbs in other connections are registrable. It is clear from the decision in the Thaddeus Davids Co. case, supra, that ordinary surnames are not the subject of exclusive appropriation. The mark here sought to be registered is an ordinary surname regardless of how it is used, it is not \u201cwritten, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner, or in association with a portrait of the individual,\u201d and therefore may not be registered. See also American Tobacco Co., the Brown Chemical Co.,- and the Howe Scale Co. cases, all supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
