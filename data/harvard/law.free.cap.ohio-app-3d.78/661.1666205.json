The matter was submitted upon stipulated evidence and the briefs of counsel, and there was no oral argument upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Relator, Ted M. Montague, seeks a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund, acting through its board of trustees (\u201cboard of trustees\u201d), to vacate and set aside its order denying relator\u2019s application for permanent total disability and ordering respondent to allow said application in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The stipulated evidence indicated that relator was a police officer employed by the Toledo Police Department for nearly twenty-four years. In March 1987, relator filed an application for disability retirement to be supported by his attending physicians, Dr. Habusta and Dr. Snyder. By letter dated June 24, 1987, the \u201cassistant director-benefits\u201d of respondent notified relator that the board of trustees had granted relator not permanent total disability benefits but, instead, \u201cmaximum partial disability retirement pursuant to Division (C)(3) of Section 742.37 of the Revised Code.\u201d Relator was also notified in that letter that he had a right to appeal this determination within sixty days. The appeal in question was back to the board of trustees. Relator did appeal the initial determination. By letter dated September 30, 1987, from the same person who signed the original letter but now under the title of \u201cretirement supervisor,\u201d relator was notified of the result of his appeal, the letter stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">\u201cAt its recent meeting, the Board of Trustees heard the appeal of its previous decision concerning your application for disability benefits. I write to inform you of the Board\u2019s decision as well as what steps need to be taken to begin the benefit payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cBOARD ACTION: The Board of Trustees, after a careful review of the medical evidence, decided not to change its original grant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">As a result of this determination, relator has been receiving partial disability retirement in the amount of sixty percent of the average of relator\u2019s three years of highest earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Under date of March 9, 1987, one of relator\u2019s attending physicians, Dr. Habusta, rendered a report on respondent\u2019s form DR-3, \u201cattending physician\u2019s report,\u201d in which it is stated that: \u201cPt. is unable to function in his employment because of pain and weakness \u2014 past experience also as heavy equipment operator and carpenter \u2014 but unable to do these jobs also.\u201d Under Section 5 of the report, which concludes four possible preprinted choices for the \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Conclusion and Recommendations,\u201d Dr. Habusta checked the block for:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u201cThe applicant is permanently incapacitated for performance of duty as a (fire fighter) or (police officer). His/her disability is \u2018total\u2019 meaning an inability to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which the applicant is reasonably fitted by training, experience, and accomplishment; provided that absolute helplessness is not a prerequisite of total disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Another attending physician, Dr. Snyder, completed the same report, checking the same box as his opinion. Under the general summary section, Dr. Snyder stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">\u201cThe chronic unremitting pain and instability of his low back prohibit him resuming his duties as a police officer. Most other kinds of work would also in most instances be out of the question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Under date of May 19, 1987, a Fund-appointed physician, Dr. Pearson, completed a similar form but checked a different box for his opinion and recommendation, namely one that stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">\u201cThe applicant is permanently incapacitated for performance of duty as a (fire fighter) or (police officer). His/her disability is \u2018partial\u2019 and performance of any other gainful occupation would depend upon the occupation in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Dr. Pearson also gave a narrative statement by a letter report dated May 19, 1987, in which he stated: <em>\u201cCOMMENT: </em>Because of the chronic nature of his problems, he probably is incapacitated for his usual performance of duty as a police officer.\u201d This narrative report gave no indication as to whether relator could perform some other gainful employment. Under date of August 8, 1987, Dr. Habusta rendered a second report in response to relator\u2019s attorney\u2019s requests for further information. In this report, Dr. Habusta stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201cReflecting on the definition of total disability, it is one in which \u2018an applicant is permanently incapacitated from performing duty as a fire fighter or a police officer, and unable to perform gainful duties in the occupation in which the applicant is fitted for by training, experience, accomplishments, etc.\u2019 It is my opinion that Mr. Montague fits this description and is permanently and totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Also stipulated was an Industrial Commission decision of December 19, 1986, relative to relator\u2019s work-related injuries indicating that relator did not sustain a new compensable injury on May 27, 1986, but did suffer a recurrence of an injury recognized in a previous claim. The parties stipulated that the foregoing was evidence in this case and represent copies of matters contained within the Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund file.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">R.C. 742.01(F) defines \u201ctotal disability\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u201c * * * [I]nability to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which the member of the fund is reasonably fitted by training, experience, and accomplishments, provided that absolute helplessness is not a prerequisite of total disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">R.C. 742.37(C)(2) and (3) provide in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">\u201cMembers of the fund * * * shall receive pensions and benefits in accordance with the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\"><em>U </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">\u201c(2) A member of the fund who is permanently and totally disabled as the result of the performance of his official duties as a member of a police or fire department of a municipal corporation or a fire department of a township shall be paid annual disability benefits until death, payable in twelve monthly installments, in an amount equal to seventy-two percent of his annual salary for the last year he was in the active service of such police or fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">\u201c(3) A member of the fund who is partially disabled as a result of the performance of his official duties as a member of a police or fire department of a municipal corporation or a fire department of a township shall, if such disability prevents him from performing those duties and impairs his earning capacity, receive annual disability benefits, payable in twelve monthly installments, in an amount to be fixed by the board. * * * [B]ut in no event shall a benefit paid to such member exceed sixty percent of his average annual salary. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">There appears to be no definition of \u201cpartial disability,\u201d although presumably it is a disability which is not total, as defined by R.C. 742.01(F), which prevents the member from performing his duties as a member of the police or fire department and which impairs his earning capacity. Arguably, it also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>includes \u201ctotal disability\u201d if such total disability is not permanent as defined by R.C. 742.01(G). Here, there is no contention made that relator\u2019s disability is not permanent, but it was found not to be total by the implication from the two decisions of the board of trustees. Nor does there appear to be any dispute but that relator\u2019s disability (whether total or partial) is a result of performance of his official duties and prevents him from performing those duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Unfortunately, the evidence before us and the decision of respondent .board of trustees are not sufficient to permit a determination of the more fundamental merit issue. The decision of respondent\u2019s board failed completely to adhere to any fundamental predicate giving rise to an explanation of either the basis for the decision, the evidence relied upon, or the reasoning utilized in reaching the decision. In <em>Kinsey v. Bd. of Trustees of Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund of Ohio </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 224, 551 N.E.2d 989, syllabus, the Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\u201cIn determining whether a person is totally disabled for purposes of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Disability and Pension Fund of Ohio, the board of trustees of the fund cannot rely upon general statements made by doctors either in a written report or in preprinted forms supplied by the board, which state that a member can engage in \u2018some\u2019 type of gainful employment. The board must state that it considered the member\u2019s training, experience, and accomplishments in determining whether he can engage in other gainful employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The decisions of the board of trustees here fail completely to comport with this requirement of <em>Kinsey. </em>In <em>Kinsey, </em>the Supreme Court found to the effect that the standards for a board decision granting or denying a permanent total disability application are essentially governed by the same rules as applied to decisions of the Industrial Commission. Accordingly, the abuse of discretion or \u201csome evidence\u201d rule is applicable. As in <em>Kinsey, </em>this court is unable to find that the record contains \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the board\u2019s determination that <em>Kinsey </em>is not \u201ctotally disabled,\u201d as defined in R.C. 742.-01(F). Rather, as stated in the opinion in <em>Kinsey, id. </em>at 227, 551 N.E.2d at 993:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">\u201cR.C. 742.01(F) specifically states that a member need not be absolutely helpless in order to qualify for total disability. It also requires that the gainful occupations available to the claimant are those that are reasonably suitable to the claimant because of his training, experience, and accomplishments. Thus, determining that appellant is qualified to do some kind of work, such as sedentary or nonstressful work, does not necessarily mean that he is not totally disabled for purposes of the Fund. Instead, in order to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>that appellant is not \u2018totally disabled\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 742.01(F), there must be \u2018some evidence\u2019 in the record that the gainful occupation he can engage in, after his disability, is an occupation for which he is reasonably fitted by way of training, experience, and accomplishments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We are unable to distinguish this case from <em>Kinsey. </em>Although the Supreme Court did not expressly refer to <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, in <em>Kinsey, </em>it would appear that the principles of <em>Stephenson </em>are also applicable to decisions of respondent board of trustees since the gist of the <em>Kinsey </em>decision is that nonmedical factors must be considered by the board in determining total disability applications, although perhaps the nature of the nonmedical factors may vary in police and firemen disability cases. Subsequent to the decision in <em>Kinsey, </em>the Supreme Court decided the case of <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, the syllabus of which states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\u201cIn any order of the Industrial Commission granting or denying benefits to a claimant, the commission must specifically state what evidence has been relied upon, and briefly explain the reasoning for its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We find no reason for the same principle not to apply to decisions of respondent\u2019s board of trustees. As stated in <em>Noll </em>at 206, 567 N.E.2d at 248-249, respect to the Industrial Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\u201cThe time has come for the commission to recognize its responsibility to prepare fact-specific orders which will be meaningful upon review. It is well-settled that the commission has the exclusive authority to determine disputed facts and weight of the evidence. * * * However, a meaningful review can be accomplished only if the commission prepares orders on a case-by-case basis which are fact-specific and which contain reasons explaining its decisions. * * * Such order must specifically state what evidence has been relied upon to reach its conclusion and, most important, briefly explain the basis of its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">From the evidence before us, we are completely \u201cin the dark\u201d as to any reason for denial of relator\u2019s application for total disability retirement. Nothing in the respondent\u2019s board of trustee\u2019s decision gives any illumination upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">As a result, relator contends that this court should grant a writ ordering the respondent Fund to grant him total disability retirement. Again, we are unable to distinguish <em>Kinsey, supra, </em>in which a similar contention was made. In <em>Kinsey </em>at 227, 551 N.E.2d at 993-994, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u201cHowever, a lack of some evidence to support the board\u2019s finding that appellant is partially disabled does not necessarily mean there is some evidence to support a finding that he is totally disabled. As stated in <em>State, ex rel Lampkins, v. Dayton Malleable </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 16-17, 542 N.E.2d 1105, 1108, \u2018 * * * a lack of evidence supporting a denial of * * * benefits cannot automatically translate into some evidence supporting an award of such benefits.\u2019 This court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the board, which has much discretion in these matters. * * * \u201d Accordingly, the appropriate writ is a so-called \u201climited writ\u201d ordering the Fund to vacate its board\u2019s present order and to enter a new order, either granting or denying the application, complying with the requirements of <em>Kinsey </em>and those we have set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">For the foregoing reasons, a writ of mandamus will issue, ordering respondent Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability <em>&amp; </em>Pension Fund (1) to vacate its board of trustees\u2019 order denying relator\u2019s application for permanent and total disability compensation and granting only partial disability benefits; (2) to enter a new order either granting permanent and total disability compensation, or partial disability compensation, as the board finds supported by the evidence; and (3) to state in such order the basis and reasoning for the decision and the evidence relied upon, including a statement of the nature of the consideration of the relator\u2019s training, experience, and accomplishments in determining whether he can engage in gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\n<em>Limited writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b700-7\">McCormac and Peggy Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
