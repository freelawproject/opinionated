We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">On April 13, 1990, Lewis drove to the home of Lee Lake to purchase eggs. Not finding anyone on the side porch where the eggs were sold, Lewis entered Lake\u2019s home through an unlocked door. Once inside the Lake home, Lewis saw Lake\u2019s checkbook, picked it up, and put it in his pocket. Sometime later, Lewis\u2019 parents found Lake\u2019s checkbook and turned it in to the sheriff\u2019s department.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Weeks later Lewis was arrested one night for disorderly intoxication. The next morning, Lewis gave officers a written statement and made several incriminating oral statements concerning the events of April 13, 1990. Although an officer read Lewis his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Lewis later claimed that he did not understand them and did not voluntarily waive them because he was still intoxicated. He stated that after he sobered up he had no memory of making those statements. Lewis moved to suppress those statements and a hearing was held on July 23, 1990. The trial court overruled Lewis\u2019 motion and the matter went to jury trial on July 26, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">At trial Lewis testified that he went to the Lake residence to buy eggs, and did not enter Lake\u2019s house with the intent to steal anything. The court stated that it intended to instruct the jury that the purpose to commit a theft may be formed while a trespass was in progress and need not be fashioned prior to the trespass. In its charge to the jury the court defined \u201cforce\u201d as \u201c * * * any <em>effort, </em>compulsion, or constraint exerted or used against a thing to gain entrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty and Lewis was sentenced to an indefinite term of six to twenty-five years in the Ohio Reformatory. Lewis appeals and assigns four errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred by admitting into evidence written and oral statements that defendant made to law enforcement officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Lewis asserts that the trial court should have suppressed the oral and written statements he gave to the officers because he did not give them voluntarily. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In a hearing on a motion to suppress, the prosecution has the burden to prove that a defendant\u2019s statements were voluntarily given. <em>State v. Garcia </em>(1986), 32 Ohio App.3d 38, 513 N.E.2d 1350. In order for a court to determine if a defendant\u2019s statement was voluntarily given a court must look at the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Arrington </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 111, 14 OBR 125, 470 N.E.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In making such a determination a court is granted broad discretion. It is the function of the court as the trier of fact to assess the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. Scott </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 155, 15 O.O.3d 182, 400 N.E.2d 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Below, the court heard testimony from Officer Ramey, who questioned Lewis and took his statements. Ramey stated that he read Lewis his <em>Miranda </em>rights from the waiver of rights form. He also testified that he allowed Lewis to read the form himself. Ramey testified that Lewis indicated that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time that he made the statements. Ramey also testified that based on Lewis\u2019 demeanor he did not believe that Lewis was under the influence at the time of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Lewis\u2019 testimony differed significantly from Ramey\u2019s. Lewis testified at the suppression hearing that he was so intoxicated that he did not even remember making a statement and did not know that he had made one until the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The trial court could not believe both Ramey and Lewis, but, pursuant to <em>Scott, </em>assessed the credibility of the witnesses and found Ramey\u2019s testimony more credible. We cannot hold that such a finding is not justified by the record. Here, Lewis\u2019 first assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that the purpose to commit a theft offense could be formed after a trespass by force had occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Appellee contends that the trial court did not err in ruling that the purpose to commit a theft offense could be formed after a trespass had occurred. Appellee relies on <em>State v. Jones </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 20, 2 OBR 21, 440 N.E.2d 580. We find appellee\u2019s reliance to be misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">R.C. 2911.11 defines \u201caggravated burglary\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">\u201cNo person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure, as defined in section 2902.01 of the Revised Code, or in a separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>secured or separately occupied portion thereof, with purpose to commit therein any theft offense * *</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The statutory language above clearly indicates that the trespass in an occupied structure must be contemporaneous with the purpose to commit a theft offense. The legislature could have provided that where an individual trespasses first and then decides to commit a theft, it would be included under the aggravated burglary statute, but it did not. To interpret this statute to hold that it did is an affront to the constitutional power of the legislature to decide which acts shall be crimes, and which acts shall be more serious or less serious crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In <em>Jones, </em>the First District Court of Appeals interpreted the breaking and entering statute, which also requires a trespass with the purpose to commit a felony, as allowing for an individual to form an intent after the trespass had taken place. We are not persuaded by the First District\u2019s reasoning in <em>Jones. </em>Rather, we believe that the legislature\u2019s intent in creating R.C. 2911.11 is clear. The purpose to commit a felony must exist at the initial trespass to support an aggravated burglary charge. See <em>State v. Magnuson </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 21, 2 OBR 23, 440 N.E.2d 581; <em>State v. Barksdale </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 126, 2 OBR 675, 443 N.E.2d 501; <em>State v. Canitia </em>(Jan. 19, 1984), Cuyahoga App. No. 46946, unreported, 1984 WL 14176.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">There is no question that the legislature could have included those situations where the intent is formed after the trespass. However, where the legislature says aggravated burglary shall be trespass with intent, a court may not say that trespass without intent is also aggravated burglary. A court may not, under the guise of construction, eliminate a distinction the legislature has created in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Let us suppose that the legislature wanted to differentiate between trespass with intent and trespass without intent. How else could the legislature express this difference except by using the very language of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Thus, we find that the trial court erred in ruling that a court may find an individual guilty of aggravated burglary even if the purpose to commit a theft offense was formed after the initial trespass had occurred. Lewis\u2019 second assignment of error is well taken and is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in instructing the jury that \u2018force means any effort, compulsion, or constraint exerted or used against a thing to gain entrance.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>R.C. 2901.01(A) defines \u201cforce\u201d as \u201cany violence, compulsion or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The court below instructed the jury that \u201cforce\u201d was \u201cany <em>effort, </em>compulsion or constraint exerted or used against a thing to gain entrance.\u201d Instructions to a jury must be a correct statement of the law. See, generally, <em>Cincinnati v. Epperson </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 59, 49 O.O.2d 342, 253 N.E.2d 785; <em>State v. Theuring </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 152, 546 N.E.2d 436. The trial court erred in its instruction since \u201ceffort\u201d is not contained in the statutory definition of \u201cforce\u201d and was not a correct statement of the law. Lewis\u2019 third assignment of error appears to this writer to be well taken. However, the reader is directed to read the attached concurring and dissenting opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u201cThe verdict was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In reviewing a claim that a jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, or that the evidence was insufficient, a reviewing court\u2019s duty is to review the record to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 528 N.E.2d 523. It is fundamental that the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of facts. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 79, 24 O.O.3d 150, 434 N.E.2d 1356. Below, the state presented testimony and Lewis took the stand in his own defense. The jury was in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Thus, we will defer to the jury\u2019s ability to assess the credibility of the witnesses and to weigh the evidence. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury below. Lewis\u2019 fourth assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">As noted above, assignment of error three is found to be not well taken by a' majority of the court and therefore is overruled. Based on our ruling on Lewis\u2019 second assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b555-11\">Harsha and Abele, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b555-12\">Harsha, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFc\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">I concur with the principal opinion\u2019s disposition of assignments one, two and four. However, I concur with Judge Abele\u2019s opinion and disposition of assignment three.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Peter B. Abele, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AET\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I respectfully dissent with respect to appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. See <em>State v. Lane </em>(1976), 50 Ohio App.2d 41, 4 O.O.3d 24, 361 N.E.2d 535, and <em>State v. Dye </em>(June 26, 1986), Ross App. No. 1117, unreported, 1986 WL 7246.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">I concur in the judgment and opinion with respect to appellant\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error. I write separately to further discuss appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">I agree with the majority opinion that R.C. 2911.11 requires that the trespass in an occupied structure must be contemporaneous with the purpose to commit the theft offense. In other words, under R.C. 2911.11 a defendant must have formed his purpose to commit a theft offense before he commits the trespass. Although there are divergent views on this issue, I agree with the majority opinion and the cases cited therein in support of this interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Some jurisdictions need not address this issue. For example, the Texas burglary statute expressly provides that the commission of a felony offense or a theft offense within a \u201cbuilding or habitation\u201d constitutes the crime of burglary. Vernon\u2019s Tex.Code Ann., Penal Code, Section 30.02 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">\u201cBurglary</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u201c(a) A person commits an offense if, without the effective consent of the owner, he:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\"><em>(t </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">\u201c(3) <em>enters a building or habitation and commits or attempts to commit a felony or theft. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Thus, the Texas statute does not contain an element requiring that an offender must have formed his purpose to commit the offense before he commits the trespass.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
