Merritt, Canton Township Zoning Inspector, appeal the judgment entered in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas reversing the decision of the Canton Township Board of Zoning Appeals. Appellants assign as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">Assignment of Error No. I</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">\u201cThe trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the administrative agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">Assignment of Error No. II</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying the Canton Township Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019 motion to dismiss appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">Assignment of Error No. Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding the structure at issue not to be a house-trailer as defined by the Canton Township Zoning Resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Assignment of Error No. IV</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying the Canton Township Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019 motion to dismiss Midwest as a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">On November 9, 1990, James A. Enberg and Debra L. Kieffer (\u201cEnberg and Kieffer\u201d) purchased a HUD-certified manufactured sectional home from Midwest Brokering, Inc., d.b.a. Midwest Manufactured Homes (\u201cMidwest\u201d). On November 15, 1990, Enberg and Kieffer applied to the Canton Township Zoning Inspector for a zoning certificate which would permit them to place the sectional home on their property located at 4529 Lincoln Street, East, in Canton Township. The zoning inspector denied the application, claiming the sectional home was considered a \u201chouse trailer\u201d as defined by the Canton Township Zoning Resolution. The zoning board of appeals affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The zoning resolution defined \u201chouse trailer\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\u201cA self-propelled or nonself-propelled vehicle so designed, constructed or added to or by means of accessories in such manner as will permit the use and occupancy therein for human habitation whether resting on wheels, jacks or other foundation and as a conveyance upon public highways, or of being conveyed upon public highways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">In reaching its decision, the board of zoning appeals focused on the evidence that the sectional home would be transported by truck over public highways on wheels and axles to Enberg and Kieffer\u2019s property. Once on the property, the undercarriage transporting the structure would be driven over cement block piers and the tow vehicle, running gear and hitch would then be removed. The sectional home would thereafter \u201crest\u201d on top of those piers and would subsequently be \u201ctied down to the property and bolted together.\u201d The extra I-beams specifically provided for transportation support would not be removed from the sectional home, thereby making it possible for the running gear and hitch, used to transport the structure, to be reattached at a future date.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Kieffer and Enberg explained that the sectional home would be permanently affixed on a crawl space-type foundation thirty-six inches deep in the ground. The sectional home would measure twenty-eight by sixty feet, and consist of three bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, living room, family room, dining room, and . laundry room. The dwelling would have a pitched, shingled roof, regular house-like windows, outside walls, vinyl siding, brick facing and a garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Midwest, and not Enberg and Kieffer, appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Stark County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 2506.01. Midwest subsequently dismissed the appeal prior to the court\u2019s hearing same.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On July 12, 1991, Enberg and Kieffer again applied to the zoning inspector for a zoning certificate to place the sectional home on their property. The zoning inspector and the zoning board again denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Enberg, Kieffer, and Midwest filed a timely notice of appeal from the board\u2019s decision to the common pleas court, which reversed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Through their first assignment, appellants maintain that the common pleas court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the administrative agency. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">In its decision, the court explained its limited power of review pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506 and quoted the following passage from <em>Dudukovich v. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 207, 12 O.O.3d 198, 201, 389 N.E.2d 1113, 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">\u201cThus, it is quite evident that the Court of Common Pleas must weigh the evidence in the record * * * to determine whether there exists a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support the agency decision. We caution, however, to add that this does not mean that the court may blatantly substitute its judgment for that of the agency, especially in areas of administrative expertise. The key term is \u2018preponderance.\u2019 If a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence exists, the Court of Common Pleas must affirm the agency decision; if it did not exist, the court may reverse, vacate, modify or remand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Upon review of the court\u2019s judgment, we believe it applied the proper standard of review and did not substitute its judgment for that of the zoning board of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Accordingly, we overrule appellants\u2019 first assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">Appellants maintain through their second assignment that the common pleas court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second appeal on the grounds of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">It is appellants\u2019 position that Enberg and Kieffer\u2019s failure to prosecute a timely appeal from the zoning board\u2019s first denial of a zoning certificate barred them from reapplying for a new zoning certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Appellants\u2019 affirmative defense of <em>res judicata </em>was waived by their failure to raise same at the administrative level. Therefore, the common pleas court properly overruled appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss where, as here, the affirmative defense of <em>res judicata </em>was first raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Through the third assignment, appellants maintain the common pleas court erred in determining the sectional home in question was not a \u201chouse trailer\u201d as defined by the Canton Township zoning resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Here, the common pleas court determined that the preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence did not support the zoning board\u2019s decision that the sectional home in question was a \u201chouse trailer.\u201d Instead, the court concluded from all the evidence that while the sectional home was \u201cmobile\u201d for the limited purpose of transporting same to Enberg and Kieffer\u2019s land, it lost that mobility and became a permanent structure once it was affixed to its permanent foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Our role in reviewing the lower court\u2019s decision is limited, not to the weight of the evidence, but to whether, as a matter of law, we can find there did exist a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support appellants\u2019 decision that the sectional home in question was a \u201chouse trailer.\u201d See <em>Dudukovich, </em>supra, at 208, 12 O.O.3d at 202, 389 N.E.2d at 1117. If we so find, we must reverse the judgment entered in the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Having examined the record, we conclude there did not, as a matter of law, exist a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support appellants\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Accordingly, we overrule appellants\u2019 third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">Through the final assignment, appellants maintain the common pleas court erred in denying their motion to dismiss Midwest as a party. Appellants opine that Midwest did not have standing to appeal the board\u2019s decision to the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Midwest\u2019s interests in the outcome of this case are well demonstrated in the record. However, the issue of whether Midwest, as the manufacturer of the sectional home, would <em>by itself </em>have standing to prosecute an appeal of the zoning board\u2019s decision is not before us. Here, the property owners, Enberg and Kieffer, were joined by Midwest in prosecuting the appeal from the zoning board\u2019s decision. As such, a ruling by this court as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Midwest, by itself, had standing to prosecute the instant appeal would be in essence an advisory opinion for which we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Accordingly, we determine the issue raised in this assignment to be moot and overrule same.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment entered in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b865-8\">William B. Hoffman and Smart, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
