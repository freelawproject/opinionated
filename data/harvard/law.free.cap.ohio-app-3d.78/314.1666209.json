We dismissed that appeal (CA 11558) for lack of an appealable order. The Supreme Court of Ohio declined to consider our action.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">CMC next sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial court from enforcing its order that CMC turn over the incident report to plaintiffs. We granted the writ. <em>State ex rel. Children\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Brown </em>(April 12, 1990), Montgomery App. No. 11638, unreported, 1990 WL 341682. The Supreme Court reversed on the basis that we lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ. <em>State ex rel. Children\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Brown </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 194, 571 N.E.2d 724. The Supreme Court did not address the merits of the controversy, <em>i.e., </em>whether the incident report is, as asserted by CMC, absolutely privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">The action of the Supreme Court had the effect of reinstating the April 17, 1989 order of the trial court that CMC disclose the incident report to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs moved to compel and CMC responded with a motion that the trial court reconsider its order of April 17, 1989, and for a protective order barring disclosure. Attached to CMC\u2019s motion were, <em>inter alia, </em>a copy of this court\u2019s decision and entry of judgment in the prohibition action, and a copy of the transcript of proceedings (including testimony and exhibits) before this court on January 5, 1990. The trial court sustained plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel and overruled CMC\u2019s motions for reconsideration and for a protective order, and ordered CMC to turn over the report within ten days or suffer appropriate sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">CMC appealed, and plaintiffs moved to dismiss for want of a final appeal-able order. Having had second thoughts about the wisdom of our dismissal of CMC\u2019s appeal from the April 17, 1989 order (CA 11558), we overruled the motion to dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>In this appeal, CMC advances two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>First Assignment Of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in its September 27, 1991 decision and order compelling production of a written communication which is absolutely protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege and where compelled disclosure on the pain of sanction will create irreparable harm which CMC cannot correct by appeal in the normal course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>Second Assignment Of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in its September 27, 1991 decision and order compelling production of a written communication absolutely protected from discovery under the quality assurance privilege and where compelled disclosure on pain of sanction will create irreparable harm which CMC cannot correct by appeal in the normal course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Prior to the first appeal, the trial court submitted the privilege issue to its arbitrator for report and recommendation. CMC claimed that the incident report was privileged as an attorney-client communication, R.C. 2317.02(A), and as a report made available to a quality assurance committee, R.C. 2305.24 and 2305.251. (The latter privilege is also referred to as the \u201cpeer review\u201d privilege.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Other than the incident report itself, which the arbitrator examined <em>in camera, </em>the only evidence before the arbitrator was the October 12, 1988 affidavit of Frederick N. Young, which stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u201c1. I am an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">\u201c2. I serve as counsel to Children\u2019s Medical Center and have served as counsel to Children\u2019s Medical Center for 23 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\u201c3. Incident reports are prepared by Children\u2019s Medical Center for two (2) purposes. First, the incident report is prepared for my review, as legal counsel. I review incident reports on a routine basis in order to determine any potential legal liability for the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">\u201c4. In addition, the incident reports are prepared in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 2305.25 and 2305.251. Copies of the incident reports are forwarded to the Quality Assurance Committee for Children\u2019s Medical Center for their review.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">\u201c5. The purpose of the Quality Assurance Committee for Children\u2019s Medical Center is to review performance of physicians and employees of Children\u2019s Medical Center to assure that Children\u2019s Medical Center provides its patients with consistent high quality medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201c6. The incident reports are prepared for no other purpose other than what has been set forth here in this affidavit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The arbitrator recommended disclosure. CMC\u2019s objections to the recommendation contained an additional affidavit from Mr. Young, dated March 17, 1989:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u201c1. In addition to serving as counsel to Children\u2019s Medical Center, I have also been a member of Children\u2019s Medical Center\u2019s Quality Assurance Committee since January, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u201c2. I was a member of the Quality Assurance Committee on the date the incident report concerning Jacqueline Ware was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u201c3. Incident reports that are prepared by Children\u2019s Medical Center are placed under the exclusive custody and control of a member of the Quality Assurance Committee and are not available to anyone other than committee members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The trial court overruled the objections and ordered disclosure of the incident report, precipitating CMC\u2019s first appeal and the prohibition proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The only additional evidence before the trial court in connection with plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel and CMC\u2019s motions for reconsideration and for protective order was the testimony and exhibits presented to this court in the prohibition proceedings, which essentially reiterated, and expanded upon, the information contained in the affidavits of Young that were before the trial court prior to its April 17, 1989 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">In its decision in connection with the order now on appeal, the trial court incorporated \u201cJudge Brown\u2019s Decision of April 17, 1989.\u201d The April 17, 1989 decision and order had, in part, overruled CMC\u2019s objections to the arbitrator\u2019s recommendation that the incident report be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">The arbitrator rejected CMC\u2019s claim of attorney-client privilege by treating it as a claim of \u201cwork product\u201d privilege, which it was not, and determining that if it was work product, which the arbitrator thought dubious, plaintiffs had demonstrated \u201cgood cause\u201d for its disclosure. The arbitrator rejected the claim of \u201cpeer review\u201d privilege by determining that the incident report was \u201ca record otherwise available from original sources,\u201d citing R.C. 2305.251. The trial court\u2019s decision of April 17, 1989 appears to approve the arbitrator\u2019s reasoning. In its decision made in connection with the order now on appeal, the trial court, in addition to incorporating the decision of April 17, 1989, noted with respect to CMC\u2019s claim of attorney-client privilege that plaintiffs were not seeking to compel the testimony of Young or the production of anything in his files, citing R.C. 2317.02(A). The trial court also observed that R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>2305.24 and 2305.251 \u201cdo not make hospital records confidential in the hands of the hospital as such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In issuing the writ of prohibition in CA 11638, we concluded on the basis of our findings of fact that the incident report was absolutely privileged both as an attorney-client communication, R.C. 2317.02(A), and as a report made available to a \u201cutilization\u201d committee, R.C. 2305.24. <em>State ex rel. Children\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Brown, supra, </em>at 4. Although the evidence in the prohibition proceeding was presented to the trial court in connection with CMC\u2019s motion for reconsideration and for protective order, we believe that the incident report and the unrebutted affidavits of Young, standing alone, established CMC\u2019s entitlement to the protection of both privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The trial court and its arbitrator did not directly address the claim of attorney-client privilege in connection with the April 17, 1989 order to disclose. Rather, the trial court treated it as a claim of \u201cwork product\u201d privilege. In connection with the order now on appeal, the trial court did directly address the claim of attorney-client privilege and rejected it because plaintiffs were not seeking to compel disclosure or testimony from Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Although a literal reading of R.C. 2317.02(A) lends support to the trial court\u2019s rationale, the Supreme Court of Ohio has interpreted the predecessor of R.C. 2317.02(A), the language of which was identical to that of the present statute, as extending the privilege to the communication itself. In other words, the privilege insulates the communication itself from disclosure, either by the attorney or the client. <em>In re Klemann </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 187, 5 N.E.2d 492. See, also, <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 383, at 395-396, 101 S.Ct. 677, at 685-686, 66 L.Ed.2d 584, at 594-595; <em>Woodruff v. Concord City Discount Clothing Store </em>(Feb. 19,1987), Montgomery App. No. 10072, unreported, 1987 WL 6827. Nor did the incident report and the unrebutted affidavits of Young support the determination that the incident report was \u201ca record otherwise available from original sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Plaintiffs contend that because the incident report relates to the care and treatment of Jacqueline Ware, its content should be contained in her medical records and, thus, it cannot qualify for protection under either claimed privilege. We considered this contention in the prohibition proceedings in CA 11638:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u201cIntervenor Ware argues that because the incident report pertains to her care and treatment, it <em>ipso facto </em>cannot be subject either to the attorney-client privilege or the peer review privilege. This argument is based on the contention that the patient has the absolute right to access to her medical records, that if the incident relates to her care and treatment, then it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>be in her medical records, and because it should be in her medical records, it cannot be subject to the attorney-client privilege, and is perforce a record \u2018otherwise available from original sources/ and hence not subject to the peer review privilege, per R.C. 2305.251.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u201cThe evidence established that all information relating to the care and treatment of the patient goes into the CMC medical record, and that the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation requires that all information relating to care and treatment go into the medical record. The fact that the incident report may relate to the care and treatment of the patient does not alter its status as a privileged communication, if it otherwise qualifies as a privileged communication. Thus, the incident report is still an attorney-client communication, and it is simply not \u2018otherwise available from original sources\u2019 even though the same information ought to be in the patient\u2019s medical report.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Children\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Brown, supra, </em>at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In our judgment, the trial court erred in its determination that the incident report is not privileged. The assignments of error are sustained. The order of disclosure will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-8\">Fain and Wilson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
