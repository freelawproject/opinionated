Section 163.53 for reimbursement of moving costs incurred in relocation are subject to the mechanic\u2019s lien statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Third assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">\u201cThe Gallia County Court of Common Pleas erred when it issued an <em>ex parte </em>order directing the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation to release funds based upon a lien of questionable validity without prior notice or opportunity to respond, as is called for under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">Fourth assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">\u201cThe Gallia County Court of Common Pleas erred when it concluded that failure to strictly comply with the notice requirements found in R.C. Section 1311.31 entitled appellee to an automatic <em>ex parte </em>order releasing funds to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">Fifth assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">\u201cThe Gallia County Court of Common Pleas erred when it ordered the Ohio Department of Transportation to release $185,000.00 to appellee based on a purported lien claim, when the Ohio Department of Transportation only had $150,000.00 still due and owing the relocatee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>A review of the record reveals the following facts pertinent to this appeal. In July 1990, the Ohio Department of Transportation (\u201cODOT\u201d) appropriated various parcels of real property in Gallia County, Ohio in order to make highway improvements. The appropriated property is adjacent to State Route 35. One parcel of property belonged to John Mathews. Mathews operated an automobile parts lot and a junk yard under the name \u201cAbies Auto System, Inc.\u201d (\u201cAbies\u201d) on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">ODOT determined that Abies qualified, pursuant to R.C. 163.53 <em>et seq., </em>for relocation assistance, and ODOT agreed to pay the expense of relocating the business. On August 7, 1990, Abies and ODOT executed an agreement regarding the amount of relocation assistance benefits for Abies.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">On March 20, 1991, appellee filed a \u201cPetition for Money Had and Received; Release of Detained Funds Pursuant to Ohio R.C. Section 1311.28\u201d in the Gallia County Common Pleas Court. Appellee alleged he performed the relocation service for Abies and alleged \u201call necessary requirements to effect a lien on public funds as mandated by R.C. 1311.26 have been met.\u201d Apparently, appellee performed the relocation service and did not receive payment from ODOT or Abies.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On the same day appellee filed his petition, the court issued an order granting appellee\u2019s request and requiring ODOT to release $185,000 to appellee within ten days. The court wrote in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u201cIt is ORDERED that funds detained by the Department of Transportation, pursuant to Revised Code 1311.28, and as directed by petitioner\u2019s Affidavit/Statement Under Oath for Lien on Public Funds, specifically $185,000.00, be released to Landis K. \u2018Pat\u2019 Wandling, d/b/a P &amp; A Enterprises, as further set forth in Revised Code 1311.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u201cIt is also ORDERED that since no compensation has been received by the lien claimant/petitioner herein for the past six months of concerted labor and labor services, that the release of funds be made immediatedly <em>\\sic\\ </em>and that the appropriate check be made special for issuance within ten (10) days hereof. The check shall have as the payee, Anthony D. Cennamo, for P &amp; A Enterprises, and mailed directly to the given address below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">After learning of the trial court\u2019s March 20, 1991 order, appellant filed a motion to vacate the order. The trial court conducted a hearing to consider appellant\u2019s motion, and on April 5, 1991, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the March 20, 1991 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">In its first assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Appellant argues the only manner in which funds may be released from ODOT is through the director of that administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>department and any action involving the director of ODOT must be brought in Franklin County, Ohio. See R.C. 121.02(D); 5501.02; and 5501.22.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Appellee maintains the Gallia County Court of Common Pleas is \u201cthe court of competent jurisdiction being situated in the county wherein the property resides.\u201d Appellee contends the trial court\u2019s judgment was \u201cnot to the Director, [i.e.] the Court Order was to the Public Authority.\u201d See R.C. 1311.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">After a review of the foregoing, we find the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter the March 20, 1991 judgment. R.C. 5501.22 requires that actions against the Director of Transportation shall be brought in Franklin County, unless one of the exceptions delineated in the statute is applicable. See, generally, <em>Sarkies v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 166, 12 O.O.3d 174, 389 N.E.2d 491. We note that the version of R.C. 1311.32<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in effect at the time of the proceeding below provides that the duty to pay lien claimants may be enforced by an action in mandamus and that actions against state officers <em>shall </em>be brought only in Franklin County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">A judgment rendered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is void <em>ab initio. Patton v. Diemer </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 68, 518 N.E.2d 941, paragraph three of the syllabus. Moreover, subject matter jurisdiction may not be conferred upon the court by agreement of the parties, may not be waived, and is the basis for mandatory <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal. <em>State ex rel. Lawrence Dev. Co. v. Weir </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 96, 11 OBR 148, 463 N.E.2d 398. If a court which has no subject matter jurisdiction enters judgment, the judgment is void; it is as though the proceedings never occurred. The judgment is a mere nullity and is subject to vacation through the inherent powers possessed by the courts of Ohio. <em>Patton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s March 20, 1991 judgment. The judgment is void <em>ab initio </em>and must be set aside. Further, inasmuch as the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment, the remaining assignments of error are, pursuant to App.R. 12(A), overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-6\">Stephenson, P.J., Grey and Peter B. Abele, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\">. R.C. 5501.02 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\"All duties, powers, and functions conferred by law on the department of transportation and the divisions of the department shall be performed under such rules as the director of transportation may prescribe, and shall be under his control. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">R.C. 5501.22 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">\"The director of transportation shall not be suable, either as a sole defendant or jointly with other defendants, in any court outside Franklin county except in actions brought by a railroad company under section 4957.30 of the Revised Code, or by a property owner to prevent the taking of property without due process of law, in which case suit may be brought in the county where such property is situated, or in any action otherwise specifically provided for in Chapterfs] 5501 * * * of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-12\">.
