Roberts was granted legal custody of the minor child, Michelle Devlin, born January 8, 1976, pursuant to a decree of divorce dated February 14, 1980, in the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations. Michelle was truant from Indianola Middle School in Columbus, Ohio, from May 24, 1991 through the remaining school year. Appellant, whose residence is in Columbus, Ohio, was notified by the Columbus Police Department that Michelle was at her father\u2019s home in Zanesville, Ohio, and that the father refused to return Michelle to appellant\u2019s residence. The record reveals that the child, Michelle, has admitted in court to the charge of unruliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Appellant sets forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\u201c1. Appellant states that the trial court erred when it determined that appellee\u2019s (the minor child, Michelle Devlin), legal residence was located in Muskingum County and not in Franklin County, which resulted in the court\u2019s subsequent transfer of the matter to Muskingum County for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in granting temporary custody pending disposition to the father, when the mother (appellant) had custody pursuant to a decree of divorce, without a finding of the custodial parent\u2019s unsuitability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">We cannot address the merits of the assignments of error because we do not have jurisdiction over this case. Pursuant to R.C. 2501.02, a court of appeals has jurisdiction of judgments or final orders of courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district. R.C. 2505.02 defines \u201cfinal order\u201d in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">\u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">The first assignment of error concerns the trial court\u2019s order transferring jurisdiction to the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas. The Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas has not accepted or rejected the case and, therefore, no transfer of jurisdiction has occurred yet and it is not a final order. The second assignment of error concerns a temporary custody order. Orders of an interlocutory or temporary nature do not constitute final orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Because we find no final appealable order, we dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b577-5\">Petree and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b577-6\">Dean Strausbaugh, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, was assigned to active duty under authority of Section 6(C), Article IV, Ohio Constitution.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
