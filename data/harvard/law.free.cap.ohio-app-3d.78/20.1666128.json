It is from this order that appellants seek our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">We note from the outset that appellee\u2019s injunctive action filed in the court of common pleas was the appropriate proceeding to prohibit or prevent appellants from placing on the election ballot the referendum in question. <em>State ex rel. Stanley v. Bernon </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 204, 187 N.E. 733; <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Hummel </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 341, 32 O.O. 416, 66 N.E.2d 111; <em>State ex rel. Newell v. Brown </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 147, 54 O.O. 392, 122 N.E.2d 105; <em>State ex rel. Graham v. Bd. of Elections </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 123, 125, 14 O.O.3d 349, 350, 397 N.E.2d 1204, 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">However, we find appellants lack standing as a real party in interest in pursuing the within appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">A \u201creal party in interest\u201d has been defined, among other ways, as \u201ca party who is benefited or injured by a judgment in the case.\u201d <em>In re Highland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Holiday Subdivision </em>(1971), 27 Ohio App.2d 237, 240, 56 O.O.2d 404, 406, 273 N.E.2d 903, 905. Appellants have failed to demonstrate how they were adversely affected or aggrieved by the judgment appealed from. Indeed, appellants have no legal interest in the outcome of this appeal and \u201cno duty to themselves or to the public to persuade this court that their view\u201d of the validity and sufficiency of the petition in question was correct. <em>DeCesare v. Bd. of Elections </em>(1968), 104 R.I. 136, 242 A.2d 421. \u201cTheir position is analogous to that of a probate judge who, as respondent in a petition for mandamus, was held by [the Rhode Island Supreme Court] to have no right of appeal as a person aggrieved by a judgment of the superior court out of which the writ issued.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">A board of elections is a quasi-judicial body charged with impartiality in determining the validity and sufficiency of petitions for zoning referendums. See R.C. 519.12(H). As such, appellants are without authority or right to appeal the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201cOnly in a very few cases has the General Assembly given the right to a board to be a \u2018referee\u2019 and a \u2018litigant\u2019 at the same time.\u201d <em>In re Highland Holiday Subdivision, supra, </em>27 Ohio App.2d at 238, 56 O.O.2d at 405, 273 N.E.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The real party in interest in this appeal would be those petitioners and/or landowners in Canton Township who seek placement of the referendum on the election ballot. Accordingly, there being no real party in interest prosecuting this appeal, we dismiss appellants\u2019 appeal for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">For the foregoing reasons, appellants\u2019 appeal is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-9\">Putman and Milligan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
