It appears that a sale was advertised for the 13th of February, and before the day of sale notice was sent to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that the sale would be postponed to February 15th. To this no objection was made. On the 14th of February the sheriff was served with an order appointing a receiver of the defendant, and enjoining sale on the 15th, and the sale subsequently occurred on February 24th by an order of the supreme court. The keepers of the sheriff were in charge of the property until February 23d, and the amount taxed is the reasonable allowance for such service. We cannot say that any error was committed by the sheriff, and the order appealed from should therefore be affirmed; but, as the amount of the fund realized on the sale is so small, we do not think any costs should be awarded on this appeal to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">HASCALL, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
