So, that the whole amount owed, including the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the first mortgage, the taxes, and the costs and expenses of the foreclosure of both mortgages, will amount to about \u00a728,000. There are also other mortgages upon the premises subsequent to the plaintiffs\u2019. The value of the premises is in dispute. It is shown by the affidavits presented on the part of the plaintiffs to be worth not over \u00a724,000, while by the witnesses produced on the part of the defendants its value is placed at from \u00a731,000 to \u00a734,000. It appears that a short time ago the property was sold for \u00a721,000. The rents, are about \u00a731,000 at the outside. Upon the whole case, I am inclined to think that it is very doubtful whether the premises upon the sale will bring more than the amount of the incumbrances and the taxes which are prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 lien, and the costs and expenses of the foreclosure; and I see no reason, under the circumstances, why the plaintiffs should not have had a receiver, as they ask. The case is within the case of Fletcher v. Krupp, 35 App. Div. 587, 55 N. Y. Supp. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">The order should be reversed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with \u00a710 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
