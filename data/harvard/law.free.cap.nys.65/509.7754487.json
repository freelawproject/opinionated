On cross-examination the witness testified, in substance, that he had no particular remembrance of the condition of the carriage before the accident, and thereupon the defendant moved to strike out the evidence of the witness -as to value, on the ground that it appeared that the witness was not able to state what the condition of the carriage was before the accident. This motion was denied, \u00e1nd the defendant duly excepted. This motion should have been granted. The witness, not knowing the condition of the carriage before the accident, was not able to tell how much it had been injured by the accident. But he had testified that he made certain repairs to the carriage, and the reasonable and fair value of the work he did was $158.70; and therefore the judgment will be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless the respondent consents to a reduction of the verdict to $158.70, in which event the judgment and order appealed from will be affirmed, without costs to either party in this court or in the general term of the city court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
