While it is beyond question that, if plaintiff ultimately prevail against the other two defendants, he might, if the facts so justified him, by proper steps reach the property of appellant, yet he cannot now force a liability not actually arisen nor duly proven against it. We think that upon the close of the case made against the appellant association at the trial it should have received the relief we now conclude it was clearly entitled to receive. Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs and disbursements of trial below and of appeal to this court to the appellant association.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-17\">SCHUCHMAJST, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
