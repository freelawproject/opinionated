The evidence adduced upon the trial does not show that his injuries have affected or will affect to any great extent his earning capacity. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>der such circumstances we think a verdict of $5,000 ought not to stand, and therefore the judgment and order denying a motion for a new trial are reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff will stipulate to reduce the damages recovered <em>to </em>$2,500, and the extra allowance granted to $100, thereby reducing the judgment as entered to the sum of $2,784.06; in which case judgment as so reduced and order denying motion for new trial are affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
