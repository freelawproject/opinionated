We think that the granting of the extra allowance in the manner herein described was within the sound discretion of the court, and was proper. We think, too, that the verdict should not be disturbed, inasmuch as the questions were properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">We do not observe any reversible error committed by the trial justice. Judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">O\u2019DWYER, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
