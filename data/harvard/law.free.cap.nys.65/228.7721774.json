This being an action brought to recover a chattel, the judgment for the plaintiff should award to him the possession of the chattel, or the sum fixed as the value thereof, if possession cannot be procured. Langbein, Law &amp; Frac. N. Y. Dist. Ct. 240. The judgment appealed from was not in the alternative, but it may be modified by providing that plaintiff recover possession of the chattels in suit, and, if delivery thereof cannot be made, then for the sum of $81, the value thereof, with $17.50 costs, and, as so modified, the judgment should be affirmed, without costs. Wolf v. Farley (Com. Pl.) 808, 16 N. Y. Supp. 168.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
