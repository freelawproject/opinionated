Some attempt was made upon the trial to prove that such was the case, but the evidence given was insufficient to establish the fact. Under the decisions of the appellate division in this department, the municipal court has no jurisdiction over a domestic corporation unless its principal place of business is established or-actually located within the city of New York. As jurisdiction must affirmatively appear, the absence of averment and proof of its existence is fatal to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
