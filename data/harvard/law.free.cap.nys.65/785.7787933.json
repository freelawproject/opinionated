This they were not permitted to do at the trial, being prevented from introducing competent proof tending to show such impeachment. If there were no account stated, shown by the plaintiff when he rested, the complaint should have been dismissed. In either event, we think that the def\u00e9ndants were subjected to erroneous rulings at the trial, of sufficient moment to warrant this appeal; and, their right to review being protected by timely exceptions, they should be awarded a reversal-</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">judgment and order denying motion for new trial reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs and disbursements to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
