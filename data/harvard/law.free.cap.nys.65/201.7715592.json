They were acting for the plaintiff corporation, and the competency of their evidence is beyond question. Nor could its force be impaired by disputing the validity of their title to the offices held by them. Indeed, in view of the character of the litigation, it was entirely immaterial whether they were officers of the corporation or not, or, if officers, whether they held by proper title. Abb. Tr. Ev.
