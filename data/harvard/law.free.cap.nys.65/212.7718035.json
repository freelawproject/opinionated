It appears, however, that the tender was not made good by deposit of the money with the clerk of the court. The justice therefore erred in dismissing the complaint. He should, at least, have awarded judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the conceded amount. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
