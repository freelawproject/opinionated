The defendants plead payment, accord and satisfaction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>statute of limitations, and general denial. The summons was issued on December 20, 1898, and was served on December 21, 1898. Upon trial the court dismissed the complaint as to Ray Jaffa, and gave judgment against Henry Jaffa for $51.97 damages, besides costs. The bill of particulars shows many petty items of plumbing work done on various days, beginning May 2, 1891, and ending on December 29, 1892. It appears that the services (many of them being repairs) were such as ordinarily are rendered \"by a plumber to a householder as occasion requires. There is no proof of any agreement as to time of payment, or that the work was performed under a continuous contract. Moreover, it appears that bills for parts of the work were rendered from time to time. The statute of limitations was a bar to all of the items save that of December 29, 1892, unless the defendant had made it unavailable. The learned trial justice held that payment on account had been made within six years, and that therefore the statute did not apply. Even considering the account as a totality, I cannot find any evidence of such payment. The plaintiff, when asked to state what work was done within six years immediately before the commencement of the action, answered: \u201cThe last work done on Mr. Jaffa\u2019s house was on December 29, 1892; repairing leak under sink; two dollars and ninety-eight cents.\u201d When asked on cross-examination whether he remembered the last time a payment was made to him, which, \u201caccording to his bills, was twelve dollars and seven cents,\u201d he answered: \u201cHe [the defendant] paid that in his own rooms after my bookkeeper called at his house a number of times. He paid that to me personally. He'paid it at his rooms, in his house.\u201d This payment is evidently that stated in the last credit on the last bill of particulars, under the date of December 11, 1892. Here is not a balance due upon a mutual, open, and current account, under section 386 of the Code of 'Civil Procedure; for the account consists of but items upon the one side, and of payments upon the other.
