This obligation is not confined to cases of ordinary and gradual decay, but extends toi accidental injuries. Hawkins v. George Ringler &amp; Co., 47 App. Div. 264, 62 N. Y. Supp. 56; Cohn v. Hill, 9 Misc. Rep. 327, 30 N. Y. Supp. 209; Kling v. Dress, 28 N. Y. Super. Ct. 525. It is true that in the cases above cited the lease was in writing, and contained an express covenant on the part of the defendant to surrender the premises at the termination of the lease in as good condition as when leased, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and also to make all necessary repairs during the term; but an implied covenant is of as much binding force and effect as an express covenant. This action is, in effect, an action for waste. In such actions it is well settled that the defendant is liable for waste, although the waste was not committed by him, but by strangers or other persons over whom he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>had no control.
