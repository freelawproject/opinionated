Plaintiff purchased certain furniture for defendant, and procured false bills from the vendor therefor, by which the defendant was required to pay for furniture not received by him. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of the condition of his employment, such as would authorize his discharge from defendant\u2019s employ.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Appeal from municipal court, borough of Manhattan, Seventh district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\">Action by Karl M.

The circumstances connected with the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of furniture for the defendant, and procuring from the vendor false bills, by which the defendant was required to pay for property never received by him, constituted a breach of the. plaintiff\u2019s implied obligation to be faithful and honest in the performance of his duties under the defendant\u2019s, employment. This was such conduct as involved moral turpitude, and was entirely inconsistent with the relation that the plaintiff held to the defendant, and the duties he owed under his employment. It comes precisely within the purview of the condition embraced in the modified contract of employment, and in itself was sufficient to relieve the defendant from all the obligations thereof. Indeed, such conduct, in the absence of the condition, would justify a termination of the employment and a forfeiture of plaintiff\u2019s rights thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The judgment, therefore, should be reversed, with costs to the appellant, and judgment ordered for the defendant, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
