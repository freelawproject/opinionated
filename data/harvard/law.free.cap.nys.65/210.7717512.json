It was shown that one Sol Moses was doing business under the name of Moses Bros.; that he opened an account with the defendant in the latter name, and that at the time of the execution of the assignment below mentioned there was a balance standing to the credit of said account. On the 23d day of December, 1899, Sol Moses made, executed, and delivered to the plaintiff an assignment, in which, after-describing himself as \u201ctrading under the name of Moses Brothers,\u201d he assigns to the plaintiff \u201call the moneys now on deposit standing to my credit in the Bowery Bank, in the borough of Manhattan, city, county, and state of New York.\u201d The assignment further contained a power \u201cto sign, execute, and acknowledge any and all checks, receipts, or other instruments in writing which the said Bowery Bank shall require for the purpose of paying over and delivering to the said Aaron L. Jaffe the said sums of money hereby assigned.\u201d It also appeared that the assignor had no other account with the defendant bank than the one above mentioned. There can be no doubt that the assignment, construed in the light of the surrounding circumstances, was intended to and did transfer to the plaintiff the moneys which were on deposit with the defendant to the credit of \u201cMoses Brothers.\u201d Sol Moses, and he alone, was the depositor, under a description adopted by him for trading purposes, as he himself states in the assignment in question, and as is also shown by the proofs. Moneys then on deposit with the defendant in terms credited to Moses Bros, were, in legal effect, moneys standing to Ms credit. He was the creditor of the bank, and the latter was debtor to him. The plaintiff, having thus acquired title to the moneys in question, presented his assignment to the bank, and demanded payment, which was refused, whereupon this action was brought for the recovery of the debt. Upon the facts as proven, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>necessarily found by the justice in rendering judgment for the plaintiff, we are clearly of the opinion that the plaintiff had a complete cause of action against the bank upon its refusal to pay the money to him. The cause of action was not of an equitable character, and the action was properly brought as one at law. The judgment was right, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
