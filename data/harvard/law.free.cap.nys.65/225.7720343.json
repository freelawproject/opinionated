Lynch, there is sufficient in plaintiff\u2019s proofs to justify the finding that George M. Lynch was at the time acting as the defendant\u2019s agent, and was so regarded by both parties. It was, therefore, error to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. If an agent possessing due authority makes a contract in his own name, his principal, whether known or unknown, may be sued thereon, unless from the attendant circumstances it is the clear intent of the parties that exclusive credit is given to the agent, and that no resort shall in any event be had against the principal. Story, Ag. \u00a7 160a; Coleman v. Bank, 53 N. Y. 393; Hall v. Lauderdale, 46 N. Y. 70. We are aware that a contrary rule was declared in Re Bateman, 7 Misc. Rep. 633, 28 N. Y. Supp. 36, but the statement of the law there made is not in harmony with the authorities. Although that case was affirmed by the court of appeals, the judgment was upheld on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
