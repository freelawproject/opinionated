His contention that the sale was made to another was discredited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>jury. Even though the defendant had, prior to the sales in question, sold the 'Columbus avenue store to his former partner, yet the transaction in question might well have been had as contended for by plaintiff; that is to say, that the goods were sold to defendant, and credit therefor given to him only. We think that the questions in dispute were justly and fairly settled by the jury, and that no . error was committed in the admission or exclusion of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
