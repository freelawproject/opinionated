Trials in the municipal court are conducted the same as in courts of record (Consol. Act, \u00a7 1381), and a justice of the municipal court now has the power possessed by a justice of a court of record with respect to the adjournment of a trial, excepting that the trial of an action cannot be adjourned for a longer period than eight days (Consol. Act, \u00a7 1362), and the trial of a summary proceeding cannot be adjourned for a longer period than ten days (section 2248, Code Civ. Proc.), unless by consent. In Boller V. Mayor, etc., 40 N. Y. Super. Ct. 537, there was an unauthorized adjournment for three weeks, and in Kiernan v. Reming, 7 N. Y. Civ. Proc. R. 311, no answer was interposed, and consequently there was no trial. These cases, therefore, do not uphold appellant\u2019s position. Aberhall v. Roach, 3 E. D. Smith, 345, and the other cases cited by the appellant, are no longer recognized as authorities, owing to the changes which have since taken place in the law governing the municipal court and its procedure. Jourdan v. Healey (Com. Pl.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 240; Goff v. Vedder, 12 Civ. Proc. R. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Final order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
