We must hold, therefore, that the statute of Colorado (Gen. St. \u00a7 270) providing \u201cthat the dissolution of a corporation * * * shall not take away or impair any remedy given against such corporation for liabilities incurred before its dissolution,\u201d does not apply to the case at bar. But section 349, Gen. St. 1883, expressly provides \u201cthe consolidated company shall be responsible for and shall assume and pay all the just liabilities of each of the companies so consolidated,\u201d etc., while section 351 declares \u201csuch * * * consolidation * * * shall not affect suits pending in which such corporations shall be parties, * * * nor shall suits brought against such corporation by its former name be abated.\u201d Thus it would appear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u2022the right of action, if any exist, in favor of the respondent, has by the \u00bfstatutory provision above cited become a liability of the Colorado Fuel <em>&amp; </em>Iron Company, and no longer exists against the defendant appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">\u25a0 It appears that the action was brought some considerable time after the defendant had been merged and consolidated, and was, therefore, not a \u201csuit pending\u201d at the time of merger; and, while the cause of \u00bfaction may not have abated or been lost against the new corporation under section 349, above quoted, yet we conclude that it did not exist \u2022against this defendant when plaintiff brought his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Judgment and order \u00e1ppealed from reversed, with costs of appeal, \u00bfand complaint dismissed, with costs of action to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">CONLAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
