The plaintiff recovered $1,136 for bodily injuries, and for \u201cinjuries to her head and limbs.\u201d She called her sister as a witness. The record shows that counsel for plaintiff put this question: \u201cHas your sister continued to complain of pains in her head ever since the accident up to the present day? (Objected to. Objection overruled. Defendant excepts.) A. Yes, sir.\u201d The question was plainly objectionable, for it called for declarations of a party made subsequent to the injury. Roche v. Railroad Co., 105 N. Y. 294, 11 N. E. 630; Reed v. Railroad Co., 45 N. Y. 574; Olp v. Gardner, 48 Hun, 169; Ryan v. Manufacturing Co., 57 Hun, 253, 10 N. Y. Supp. 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-20\">There is no force in the respondent\u2019s contention that the general objection was insufficient, for if it had been taken, or had been recast in specific terms, there was no way in which the question could have been made admissible. Tozer v. Railroad Co., 105 N. Y. 659, 11 N. E. 846; Silberstein v. Railroad Co., 117 N. Y. 293, 22 N. E. 951; Tooley v. Bacon, 70 N. Y. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-21\">The claim for damages was largely based upon pains in the head and upon mental distress. After the plaintiff, none was called as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>witness save the sister, and the attending physician, whose visits were few. It cannot be assumed that the evidence admitted was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and anew trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
