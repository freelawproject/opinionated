Rohner v. Lenisch, 29 Misc. Rep. 315, 60 N. Y. Supp. 543. It was the law of the case, and should have been followed by the court below. It seems, however, to have been disregarded. The judgment must accordingly be reversed. See, also, Curtiss v. Mott, 90 Hun, 439, 35 N. Y. Supp. 983. As the plaintiff on the new trial which was ordered on the former appeal has had a full opportunity to strengthen his case by additional evidence, and has failed to do so, we are satisfied that it would be futile to order a new trial, and that the complaint should therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
