We are asked to reverse on the ground that the evidence preponderated in favor of the appellants; but under a long line of decisions in the court of common pleas, as well as in this court, such a condition must be obvious and indisputable to justify the appellate court in taking such action,\u2014a situation which does not at all exist in the case at bar. The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-19\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
