Since the appeal was taken, the plaintiff has served upon the defendant a notice that she would produce before this appellate term a certified copy of the certificate, of incorporation of the defendant in order to support the judgment. This the plaintiff had a right to do. It may be that the court could take judicial notice of the fact that the defendant is a domestic corporation, and that its principal place of business is in the city of Hew York, but, in any event, it has frequently been held that an omission in proof of a matter of record may be supplied on appeal to sustain a judgment, when a record cannot be answered or changed.
