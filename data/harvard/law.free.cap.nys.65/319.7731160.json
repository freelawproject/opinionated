The identity of name raises a presumption of identity of person where there is similarity of residence or occupation (Lawson, Pres. Ev. 307), and, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s denial, the question as to the defendant\u2019s identity should have been submitted to the jury. There is sufficient evidence in the record to warrant a verdict for .the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
