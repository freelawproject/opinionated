That the car stopped at Ninety-Eighth street is denied by but one person,\u2014the conductor of the car, who testified that the car had not, to his recollection, stopped at Ninety-Eighth street. The other witnesses would not swear that the car had not stopped at Ninety-Eighth street. The case presented a question of fact for the jury, and, there being evidence to sustain the verdict, the case presents no question of law for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
