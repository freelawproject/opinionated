Upon this question the evidence upon the trial was in conflict, and the chprge of the trial justice, to which there wras no exception, clearly stated the whole case to the jury. In addition to this, the defendant at the close of all the testimony asked the court to submit to the jury this precise question of delivery, and the court acquiesced.\" The jury determined the whole matter in favor of the plaintiff, and we have no inclination to disturb their finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Judgment and order appealed from must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
