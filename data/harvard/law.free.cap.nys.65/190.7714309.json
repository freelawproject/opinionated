J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agh\">Mr. Justice STOVER has written a full and elaborate opinion, hereto appended (60 N. Y. Supp. 357), setting out the\" allegations of the complaint, which allegations need not be repeated here. We concur in Ms conclusions, and in Ms reasons therefor. But, as the appellant\u2019s counsel earnestly argued that the learned justice misconceived the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the action, it is proper that this contention should be considered. He refers to the sentence of the opinion in which it was said \u201cthat the theory of the plaintiff is that by the agreement of May, 1899, the defendant trust company was constituted a trustee for the benefit of the bondholders of the Huntingburg road, and that the Huntingburg bondholders thereby acquired certain vested rights in and to the bonds issued under the agreement, which may be enforced against the trustee and the grantor,\u201d and says that he does not contend that the plaintiff\u2019s right accrued directly from the consolidation agreement, as that was carried out and completed, but out of what was actually done in pursuance of the agreement, viz. the actual delivery of the new bonds to the New York Security &amp; Trust Company for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, and that the security company has no interest in the bonds, except to fulfill its duty as trustee. The justice stated that he based his decision upon \u201ca fundamental ground, going to the very root and core of the plaintiff\u2019s contention, namely, that under the agreement of consolidation no right of action was conferred upon the bondholders of Huntingburg road, and that they were not cestuis que trustent for whom and in whose behalf a court of equity could intervene.\u201d While he did not discuss the effect of the deposit of the bonds with the security company as constituting it a new trustee for the plaintiff, and imposing upon it the duty of delivering to him new bonds in exchange for the old, the question was really involved in his conclusion that the plaintiff acquired no rights, as cestui que trust, to enforce the delivery of the bonds to Mm until all of the provisions of the consolidation agreement as to the entire amount of the bonds had been fulfilled, and the original mortgage on the Huntingburg road had been canceled, and that the trustees of the original mortgage on that road would be necessary parties in an action for that purpose. If the justice\u2019s conclusions are correct, the plaintiff\u2019s right of action must have been derived from and through the consolidation agreement, and the delivery of the bonds to the security company conferred no new right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>upon the plaintiff. It is proper to say that, since the interlocutory judgment was entered in this action, Baker, District Judge, in the United States circuit court, district of Indiana (New York Security &amp; Trust Co. v. Louisville, E. &amp; St. L. Consol. R. Co. [C. C.] 97 Fed. 226), has had the consolidation agreement under consideration, and held that it gave individual holders of bonds of one of the constituent companies no right to compel the delivery to them, severally, of bonds of the consolidated company in exchange for their holdings. His opinion on this subject coincides substantially with the views expressed by Mr. Justice STOVER.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The interlocutory judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
