It appeared, however, that the record of the officer was introduced in evidence and considered as bearing \"upon the question of his guilt. This was improper, and has been condemned by this court and the court of appeals. It is only proper for the commissioners to consider the officer\u2019s record as bearing upon the degree of punishment which they inflict. It cannot be used to determine guilt. Such was the express holding of this court in People .v. York (decided April term, 1900) 64 N. Y. Supp. 2. The record in that case is almost precisely similar to the record in the present case, and, as such, the decision is conclusive of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The proceedings should therefore be annulled, and a new trial ordered before the commissioners, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
