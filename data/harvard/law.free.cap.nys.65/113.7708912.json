The averments contained in the complaint are positive,\u2014nothing being alleged upon information and belief,\u2014and the - verification is that these allegations are true. This, therefore, constitutes a complete verification, under section 526, Code Civ. Proc. In re McCauley, 94 N. Y. 574. So far, therefore, as the verification of the positive averments of the complaint are con cerned,, no explanation of the source of the attorney\u2019s information was necessary; for, in terms, he said he was possessed of actual knowledge of the matters which he verified by his oath. Had the matter remained in that form, the verification answered every requirement of law, and constituted such'a pleading as required the defendant to make answer under oath. . But the difficulty which the verification presents is that it goes, too far in statement, as the affiant immediately proceeds to show that, as to the matters to which he made oath as facts within his knowledge, the statement was not in accordance with the truth. He says, \u2018The source of the deponent\u2019s information as to the facts alleged in the complaint are conversations with the plaintiff.\u201d From this statement, it. appears that the attorney for the plaintiff had no personal knowledge of any of the facts alleged in the complaint. This qualifies the former statement, and shows the attorney disqualified to make the verification. It was, therefore, defective, and the defendant was authorized to treat it as an unverified pleading (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 528), and therefore had a right to serve an .unverified answer, and the plaintiff was bound to accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">It follows that the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
