The action was to recover damages for personal injuries. Issue was joined, and the cause was on the calendar for trial, but the plaintiff settled with the defendant, and executed a general release. Subsequently thereto the defendant moved to set up in a supplemental answer that release, as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action. The court at special term denied the motion because it appeared that the settlement was made without the knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who had given notice of a lien upon the cause of action, and the plaintiff was not pecuniarily responsible. The question involved on this appeal was decided by this court in O\u2019Brien v. Railway Co., <em>27 </em>App. Div. 1, 50 N. Y. Supp. 159, in which it was held that in an action of this character an application by a defendant to be allowed to set up in a supplemental answer a settlement of the action and a release by the plaintiff should not be denied simply for the reason that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had a lien upon the recovery as compensation for services in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">In view of that decision, the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
