They allege that they have built up a large business in, the manufacture and. sale of the files, and that the defendants have infringed their, right by adopting for an invoice file made by them a label with the word \u2018Favorite\u201d displayed upon it in such- a way as to deceive the public, and that they attempt to palm off their goods; as those-of the plaintiff. The ordinary allegations in actions for the infringement of trade-marks are contained in the complaint. An injtinction was sought, and a claim for damages is also made. The defendants admit that they manufacture letter and invoice files, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>that they place upon their goods a label upon which the word \u201cFavorite\u201d is displayed, but they deny the charges of fraud\u00bb and deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The evidence in the case fails to show that the defendants designedly or fraudulently sought to place their goods upon the market as those of the plaintiff. Specimens of the labels used by both parties appear in the record, and it is apparent from an inspection that even a casual observer would not be deceived by, or mistake the defendant\u2019s label for, that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s label consists of a device or design of a circle in which are inclosed the words, \u201cThe Improved, Best, Favorite, Cheapest Letter and Invoice File.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s name does not appear on it. The defendants\u2019 label is on a plain sheet, differing in color from that of the plaintiff, without the circle, and containing only the words, \u201cThe Favorite Letter and Invoice File.\u201d In design and appearance the two labels are entirely different. There is no question, in the case of illegitimate competition or of fraudulent acts upon the part of the defendants, and the only right which the plaintiff could assert is to the exclusive proprietorship of the word \u201cFavorite\u201d as a trademark designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">We agree with the trial judge that the word is not one which can be made the subject \"of an exclusive proprietary right as a trademark. It does not indicate either ownership or origin of the goods of the plaintiff. It is only an adjective which, if descriptive of anything, refers to quality. Any one is entitled to describe the articles manufactured and sold by him as being favorite, or desirable, or superior, or unrivaled, or peerless, if he chooses so to do. The - adjectives of the English language are the common property of all who speak and write it. There may be such a combination of words as would entitle a person to the use of an adjective in that combination, where there is an arbitrary and fanciful designation, as in the cases of \u201cSliced Animals,\u201d in Selchow v. Baker, 93 N. Y. 59; or \u201cPride Cigar,\u201d in Hier v. Abrahams, 82 N. Y. 519; or \u201cIdeal Fountain Pen,\u201d in Waterman v. Shipman, 130 N. Y. 301, 29 N. E. 111. Those cases proceed upon the principle that where a manufacturer invents a new name, and applies it to his wares to distinguish them from others, and it is not generic or descriptive, but arbitrary and fanciful, the right to use the name will be protected as a trade-mark. But the word \u201cFavorite,\u201d even in combination with the words \u201cBest and Cheapest,\u201d indicates nothing but an owner\u2019s appreciation of the value or quality of the article or merchandise he offers for sale to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The judgment dismissing the complaint was right, and should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except YAM\" BBUMT, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
