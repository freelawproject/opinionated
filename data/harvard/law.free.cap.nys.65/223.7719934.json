Supp. 103), and she must be confined in her recovery to the damages sustained by reason of the fraud. Under the proofs,' plaintiff cannot sue for the return of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
