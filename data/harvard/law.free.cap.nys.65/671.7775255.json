The distinction sought to be drawn by appellants between \u201cordering\u201d and \u201cpermitting,\u201d as a ground for reversal, while, possibly, logical, is not necessarily practical, and therefore we do not think, in view of the old,, familiar adage, that this alone would be \"sufficient to disturb the order below. The principal question is whether it was a preliminary necessity that appellants should have reasonable notice of application for the order appealed from,\u2014whether any notice at all were required. The extreme lati<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>tude bestowed by the legislature in these words, \"may, in his discretion, and upon such a notice, given to such persons as he deems just, or without notice, make an order,\u201d etc., leaves the matter almost completely within control of the justice making the order, and, unless there has been an abuse of power,\u2014a serious overstepping of judicial discretion,\u2014the general term will not interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">' Order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">SCHUCHMAE, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
