Baldwin &amp; Gleason Co. (Sup.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 893, which was an action for damages for the alleged wrongful discharge of plaintiff from defendant\u2019s service, the same as the one at bar, the verdict awarded plaintiff $220 expenses for \u201cboard, car fare, and lunches incurred when he was no longer in defendant\u2019s service,\u201d and Judge Pryor in his opinion says: \u201cWe are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>aware of no principle or precedent which justifies this recovery.\u201d' This was obiter. The agreement of the parties was that plaintiff should receive $25 a week, his \u201ctraveling expenses to be borne by the defendant.\u201d In the case at bar the agreement is that plaintiff should receive a \u201csalary of $900 per annum, and an allowance for his expenses not to exceed the average of $5 a day.\u201d We do not think that this includes \u201cliving expenses.\u201d It was not contemplated by the contracting parties that \u201cliving expenses,\u201d to wit, \u201cboard,\u201d was to be an item or part of the daily allowance of $5. The payment of salary of $900 is to be considered in construing the said covenant as to whether board was included, or intended to be included, in the $5 expense item. Usually an employ\u00e9 pays his board out of his salary. Besides, plaintiff earned salary, and was allowed expenses, with another employer during the period for which he seeks to recover board.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Damages for breaches of contract are those which are incidental to, and directly caused by, the breach, and may reasonably be pre-' sumed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties. Hamilton v. McPherson, 28 N. Y. 72. We conclude that the allowance of the item, \u201cActual living expenses from May 31, 1896, to January 1, 1897, at two dollars per day, $424.66,\u201d included in the verdict, was-error.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The plaintiff testified that $2 a day for living expenses was a very conservative estimate. \u201cTwo dollars a day is what I estimate it at.\u2019r This was objected and excepted to. The plaintiff should have testified to facts and figures from which the jury could make the estimate. . Here the plaintiff was allowed to testify to and make an estimate which it was the function of the jury&lt;to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Judgment and order appealed from reversed, and new trial ordered,, with costs to\u201d appellant to abide event,</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">HASCALL, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
