At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case a motion was made to dismiss the complaint, whereupon the justice granted the motion, and in addition thereto directed a verdict for the defendant. This was a manifestly erroneous disposition of the case. We think the evidence required the submission of the case to the jury, but, even assuming that the justice was right in believing that the motion to dismiss should be granted, it was improper to direct a verdict for the defendant. It was also improper to render a judgment such as the record discloses. In the municipal court, where a plaintiff does not prove his cause of action, the judgment should simply provide that the action is dismissed, with costs, without prejudice to a new action. Section 1382, Consol. Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
