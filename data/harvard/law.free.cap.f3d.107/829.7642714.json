It argues that a higher burden of proof is required because civil forfeitures constitute punishment for purposes of due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"ADv\">We agree with the First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which all have explicitly upheld the constitutionality of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615. <em>United States v. $94,000.00 in United States Currency, </em>2 F.3d 778, 783-84 (7th Cir.1993) (\u201c[T]he penalty of civil forfeiture, while sufficiently akin to the criminal law to invoke ... the strictures of the Eighth Amendment, does not convert a civil forfeiture proceeding into a criminal matter insofar as the allocation of the burden of proof is concerned.\u201d); <em>United States v. 228 Acres of Land and Dwelling, </em>916 F.2d 808, 814 (2d Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1091, 111 S.Ct. 972, 112 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1991) (\u2018We find nothing unconstitutional in Congress\u2019 allocation of the burdens of proof in forfeiture eases.\u201d); <em>United States v. Santoro, </em>866 F.2d 1538, 1544 (4th Cir.1989) (\u201cCongress may alter the burden of proof in a civil proceeding as it sees fit, without constitutional implications.\u201d); <em>United States v. $250,000 in United States Currency, </em>808 F.2d 895, 900 (1st Cir. 1987) (\u201cGenerally, Congress may alter the traditional allocation of the burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"-754\">*-754</page-number>without infringing on the litigant\u2019s due process rights unless the statute is criminal in nature\u201d); <em>United States v. One 1970 Pontiac GTO, </em>529 F.2d 65, 66 (9th Cir.1976) (\u201c[T]he challenged forfeiture statutes are not criminal enough to prevent Congress from imposing the burden of proof on the claimant.\u201d); <em>Bramble v. Richardson, </em>498 F.2d 968 (10th Cir.1974) (due process does not require transformation of civil forfeiture proceedings into criminal actions for procedural purposes), ce<em>rt. denied sub nom., Bramble v. Saxbe, </em>419 U.S. 1069, 95 S.Ct. 656, 42 L.Ed.2d 665 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Like the foregoing circuits, we view <em>in rem </em>forfeiture as a civil proceeding. <em>See United States v. Real Property and Residence, </em>921 F.2d 1551, 1556-57 (11th Cir. 1991). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996), supports our view. Although. <em>Ursery </em>did not specifically address Appellant\u2019s claim that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615\u2019s burden of proof violates due process, <em>Ursery </em>made it clear that the Supreme Court continues to view <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings as civil actions rather than criminal punishment. Accordingly, we hold that Congress\u2019s decision to allocate the burden of proof to the claimant in civil forfeiture proceedings is not unconstitutional. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AgU\">.
