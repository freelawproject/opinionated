The plaintiffs were the indorsees of the payee. The defendant was the maker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">In addition to the facts set forth in the opinion of the Supreme Court it appeared from the affidavit of defense that the notes in suit were given in payment for the stock of a corporation to which Harry F. Hall, the payee, had assigned certain patents. The court made absolute rul\u00e9 for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-9\"><em>C.

L. 60: Northern Securities Co. v. U. S., 193 U. S. 197 (24 Sup. Ct. Repr. 436); Hunter v. Henninger, 93 Pa. 375; Horstmann v. Zimmerman, 4 Atl. Repr. 171; Kinney v.

The learned court below entered judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and the defendant has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We do not think this is a case for summary judgment. The plaintiff is the indorsee of the payee and took the notes after maturity. The statement does not aver that the plaintiff is a holder in good faith and for value, and that at the time the notes were negotiated he had no notice of any infirmity in the instrument. The affidavit of defense avers failure of consideration, caused by certain acts and conduct of the payee in violation of his express agreement inducing the execution of the notes. The defendant further avers that after the maturity of the notes in suit they were \u201cput into the hands of plaintiffs under a collusive arrangement to assist said Hall (payee) in collecting said notes contrary to the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d While the affidavit certainly lacks clearness and conciseness, we think, under the pleadings, it is sufficient to send the case to a jury so that the issue may be determined after a full development of all the facts. The notes were not given for a patent right within contemplation of the Act of April 12, 1872, P. L. 60, and the averment in the affidavit in reference thereto is without merit as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The judgment is reversed with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
