He was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">On appeal, appellant contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">\u201cThe trial judge\u2019s order, given in the presence of the jury, that a defense witness be taken into custody by the sheriff following his testimony prejudiced the appellant\u2019s right to be fairly tried by an impartial jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">John Long, father of appellant, had been called to the stand as a witness for the defense. There were three areas of misunderstanding or contradiction in the course of his testimony. They were: (a) whether a white, 1963 Chevrolet automobile, fitting the description of the vehicle used in the larceny, had been in use on the date in question; (b) whether the son had been at home that day; and (c) whether or not he had seen his son on the day of the larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">At one point in his testimony the witness had stated that the automobile tags had been removed from the vehicle and sent back to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Later testimony indicated uncertainty or equivocation as to that fact. The witness did not, however, retreat from his testimony that the car had not been used on the crime date.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The following excerpts from the record will set the background in which the alleged impropriety occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">\u201cQ Has he [the son] ever driven the car without tags? You don\u2019t know that either?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>A That car hadn\u2019t left the yard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">Q You were there all day that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">A Can you automatically park a car in the same tracks and don\u2019t have no track behind it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">JUDGE.\" He didn\u2019t ask you that. He asked you were you there all day. Answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I was there all day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">Q You never went away from that house, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">A I\u2019m away sometime but I would know if the car was moved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">Q You would know if the car was moved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-13\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-14\">Wasn\u2019t no tracks behind it and none in the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-15\">JUDGE : Ask your next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-16\">MR. MALOOF:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-17\">Q Sir, do you have any idea why your son would tell the Police Officer that he was in the house that very day when the Police Officer was asking you where he was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-18\">Q Answer the question, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-19\">A I wouldn\u2019t know who was at my house if I went to the store and come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-20\">Q Well sir, was he there on that day, was James in your house on August the 10th, 1973?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-21\">A I can\u2019t tell you who was in the house on---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-22\">Q Well, sir, you just testified under oath that he wasn\u2019t in your house---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-23\">A I said I couldn\u2019t tell you that. You can\u2019t tell me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>that I\u2019m testifying under oath. I\u2019m outside and come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Q Sir, do you realize you\u2019re under oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">A I know I\u2019m under oath and I\u2019m going to tell you the truth. I\u2019m---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Q Sir, do you remember saying\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">A I\u2019m all\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">JUDGE: Just listen to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">THE WITNESS: I\u2019m answering him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">JUDGE: Shut up and listen to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">MR. MALOOF:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">Q Sir, do you remember saying just ten minutes ago that absolutely James was not at your house that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">A As I seen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-15\">Q As you seen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-16\">A That\u2019s right and I\u2019m telling you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-17\">Q Sir, did you have your eyes open?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-18\">A Did you understand what I was asking you? I\u2019m- - -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-19\">Q I asked you did you have your eyes open---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-20\">A When I\u2019m away from the place and come in, definitely I couldn\u2019t say, Judge,---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-22\">JUDGE: You are saying now you were away from the place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-23\">THE WITNESS: I had been away and come</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-24\">in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-25\">\n<em>JUDGE: Do you want him held, Mr. Mafoof?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-26\">\n<em>MR. MALOOF: Yes, Your Honor. I do want him held.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-28\">JUDGE: All right. Go ahead and finish your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>THE WITNESS: I say I was away and I come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">MR. MALOOF:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Q How many times were you away that day, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">A Well, I occasionally go to the store to get something for the farm. I raise tobacco. I\u2019m disability [sic],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">Q Did you see him on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">A I did not see him that day.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">The witness also had disputed the testimony of a state trooper who had said that the vehicle in question was being washed when the officer visited the Long farm on the day of the larceny. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">\u201cQ You\u2019re positive no one was washing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">A I didn\u2019t see anybody washing the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-14\">Q You were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-15\">A When I leave I come in on the back end where I\u2019m farming at and I\u2019m working in the field and I can look straight up in the yard and see anything that\u2019s up on my place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-16\">Q And you saw the Police Officer come into your yard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-17\">A Yes, and came up and I had the keys to the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-18\">Q And you\u2019re now saying that no one was washing the car at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-19\">A No, wasn\u2019t nobody washing the car. The car had been washed some but definite I did not see James there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-20\">Immediately following the last question to the witness the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-21\">\u201c <em>Very well, you report to the Sheriff. Sheriff take him in custody.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Defense counsel then addressed the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cYour Honor, I would at this time make a motion in which occurred concerning the testimony and the fact that Mr. Long, John Long, as a witness was held.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I feel that the matter of him being instructed by the Court to be held, the inference being that he may have perjured himself. That being done in front of the Jury is prejudicial to the defendant and I would ask for a Mistrial on that basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The trial judge responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201cWell, the Jury heard his testimony and as far as his conduct is concerned, the only thing I told him to do is report to the Sheriff. The Jury doesn\u2019t know whether he is reporting for Perjury or Paternity or owes a bill or what. I don\u2019t believe that has anything to do with the outcome of this case. The Jury certainly could not possibly believe both the statements he made. They couldn\u2019t believe him when he said he was there all day, and then turned around and said he went to the store twice. One or the other of those has got to be wrong and I think it is a question of credibility but not grounds for mistrial. I will deny the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">An annotation in 127 A.L.R. 1385,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cStatements, comments, or conduct of court or counsel regarding perjury, as ground for new trial or reversal in civil action or criminal prosecution other than for perjury\u201d discusses in considerable depth the effect, in jury trials, of indications by the trial court by word or action, that a witness will be committed for perjury. The general rule is thus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201cIt is a general rule that the court\u2019s commitment for perjury of a party or witness in the presence or hearing of the jury, or under circumstances calculated to come to their knowledge, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>making of an order therefor, in like situations, constitutes reversible error, as an encroachment upon the right of the jury freely to consider a witness\u2019s testimony, uninfluenced by the court\u2019s unauthorized direction or opinion as to the credibility of the witness or the weight of the testimony.\u201d 127 A.L.R. at 1394.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">That Maryland subscribes to the stated general rule is apparent. In <em>Newton v. State, </em>147 Md. 71, 127 A. 123 (1924), the trial judge commented in the course of the testimony of a witness: \u201cYou know better than that, Mr. Gillespie.\u201d Conviction was reversed because of the remarks of the trial judge, the Court saying at 87-88 [130]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201cThe remark involved in the forty-ninth exception was equivalent to a statement by the court that the witness Gillespie had testified to what he knew to be untrue, and was a direct reflection upon his credibility. That such is its effect is admitted by the State in its brief, where this frank but singular statement is found: \u2018The answers of the witness to this question were clearly evasive and certainly merited the comment of the court. Inasmuch as the only effect a comment could have had was to affect the credibility of the witness before the jury and did not of itself cast any reflection upon the traverser, certainly the traverser was not prejudiced thereby.\u2019 Inasmuch as the traverser\u2019s case depended upon the credibility of his witnesses, it is not easy to see how anything could possibly prejudice him more than a conclusion that their testimony was not credible, and there was in our opinion error in this ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In <em>Elmer v. State, </em>239 Md. 1, 209 A. 2d 776 (1965), the trial judge\u2019s comments had reflected adversely upon a witness. Although defense counsel had not moved for a mistrial or to strike the judge\u2019s comments, the Court of Appeals reversed. After discussing numerous Maryland cases dealing with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>subject, the opinion by Sybert, J. for the Court said at 10 [781-82]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201cWhen the trial judge declared Davis a witness hostile to the State, after he had been called by the State and had given testimony favorable to the defense, the judge\u2019s remark clearly indicated his disbelief of the witness and unquestionably influenced the jury\u2019s appraisal of the credibility of the witness. It was, of course, the function of the jury alone, as the triers of the facts, to weigh and determine that factor. The rule in such cases was stated by this Court in <em>United Rys. Co. v. Carneal, </em>110 Md. 211, at pp. 232-233, 72 Atl. 771 (1909), and quoted in <em>Marino v. State, supra </em>(at p. 110 of 171 Md.), as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u2018* * * It is undoubtedly true that a trial Judge, because of his high and authoritative position, should be exceedingly careful in any remarks made by him during the progress of a trial, either in passing upon evidence or ruling upon prayers, and should carefully refrain, either directly or indirectly, from giving expression to an opinion upon the existence or not of any fact, which should be left to the finding of the jury * * *.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">The rule was applied in <em>Newton v. State, </em>147 Md. 71, 86-88, 127 Atl. 123 (1924), where this Court held (upon objection, unaccompanied by any motion) that remarks made by the trial court in the presence of the jury which directly reflected upon the credibility of a defense witness constituted prejudicial error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">\u201cWe think that the appellant must be granted a new trial. It should be noted that we are not deciding that the trial judge was wrong in concluding the witness was hostile, but rather that, even though his conclusion was correct, the prejudicial error was committed by not making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>declaration of the witness\u2019 hostility (if any such declaration was felt necessary) out of the presence of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">We believe that the trial court\u2019s comments and directions to the sheriff could be interpreted only as indicative of his disbelief of the witness and as expressing a purpose to subject that witness to prosecution for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">To follow such a course in the presence of the jury constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Because we find it necessary to reverse and remand for a new trial, we do not reach the other issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\n<em>Case remanded for new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\"> Language is as it appears in transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Af5\">. <em>See, </em>particularly, pp. 1392-1398.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
