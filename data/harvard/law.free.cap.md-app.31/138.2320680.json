State, </em>decided this date,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are here confronted with a contention that a guilty verdict was coerced. For reasons different from those found and explained in <em>Pinder, </em>we sustain appellant\u2019s contention. The judgment of conviction of larceny upon which appellant was sentenced to a term of six years (execution of which was suspended and supervised probation for six years imposed) will be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Appellant was employed as a maintenance worker at the Blair Plaza Apartments in Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland in October, 1974. The occupant of Apartment 907, Annie Drew Derrick, age 84, reported to the management and to the police on October 9,1974 the theft of two rings \u2014 her own three-diamond ring with a Tiffany setting, and a gold ring of her daughter, twenty years deceased. (The value of her own ring was established at approximately $1,000 but the testimony did not develop a value for her daughter\u2019s ring.) These two rings had been kept by her in a box on the top of her \u201cchiffonier\u201d in her bedroom together with a third ring \u2014 a bloodstone \u2014 which had not been touched.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">On Wednesday, October 8, 1974, appellant was dispatched to Mrs. Derrick\u2019s apartment to repair a thermostat. According to her testimony, while appellant was in the process of examining the thermostat in her bedroom, he inquired if she had a small screwdriver. She withdrew from the bedroom for several minutes and returned with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>screwdriver requested by him. The next day, she discovered the loss of the two rings. Asked to describe how she discovered that the rings were missing, she responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cA Well, I go to church on the second Wednesday in the month, and I didn\u2019t notice my ring until I opened the box to put my rings on, and the first I noticed was my daughter\u2019s ring gone. I never touch that ring. And then mine. But my bloodstone ring was left in the box. This one I have on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cQ Is it your habit to wear that diamond ring when you go to church?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cA Yes. I wear them whenever I go out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201cQ And where are those rings kept?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201cA Right on the chiffonier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Other testimony of the elderly widow revealed that she lived alone, went grocery shopping about once each week, on Friday, did not \u201chear too well,\u201d was on prescribed medicines, including sleeping pills, and that a key to her apartment was also in the possession of the front office.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The State\u2019s case against the appellant under an indictment charging him with larceny of the value of $100 or more and of larceny under the value of $100 was presented through the testimony of Annie Drew Derrick and of Dorothy L. Murphy, resident manager of the Blair Plaza Apartments. The latter confirmed the employment of appellant in maintenance and general repair work during the period September 27 through October 11, 1974. During her testimony, a repair order for the thermostat in the living room and master bedroom of Apartment 907 on October 8, 1974 was introduced. Appellant\u2019s initials appeared in the right-hand corner and signified his performance of the work. No other witnesses testified for the State and appellant did not take the stand in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">The trial commenced at approximately 10:00 a.m. and the jury retired at approximately 3:15 p.m., after a luncheon recess, oral argument and instructions by the trial court. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>4:35 p.m. the jury sent a note to the trial judge (Fairbanks, J.), requesting pencils and paper and inquiring, \u201cMay we have a copy of Mrs. Derrick\u2019s testimony?\u201d Upon receipt of this communication the transcript discloses that the court summoned the State\u2019s Attorney and defense counsel and read it to them. With the concurrence of both sides, the court sent a note back to the jury that Mrs. Derrick\u2019s testimony would not be transcribed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">A second note was received from the jury at 5:23 p.m., reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cThe jurors at present have firm judgments on the defendant\u2019s guilt or lack of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7k\">8 consider him guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA5\">4 not guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azf\">&amp; all have stated that they are adamant in their beliefs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Without disclosing the contents of the second communication to either side, the trial court reassembled the jurors in the jury box. It appears that the State\u2019s Attorney, the defendant (appellant) and defense counsel were present in the courtroom. In response to the second note the court made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am advised that you are having some difficulty in coming to a verdict. The note which you have just sent out would at first blush lend one to believe that you can\u2019t come to a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\"><em>\u201cWell, I will not accept that. </em>You have only been deliberating for about two hours, approximately two hours. I am sure that if you continue your deliberations, you will be able to reconcile your various views, and come to a verdict. <em>I propose to require you to go back and do some more deliberating. </em>I don\u2019t consider that a two-hour deliberation on a matter of this kind as any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>indication that you are, or ultimately will remain deadlocked, so you ladies and gentlemen will return to the jury room and continue your deliberations.\u201d {Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">After the jury returned to the jury room, the court then addressed itself to counsel, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201cNow, what this is all about is that they came out with a note in which they say that they are divided in a particular way, and that they think they are hopelessly deadlocked. My experience with juries is that they don\u2019t deadlock in two hours, and I just don\u2019t accept that, and if necessary, and I will tell you this \u2014 I won\u2019t tell it in front of them \u2014 <em>I\u2019m going to keep them here all night, if I have to.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\u201cMR. HOGAN [Defense Counsel] May I be heard, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, you may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: Your Honor, for the record, I object to the instruction the Court just gave the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: What instruction is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: That they had to go back and find a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: I said go back and continue their deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: Perhaps I took it a little stronger than Your Honor did, but I felt that you ordered them to make a decision in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: I didn\u2019t do anything. I simply told them, Mr. Hogan, that I thought two hours was not a sufficient time, and that if they continued to work, they could reconcile their differences, and to go back and continue their deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\">If necessary, I\u2019ll have the reporter read it back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-16\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: <em>Well, my motion is for a mistrial ' at this time because of that instruction. I believe it has a coercive effect upon them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Well, you wait. If they are out there long enough, I\u2019m going to give them the Allen Charge. Then maybe you will have something to complain about.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: The <em>Allen </em>Charge is generally acceptable, but I don\u2019t think Your Honor\u2019s instruction \u2014 Your Honor\u2019s instruction at this point was stronger than the <em>Allen </em>Charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I told them to continue their deliberations. Now, I didn\u2019t tell them to continue to a verdict one way or the other. I told them that I thought they could reconcile their differences. There is nothing the matter with that. They might reconcile their differences in a not guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">Did that occur to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: Also, Your Honor, I think from the tone of the instruction it could have a coercive effect upon them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, sir, if they come out with a guilty verdict, you may take an appeal on that basis. I recognize your motion, and I deny it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">In the continuing colloquy between court and counsel for appellant, the latter observed that the jury had \u201capparently\u201d indicated to the court a numerical division although counsel had not seen the note. Defense counsel pursued this point, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: I believe, Your Honor, that that is grounds for a mistrial, because they are not supposed to indicate numerically that they are split at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The following thereafter ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I didn\u2019t ask for it. It\u2019s in their note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: I think that\u2019s unfortunate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you get me some authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>on that. I don\u2019t know of any authority that says that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: I think if they reveal what their division process is before they reach a decision, it tends to influence a further deliberation in the case in the way that we answer in the note, and the way we ask them to go back and decide again, or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">I would think, Your Honor, I would be a little bit better able to argue this if I could see the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sure. Hand him the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, what\u2019s your authority for the fact that they have disclosed their numerical decision, that that calls for a mistrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: I don\u2019t have that in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">I\u2019ll have to supply that at a later time, but I believe that there have been decisions that if the jury has revealed how it\u2019s standing, and what its feelings are, that either then it\u2019s clear there should be a mistrial, or there\u2019s just \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Maybe that\u2019s more preferable to the defendant, but I don\u2019t know of any law that says that that requires a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">Do you know of any, Mr. Scheraga?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">\u201cMR. SCHERAGA [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: No, TH*\u00abr Honor, and I think the Court\u2019s direction to tiftrm was neutral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I intended it to be. I don\u2019t know whether it sounded that way or not, but I intended it to be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">The court recessed at 5:30 p.m. The jury suspended deliberations for dinner from 6:30 p.m. until 8:15 p.m. A third communication was sent to the trial judge at 9:20 p.m.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-17\">\u201cThe jury feels that based on the evidence we have, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>we can not come to a unanimous decision. We are still at a deadlock on the same 8 to 4 combination \u2014 8 for the verdict of guilty &amp; 4 for the verdict of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The trial judge summoned the attorneys and stated that \u201cI do not propose to discharge them, and I simply wish to send back the message, without taking the time to bring them in here, and tell them to stay at it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">With respect to the time and circumstances, the court also then observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">\u201cNow, they haven\u2019t been deliberating hardly an hour since they went to eat. They had a good, long, pleasant dinner hour, which lasted from six-thirty until a quarter past eight, and they should have gotten nice and thoroughly relaxed over that. Now, they came back, and they have been going only another hour. When that note came in to me it was about ten minutes past nine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Thereupon counsel for appellant renewed his motion for a mistrial, contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">\u201cIn addition to the other two bases I believe we have a hung jury. They have indicated through two notes they are hung, irreparably hung, and I think at this time, in considering the trial was only a few hours, they have been deliberating longer than the trial was at this point. In fairness, we should have a hung jury and a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">With the concurrence of defense counsel who preserved for the record, however, his motion for a mistrial, the court instructed the bailiff to inform the jury that they were to continue their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">The transcript discloses that the court thereafter reconvened at approximately 10:30 p.m., at which time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>trial judge spread on the record the sequence of events since the jury first retired to deliberate arid then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201cNow, I propose to call them in in a moment and read them the charge recommended in the American Bar Association standards relating to trial by jury Section 5.4. This instruction has been approved by the Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The State offered no comment. Defense counsel, however, interposed an objection to the court\u2019s instruction and to the continuation of the case. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cIt seems to me in five hours and twenty-five minutes of actual deliberation time, with two notes, both commenting they are completely and irrevocably separated, and with a trial that lasted approximately three hours, that balancing those factors out we must come to the conclusion that further deliberation would be fruitless, and that to send them back again is an attempt to coercing a verdict from them, which I do not believe is fair to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Very well. Bring in the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\u201cMR. HOGAN: Your Honor, I would again move for a mistrial as a result of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">At the conclusion of this exchange between court and counsel, the jury returned to the courtroom and the trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>delivered the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I propose to give you a further instruction. I am authorized to do this by the law of Maryland, and by certain standards which have been proposed by the American Bar Association in its standards relating to trial by jury, and I will now do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, it is your duty as jurors to consult with one another and to deliberate with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>view to reaching an agreement, if you can do so without violence to your individual judgment. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but do so only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors. In the course of your deliberations do not hesitate to reexamine your own views and change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous, but do not surrender your honest conviction as to the weight or the effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict. You are not partisans, you are judges, and since this is a criminal case you are judges both of the law and the facts. Your sole interest is to ascertain the truth from the evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, retire to the jury room.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The court recessed at 10:40 p.m. and reconvened some forty minutes later at approximately 11:30 p.m., presumably having been advised by the bailiff that the jury had reached a verdict. Upon inquiry from the clerk, the forelady announced that the jury had found appellant guilty under count one of the indictment. A presentence investigation was ordered and the court adjourned at approximately 11:35 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">On this appeal, appellant mounts a four-pronged attack upon the trial proceedings: He argues that: (1) it was unreasonable and coercive to require the jury to spend \u201c6V2 hours in actual deliberation to reach a verdict after a 3-hour trial;\u201d (2) the first Allen-type instruction given more than 2 hours after the jury had begun deliberation constituted reversible error because it deviated from the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>approved in Maryland for use in such circumstances; (3) the court erred in twice refusing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial after learning of the jury\u2019s 8 to 4 division in favor of a verdict of guilty; and (4) it was an abuse of discretion to give the second <em>Allen-type </em>charge of 10:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Because of the interrelation of the several assignments of error, we have quoted extensively from the transcript and proceed to examine the period of deliberations as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In his first supplemental remarks to the jury, heretofore quoted in full, the trial court dismissed the suggestion that the jury could not reach a verdict. His statement to them after some two hours of deliberation included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\"><em>\u201cWell, I will not accept </em>that... I propose to <em>require </em>you to go back and do some more deliberating. I don\u2019t consider that a two hour deliberation on a matter of this kind is any indication that you are or ultimately will remain deadlocked.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Unquestionably, these remarks constituted an instruction within the scope of Maryland Rule 756 g. <em>Taylor v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 41, 299 A. 2d 841 (1973). Furthermore, it was indubitably coercive. <em>Jenkins v. United States, </em>380 U. S. 445 (1965), reversing 330 F. 2d 220 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Plumley v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 671, 245 A. 2d 111 (1968); <em>State v. Rodman, </em>23 So. 2d 204 (La. 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">In <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>the dissenting opinion at the Court of Appeals level<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> discloses that the jury sent the trial court a note after two hours of deliberation, reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">\u201cThe jury cannot come to a decision on both counts because of insufficient evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The court (Holtzoff, J.) thereupon gave the jury additional instructions, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\"><em>\u201cNow I am not going to accept this. </em>You have got to reach a decision in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">After further deliberation the jury brought in a verdict of guilty of robbery. The majority of the Court of Appeals rejected appellant\u2019s contention that the trial judge had given a coercive instruction. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, 379 U. S. 944 (1964), to determine if \u201cthe statement was coercive.\u201d Thereafter, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, the court noted that the Solicitor General stated in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\u201cOf course, if this Court should conclude that the judge\u2019s statement had the coercive effect attributed to it, the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial; the principle that jurors may not be coerced into surrendering views conscientiously held is so clear as to require no elaboration.\u201d 380 U. S. at 446.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The Court concluded that the statement did have a coercive effect and reversed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">And in <em>Plumley, supra, </em>Judge Morton, speaking for this Court, stated that \u201csuch language as the jury has \u2018got to reach a verdict\u2019 and \u2018this Court expects a verdict\u2019 has been held to savor of coercion or undue pressure.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Rodman, supra, </em>where the jury informed the trial judge that \u201cwe cannot agree and wish to report a mistrial\u201d and the court upon receiving the statement said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">\u201cThe court will not accept a mistrial and you must deliberate further,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">the Supreme Court of Louisiana found reversible error. The Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that, when the jury came into court, stated that they could not agree, and wished to report a mistrial, <em>the statement of the trial judge to the effect that the court would not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>accept a mistrial and that they must deliberate further was, in effect, coercing a verdict </em>either of guilty as charged in the information or of any lesser offense contained therein, or of not guilty, <em>and this statement, in our opinion, deprived the accused of the right to a mistrial in the event the jury could not agree. </em>\u201d23 So. 2d at 205. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">There is a striking parallel between the language found coercive in the above authorities and that employed below \u2014 \u201cWell, I will not accept that\u201d and the court\u2019s statement that he would \u201crequire you to go back and do more deliberating.\u201d These statements of the court constituted an Allen-type charge subject to \u201ccareful scrutiny\u201d under <em>Kelly v. State, </em>270 Md. 139, 310 A. 2d 538 (1973). On the basis of such scrutiny, we find coercion and therefore reversible error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Additional evidence of coercion may also be found, in our judgment, in the trial court\u2019s candid statement to defense counsel that \u201cI am going to keep them here all night, if I have to.\u201d While this statement was not made to the jury and, indeed, the trial judge remarked, \u201cI won\u2019t tell it in front of them,\u201d it nevertheless reflects an attitude on the part of the presiding judge, under the totality of circumstances in this case, that the possibility of a mistrial would not be tolerated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">A regrettable aspect of the proceedings below, we also believe, was the unfortunate disclosure by the jury not only of their numerical division but also the number voting for conviction and for acquittal. Had this information been solicited by the trial court \u2014 and not volunteered by the jury \u2014 such action would have constituted reversible error. <em>Brasfield v. United States, </em>272 U. S. 448 (1926); <em>Taylor v. State, supra. </em>In <em>Brasfield, </em>the jury had failed to agree after some hours of deliberation. The trial judge inquired how it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>was divided numerically, and the foreman replied that it stood 9 to 3, without indicating which number favored a conviction. Reversing the judgment, the Supreme Court held, at 450:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\"><em>\u201cWe deem it essential to the fair and impartial conduct of the trial, that the inquiry should be regarded as ground for reversal. </em>Such procedure serves no useful purpose that cannot be attained by questions not requiring the jury to reveal the nature or extent of its division. <em>Its effect upon a divided jury will often depend upon circumstances which cannot properly be known to the trial judge or to the appellate courts and may vary widely in different situations, but in general its tendency is coercive. </em>It can rarely be resorted to without bringing to bear in some degree, serious although not measurable, an improper influence upon the jury, from whose deliberations every consideration other than that of the evidence and the law as expounded in a proper charge, should be excluded. Such a practice, which is never useful and is generally harmful, is not to be sanctioned.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Here, the jury twice volunteered the details of their division. After the first disclosure, they should have been admonished by the court, and counselled against any repetition. In the absence of such a cautionary instruction, the second disclosure of their split, at 9:20 p.m., was even more explicit and more improper. It recited \u201ca deadlock on the <em>same </em>8 to 4 combination.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In response to the plaintive inquiry on the \u201cbottom line\u201d of their note, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d, the trial court, under the circumstances then existing in this case, should have granted the appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and sent them home. To require, as he did, another hour of deliberation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>then <em>sua sponte </em>to administer the <em>Allen-type </em>charge \u2014 even though substantially in the form recommended by the ABA Standards \u2014 was an abuse of discretion under <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Leupen v. Lackey, </em>248 Md. 19, 234 A. 2d 573 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">A comment also appears appropriate with respect to the trial court\u2019s handling of the first communication from the jury, after two hours of deliberation, disclosing their apparent stalemate. The jury, as we have stated, was assembled in the jury box and instructed by the court. Only after the conclusion of such instruction were counsel \u2014 and the accused \u2014 given any explanation for this procedure. As a general proposition, communications from the jury should be immediately disclosed to both sides unless, of course, they relate to mere physical requirements. <em>See, Winegan v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 196, 268 A. 2d 585 (1970). Indeed, in a criminal case, the receipt of a communication from the jury may constitute a phase of the trial, <em>State v. Saul, </em>258 Md. 100, 265 A. 2d 178 (1970), and care should be exercised that the communication be revealed not only to counsel but also to the accused. We observe also that questions of some perplexity will arise when the jury transmits, as here, an <em>improper </em>communication in a criminal case. In such a situation it may be appropriate, with the concurrence of counsel, to seal the communication, without its disclosure, pending receipt of the verdict; and in such eventuality additional care should be observed before an Allen-type charge is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">While it is not essential to consider appellant\u2019s remaining contention \u2014 that coercion is inherent when a jury is required to deliberate 6 hours after a 3 hour trial \u2014 we have found no support for such a proposition and, indeed, consider it at variance with the authorities cited in the commentary to \u00a7 5.4 of the ABA Standards. The determining factor is the conditions under which the jury is required to deliberate, not the total length of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial; costs to be paid by Montgomery County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\">. Case No. 735 and No. 1128, September Term, 1975, consolidated for oral argument. In <em>Pinder </em>we reversed convictions for rape and burglary because the trial court failed to adhere to. the requirements of an \u201cAllen-type\u201d charge explicated by the Court of Appeals in Kelly v. State, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-12\">.

The charge adhered to that approved in Kelly v. State, 270 Md. 139, 310 A. 2d 538 (1973). However, the following sentences from the model were significantly absent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\u201cThe verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror.
