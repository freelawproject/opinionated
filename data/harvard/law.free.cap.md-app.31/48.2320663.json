State, </em>20 Md. App. 682, rev\u2019d 275 Md. 22, we faced the question of wrhether a suitcase was more like a car or a house. We are faced here with the issue of whether a motel room is a dwelling capable of being burglarized or a storehouse which can be merely broken, or \u2014 as the State would have us rule, both.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">On May 23, 1975, after a trial before the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, sitting without a jury, Richard Edward Herbert was found guilty of burglary under the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>and Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30, 31 and of \u201cAttempted Storehouse etc. Breaking\u201d under Art. 27, \u00a7 342. These convictions rested largely upon the testimony of four Baltimore County policemen who were assigned to a \u201cstakeout\u201d at the Continental Motel due to \u201ca recent rash of burglaries\u201d that had plagued that establishment. Officer Barker, who presumably had the best vantage point at the stakeout, testified that during the early morning hours of September 15, 1974, he saw a black male park a 1974 Oldsmobile automobile in the motel parking lot, walk up to room 76 of the motel complex and unsuccessfully attempt to open the door. The suspect then walked down a row of motel rooms, turning the knobs on each door, until he reached room 66 which was unlocked, whereupon he entered the room for three or four minutes. After leaving room 66 the suspect continued walking along the row of motel rooms, turning doorknobs, until a car pulled into the parking lot and the driver entered room 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The suspect then continued trying the motel room doors, as he walked toward room 76 where he stopped and again attempted to open the door, this time with what appeared to be a key. After a third unsuccessful attempt to unlock room 76, the suspect entered his car, but was arrested before leaving the motel complex. He was subsequently identified as Richard Edward Herbert. A search of his person at the time of his arrest revealed three room keys from a Baltimore City motel, the key to room 76 of the Continental Motel, and a yellow flashlight. A further search of the car resulted in the finding of a bag containing twelve more motel keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The most troublesome issue among the seven that the appellant has raised is the contradiction of the elements of the two offenses of which he was convicted, burglary of room 66 and attempted storehouse breaking of room 76. It appears from the convictions below and from the Maryland case law on the issue, that prosecutors as well as judges may be confused as to the distinction between a \u201cdwelling\u201d which is an element of the crime of burglary, and \u201cany shop, storehouse, tobacco house, warehouse, or other building\u201d, an element of attempted storehouse breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>But for the fact that room 66 was rented that evening, the State produced no evidence at Herbert\u2019s trial that room 76 was used for different purposes than room 66.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both seem to be ordinary motel rooms designed and used for the same purpose. It is apparent that either both rooms are \u201cdwellings\u201d or both are \u201cother buildings\u201d under the storehouse breaking statutes, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 33, 342. We have faced this dilemma before although never have we had simultaneous convictions of both crimes regarding similar rooms in the same motel. As we stated in <em>Marston v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 360, 363,</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201cThe clearest test of what is a dwelling house is in <em>Poff v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 186, 189 . . . :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u2018The test as to whether or not a building is a \u2018dwelling house\u2019 is whether or not it is used <em>regularly </em>as a place to sleep. No building becomes a \u2018dwelling\u2019 by reason of the fact that someone may sleep there on rare occasions or take an occasional nap there, as in the current appeal.\u2019 \u201d Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>Ch. 3, \u00a7 1 C (1), at 158, 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 433 at 45,13 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Burglary </em>\u00a7 3 at 321, Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes, </em>\u00a7 13.01 at 874.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Perkins, in his volume on <em>Criminal Law, </em>2d ed., Ch. 3, \u00a7 1, p. 207, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">\u201cIf a house is <em>habitually used as a place where persons sleep, </em>it is properly to be regarded as a dwelling even if no one who lodges there has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>sufficient interest therein to establish it as <em>his </em>dwelling. Thus a hotel is a dwelling house even if all the inmates are transients, and the proprietor and his family and servants all sleep elsewhere.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The State produced evidence from which it could be inferred that the motel complex was utilized for overnight sleeping accommodations by paying guests and thus met its burden of proving the \u201cdwelling house\u201d element of burglary beyond a reasonable doubt, as was required to convict appellant of burglary of room 66, (Count I).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Not every room of a multiple unit \u201cdwelling house\u201d need be classified as a dwelling. In <em>Arnold v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 1, the basement of an apartment house which was divided into storage areas for the tenants was held to be a storehouse and not a dwelling; and, in <em>Poff, supra, </em>a vacant apartment used simply as a place in which to keep furniture pending rental was found to be a storehouse and not a dwelling. Also in <em>Jones v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 356, part of a building used as a club was deemed a storehouse although another part, used as an apartment, was a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">But, having proven one room of the motel to be a dwelling house, the State may not then designate another room a storehouse without further proof. There was no evidence at trial that room 76 varied in use or purpose from any other room in the motel. The proof by the State that the motel rooms were overnight places of repose, upon which was based the conviction under Count I, may not be disregarded in order to convict appellant of a different charge under Count V. If the prosecution contends that one room of a proven dwelling house is severable because it is used as a storage area, <em>e.g., Arnold </em>and <em>Jones, supra, </em>it must prove this \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The State may not make soup of one and sauce of the other without adding an additional ingredient. We will reverse the conviction under the fifth count, attempted storehouse breaking and vacate the (suspended) sentence. <em>United States v. Gaddis, </em>18 Cr. L. 3079 (decided 3/3/76).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Sentencing Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">At sentencing, the trial judge chose to consider factors which the Court of Appeals in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, has held to be improper sentencing considerations. In <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 542-544, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cEven though we firmly believe that the judge at sentencing can and should take into account a broad spectrum of considerations, there do exist, in order to protect the fundamental rights of the offender, restrictions on this latitude. Thus, in view of what is at stake for one who is charged with a crime, <em>it is improper to conclude that a decision, constitutionally protected, not to plead guilty and in doing so to require the State to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is a factor which ought to, in any way, influence the sentencing judge to the detriment of the accused. </em>In the case now before us, when Judge Powers said, \u2018if you had come in here with a plea of guilty . . . you would probably have gotten a modest sentence,\u2019 he indicated that he, at least to some degree, punished Johnson more severely because he failed to plead guilty and, instead, stood trial. <em>Although a reading of the judge\u2019s remarks in full does not necessarily demonstrate that a more severe sentence was imposed, the words just quoted manifest that an impermissible consideration may well have been employed. Any doubt in this regard must be resolved in favor of the defendant. </em>Accordingly, our part in the administration of justice requires that we find that a consideration of Johnson\u2019s failure to plead guilty was impermissible because a price may not be exacted nor a penalty imposed for exercising the fundamental and constitutional right of requiring the State to prove, at trial, the guilt of the petitioner as charged. This is as unallowable a circumstance as would be the imposition of a more severe penalty because a defendant asserted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>right to counsel or insisted on a jury rather than a court trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The words of Judge Weinfeld in <em>United States v. Tateo, supra </em>[214 F. Supp. 560] at 567 are particularly instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u2018No matter how heinous the offense charged, how overwhelming the proof of guilt may appear, or how hopeless the defense, a defendant\u2019s right to continue with his trial may not be violated. His constitutional right to require the Government to proceed to a conclusion of the trial and to establish guilt by independent evidence should not be exercised under the shadow of a penalty \u2014 that if he persists in the assertion of his right and is found guilty, he faces, in view of the Trial Court\u2019s announced intention, a maximum sentence, and if he pleads guilty, there is the prospect of a substantially reduced term. To impose upon a defendant such alternatives amounts to coercion as a matter of law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">This same principle was succinctly stated by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Letters v. Commonwealth, supra, </em>193 N.E.2d [578] at 580, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u2018But, plainly, a defendant, whatever his character, may not be punished for exercising his right to trial and, therefore, the fact that he has done so <em>should be given no weight in determining his sentence.\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">(Emphasis partially added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">At two junctures during the penalty phase of the proceedings, the trial judge clearly indicated that he had considered \u201cthe fact that the man has maintained his innocence throughout.\u201d He first pointed out to Herbert and his counsel what bothered him about appellant\u2019s attitude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u201cI do have one question which troubles me a great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>deal. I think I have every right to consider, and also think I have a duty to let it be known that, Mr. Herbert, one of the factors in any case, and I understand your argument, and think there is logic in what you say, but I think a Judge has to consider and prosecution has to consider the fact that the man has maintained his innocence throughout. I have heard one of the Judges from the bench say that the first step toward rehabilitation is admitting there\u2019s been some criminal involvement. I don\u2019t think that a man has to come in and say I did it, and lay down and ask sympathy. That is not required. It\u2019s a delicate problem \u2014 a philosophical problem, but the evidence in the case as far as I was concerned was really overwhelming.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Apparently counsel\u2019s argument in response did not dispel that concern. At allocution, the court\u2019s colloquy with the appellant emphasized its continued preoccupation with the forbidden consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cAll right, Mr. Herbert, before a judgment is imposed or sentence in any case, a Defendant must have an opportunity to make a statement. I\u2019ll be glad to hear from you anything you wish to say before I impose sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, I don\u2019t have anything to say. I really feel I am in a position where I can rehabilitate myself some if I\u2019m allowed to go out on the street, and also in a position if I admit that I am guilty it may affect any appeal I might have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not asking you to do that. I realize it is a dilemma. 1 want you to understand it is a dilemma that every Defendant faces. There is no question about it. I am not asking you to do that, <em>but it is also a factor in this scale we use. </em>We use a big scale, and we put lots of things into it, and one of the things I have a difficult problem with, and you have a problem too \u2014 all Defendants also \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: But, Your Honor, I should say I am in a position where I think I can rehabilitate myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">THE COURT: Mr. Herbert, this is a very difficult case \u2014 very unfortunate case. I might say to you that what I am about to do is not an effort to convince you that I am right. I do not have that responsibility. If a Judge had to convince every Defendant that the verdict was right, no Judge would ever render any verdict, because he\u2019d never be able to do that, but I think it is the right one. I am just giving my reasons; I think you are entitled to know why you are being sentenced, and what for.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The mandate of <em>Johnson </em>is clear. The protestations of innocence throughout the trial must not influence sen- , tencing \u201cin any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Although the Court of Appeals reversed this Court on this issue in <em>Johnson, </em>it did not find it necessary to reverse the conviction and remand the case for retrial as prayed by appellant here. The Court of Appeals instructed us \u201cto vacate only the sentence which was imposed . . . and then remand the case .. . with direction that it impose a new sentence arrived at in conformity with this opinion.\u201d We shall do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Further Grounds Without Merit</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">We have carefully reviewed the record and find appellant\u2019s remaining questions to be without merit:</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">The complaint that the record does not disclose a knowing and intelligent waiver of a jury trial is answered precisely in <em>Miller v. Warden, </em>16 Md. App. 614, 628; see also <em>Williamson v. State, </em>25 Md. App. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Appellant contends that the proof of burglary was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>insufficient to convict because of a lack of proof of felonious intent. The intent here was proven by the circumstances (surreptitiously trying to open doors at night and possession of a number of motel keys). It is not necessary that goods actually be taken to prove the intent to steal. <em>Barnette and Crawford v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 5; <em>Sparkman v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">There is no duty to advise a criminal defendant of his right to move for a new trial. <em>Dorris v. Warden, </em>222 Md. 586; <em>United States v. Follette, </em>358 F. 2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">We have consistently held that the issue of effective assistance of counsel may not be reviewed for the first time on appeal. Md. Rule 1085. <em>White v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 58; <em>Bailey v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 496, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Appellant complains that the State\u2019s Attorney made certain prejudicial remarks at sentencing. No objection was made and the issue was not preserved for review. Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">\n<em>Count five of Indictment No. 49790, judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">\n<em>Count one of Indictment No. 49790, judgment affirmed, but sentence vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">\n<em>Case remanded for imposition of new sentence in conformity with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-10\">. Although the State further proved through the testimony of the motel owner and the occupant of room 66 that room 66 was occupied on the night of the incident involved here, that proof was relevant only as to whether the room was generally used as a place to sleep. The proof that a named individual occupied the room on the evening in question is not evidence, by itself, sufficient to make a motel room a \u201cdwelling house,\u201d for \u201c[n]o building becomes a \u2018dwelling\u2019 by reason of the fact that someone may sleep there on rare occasions or take an occasional nap there....\u201d Poff, <em>infra, </em>at 189. It is the overall testimony and general knowledge of the purposes served by a motel that made it a dwelling house under the burglary law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
