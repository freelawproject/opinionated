Code Article 100, \u00a7\u00a7 96-107, 1975 Cum. Supp.) apply to separate construction projects in Wicomico and Talbot Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The issue had been raised before the Commissioner of Labor and Industry by separate actions by the Board of Education of Wicomico County and by the Board of Education of Talbot County. The facts giving rise to the issue are not in dispute and will be set forth herein under the headings: (a) The Wicomico County Project; and (b) The Talbot County Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">(a) The Wicomico County Project. .</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The Board of Education of Wicomico County had proposed an addition to the existing Delmar Elementary School that included: (a) the use of maple wood flooring within a gymnasium; and (b) replacement of the roof over the existing multi-purpose room of the school. The Interagency Committee of the Board of Public Works of Maryland excluded the use of State funds for the recited items. Wicomico County thereupon undertook to pay for the items, a contribution of $25,000.00 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the total project cost of $2,278,565.00. The project then was to be contracted as initially planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">(b) The Talbot County Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The Board of Education of Talbot County had proposed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>addition to the Easton Area Senior High School consisting of a new auditorium with a seating capacity for 1270 persons. The Interagency Committee of the Board of Public Works of Maryland had excluded the use of State funds to provide a seating capacity exceeding 1000 persons. Talbot County thereupon undertook to pay the cost of the additional 270 seats, a contribution of $110,000.00 to the total project cost of $1,087,997.00. The project then was to be contracted as initially planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\n<em>The Proceedings Before the Commissioner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A86n\">(a) The Wicomico County Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The Board of Education of Wicomico County, by letter dated August 7, 1974, requested the Commissioner of Labor and Industry to determine that \u00a7 \u00a7 96-107 of Code Article 100 did not apply to the Delmar Elementary School project. After investigation and hearing and purporting to act under \u00a7 101 of that Article,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Commissioner reached, <em>inter alia, </em>the following conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cIn Wicomico County a contribution of $25,000.00 represents approximately one cent on the real property tax rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cIt is agreed by all parties that the contribution is not being made for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the prevailing wage statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the contribution is bona fide within the meaning of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">He then made a determination that Code Article 100, \u00a7\u00a7 96-107 \u201cis not applicable to the Delmar Elementary School Project, Wicomico County, Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Associated Builders and Contractors of Maryland, Inc.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Baltimore Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO and the Board of Education of Wicomico County had been interested parties at the hearing. Baltimore Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO, aggrieved by the Commissioner\u2019s decision, filed an appeal to the Baltimore City Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">fb) The Talbot County Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The Board of Education of Talbot County, by letters dated September 30, 1974 and October 11, 1974, requested the Commissioner of Labor and Industry to determine that \u00a7\u00a7 96-107 of Code Article 100 did not apply to the Auditorium Addition to Easton Area Senior High School Project. After investigation and hearing, and purporting to act under \u00a7 101 of that Article, the Commissioner reached, <em>inter alia, </em>the following conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cThat the plans and specifications submitted by Talbot County provide for the construction of the auditorium with seating capacity increased to 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201cThat the increased seating capacity of the auditorium by Talbot County is for the stated purpose that said auditorium will be used as a cultural center for residents of Talbot County.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u201cThat the contribution of Talbot County towards the estimated total cost of the project is the cost of the additional seating over and above the 1000 seat capacity approved by the State Interagency Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u201cThat the contribution by the County for the additional seating is for a community purpose rather than an education purpose, and is not a bona fide purpose within the meaning of Article 100, Sections 96-107, Annotated Code of Maryland f 1974 Supplement).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>He then made a determination that Code Article 100, \u00a7\u00a7 96-107 \u201cis applicable to the Talbot County Auditorium Addition to Easton Area Senior High School [Project], Talbot County, Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Associated Builders and Contractors of Maryland, Inc., Baltimore Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO and the Board of Education of Talbot County had been interested parties at the hearing. Associated Builders and Contractors of Maryland, Inc. and the Board of Education of Talbot County, aggrieved by the Commissioner\u2019s decision, filed an appeal to the Baltimore City Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\n<em>The Proceedings in the Baltimore City Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Both appeals were heard in the Baltimore City Court on March 3, 1975. The Commissioner\u2019s decision in the appeal concerning the Wicomico County Project was reversed; his decision in the appeal concerning the Talbot County Project was affirmed. In sum, the trial court decided that both projects came within the purview of the Prevailing Wage Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>The Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">We shall reverse. We hold that both projects are without the purview of the Act. That public school construction contracts may be public works within the purview of the provisions of the \u201cPrevailing Wage Law\u201d is not open to doubt. <em>Demory Brothers v. Board of Public Works, </em>20 Md. App. 467, 316 A. 2d 529 (1974), affirmed 273 Md. 320, 329 A. 2d 674 (1974). This is not to say, however, that the provisions of the Prevailing Wage Law become enlarged in scope or broader in application when a particular contract involves in whole or in part the construction of public schools. Otherwise stated, the issue or question whether the Prevailing Wage Law is applicable in a particular case depends upon whether such project falls within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>definitions of \u201cconstruction\u201d of \u201cpublic works\u201d by a \u201cpublic body\u201d as defined in \u00a7 96, subsections (b), (c), (d) (1) and (d) (2) of Code Article 100. That issue or question is not influenced by the circumstance that the contract for the \u201cconstruction\u201d of \u201cpublic works\u201d perchance involves school construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The above noted subsections of \u00a7 96 of Code Article 100 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201c(b) <em>\u2018Construction\u2019 </em>includes all construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, painting and decorating, alteration, maintenance or repair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">(c) <em>\u2018Public works\u2019 </em>includes all buildings, bridges, roads, streets, alleys, ditches, sewage disposal plants, waterworks, and all other <em>structures or works, constructed for public use or benefit </em>or paid for wholly or in part out of public funds, except work done by any public utility company pursuant to order of the Public Service Commission or other public authority, whether or not done under public supervision or direction or paid for wholly or in part out of public funds, unless let to contract provided, however, that for the purposes of this subtitle contracts of less than $500,000 shall be excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(d) (1) <em>Public body\u2019 </em>means the State or any department, officer, board, commission, agency or instrumentality of the State, and shall include any other agency, political subdivision, corporation, person or entity of whatever nature <em>when State public funds are the only funds used for the construction of a particular public works, </em>but, except when made applicable pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, this term shall not mean any State agency or instrumentality funded wholly from sources other than the State, <em>nor shall it mean any county or municipal corporation, </em>or any department, officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>board, commission, or agency thereof, <em>when funds other than State funds are used either in whole or in part for the construction of public works.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">(2) The governing body of any political subdivision of this State may provide by resolution or ordinance that the political subdivision shall be covered by this subtitle and included within the scope of its provisions and any such political subdivision shall constitute a \u2018public body\u2019 within the meaning of this subtitle when the Commissioner is notified in writing by the governing body that such action has been taken.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We note at the outset that neither Wicomico County nor Talbot County has provided by resolution or ordinance that those political subdivisions shall be covered by the Prevailing Wage Law. Thus subsection (d) (2) has no application to either County.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Unlike the contract under consideration in <em>Demory, supra, </em>the items in both the Wicomico County and Talbot County projects for which each County provided funds, plainly fell within the words \u201cConstruction\u201d and \u201cPublic Works\u201d as defined in the Prevailing Wage Law. In short, it is undisputed here that in both projects County funds were used \u201cin part for the construction of public works.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">We believe it to be immaterial that Wicomico County\u2019s expenditure was limited to but $25,000.00. The Court of Appeals in <em>Demory, supra, </em>questioned the propriety of application of the doctrine of <em>de minimis non curat lex </em>qnd although finding it unnecessary to decide the question, commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\u201cSince we have found that no real cost was incurred by the payment of these permit fees, it is not necessary that we decide whether the <em>de minimis </em>doctrine is applicable in this case. We point out, however, that the legislative history of the \u2018Prevailing Wage Law\u2019 could make it extremely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>difficult to apply that law to a project in which any funds other than State funds were utilized. It must be remembered that when the law was enacted in 1969, its provisions were excluded from projects funded <em>\u2018primarily from sources other than the State.\u2019 </em>Chapter 558, Laws of Maryland, 1969. The 1971 amendment, however, deleted that provision and specifically provided that the law should be applicable \u2018when state public funds are the <em>only </em>funds used for the construction of a particular public works.\u2019 Chapter 220, Laws of Maryland, 1971. We assume, without deciding, that when the Legislature said \u2018only,\u2019 it meant \u2018only.\u2019 \u201d <em>273 </em>Md. at 332, 329 A. 2d at 680.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In the subject case, the Wicomico County funding operated to impose an added cost upon the property owners within its borders equal to one cent upon the tax rate. Moreover, the uncontradicted evidence shows that \u201cthe contribution [was] not being made for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the prevailing wage statute.\u201d Under such circumstances, we too find it unnecessary to decide the <em>de minimis </em>question.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">It is also wholly immaterial that Talbot County\u2019s very substantial expenditure of $110,000.00 was made \u201cfor a community purpose other than an education purpose.\u201d The uncontradicted evidence shows that the increase of 270 seats in the school auditorium was provided for the benefit of the citizens of Talbot County and plainly fell within the definitions of \u201cConstruction\u201d and \u201cPublic Works\u201d in the Prevailing Wage Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In the proceedings before the Commissioner, the architect and engineer of the Talbot County Project explained at some length the basis of need for an auditorium seating 1270 rather than 1000 persons. He testified, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">\u201cIs there anything you want to tell us about this particular project? Anything you could tell us, such as why it\u2019s being enlarged \u2014 and the nature \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>A You mean why the auditorium is \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">MR. SAUL: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">A Why it\u2019s larger than \u2014 well, Talbot County goes in for a lot of plays and concerts and things like that and it\u2019s really an auditorium for the entire county and not just for Easton High School, but they treated it as to Easton High School....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">Q Will the auditorium be located on the school grounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">A Attached to existing building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">Q And look like a part of the existing building, upon completion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">Q ... As I understand it, the Talbot County Board of Education, did apply to the interagency commission, to fund this entire project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">Q But the interagency commission has indicated by this letter of October 21, exhibit 1, declining to do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-16\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-17\">Q And it was on that basis that the county then agreed, according to their letter of October 16, exhibit 9, to budget an estimated $115,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-18\">A 115 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-19\">Q For this project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-20\">A And they will go more if necessary, based on the formula that I mentioned. ... 11 square feet per seat. See, it takes seven and a half per seat in the auditorium, plus the aisles and cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ridors which we rounded off at 11 square feet per seat, plus the cost of the seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Q Mr. Elliott, you said that the local citizens wanted at least 170 [sic] seats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Q Is that the community council of some sort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">A Well, it is the county council, formerly county commissioners \u2014 they are called the county council now and the citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">[Talbot County citizens] have to go to Queen Anne for all their concert and plays, which has a 1260 seat capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">Q You say \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">A In other words, they want a larger auditorium that is normally allowed for \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">Q Cultural and social activity for the county in general?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">Really the county council went along with it because it\u2019s for the whole \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">Q Right, and the county commission, which is now the county council, has, as you have indicated here \u2014 they had a request by the citizenry and so on, and the leaders of the community, and they agreed to put up the differential, which is roughly $115,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-17\">Q Would it also be fair to say, as you testified, that the county commission or county council consistent \u2014 with their decision \u2014 prepared to pay even more to accomplish this extra \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>A They expected to pay in excess of $115,000 when they started out.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">First, they wanted to pay for two sets of plans, one with 1270 and one with 1,000. That didn\u2019t work out, even though it made a bigger fee for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">It wasn\u2019t fair to the contractors or to anybody, so then, we worked out this formula with the interagency and it\u2019s better for all concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The Talbot County project was no less a \u201cPublic Works\u201d because it served both education and other \u201cpublic uses and benefits.\u201d Code Article 100, \u00a7 96 (c), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Because both projects involve \u201cfunds other than State funds . . . used ... in part for the construction of public works\u201d (\u00a7 96 (d) (1), <em>supra), </em>neither is within the purview of the Prevailing Wage Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\n<em>Three-fourths of the costs to be paid by the appellee Baltimore Building and Construction Trades Council, and one-fourth of the costs to be paid by the appellee Commissioner of Labor and Industry.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\">.

Contractors and subcontractors on public works shall permit representatives of the Commissioner to observe work being performed upon the work site, to interview employees and to review the books and records on the project being investigated to determine the correctness of classifications, ratios of apprentices to mechanics and payment of proper regular and overtime wage rates as required. Complaints of alleged violations shall be investigated promptly and statements, written or oral, made by an employee shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed to his employer without the consent of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">(b) <em>Procedure upon determination of violation. </em>\u2014 Following investigation as provided in subsection (a), if the Commissioner determines that any of the provisions of this subtitle may have been violated, the Commissioner shall immediately notify the public body interested, which shall withhold any payment on account thereof, due the contractor or the subcontractor constructing said public works, sufficient moneys to satisfy said sums as may be considered necessary (1) to pay the workmen and apprentices employed by the contractor or any subcontractor the full amount of wages required by the provisions of this subtitle; and (2) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>satisfy any liability of any contractor for liquidated damages as provided herein, pending a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">(c) <em>Hearing; filing of order. \u2014 </em>Within thirty (30) days after an investigation has been completed, the Commissioner shall order a hearing thereon at a time and place to be specified and shall give notice thereof, together with a statement of the facts disclosed upon such investigation, which notice shall be served personally or by mail on all interested persons, including the interested public body.
