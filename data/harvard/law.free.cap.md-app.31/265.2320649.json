Chiaramonte is a member, proposed a new hospital that would be styled \u201cSouthern Maryland Medical Center\u201d (Southern), and also applied for a \u201cCertificate of Need.\u201d Both applications were submitted to the Comprehensive Health Planning Agency (CHPA), a division of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 206. CHPA forwarded the application to the Health Planning Advisory Committee (HPAC) for Prince George\u2019s County, a then largely advisory body.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Md. Ann. Code art. 43, \u00a7 559 (a-1). According to Clinton, Southern\u2019s proposed hospital was to be built \u201c . .. 17,000 feet due south of...\u201d a main runway of Andrews Air <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Force Base. Southern\u2019s hospital would also be approximately two miles southeast of Clinton\u2019s existing facility. In any event, HP AC, on March 1,1971, recommended to CHPA that the Clinton application be denied and that a \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d be issued to Southern. On March 10,1971, Clinton was notified of HPAC\u2019s conclusions, and Clinton noted an appeal to CHPA from the recommended denial. CHPA, on March 29, 1971, informed Clinton that it had reviewed the application, and it concurred in HPAC\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Clinton, by some means not manifest in the record, found its way to the Baltimore City Court through \u201cA Petition to Intervene.\u201d We glean from the record that the desired intervention was in the matter of the granting of the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d to Southern. Judge Charles D. Harris, on September 17, 1971, sustained CHPA\u2019s demurrer to the petition to intervene on the ground that Clinton had not exhausted its administrative remedies although he opined that Clinton was a \u201cParty Aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 \u00a7 244-56 (Administrative Procedure Act).'* Clinton then, in an effort to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, appealed to the Board of Review of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. <em>See </em>Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 206A. The Board conducted hearings and, thereafter, on November 1, 1972, entered \u201cFindings of Fact, Conclusion and Decision\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which appellant states was communicated to it on December 5, 1972. The Board\u2019s affirmance of the CHPA\u2019s action allegedly concerned the sole issue of the denial of the certificate to Clinton and did not consider the issuance of the certificate to Southern. Clinton asserts that the Board should have decided both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We were informed on oral argument that Clinton filed two appeals from the Board of Review in the Baltimore City Court. The first appeal was from the denial of the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d to Clinton. That case, we were told, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>not as yet been adjudicated. Clinton\u2019s other appeal was taken as a protestant from the Board\u2019s implicit upholding of the issuance of the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d to Southern. Judge Paul A. Dorf granted a motion <em>ne recipiatur </em>which was filed by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Clinton appealed to the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court, in an unreported per curiam opinion, <em>Clinton Community Hospital Corp. v. Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>No. 153, September Term, 1973 (Ct. App., filed January 28, 1974), dismissed the appeal for failure to comply with Md. Rule 828 b 1, the record extract rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><em>Deus ex machina, </em>ten days later, on February 7, 1974, Clinton filed another \u201cOrder <em>for </em>Appeal . . .\u201d in the Baltimore City Court. This time Clinton filed as a protestant in the matter of the granting by CHPA of the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d to Southern.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequently, on February 11, 1974, Clinton filed a 152 paragraph \u201cPetition to Intervene\u201d in the case in which it had noted the appeal on February 7, 1974. The \u201cPetition\u201d is Promethean, but unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">CHPA raised preliminary objections, Md. Rule 323, and the matter was heard before Judge James W. Murphy on March 17, 1975. Judge Murphy treated the motion raising preliminary objections as a motion for summary judgment, Md. Rule 610. The judge stated in his ruling of court: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cSummary Judgment granted in favor of [CLIPA] .... [Further,] [t]he Appeal is dismissed.\u201d The hearing judge based his ruling on his conclusion that Judge Dorf s decision in the prior case \u201c. . . went directly to the merits of the controversy. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">We shall affirm. We observe that the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d was issued to Southern in 1970. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the Board of Review had the matter before it in 1972 when it affirmed the decision of the CLIPA, Clinton may not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 206B (2) provides that \u201c[a] party aggrieved by an adverse decision of action or failure to take action within the time prescribed by subsection (1) [30 days] . . . may file an appeal to the board of review . . . .\u201d The Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a) authorizes judicial review for a \u201c. . . party aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case, whether such decision is affirmative or negative in form . . . .\u201d There is, however, a time limitation after which an appeal is not authorized. Md. Rule B4 a states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201cAn order for appeal [from an administrative agency] shall be filed within thirty days from the date of the action appealed from, except that where the agency is by law required to send notice of its action to any person, such order for appeal shall be filed within thirty days from the date such notice is sent, or where by law notice of the action of such agency is required to be received by any person, such order for appeal shall be filed within thirty days from the date of the receipt of such notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The record disclosed that the notice of the Board of Review\u2019s final decision was received by Clinton on December 5, 1972. Hence, Clinton had thirty days from that date to appeal to the Baltimore City Court. It did so, but, as we have said, Judge Dorf granted a motion <em>ne recipiatur. </em>Clinton then had its appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeals dismissed. The dismissal of the appeal by the Court of Appeals did not operate so as to confer upon Clinton the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>right or privilege, to intervene or file a new appeal within thirty days of the decision by the Court of Appeals. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Clinton was an aggrieved party, its right to appeal the granting of a \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d to Southern, expired on January 4, 1973. The \u201cappeal\u201d entered to the Baltimore City Court on February 7, 1974, was one year and three days too late. It was a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">On oral argument, we were informed that the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d is reissued every year. Even if that is true, the \u201cOrder for Appeal\u201d in this case implies that the appeal is from the granting of the original \u201cCertificate of Need\" to Southern. It does not suggest that the appeal is from the renewal of the certificate, nor can we glean from Clinton\u2019s \u201cPetition to Intervene\u201d that such is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">It is readily apparent to us that Clinton\u2019s appeal and its sought intervention in its own appeal are both directed toward the initial granting of the \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d to Southern and not to any renewal thereof. In any event, if the appeal that was filed in the Baltimore City Court in this case were viewed as a renewal, it would meet the same fate as the 1971 appeal to the Baltimore City Court, <em>scilicet, </em>premature because of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In short, the path to the Courts would have to be trod anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">A further comment with respect to what purports to be \u201cSupplement No. 1 to APPELLANT\u2019S APPENDIX.\u201d The \u201cSupplement\u201d contains material Clinton wanted, but was unable, to present to Judge Murphy. There is no warrant to submit to this Court material not already in the record. <em>See Community Realty Co. v. Siskos, </em>31 Md. App. 99, 254 A. 2d 181 (1976). Thus, even if Clinton had prevailed here, we would assess court costs against it for its flagrant violation of Md. Rule 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">. In addition, certain aspects of the case have been before the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and the United States Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\">. Apparently, when a \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d has been issued pursuant to State law, federal funding is available under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 246 (1970) [Public Law 89-749,20 Stat. 1180 (1966)].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\">. The members of HPAC are appointed by the Prince George\u2019s County Executive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">. The propriety of that ruling is not before us, and we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">. The Board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact, Conclusion and Decision\u201d is not included within the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\">. Prior to January 1, 1975, this Court\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to_ the type of appeals specified in former Md. Ann. Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-308 (a). Since December 31, 1974, we exercised \u201c... exclusive initial appellate jurisdiction over any reviewable judgment, decree, order or other action of a circuit court and orphans\u2019 court, or the Maryland Tax Court.\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 12-308. The Court of Appeals, however, in Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor of Assessments, 276 Md. 36, 343 A. 2d 521 (1975), held that the Maryland Tax Court is not a court within the meaning of the State Constitution, and that appeals from its decisions must be noted in the first instance to the circuit court. The net effect of the holding in <em>Shell </em>is that Courts Art. \u00a7 12-308 has been judicially amended to read substantially as it did prior to the enactment of Laws 1975, ch. 448, \u00a7 1, when the Maryland Tax Court was omitted from that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. We note that this is an appeal <em>directly </em>from the CHPA as opposed to the earlier appeals to the Baltimore City Court from the Board of Review\u2019s action. Further, we observe that the February 7, 1974, appeal should have been dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies or, alternatively, on the basis of <em>res judicata </em>because of the prior Court of Appeals dismissal which had the effect of denying standing to Clinton to protest Southern\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Need.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
