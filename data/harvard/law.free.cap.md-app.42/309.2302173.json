Sims, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">On November 2,1976, the appellant, who worked for First National Bank of Maryland, one of the appellees, suffered a back injury. He filed a claim for compensation benefits with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland, On March 1, 1977, the Commission completely disallowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>claim, stating that \u201cthe claimant did not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">On June 24, 1977, the appellant, the First National Bank of Maryland, and Maryland Casualty Company, the bank\u2019s insurer under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of Maryland, entered into an \u201cAgreement of Final Compromise and Settlement,\u201d which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfM\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Claimant has filed a claim with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland, hereinafter called the Commission, to recover workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for alleged disability resulting from accidental personal injury or disablement from occupational disease, arising out of and in the course of his or her employment with the Employer, which injury or disablement is alleged to have occurred on or about the 2nd day of November 1976; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQoF\">\u201cWHEREAS, the Employer and Insurer deny the allegations of the Claimant, either in whole or in part, so that there now exists a dispute between the Claimant on the one hand, and the Employer and Insurer on the other, as to whether the Claimant is entitled to any workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and/or, if so entitled, as to the nature and extent of disability involved and the benefits or additional benefits to be paid Ox\u2019 provided; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaJ\">\u201cWHEREAS, irrespective of and notwithstanding the divergent views held by the parties ... the said parties have reached an agreement providing, subject to the approval of the Commission, for a final compromise and settlement of any and all claims which the Claimant or his or her personal representative or beneficiaries might now or could hereafter have under the provisions of the said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law against the Employer and/or the Insurer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201c2. The Claimant hereby accepts the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>agreement and the aforesaid payment(s) in final compromise and settlement of any and all Claims which the Claimant, his or her personal representative, dependents, wife and children or any other parties who might become beneficiaries under the said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, might now or could hereafter have under the provisions of the said Law, arising out of the aforesaid injury or disablement or the disability resulting therefrom, and does hereby, on behalf of himself or herself and all of said other parties, release and forever discharge the Employer and Insurer, their personal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns, from all other claims of whatsoever kind which might or could hereafter arise under the said Law from the said injury, disablement or disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201c3. This Agreement is made subject to the approval of the Commission, and when so approved shall immediately become effective and binding upon all of the parties hereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The agreement was approved by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission on June 28, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">At the time of the injury, First National Bank provided for its employees a \u201cLong Term Salary Continuance Accident and Sickness Policy\u201d through the Insurance Company of North America, an appellee in this case. The policy entitled employees to monthly disability payments based on a percentage of the employee\u2019s base monthly salary. A stipulation of the policy was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cThe Monthly disability benefit shall be reduced by the Monthly pro-rata portion of any benefits payable under any applicable Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">After the June 24, 1977, agreement and settlement, the appellees discontinued the payments to the appellant under the above insurance policy. Thereupon, the appellant brought an action for specific performance under the policy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>appellees moved for summary judgment in their favor. They cited \u00a7 52 of Article 101 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u201c\u00a7 52. <em>Compromise and settlement.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">At any time after a claim for compensation under this article has been filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission by any claimant, and said claimant and/or his or her dependents may, with the approval of the Commission, enter into an agreement with the employer or insurer of such employer or with the Subsequent Injury Fund providing for a final compromise and settlement of any and all claims which the said employee or his or her dependents might then or thereafter have under the provisions of this article, upon such terms and conditions as the Commission shall, in its discretion, deem proper. Any such settlement when approved by the Commission shall be binding upon all parties thereto, and no such settlement shall be effective unless approved by the Commission____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The appellees argued that the monies received by the appellant pursuant to the June 24, 1977, settlement were \u201cbenefits payable under any applicable Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d After a hearing, the lower court granted the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We will affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The outcome of this case is determined by the construction given to the words in the June 24,1977 settlement in light of \u00a7 52 of Article 101, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">We hold that the June 24, 1977 agreement and settlement concerned Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits. The agreement specifically provided that the payments were in \u201cfinal compromise and settlement of any and all Claims ... under the said Workmen\u2019s Compensation .Law____\u201d In addition, the agreement was approved and signed by the Commission pursuant to \u00a7 52 of Article 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">The appellant argues that the payments received were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>pursuant to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law because the settlement was made <em>after </em>the Commission adjudicated his claim as having no merit. We do not find this argument persuasive for two reasons. First, \u00a7 52 provides that a settlement may be entered into <em>\u201cat any time after &amp; </em>claim for compensation under this article has been filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission....\u201d (emphasis added). That section does not state that the settlement must be reached before the claim is adjudicated. In addition, the appellant himself states in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201c... the settlement was entered into for the purpose of the insurer avoiding further litigation on appellate review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Clearly, both parties considered the settlement to be a direct result of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation claim that had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The appellant relies on <em>Rich v. Dyna Technology, Inc., </em>204 N.W.2d 867 (1973), in support of his argument. That case, however, is not binding precedent in Maryland, nor is it factually apposite. In that case, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law provision on \u201ccompensation agreements,\u201d the agreement, and the insurance policy stipulation materially differed from those in the present case. The same result is not mandated in the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Therefore, the lower court did not err in granting summary judgment to the appellees. Maryland Rule 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
