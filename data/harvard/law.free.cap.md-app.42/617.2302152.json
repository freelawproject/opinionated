Robinson, appellant, was convicted in a non-jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>trial in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of the crime of escape (Md. Code, art. 27, \u00a7 139) and sentenced to the .Division of Correction for a term of eight months to be served consecutively to any sentence he was then serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In this appeal appellant contends that \u201c[t]he trial judge erred in refusing to consider Appellant\u2019s defense of compulsion to the crime of escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The record indicates that on May 13, 1978, appellant was incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional Camp Center in Jessup, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and about 9:45 p.m. on that date he departed from the premises without permission. On May 30, 1978, appellant \u201cturned himself in\u201d to the police authorities of Baltimore City. At trial, appellant testified that while a member of the Maryland Penitentiary population, he \u201chelped some officials out\u201d as a result of which he was \u201cjumped on\u201d by several of his fellow inmates. He was then transferred to the Maryland House of Correction where he was placed \u201con protective custody status.\u201d Sometime later he was sent to the Maryland Correctional Camp Center. According to appellant, \u201cfw]hen I went to the Camp Center I had trouble with three inmates and I got cut in the back over there the night that I left and that\u2019s the reason why I left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Prior to the assault he had complained to a correctional officer of his fear of attacks by certain fellow inmates and was told \u201cif you can\u2019t handle the Camp Center we\u2019ll send you back to the Maryland House of Correction.\u201d About an hour later he \u201cwas called into the bathroom and jumped on by the three inmates and cut on my back.\u201d When questioned about his actual escape, he said: \u201cI knew exactly what I was facing, but instead of staying there and getting stabbed or going to sleep and getting stabbed, I left.\u201d When asked: \u201cSo, in other words, what you\u2019re saying is that you left out of fear for your life?,\u201d appellant replied: \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">At the conclusion of the testimony trial counsel for appellant argued, as his appellate counsel does in this Court, that appellant\u2019s escape was excused because he \u201cacted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>a compelling force of coercion or duress.\u201d In response to counsel\u2019s argument, the trial judge announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\u201cIt may well be that some day some Court will structure certain guidelines for determining ... just how coercion or duress is to be measured insofar as inmates\u2019 escapes are concerned, but I am certainly not going to undertake to structure such guidelines.... I am not aware of any principle that there can be justification or excuse as such, a justification which would excuse the act so to speak from being a violation of the statutory crime of escape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We agree with appellant that the trial judge erred in refusing to pass upon the appellant\u2019s defense of coercion, compulsion, duress or necessity. Counsel for both appellant and the State agree that for the purposes of this case, the terms may be treated interchangeably, although some authorities have sought to make a distinction among the terms. <em>Stewart v. United States, </em>370 A. 2d 1374 (D.C. Ct. App. 1977); 43 U. Cin. L. Rev., 956-60 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">While it would appear that our Maryland appellate courts have not addressed the applicability of such a defense specifically to the crime of escape, this Court did say, in <em>Frasher v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 439, 447-48 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">\u201cIt is essential to a crime that the defendant committed a voluntary act.... The voluntary requirement of the criminal act relates directly to compulsion; it is a defense as to all crimes except taking the life of an innocent person that the defendant acted under a compelling force of coercion or duress. 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>(Anderson) \u00a7 123, p. 261. The compulsion may be by necessity, that is duress arising from circumstances, or by the application of duress on the defendant by another person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Counsel for appellant asserts that \u201c[sjeveral jurisdictions have recently shed a traditional reluctance to apply this defense to a charge of escape\u201d and counsel for the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u201cconcedes that there is a trend to recognize the defense\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and urges us \u201cto recognize the defense in a proper setting,\u201d asserting that this case does not constitute such a setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Both sides recommend that we adopt the guidelines set forth in what they term the leading case of <em>People v. Lovercamp, </em>43 Cal. App. 3d 823, 69 ALR 3d 668 (1975). There the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201c[RJather early in the legal history of the offense of escape, it became clear that all departures from lawful custody were not necessarily escapes or, to put it more accurately, there was a possible defense to an escape charge, to wit, necessity. In 1 Hale P.C. 611 (1736), it was written that if a prison caught fire and a prisoner departed to save his life, the necessity to save his life \u2018excuseth the felony.\u2019 So, too, we may assume that a prisoner with his back to the wall, facing a gang of fellow inmates approaching him with drawn knives, who are making it very clear that they intend to kill him, might be expected to go over the wall rather than remain and be a martyr to the principle of prison discipline.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The facts in <em>Lovercamp, </em>as delineated in the opinion of the court, were as follows: Two women inmates of the California Rehabilitation Center \u201chad been in the institution about two and one-half months and during that time they had been threatened continuously by a group of lesbian inmates who told them they were to perform lesbian acts \u2014 the exact expression was \u2018fuck or fight.\u2019 They complained to the authorities several times but nothing was done about their complaints. On the day of the escape, 10 or 15 of these lesbian inmates approached them and again offered them the alternative \u2018fuck or fight.\u2019 This time there was a fight, the results of which were not outlined in the offer of proof. After the fight Ms. Wynashe [co-defendant] and defendant were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>told by this group of lesbians that they \u2018would see the group again.''' The women thereupon departed from the center and \u201cwere promptly captured in a hayfield a few yards away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">At trial Ms. Lovercamp\u2019s offer to prove the facts surrounding the leave-taking of the institution by her and her fellow inmate was refused by the trial judge and they were convicted of escape. In reversing the conviction, the California appellate court announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201cWhile we conclude that under certain circumstances a defense of necessity may be proven by the defendant, at the same time we place rigid limitations on the viability of the defense in order to insure that the rights and interests of society will not be impinged upon. We have not formulated a new rule of law but rather have applied rules long ago established in a manner which effects fundamental justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The court then went on to hold that a limited defense of necessity is available to an individual charged with the crime of escape if the following conditions exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201c(1) The prisoner is faced with a specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">(2) There is no time for a complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints which makes any result from such complaints illusory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">(3) There is no time or opportunity to resort to the courts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">(4) There is no evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other \u2018innocent\u2019 persons in the escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">(5) The prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities when he has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">We think these guidelines represent a sound and reasonable approach to the problems arising in our prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>institutions which may occasionally force upon a member of the prison population a choice between escaping or subjecting himself to death or serious bodily harm. A person charged with the crime of escape should have available to him the defense of necessity or compulsion if he can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the judge or jury that the facts surrounding his escape fall <em>strictly </em>within the guidelines set out above in <em>Lovercamp.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The attorney general\u2019s representative, while agreeing that the rule of <em>Lovercamp </em>should be adopted by the courts of this State, urges that the record before us facially demonstrates that the appellant has failed to satisfy the conditions of <em>Lovercamp. </em>While suggesting that appellant probably failed to meet conditions (1) and (2), it is vigorously argued that appellant remained free from custody for a period of some 17 days and that this conduct in itself manifestly constitutes a failure to comply with guideline (5) which requires that a prisoner immediately report to the proper authority when he has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">While this argument may or may not have some validity, the record before us is clear that the trial judge refused to recognize the defense of necessity or compulsion. We think the appellant was entitled to have the trial judge pass upon the facts developed in support of such a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Accordingly, we shall reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial to enable the trial judge to review the evidence in light of the guidelines set forth herein.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial; costs to be paid by Anne Arundel County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">. Appellant is correct in his contention that \u201cseveral jurisdictions\u201d have recently recognized the necessity defense in escape cases. <em>See, e.g., </em>People v. Hocquard, 236 N.W.2d 72 (Mich. 1975), People v. Davis, 306 N.E.2d 897 (Ill. 1974), and Roy v. Commonwealth, 500 S.W.2d 921 (Ky. 1973). <em>See also </em>Annot., Duress, Necessity, or Conditions of Confinement as Justification for Escape From Prison, 69 ALR 3d 678.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\">. We do not agree with the holding of the court in People v. Unger, 362 N.E.2d 319 (Ill. 1977), that \u201cthe absence of one of the Lovercamp preconditions does not alone disprove the claim of necessity and should not therefore automatically preclude an instruction on the defense.\u201d The defense, in our opinion, must generate factual compliance with each of the five guidelines where applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\">. The briefs submitted by counsel for appellant and the State were of high caliber and their oral arguments most nelpful to the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
