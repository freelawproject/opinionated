For the reasons set forth, we hold that it was error not to merge the larceny conviction \u2014 the \u201clesser offense\u201d \u2014 into the shoplifting conviction \u2014 the \u201cgreater offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Harvey Ignatius Slye, the appellant, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Bowie, J.) of larceny and shoplifting of men\u2019s suits valued at $835. The court imposed a 10-year sentence for the larceny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>conviction and a 3-year concurrent sentence for the shoplifting conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">At the trial, Troy Ratliff, the store detective at the Woodward &amp; Lothrop department store in Iverson Mall, Prince George\u2019s County, testified that, at approximately 9:30 p.m. on October 9,1975, he was summoned to the Men\u2019s Suits Department. There he observed a man, whom he later identified in court as appellant, leaving the department with a number of suits \u201cdraped\u201d over his arms. Cecile Langston, a salesperson, also saw appellant departing, thus encumbered. As Ratliff followed appellant towards the front door, he called by radio for assistance. Alerted, appellant began to run. Ratliff chased him outside where appellant jumped into a car. Ratliff grabbed him. A struggle ensued during which the detective sprayed appellant with mace and knocked the suits to the ground. Appellant nevertheless managed to re-enter and to start his car. Ratliff clung to the moving vehicle for 10 or 15 feet before he released his grip. He was able, however, to get the license number. Subsequently, the car was traced to appellant and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Appellant testified on his own behalf. He also presented three alibi witnesses who testified that he was with them at the time of the alleged criminal conduct. Without objection, the court submitted both counts \u2014 larceny and shoplifting \u2014 to the jury. The jury returned guilty verdicts to both offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court should have merged the larceny conviction into the shoplifting conviction. The State responds that the issue of merger was not properly preserved for appellate review. Md. Rule 1085. If preserved, however, appellee concedes that merger should take place but argues that the shoplifting should merge into the larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Examination of the record reveals that appellant\u2019s trial counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>State\u2019s case and stated, in the course of his supporting argument, that \u201cthe application of both the grand larceny and grand shoplifting would seem to merge somehow or some way in that aspect.\u201d The motion was denied. Appellant did not object thereafter when the trial court submitted both offenses to the jury nor when the jury returned a verdict convicting him under each count nor when the court sentenced him to 10 years for grand larceny and a concurrent three-year term for shoplifting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State, citing <em>Rose v. State, </em>37 Md. App. 388, 377 A. 2d 588, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 743 (1977), argues that Rule 1085<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> precludes appellate review of the merger issue when, as here, the sentences imposed were concurrent, not consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Writing for the Court in <em>Rose v. State, </em>Judge Davidson observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cThis Court will not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear to have been tried or decided by the trial court. We have, however, occasionally decided such points or questions. While we have often refused to decide a question of merger which has not been raised or decided in the trial court in cases in which concurrent terms were imposed, <em>we have not declined to consider such questions in cases in which consecutive terms were imposed. In such cases we shall decide the merger question in order to avoid the manifest injustice which would result if consecutive sentences were imposed for merged offenses.\" </em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">37 Md. App. at 393-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d rationale enunciated in <em>Bose </em>is, we think, clearly applicable to the instant appeal. Here, appellant contends that the larceny conviction, for which he received a sentence of 10 years, should merge into the shoplifting conviction, for which he received a 3-year term. The latter, it is true, was concurrent. However, if we were not to entertain the merger issue because of Md. Rule 1085, appellant is faced with the prospect of an additional seven years incarceration for an offense which he claims, on the authority of <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 373 A. 2d 262 (1977), should have been merged into the conviction for which he received the lesser, 3-year, sentence. The situation is, in practical effect, indistinguishable from that where consecutive sentences are imposed and considerations of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d are equally present.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In this respect, we deem it appropriate to point out that, upon close scrutiny, the cases wherein we have declined to review the question of merger of concurrent sentences because of Rule 1085, do not involve these considerations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In those cases, unlike the present appeal, the sentence imposed for the conviction proposed to be merged was less than or, at most, equal to the sentence imposed for the other conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we shall decide the merger question.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The prohibition against double jeopardy, both under the Fifth Amendment and at common law, bars not only successive trials but also multiple punishment for the same offense. <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 263, 373 A. 2d 262 (1977), <em>citing Ex parte Lange, </em>18 Wall. 163, 21 L. Ed. 872 (1873); <em>Cousins v. State, </em>277 Md. 383, 388, 354 A. 2d 825 (1976); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 353 A. 2d 240 (1976). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>appeal represents a case of multiple punishment. Two questions arise: (a) must the offenses, arising from the same act or criminal episode, be deemed the same for double jeopardy purposes? (b) if so, which offense merges into the other?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The established test for determining whether two offenses merge is the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test. This was made clear in <em>Newton v. State, </em>in which Judge Eldridge wrote for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cThus, under both federal double jeopardy principles and Maryland merger law, the test for determining the identity of offenses is the required evidence test. <em>If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and do not merge. However, if only one offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are deemed the same, and separate sentences for each offense are prohibited.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">280 Md. at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Applying the required evidence test to the two offenses involved here, it is manifest that only one, shoplifting, requires proof of a fact that the other, larceny, does not, thus requiring a merger. \u201cLarceny is the fraudulent taking and carrying away of a thing without claim of right with the intention of converting it to a use other than that of the owner without his consent.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 606, 298 A. 2d 378 (1973). The elements of the shoplifting offense under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 551A (a) (1), with which appellant was charged, are identical to those of larceny with the addition of one element: the goods must be taken from a mercantile establishment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>When a merger is necessitated, the \u201clesser\u201d crime is merged into the \u201cgreater\u201d and the judgment of conviction and the sentence on the lesser offpnse are vacated. <em>Stewart v. Warden, </em>243 Md. 697, 699, 221 A. 2d 709 (1966). The lesser offense is that which is itself an \u201cessential ingredient\u201d of the offense requiring proof of an additional fact. <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. at 269.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, larceny is an \u201cessential ingredient\u201d of shoplifting under subsection (a) (1) of the shoplifting statute. Shoplifting requires proof of an additional fact \u2014 theft from a mercantile establishment. Larceny is thus the \u201clesser\u201d offense and the conviction and sentence must be vacated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The penalties prescribed for the respective crimes are not, as the appellee contends, a factor to be considered. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>283 Md. 196, 388 A. 2d 926 (1978). One of the issues before the Court, in <em>Johnson, </em>was whether a false pretenses <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> conviction merged into a welfare fraud <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> conviction. It was held that the false pretenses conviction merged. In language appropriate to this case, Judge Smith stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\"><em>\u201cThere is at least a suggestion here that because false pretenses carried a potential punishment of 10 years imprisonment while the maximum imprisonment for welfare fraud is three years that this in some fashion makes false pretenses the greater crime into which welfare fraud would merge. This concept was rejected by the Court in Flannigan v. State, </em>232 Md. 13, 19, 191 A. 2d 591 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(1963). The issue there before the Court involved Art. 27, \u00a7 140, the False Pretense Act, and \u00a7 142, the Worthless Check Act, the latter of which provided the lesser sentence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"><em>Id </em>at 204. Thus, the focus and emphasis in the determination of the \u201cgreater\u201d and \u201clesser\u201d offenses are upon the \u201crequired evidence\u201d to prove them, not the prescribed penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\n<em>Judgment of conviction and sentence for larceny vacated; costs to be paid by Prince George\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 340 (1976) provides that a \u201cperson convicted of the crime of larceny to the value of one hundred dollars or upward ... shall be deemed guilty of a felony\u201d and prescribes the punishment: restoration to the owner or payment to the owner of the value of the property and a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than 15 years, or both such fine and imprisonment. In Maryland, the dividing line between felonious and nonfelonious larceny is the value of $100. The theft of goods under $100 is a misdemeanor. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 341. Larceny is not by statute designated as \u201cgrand\u201d or \u201cpetit\u201d but is commonly referred to in those terms. Melia v. State, 5 Md. App. 354, 360-61, 247 A. 2d 554 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-10\">. Maryland's shoplifting law was enacted in 1961 and is codified in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 551A (1976 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 1978). Under subsection (aj (1), the crime is committed when any person, <em>in any mercantile establishment, </em>removes \u201cany goods, wares or merchandise [from a place within the establishment] with the intent to appropriate the same to [his own use], or to deprive the owner of the use, or value, or any part thereof.\u201d These, of course, are also the essential elements of common law larceny. Under subsections (a) (2) through (a) (5), shoplifting is also defined, disjunctively, to include obtaining possession, \u201cwith a like intent,\u201d of any such goods by charging them to a fictitious person or to a real person without the latter\u2019s authority; concealment of any such goods; alteration, removal, or disfigurement of any label or price tag; and transferring of any such goods from their container to any other container. The dividing line between felony and misdemeanor shoplifting is again $100, under subsection (d). The maximum imprisonment for the felony is 3 years; for the misdemeanor, 18 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\">. Appellant was convicted on July 8, 1976. The case is before us as a belated appeal after a successful application for post conviction relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\">. Under these circumstances, we find it difficult to accept appellate counsel\u2019s assertion at oral argument that the limited reference to the merger issue at the time of the motion for judgment of acquittal was sufficient to preserve the question for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">.

In <em>Brooks v. State, </em>38 Md. App. 550, 381 A. 2d 718 (1978), appellant had received <em>consecutive </em>sentences of twelve years for assault with intent to murder and three years for carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure. Citing <em>Rose v. State, </em>Judge Melvin held for the Court: \u201cBecause appellant was given consecutive sentences, we will consider the issue of merger even though it was not raised or decided below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Johnson v.
