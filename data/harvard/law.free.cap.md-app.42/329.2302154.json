As a prelude to discussing the matter now before us, a brief review of some historical data relative to the Maryland Blue Sky legislation is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\n<em>HISTORY OF THE MARYLAND SECURITIES ACT.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">According to D.H. Miller,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 23 Md. L. Rev. 289 (1963), <em>A PROSPECTUS ON THE MARYLAND SECURITIES ACT, </em>the first Maryland law dealing with \u201cBlue Sky\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was enacted in 1920. It conferred upon \u201cthe Attorney General the power to investigate and deal with frauds in the offering and sale of securities....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Following the economic disaster that befell the nation in the early 1930\u2019s, the federal government put itself into the regulation of securities by the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933. Apparently, the federal authorities\u2019 entry into security regulation led to a minimum of activity in the area on the part of the State. The situation seems to have remained static in Maryland until the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws and the American Bar Association approved the Uniform Securities Act in 1956.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">A Joint Resolution of the General Assembly in 1961 led to the appointment of a committee \u201cto study the Maryland situation and to report on the adequacy of the Maryland Blue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Sky Law.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Committee concluded that the Maryland law was inadequate and recommended the adoption of a version of the Uniform Securities Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With only minor amendments, the matter passed both Houses of the Legislature and became law on July 1, 1962.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Mr. Miller states in his article that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201cThe Maryland Securities Act is an attempt to do four things. First, it imposes a standard of honesty and truthfulness upon every transaction involving an offer to buy or sell a security, regardless of the size of the transaction or the sophistication (or lack of it) of the parties. This standard is implicit in the anti-fraud provisions. Secondly, it provides for the regulation of those engaged in the business of buying and selling securities. Thirdly, it regulates certain offerings of securities with the principal purpose of assuring that full disclosure of the material facts will be made to every prospective investor. Finally, it provides administrative, civil, and criminal remedies in cases where the standards prescribed by the Act are not met. In sum, the Act roughly approximates locally the coverage of the two principal federal securities laws: the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 23 Md. L. Rev. at 291-92.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The Maryland Act was codified as Maryland Annotated Code art. 32A. A security was defined in then section 25 (1) in broad and flexible terms.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>The entire Act revolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>around the meaning of three words, <em>scilicet: </em>1) <em>security; </em>2) <em>offer;</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 3) <em>sale.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The thrust of the Act, through the registration and regulation of the offer or sale of securities, is to prevent the perpetration of fraud on the citizenry. Offers and sales generally were to be made by a \u201cbroker-dealer,\u201d a \u201cperson engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others or his own account.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An \u201cagent\u201d was any person \u201cother than a broker-dealer who represents a broker-dealer or issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities.\u201d *<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As with many regulatory laws, there were exceptions which took the ' form of \u201cexempt securities\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or \u201cexempt transactions.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Among the transactions that were exempt<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> from the ambit of the Act were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\"><em>\u201cAny transaction pursuant to an offer directed by the offeror to not more than twenty-five persons </em>(other than those designated in paragraph (8)) <em>in this State during any period of twelve consecutive months, </em>whether or not the offeror or any of the offerees is then present in this State, if the seller reasonably believes that all the buyers in this State, other than those designated in paragraph (8), are purchasing for investment; but the Commissioner may by rule or order, as to any security or transaction or any type of security or transaction, withdraw or further condition this exemption, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>increase or decrease the number of offerees permitted, or waive the condition relating to their investment intent....\u201d <footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">So much for the history of the Act. We turn now to the statute under which the prosecution was brought in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>THE LAW.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The current Maryland Securities Act, codified in Maryland Corporations and Associations Code Annotated, Title 11 tracks to a great extent its predecessor, Article 32A. It is safe to say, but for very few substantive changes, the recodification under Title 11 produced only stylistic alterations. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the 1962 Act remains intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Corporations Art. \u00a7 11-101 (o) defines \u201cSecurity\u201d in 141 words, a net decrease of five (5) words since the original Act of 1962. <em>See </em>n. 7, <em>supra. </em>Section 11-101 (o) now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">\u201c(o) <em>Security. </em>\u2014 (1) \u201cSecurity\u201d means any:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">(i) Note;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">(ii) Stock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">(iii) Treasury stock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">(iv) Bond;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-15\">(v) Debenture;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-16\">(vi) Evidence of indebtedness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-17\">(vii) Certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-18\">(viii) Collateral-trust certificate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-19\">(ix) Preorganization certificate or subscription;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-20\">(x) Transferable share;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-21\">(xi) Investment contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>(xii) Voting-trust certificate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">(xiii) Certificate of deposit for a security;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">(xiv) Certificate of interest or participation in an oil, gas, or mining title or lease or in payments out of production under the title or lease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">(xv) In general, interest or instrument commonly known as a \u201csecurity\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">(xvi) Certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase any of the preceding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">(2) \u201cSecurity\u201d does not include any insurance or endowment policy or annuity contract under which an insurance company promises to pay money either in a lump sum, periodically for life, or some other specified period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The appellant, Richard D. Hohensee, was charged in an eight count indictment with violating the Maryland Securities Act. Although the indictment was handed down in June 1976, the matter did not proceed to trial until April 1978. Hohensee was convicted of violating Corporations art. \u00a7 11-402.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\u201cIt is unlawful for any broker-dealer or issuer to employ an agent unless the agent is registered. When an agent terminates a connection with a broker-dealer or issuer or terminates those activities which make him an agent, the agent and the broker-dealer or issuer shall promptly notify the Commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">An \u201cagent,\u201d according to section 11-101 (b) (1), is \u201can individual other than a broker-dealer who represents a broker-dealer or issuer in effecting or attempting to effect the purchase or sale of securities,\u201d but the meaning of \u201cagent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>does not \u201cinclude an individual who represents an issuer in: ... (ii) Effecting a transaction exempted by \u00a7 11-602 of this title....\u201d \u00a7 11-101 (b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The statute, as did its predecessor, contains a section that exempts certain transactions from the breadth of the Securities Act. Current Title 11, \u00a7 11-602 declares in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cThe following transactions are exempted from \u00a7\u00a7 11-205 and 11-501 of this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">(9) Any transaction under an offer directed by the offeror to not more than 25 persons, other than those designated in item (8) of this section, in this State during any period of 12 consecutive months, whether or not the offeror or any offeree is then present in this State, if the seller reasonably believes that all the buyers in this State, other than those designated in Item (8) of this section, are purchasing for investment, but the Commissioner by rule or order, as to any security or transaction or any type of security or transaction, may withdraw or further condition this exemption, increase or decrease the number of offerees permitted, or waive the condition relating to their investment intent....\u201d <footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Subsection 8 of section 11-602 is identical to that contained in the old law. <em>See </em>n. 15, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Sections 11-205 and 11-501 provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u00a7 11-205:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">\u201cThe Commissioner by rule or order may require the filing of any prospectus, pamphlet, circular, form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>letter, advertisement, or other sales literature or advertising communication addressed or intended for distribution to prospective investors, including clients or prospective clients of an investment adviser, unless the security or transaction is exempted by Subtitle 6 of this title.\u201d <footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00a7 11-501:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cIt is unlawful for any person to offer or sell any security in the State unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">(1) It is registered under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">(2) The security or transaction is exempted under Subtitle 6 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The penalty prescribed for violating any provision of the Act is \u201ca fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both.\u201d \u00a7 11-705 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">In 1968, the appellant and his wife purchased approximately 130 acres of land near Winchester, Virginia and began to operate a trailer camp under the name of Magic Mountain. Appellant was an incorporator and director of the Virginia corporation, Magic Mountain Recreation Area, Inc. Four years later, the appellant formed a limited partnership to sell investment shares in his trailer camp. The partnership was known as Magic Mountain Park Limited Partnership. Appellant selected one James K. Brewer to sell the shares for appellant. Brewer, however, did not register with the Maryland Securities Commission as an agent for Magic Mountain Limited Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Fred G. O\u2019Fiesh, the Assistant Securities Commissioner for Maryland, told the jury in the circuit court that the records of the State Securities Division had \u201cno records of any registration of Magic Mountain, Inc. as a limited partnership----\u201d Moreover, Brewer \u201cwas never registered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>an agent by the Division for Magic Mountain.\u201d The records of the Division were also negative as to appellant\u2019s registration. The sale of limited partnership shares required registration. An inference may be drawn from the transcript of O\u2019Fiesh\u2019s testimony that he referred the matter of the sale of the unregistered limited partnership shares by an unregistered agent to the Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">When O\u2019Fiesh was interrogated relative to section 11-602 (9), he explained that the limitation to twenty-five offerees meant that the offering was a small closed one \u201cwithout any public solicitation. They want to permit... [a] man to raise his additional capital to expand his business without the necessity of registration which requires time, effort and expense.\u201d The witnesss further said, \u201cThat section [11-602 (9)] has been supplemented by a rule which now has a thirty-five purchaser concept____\u201d He added, \u201c[I]f one of the offerees can be determined not to be sophisticated and knowledgable [s/e] with respect to the venture, that also knocks out the possibility of exemption,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Brewer identified himself at trial as an \u201cindependent insurance agent.\u201d He acknowledged that he had pleaded guilty to a felony charge in 1977 in Montgomery County. The charge was \u201cselling a security without a license.\u201d As part of the disposition in that case, Brewer agreed to testify in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Brewer told the jury that he met appellant \u201cthrough\u201d a Quentin Adams. Adams advised Brewer that appellant was \u201cinterested in developing a park.\u201d A meeting occurred \u201cin the fall of 1972\u201d with appellant. It was agreed that Brewer and his then partner were to receive \u201cten percent\u201d commission on each sale of a limited partnership interest, in addition to \u201ca small ownership\u201d of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Brewer testified that he, his partner and four salesmen did sell limited partnership shares in Magic Mountain. He said that he, personally, made \u201ctwelve to fourteen\u201d offerings. The four salesmen made \u201cnot more than half a dozen\u201d offerings. There may have been three sales in addition to those made by Brewer, and they were separate from the \u201chalf dozen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>offers.\u201d Brewer sold six to eight interests to individuals in Maryland. The sales were for three thousand dollars ($3,000) each, \u201cof which fifteen hundred was to be put up in cash.\u201d A note was taken for the balance. The total dollar value of the shares sold by Brewer, his partner and the salesmen \u201cwas in the neighborhood of a little over $43,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">During cross-examination, Brewer said that while shares in the limited partnership originally sold for $3,000 each, they were \u201craised to forty-five hundred\u201d: three thousand dollars ($3,000) cash and a note for fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500). Brewer never told appellant that he, Brewer, was not a registered agent in Maryland for the purpose of selling securities. In fact, he related that because of a prior registration with a broker-dealer he thought he was permitted lawfully to sell the limited partnership interest. Moreover, he believed it was \u201ca private placement,\u201d and that it did not \u201chave to be registered.\u201d Brewer stated there were not more than \u201ctwenty-eight, thirty investors,... [so as to stay] within the framework of what we thought to be the law.\u201d Brewer testified that thirty-five to forty would be an accurate figure as to the total number of offerees.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">When asked how many offers were made outside of Maryland, Brewer replied, \u201cPercentage-wise, maybe half; <em>fifty percent of the offers were made outside of the State of Maryland.\u201d </em>The trial judge then asked, \u201cFifty percent in the State and fifty percent outside of the State?\u201d Brewer answered, \u201cRight. <em>Outside the State does not include the District of Columbia.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Later on, in response to the questions \u201cHow many offers did you make in the State of Maryland? Do you have any way of telling?\u201d Brewer admitted, \u201cNot really.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Because appellant did not \u201cregister the limited partnership\u201d by filing it in the appropriate courthouse, Brewer and his group \u201ccalled a halt to ... [the] selling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The record indicates that the appellant proposed to file the limited partnership agreement when all the shares available for sale were sold. Matters never reached that point, however, because with the exit of Brewer and his crew, the \u201cMagic\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>was gone and the \u201cMountain,\u201d figuratively speaking, fell on appellant Hohensee in the form of an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In this Court, the appellant strongly contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">It is apparent from the testimony that the sale of the limited partnership shares fell within the exemption set out in section 11-602 (9) in that offers were made, according to the evidence produced by the State, to thirty-five to forty persons, half of whom were outside the State of Maryland. No more than 17 to 20 offers were made within Maryland. Moreover, Brewer treated the District of Columbia as being part of the State of Maryland in arriving at the 17 to 20 figure. Thus, Brewer\u2019s estimate is grounded on a false premise. Nevertheless, if we accept it as true, <em>arguendo, </em>the number of offerings is still less than the twenty-five permitted by section 11-602 (9).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The employment of Brewer as an agent, by the appellant, was for the purpose of making offers of sale of an exempt transaction. That being the situation, it was immaterial that the agent was not registered with the Securities Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The count of the indictment upon which appellant was convicted specifically charged that the appellant unlawfully employed an unregistered agent, but as we have seen the evidence shows that there was no need for the agent to be registered because the offering was exempted from the ambit of the Maryland Securities Act by section 11-602 (9).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">In our view, the evidence failed to demonstrate that the appellant was guilty of the offense charged.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In fact, the evidence clearly established that he was not guilty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>offense charged because of the exemption conferred by section 11-602 (9). The motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count I should have been granted.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Montgomery County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\">.

The Revisor\u2019s note states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\">\u201cThis section formerly appeared as Article 32A, \u00a7 27. The only changes are technical changes in style.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\">. The statute provides in section 11-604 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">\u201cIn any proceeding under this title, the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is on the person claiming it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The constitutionality of the burden of proof proviso is not raised on appeal. We do not decide it. <em>But see </em>Evans v. State, 28 Md. App. 640, 349 A. 2d 300, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>278 Md. 197, 362 A. 2d 629 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\">. Regardless of whether the appellant carried the \u201cburden\u201d of proving that the transactions in the instant case were exempted from the Securities Act, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the \u201cburden\u201d was met. <em>See </em>n. 19, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\">. If we had not reached this result today, we, nonetheless, would be constrained to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. The record clearly shows that the trial judge imposed a two-year sentence, which he then suspended, thereafter imposing a two-year term of probation, subject to the special condition that Hohensee pay the Public Defender\u2019s fee. After determining what amount the appellant was able to pay, the court increased the term of probation to three years. While conditioning probation on payment of the Public Defender\u2019s fee is permissible, Md. Ann. Code art. 27A, \u00a7 7 (g), <em>c.f., </em>Haynes v. State, 26 Md. App. 43, 337 A. 2d 130 (1975), the increase in the term of probation violated Rule 774 (b). That rule gives the trial court broad revisory power over the sentence for a period of ninety days. However, the rule patently lorbids any increase m the sentence, consequently, the increase m the term of probation was impermissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
