After a hearing pursuant to the Anne Arundel County Zoning Ordinance, the zoning hearing officer issued an Order of denial. Upon appeal by the petitioners to the County Board of Appeals, the applications were granted by a divided vote, one member dissenting. Upon appeal by the protestants, residents of adjacent Pasadena, Maryland, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Williams, J.) affirmed the action of the Board of Appeals, finding \u201cfairly debatable\u201d the issue of mistake in the original zoning of the property. The protestants below appeal. For the reasons stated, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">The 67 acres here involved are located on the south side of Knollview Drive, 1,000 feet north of Bayside Beach Road in the Alpine Beach Subdivision of Anne Arundel County, with approximately 2,000 feet of frontage on the east and west sides of Alpine Beach Road. The site is partially wooded. The portion to the west side of Alpine Beach Road, somewhat more than one-half the total acreage, contains no structural improvements. The east side has approximately 400 feet of water frontage on the Patapsco River at the point where it enters Chesapeake Bay. This section of the property was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>for a number of years as a public bathing beach; and a number of vandalized structures formerly used as beach facilities repose there. The land area on the eastern boundary of the site fronts, for approximately 1,200 feet, on Boyd Pond. Beyond Boyd Pond is Bayside Beach, the nearest residential community.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The appellee, Ralph C. Boyd, became the contract purchaser of the acreage in 1970 but, because of extensive litigation, he did not acquire legal title to the property until January, 1977. Not long thereafter, these applications were filed. The zoning reclassification was essential because the property was zoned R2 and, under the Anne Arundel County Zoning Ordinance, a commercial recreational campground is permitted by special exception in only the RA and R1 districts. The appellee proposed the installation of approximately 250 campsites which would utilize about one-half of the property, in the area generally west of Alpine Beach Road. The remainder of the property would be used for recreational purposes, including bathing at Alpine Beach and boating at Boyd Pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The site was included in a comprehensive zoning for the northern portion of the third assessment district which commenced in 1971. Its somewhat complicated zoning history included six maps, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">FIRST: A \u201csuggested map\u201d dated October 4,1971 formulated by the Office of Planning and Zoning, in which the entire property was designated R2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">SECOND: A map recommended by the Planning Advisory Board dated June 19, 1972, as a result of \"prefiles\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before the Board. Again, the site was designated R2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">THIRD: A map adopted by the Anne Arundel County Council on October 2, 1972, effective December 21, 1972. The map split the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>designating the west side of Alpine Beach Road R1 and the east side R2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">This was accomplished by Amendment No. 7 of Bill No. 136-72, a legislative enactment which was the subject of a court challenge. In the case of <em>Anne Arundel County v. </em>Moushabek, 269 Md. 419, 306 A. 2d 517 (1973), it was held that 83 amendments to the bill, adopted by the Council on the day of the enactment of the ordinance, were invalid because no hearing on the amendments had been held as required by Section 307 (d) of the County Charter. The court ruled, however, that the ordinance was severable from the in validly adopted amendments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">FOURTH: A \u201crecommended map\u201d dated May 8, 1973, preliminary to the reinstitution by the Council of the comprehensive zoning process, following the decision of the Court of Appeals in the <em>Moushabek </em>case. The previous R1 and R2 designations were retained for the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">FIFTH: A map adopted by the County Council, as part of Bill No. 52-73, on May 8,1973, again showing the site as R1 and R2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">This was an emergency bill designed to repeal what remained of Bill No. 136-72, and to re-enact it with the provisions of the 83 amendments stricken by the Court of Appeals in the <em>Moushabek </em>case incorporated directly into the text of the new law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">SIXTH: \u201cReferendum Approved\u201d map, effective November 5,1974, in which the subject property was designated R2 in its entirety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">Emergency Bill No. 52-73 was not challenged in the courts as had been Bill No. 136-72. The opponents of the Council\u2019s new ordinance petitioned it to Referendum <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, on November 5, 1974, the voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of Anne Arundel County decisively rejected Bill No. 52-73. The combined effect of the litigation and the referendum was concisely stated by Judge Levine in <em>Ritchmount Partnership v. Board of Supervisors of Elections for Anne Arundel County:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201cAs a result of our holding in <em>Moushabek, </em>Bill No. 136-72 in its unamended form became the operative law. It was this version of Bill No. 136-72 that the County Council attempted to repeal by emergency Bill No. 52-73 in July 1973. And consequently it was this unamended version of Bill No. 136-72 which was automatically reinstated after Bill No. 52-73 went down to defeat at the hands of the electorate in 1974.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">283 Md. 48, 65, 388 A. 2d 523 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In the proceedings below, the hearing officer found that no evidence of \u201cchange\u201d was introduced and that the property owners\u2019 case became \u201cone of mistake or error alone.\u201d On that issue, he found no evidence of mistake to support a reclassification from R2 to Rl. On appeal, the County Board of Appeals received in evidence a recommendation of the Office of Zoning and Planning in which certain \u201cconsiderations\u201d concerning \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cmistake\u201d factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>were set forth. These included the statement that sewer service was anticipated during the comprehensive zoning process of 1971, to be available by 1981 for the area in which the subject site is located; but that the current sewer map adopted March 7, 1977 designated the area to be served between 1989 and 1997 and, therefore, \u201cthe R2 zoning ... is based in part on misapprehension\u201d and the revised projected date \u201cwould support a lower residential classification.\u201d The Office concluded therefore that it \u201cwould not be adverse to the granting of this application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Board\u2019s majority opinion reviewed the testimony of Ralph C. Boyd, one of the owners of the property, Joseph L. Peeler, Jr., a consulting engineer, and Gene E. Floyd, a real estate consultant and appraiser. The testimony of 12 opposing witnesses was also summarized, as was the testimony of Larry Burkins, principal zoning analyst for the Office of Planning and Zoning of the County. In its statement of findings, the majority considered \u201cmost significant\u201d the weight given to the availability of public water and sewer in classifying low density residential property and stated that the updating of the sewer map, projecting sewer services for the area in the period 1989 to 1997, supported reclassification of the property to Rl. The majority also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cThis board finds that zoning by referendum failed in this case to take into account the unique physical characteristics of this parcel. This constitutes error sufficient to change from R2 to Rl.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">With respect to the request for a special exception, the Board found that the application met the requirements of the County Code and ordered that the special exception to permit a recreational campground be granted subject to specified conditions. The dissenting member expressed the position that the evidence of mistake was insufficient to support the reclassification. Her dissenting opinion stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201ca) Although the status of sewer has changed, in effect, <em>a possible error in the Master Plan for sewer does not constitute a mistake in zoning.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Z\">b) Public sewer is not necessary for the Ra, Rl or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>R2 Residential Districts, but is a requirement for R5 Residential Districts (Section 13-306).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The court below, in a written opinion, agreed with the protestants that there was no evidence of change in the neighborhood to justify the zoning reclassification. On the other hand, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cIt is, however, clear from the record and particularly from those portions of the testimony quoted herein that there was testimony of <em>mistake in the original zoning </em>and that the Board was presented with facts that made the issue of mistake fairly debatable.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">It is from this finding that the protestants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">It is fundamental law in Maryland that to grant a zoning reclassification, the zoning authority must find evidence of mistake in the original zoning or comprehensive rezoning or that there has been substantial change in the character of the neighborhood. There is a strong presumption of the correctness of comprehensive rezoning. Consequently, the burden of proving mistake or change is a heavy one. <em>Stratakis v. Beauchamp, </em>268 Md. 643, 652-53, 304 A. 2d 244 (1973); <em>Boyce v. Sembly, </em>25 Md. App. 43, 49-50, 334 A. 2d 137 (1975). There is also a presumption of the correctness of piecemeal rezoning but it is \u201cnot so potent as the presumptions of comprehensive zoning or rezoning.\u201d <em>Bonnie View Country Club, Inc. v. Glass, </em>242 Md. 46, 52, 217 A.2d 647 (1966). The scope of appellate review of zoning reclassifications is also well defined. Simply stated, \u201cit is not the function of the courts to zone or rezone....\u201d <em>Germenko v. County Board of Appeals, </em>257 Md. 706, 711, 264 A. 2d 825 (1970). Judicial review is limited to a determination of whether the evidence presented to the zoning authority made the question at issue \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d <em>Offutt v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>204 Md. 551, 562, 105 A. 2d 219 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Another rudimentary proposition, overlooked in the proceedings below \u2014 except by the dissenting member of the Board of Appeals <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 and by the parties on this appeal, is that there is a vast difference between a master plan for sewer and a comprehensive zoning or rezoning. As Judge Levine stated for the Court of Appeals in <em>Pattey v. Board of County Commissioners, \u201ca </em>master plan is only a guide and is not to be confused with a comprehensive zoning, zoning map, or zoning classification. [Citations omitted.] <em>It is a \u2018mistake\u2019 in the latter, not in the master plan, which may support a rezoning.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 271 Md. 352, 360-61, 317 A. 2d 142 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In <em>Pattey, a </em>large number of Worcester County residents appealed from a Circuit Court decision affirming zoning reclassifications of 1,870 acres of agricultural and conservation la\u00f1d located in the fourth election district of that County. The Circuit Court determined that the rezoning should be upheld on the basis of mistake as well as change. The Court of Appeals reversed. On the issue of mistake, the Court noted that the error on which the trial court had predicated its decision \u201cwas that made by the planning consultant in recommending that \u2018too much land [be] reserved under an agricultural classification.\u2019 \u201d As a result, the opinion of the Court continued, \u201cthe trial court took the planners to task rather than the county commissioners, who adopted the agricultural and conservation classifications for the subject property in 1965.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">There is a clear parallel between the so-called mistake, vehemently litigated by both sides on this appeal, and the \u201cerror\u201d which the court rejected in <em>Pattey. </em>Here, the mistake claimed by the appellee, as applicant for a local map amendment and a special exception, was predicated upon projections contained in the master plan for sewer for the area of Anne Arundel County in which the subject property is located. These projections, we glean from the record, originated in the Office of Planning and Zoning. During the comprehensive rezoning process which commenced in 1971, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the sewer map adopted by the County Council on December 15, 1969, revised as of September 1, 1971, showed that the area in which the subject property is located was anticipated to be served by 1981. The sewer map which was current at the time of the applications below, was adopted March 7,1977 and changed the period of projected service to between 1989 and 1997. It was upon this basis that the appellee\u2019s expert consultant and appraiser, Gene E. Floyd testified \u2014 albeit with some ambivalence \u2014 that the existing R2 zoning classification was a mistake, on the theory that R2 carried with it a presumption of sewer availability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The basis for the theory expressed by Mr. Floyd, that R2 carries with it a presumption that sewer is available, is not disclosed in the record. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201c[T]he utility situation, when this was made up, suggested that the utilities were to be available in a five year plan. I must add that that is incorrect....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Whether it is change, error \u2014 it is a matter of semantics. Whatever you want to call it, obviously, the Council did not, in 1972, have the insight to know that sewer was not going to be available in 1977 or 1980, and it was going to be moved back. It doesn\u2019t meet an R-2 as set out by the Council in their normal deliberations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Similarly, Larry Burkins, the County\u2019s principal zoning analyst, Office of Planning and Zoning, testified that the County Council and the Office of Planning and Zoning when \u201cgoing into the comprehensive zoning process, tries (sic) to establish trends and projections of when things will occur.\u201d In response to a question as to whether the information with respect to sewer was incorrect, or represented a change, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\"><em>\u201cNow it is a mistake in that our projections or trends were off. </em>It is a change, in that the change</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u2014 although it is not an actual physical change, it is a change in policy or whatever determines what area will be sewered or what area is feasible to be sewered.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">That the Board of Appeals relied substantially upon the master plans for sewer is evident from its finding that \u201cmost significant is the weight given to the availability of public water and sewer utilities in classifying low density residential property.\u201d That the Circuit Court placed heavy reliance upon the expert opinions of Mr.' Floyd and Mr. Burkins in finding the issue of mistake \u201cfairly debatable\u201d is clear from the court\u2019s opinion and the extensive quotations from their testimony contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We recognize that expert testimony, as well as a technical staff report of a planning agency, may constitute probative evidence in a hearing upon an application for a zoning reclassification which may be sufficient to make the issue of mistake or change fairly debatable. <em>Montgomery v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>263 Md. 1, 8, 280 A. 2d 901 (1971); <em>Surkovich v. Doub, </em>258 Md. 263, 272, 265 A. 2d 447 (1970). However, as Chief Judge Prescott stated for the Court of Appeals in <em>Miller v. </em>Abrahams:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201c[A]n expert\u2019s opinion is of no greater probative value than the soundness of his reasons given therefor will warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">239 Md. 263, 273, 211 A. 2d 309 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">In the instant case, it is quite plain that the experts based their testimony of mistake upon a false premise, failing to distinguish between a master plan for sewer, which is only a guide and subject to change, and a comprehensive zoning ordinance. <em>See Pattey v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>271 Md. at 360, <em>citing Nottingham Village v. Baltimore County, </em>266 Md. 339, 354-55, 292 A. 2d 680 (1972), <em>Chapman v. Montgomery County, </em>259 Md. 641, 644, 271 A. 2d 156 (1970), <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Edmonds, </em>240 Md. 680, 685, 215 A. 2d 209 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Furthermore, it is fundamental that the evidence before the zoning authority to support a reclassification based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>mistake must establish that the mistake was \u201cbasic and actual\u201d and made \u201c <em>\u2018at the tim\u00e9 </em>the property was zoned....\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Pattey v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>271 Md. at 361. In addition, \u201cthe \u2018mistake\u2019 alleged to have occurred must relate to the <em>specific property </em>for which the zoning is sought, and may not consist of generalities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Applying these standards, we find error in the proceedings below for another fundamental reason. There is no evidence in the record of \u201cbasic and actual\u201d error at the time the property was zoned in 1972. It is presumed that the placement in 1971 of these 67 acres \u2014 as well as an undetermined amount of additional acreage \u2014 in a ten-year program, represented a reasonable, prudential judgment, <em>at that time, </em>on the part of the planners and the County Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The record does not document the reasons for the subsequent change in the master plan for sewer. We deem it a fair inference, however, that growth and development factors between 1971 and 1977 led logically to a revision of the sewer guidelines in 1977, postponing by 8 to 16 years proposed service to the area in which the 67 acres are located. This modification of sewer programming might well have motivated the Board of Appeals to deny a reclassification of the subject property to some higher density \u2014 particularly to R5 which requires sewer \u2014 had such a reclassification been sought, <em>Montgomery County v. Pleasants, </em>266 Md. 462, 467, 295 A. 2d 216 (1972); but it does not substantiate a claim, in a piecemeal down-zoning proceeding, that a mistake was made at the time of comprehensive zoning when the property was zoned R2.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Evidence sufficient to overcome the correctness of the comprehensive zoning was not adduced. <em>See Boyce v. Sembly, </em>25 Md. App. at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Since we find no basis for the claim of mistake and there is no contention that the zoning classification may be justified on grounds of change, the action of the lower court and of the County Board of Appeals must be reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; ease remanded for entry of an order reversing the decision of the County Board of Appeals for Anne Arundel County; appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\">. The record does not explain this term but it appears to refer to tentative requests for zoning classifications made by property owners prior to comprehensive zoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-13\">. In <em>Ritchmount Partnership v. Board of Supervisors of Elections for Anne Arundel County, </em>283 Md. 48, 388 A. 2d 523 (1978), the Court upheld the constitutionality of Article III, Section 308 of the Charter of Anne Arundel County, pursuant to which the referendum of Bill No. 52-73 was held. <em>See also </em>Anne Arundel County v. McDonough, 277 Md. 271, 354 A. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>788 (1976) in which the court held that the notice requirements of the Maryland election laws were applicable to a referendum of 41 amendments to another comprehensive zoning ordinance and that the summaries of the referendum questions on the ballot did not conform to the requirements of the election laws.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">A referendum involving piecemeal rezoning withstood constitutional challenge in <em>Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., </em>426 U. S. 668 (1976). That case involved the rezoning of an 8-acre parcel from industrial to multi-family high-rise use, in which the U. S. Supreme Court reversed the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s determination that a mandatory referendum provision in the City Charter violated federal due process guarantees. <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>Referendum Zoning: The State and Federal Issues and a Suggested Approach, </em>60 Marq.

Both appellants and appellee take the position in their briefs that the zoning was accomplished by the referendum in 1974.
