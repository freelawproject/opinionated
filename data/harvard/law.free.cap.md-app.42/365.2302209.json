Pasker, testified to that which constituted the conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201cA We went into the house and met with Greg. And then we went up to his room which is located in the attic. We began a drug related conversation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">Q Just tell us what the conversation was between-you and the Defendant? What did you talk about? What did you say and what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">A He said, \u2018Do you have anything for your head?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">MR. EVANS [Defense Attorney]: I object. Who is this that says this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">THE WITNESS: Gregory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">MR. EVANS: Said what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-14\">THE WITNESS: \u2018Do you have anything for your head?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-15\">BY MR. COLE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-16\">Q What happened next.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-17\">A I said \u2018No. That is what we are here to see you about.\u2019 And Gregory said he didn\u2019t have anything at that time, but if we came back or called him around 5:00 he would see what he could do for us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-18\">Q He said come back or call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-19\">A Around 5 that afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-20\">Q Did you do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-21\">A Yes. At about 5 that afternoon I returned to the house. Again with Dennis, we went into the house and into the kitchen. And Gregory said he didn\u2019t have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>anything at that time, but he had talked to Ralph Quincy Richardson and that he had two quarter-tees of crank for sale, which means he had a quantity of methamphetamine for sale. And that he would meet us at the Howard Hotel in Elkton to make the transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">Q Did he say anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">A He also said that he would call at that time and tell him that we were on our way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">Q Okay. Now, did you go to the Howard Hotel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">A Yes, I did. I arrived there at approximately 5:30 and I met with Ralph Quincy Richardson at that location. I identified myself that I had just talked to Gregory Amos, and asked Richardson if Amos had contacted him, at which time he said, \u2018Yes, he did.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">A Richardson and I then went into the bathroom, at which time he said he had two quarter-tees of crank. And I asked him what the price would be. And he said $30 to me. I produced a $20 bill and a $10 bill and handed it to him, at which time he removed from his shirt pocket a silver cigarette case and had a pack of Kool cigarettes there. And on the side or in the bottom of the case he had two small packages of methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">Q And they were \u2014 what happened to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">A I then took them into my custody, and subsequently had them analyzed by a certified chemist for the State of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">While this evidence is admittedly thin, it is sufficient evidence from which a factfinder could infer a conspiracy. In <em>Kelley v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 251 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 716 (1971), the facts were surprisingly similar. There, a police officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">\u201c T said, \u2018Do you have any grass that you would like to sell?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>He said, \u2018My brother has some, but he\u2019s not home right now.\u2019 Then on top of that he said, \u2018But I know a guy that might have some. If you want to come in, I\u2019ll call him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelley v. State, </em>12 Md. App. at 253, n. 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Kelley then called the source, relayed the messages and went with the officer to vouch for him. The transaction was consummated, and as here, no evidence was adduced that Kelley participated in the proceeds. This Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201cthe jury could have found from credible evidence before it that appellant at his own suggestion called Yeager and arranged for the sale of marijuana to Morton. This agreement between appellant and Yeager that the drug be sold to Morton resulted in the unlawful combination, as charged, to commit the crime proscribed by Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 277,' then in effect, and the conspiracy was complete. Compare <em>Randolph v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 89. Whether or not appellant thereafter shared in the profits or received some other consideration is not material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Appellant seeks to distinguish <em>Kelley </em>because of his limited participation in the actual transaction. He contends that he did little more than give gratuitous advice to the trooper at the trooper\u2019s importunacy, <em>i.e., </em>he made inquiries solely on behalf of the trooper. But that is his interpretation of the facts proven without allowance for logical inferences which may flow from those facts. If jurors could not infer elements of dishonesty from borderline conduct, few, if any, conspiracy convictions would occur. <em>Id. </em>at 257-258. The difficulty, of course, is that the law of conspiracy is broad enough to ensnare innocent acts shaded with corrupt appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Over one hundred and fifty years ago the Court of Appeals decided that every conspiracy to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act for an illegal purpose which has a tendency to prejudice the public, is at common law an indictable offense. <em>State v. Buchanan, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 317 (1821). If the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>case at bar is considered thin, it appears abundant when compared to some of the examples given in <em>Buchanan, e.g.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">\u201cSo in <em>The King </em>vs. <em>Leigh and others, (Macklin\u2019s Case,) </em>2 <em>Macklin \u2019s Life, </em>217, in which it was held, that an indictment would lie for a conspiracy to impoverish an actor, by driving or hissing him off the stage; and in <em>Clifford </em>vs. <em>Brandon, 2 Campb. </em>358, it was said by Sir James Mansfield, that \u2018though the audience had a right to express by applause or hisses their sensations at the moment, yet if a body of men were to go to the theatre, with a settled intention of hissing an actor, or even of damning a piece, there could be no doubt that such a deliberate preconcerted scheme would amount to a conspiracy, and that the persons concerned in it might be brought to punishment.\u2019 There the preconcerted scheme alone, the unexecuted conspiracy, was held to be indictable; but if put into execution, according to circumstances, it would be a riot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346-347.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We will, therefore, not reverse without retrial, because the evidence was sufficient to have sustained the verdict. However, finding evidentiary error of a prejudicial nature, we will reverse and remand for retrial. <em>State v. Boone, </em>284 Md. 1, 13-14 (1978); <em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u2014 chain of custody \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">If appellant were to be convicted of conspiracy to distribute a quantity of methamphetamine, a controlled dangerous substance, as charged, the proof must equal the charge. The testimony set forth above \u2014 without more \u2014 would have been sufficient. The actual transaction conspired need not have transpired. Execution is not requisite, <em>Buchanan, supra </em>at 355; the gist of the conspiracy is an unlawful combination and no further overt act is required to constitute the crime. <em>Kelley, supra; Jones v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 370, 375-378 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">But, presumably, because the evidence was inferentially equivocal, the State chose to bolster it by showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>consummation of the overt act conspired. To further substantiate the testimony that the sale took place as set up by appellant, the State sought to introduce the methamphetamine purchased by the officer, then to prove by a chemical analyst that it was indeed methamphetamine. In short, the State sought to corroborate the testimony of the trooper and to enlarge the scope of inferential culpability by introducing the real evidence of the crime appellant had conspired to have perpetrated, <em>i.e., </em>by presenting to the jury the controlled dangerous substance itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">To be admissible, however, this \u201creal evidence\u201d must be in substantially the same condition that it was in at the time of the crime and must be properly identified. 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 635 (13th ed. C. Torc\u00eda). Although there is a natural inference or presumption of continuance in the same condition, that inference varies in each case with the nature of the subject matter and the time element. <em>Nixon v. State, </em>204 Md. 475, 482 (1954); 2 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 437 (1) (3d ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Whether real evidence is in the same condition as at the time of the crime so as to permit admissibility is not entirely a discretionary matter with the court, <em>Nixon, supra </em>at 483; although the circumstances surrounding its safekeeping in that condition in the interim need only be proven as a reasonable probability. <em>Breeding v. State, </em>220 Md. 193, 199 (1959). The proof negating the probability of changed conditions between the crime and the trial, is spoken of as proving the chain of custody, and in most instances is established by accounting for custody of the evidence by responsible parties who can negate a possibility of \u201ctampering\u201d and thus preclude a likelihood that the thing\u2019s condition has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In a narcotics\u2019 case, the heart of the crime is that the seized evidence is legally proscribed, and this of necessity requires expert analysis of the thing seized. Obviously, the identifying guarantee that the hard evidence seized is unchanged between the time of seizure and the trial is not as important as establishing that the thing seized is the same analyzed and introduced at the trial as a proscribed drug. When drugs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>submitted to police laboratories for analysis, and held in drug lockers with/\u2018say two hundred [other specimens] to be tested,\u201d there is far greater risk of misidentification than there is of changed conditions. It is the assurance that the substance analyzed and introduced was the same substance purchased by Trooper Pasker that appellant contends was not established with even \u201creasonable probability\u201d in this case. The State attempted to negative the possibility of mistake by establishing a \u201cchain of custody\u201d but it fell short of connecting the links.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Trooper Pasker testified that after purchasing the drug in two small packets, he locked them in a brief case which was locked in his car trunk until the next day when he delivered them personally to the chemist, a M. Patricia Sullivan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cQ All right. Now, when did you \u2014 you took them into your custody and when did you deliver them to the chemist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">A I would like to look at the lab report here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">Q Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">A I delivered them to M. Patricia Sullivan, Certified Chemist for the State of Maryland, on the 21st, the day following, at 1:40 P.M.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">As further explained, he pointed out that the two packets were sealed in an orange evidence envelope which he identified as being the one he turned over to Ms. Sullivan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">\u201cQ I show you State\u2019s 1 for identification. Can you identify it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">A Yes, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">Q Will you please do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">A This is the envelope in which I placed the two packages of methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">Q Are they still in it or \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">A They are still in here, and it is sealed by the official seal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">Q Of the chemist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-18\">A Of the Criminal Laboratory of the Maryland State Police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Q Okay. And you delivered that particular package with its contents to Miss Sullivan at 1:40 P.M. on the 21st?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">A Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">On cross-examination he repeated his procedure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cUntil the next day when I went to Headquarters. Then I took my \u2014 I unlocked the trunk and took my case out and went into the office, and unlocked the briefcase. I got one of these orange evidence envelopes, placed the stuff in there and filled out all of the information, and I sealed the envelope myself. I then carried it personally to the Maryland State Police Laboratory Services Section where it was turned over to Mary Patricia Sullivan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">But when pressed for proof of this transfer to Ms. Sullivan, the officer first waffled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cQ I am not talking about the Court. You say you gave something to somebody. Who did you give the stuff to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">A To M. Patricia Sullivan, the Certified Chemist for the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">Q All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">A It was stamped on there at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">Q Did M. Patricia Sullivan give you a receipt for what you gave her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">A She stamped this and I also had another receipt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">Q All right. Well, the best evidence would be the other receipt. Where is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">A I suppose that it is in my desk in Pikesville or \u2014-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-17\">Q Why wouldn\u2019t it be in the file in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">A Through my own neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-19\">Q And what this is is just a time stamp, just received in the Crime Lab. Does this say who it is received by?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>A Yes. It is also signed by the chemist below my name, indicating the chain of custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">Q Well, that is what it is signed. But I am not interested \u2014 anybody could sign anything. I am asking you: You gave it to this girl?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">A She will be in to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">Q Answer my question. It is not what she will be. I asked you. You gave it to this girl and she signed for it, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">Q All right. But you didn\u2019t get this \u2014 this is just a chain of custody. And then I suppose she gave it back to you later, huh? Did you actually hand it to this one girl?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">A We have a procedure.\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyB\">then abruptly changed his story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cQ Just answer my question and then you can say anything you want to say about your procedure. I asked you: Did you actually deliver, hand deliver it to this Sullivan woman or girl? Just answer yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">Q No. And when it came back to you, did she personally hand deliver it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">A Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-16\">Q But you didn\u2019t hand deliver it to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-18\">Q You don\u2019t know whose hands it went in or where it went after you put it there? Who did you give it to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-19\">A Trooper First Class Howard Presnell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-20\">Q Where is he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-21\">A He is assigned to the Laboratory Services Section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-22\">Q Well, he is not here today, is he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-23\">A I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Q I mean you would know whether he came up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">So, this thing, you don\u2019t really know where it went between the time it left your hands, when you gave it to Trooper Presnell, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">A Presnell \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">Q So you didn\u2019t really deliver it to the Lab at all, you gave it to Trooper Presnell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">A I delivered it to the Lab.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">Q But you gave it to somebody named Presnell, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">Q And Presnell is not here to say what he did with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Since the only purpose of a chain of custody is to verify that the evidence is the same obtained at the time of the crime, appellant called upon the officer to describe what he had purchased.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">\u201cQ. Is there any way, other than what you have told us, that these are not pills, but some sort of a powder, is that correct? It is a powder substance, is that what it is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">Q All right. What color is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">A It is off-white,- like Coffee Mate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">Q An aspirin is sort of off-white, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-18\">A No, I would say that is pure white.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-19\">Q But there are a lot of known CDS? ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-20\">A Really like Coffee Mate. That is almost the exact color.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-21\">Q So, you got it back. Now, how do you know if this is a powder \u2014 that the same powder you got back is what you turned in? Is there any way you can tell it other than you say it was in the envelope?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-22\">A The chemist who will testify later can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-23\">Q We don\u2019t want you to testify what the chemist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>will testify to. How many chemists are down in this lab?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Appellant\u2019s obvious concern came from the fact that he had unsuccessfully tried doggedly to have the trooper open the sealed envelope and identify the contents as being the same which he had placed therein for analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cQ You should have shown it to us. Why don\u2019t we take a look at it. Do you have it here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">A It was submitted into evidence. Yes, here it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">Q I haven\u2019t seen it. And we have an envelope, but there might be nothing in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">MR. COLE: It will be opened when the chemist gets here, Billy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">MR. EVANS: I want to see what it is now, and see if there is anything in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">MR. COLE: I don\u2019t know what is in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">MR. EVANS: Maybe there is nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">MR. COLE: It could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">BY MR. EVANS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">Q Did you see anything in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-16\">A There is something in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-17\">MR. EVANS: Let\u2019s open it. Do you want me to open it, if you are afraid to open it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-18\">MR. COLE: Judge, what will this do about our chain is the only problem I am running into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-19\">THE COURT: Do you propose to open it, Mr. Cole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-20\">MR. COLE: The chemist will open it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-21\">THE COURT: What is in there, two white packets of white powder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-22\">MR. EVANS: I want to see if there is anything in it at this time. The Jury is here and \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-23\">THE COURT: The Jury will still be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-24\">MR. EVANS: I understand that. And I think I have a right to have it opened at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>THE COURT: Well, you can call this Witness back and question him after it is opened, if you wish, as a State\u2019s Witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">MR. EVANS: Your Honor, there is no way \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">THE COURT: It isn\u2019t necessary that the Defense Counsel have everything that he wants, nor is it right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">MR. COLE: We plan to open it with the chemist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">MR. EVANS: If you can direct me to anything in the law that says that a piece of evidence that I can\u2019t ask to have it opened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">THE COURT: It isn\u2019t even in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">MR. EVANS: Excuse me. If you had said that, I would concede. The envelope is identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">The contents of the envelope have not been identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">THE COURT: The envelope is in for identification, Mr. Evans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-13\">MR. EVANS: The envelope is and the contents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-14\">THE COURT: And contents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-15\">MR. COLE: That comes later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-16\">MR. EVANS: Then we can\u2019t see the contents. How can it be identified? It is very simple.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-17\">THE COURT: The envelope contains contents, Mr. Evans, and it is in for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-18\">MR. COLE: That is as far as we have gone so far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-19\">MR. EVANS: Well, we are sort of bandying words. But I think if the envelope is in, the contents you say are in, and we ought to see them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-20\">THE COURT: They aren\u2019t in, sir, except for identification. You, as a lawyer, know the difference between identification and evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>MR. EVANS: You tell me what I know as a lawyer, and sometimes you and I don\u2019t agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">THE COURT: That is very often the case, particularly when you are trying a criminal case and I am sitting here as a Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">MR. EVANS: You have the upper hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t have the upper hand,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">Mr. Evans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The judge was in error. He did have the upper hand, and he did deny the identification. The purpose of marking an exhibit for identification is so it may be identified, since its admissibility has not been adequately established. As appellant rhetorically asked, if a witness is not allowed to see the contents, \u201c[h]ow can it be identified?\u201d Had the trooper been permitted to view the contents, that would have been some measure of assurance that the evidence he had given to someone, but gotten back from Ms. Sullivan prior to trial, was the same he had purchased from Richardson. If there is an inference that the evidence obtained at the crime is the same analyzed and introduced (as there is an inference that such evidence\u2019s condition remains the same), that inference has been dispelled by the trooper\u2019s equivocation and the refusal to let him identify the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Attempting to overcome this difficulty the State introduced, over objection, the chain of custody report. That report contradicted the officer\u2019s most recent testimony that he had delivered the evidence to an Officer Presnell, but reestablished that he had delivered it to, and received it back from, Ms. Sullivan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">\n<em>\u201cEVIDENCE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">\n<em>Tfc Michael H. Pasker #248710-20-77 5:35 PM M. Patricia Sullivan 10-21-77 140 PM</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">\n<em>Tfc Michael H. Pasker #248711-17-77 1052 AM\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">The court admitted the log but recognized its limited value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-16\">\u201cMr. Evans,,I know it is in contradiction. I know that. But that doesn\u2019t make this piece of paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>inadmissible. He is telling you where he signed that he gave it to Sullivan and he got it back from Sullivan. Now, I realize he told us that he gave it to Presnell. So does the Jury. And it doesn\u2019t make it inadmissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Finally Ms. Sullivan was placed on the stand to clear up the dilemma of whether Trooper Pasker had delivered the evidence directly to her or to Trooper Presnell. Ironically, although the envelope was still only identified and not admitted, <em>she </em>was allowed to open the envelope and describe its contents, but that, of course, did not serve to guarantee that what she had received was that which Pasker had purchased.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201cQ O.K. Now, will you open the envelope and tell us what\u2019s inside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">MR. COLE: Sounds like an Oscar award, find out what\u2019s inside the envelope. I don\u2019t even know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">MR. EVANS: Be surprised if there\u2019s nothing in there, too, won\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">MR. COLE: You\u2019re darn right. I\u2019ll be the first to yell, \u2018Surprise.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">BY MR. COLE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">A O.K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">Q Found something, another envelope?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">A It contains a manila envelope initialed by me, and two plastic packets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-14\">Q O.K. Could you see it\u2019s plastic? They\u2019re quite small, aren\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-15\">A Uh-huh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-16\">But finally the big moment: from whom did Ms. Sullivan obtain the evidence, Trooper Pasker or Presnell? The answer \u2014 a new development \u2014 neither one.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-17\">\u201cQ O.K. O.K. Now, you received this envelope containing the packets when, again, the lab really received it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>A The lab received it on the 27th of October.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Q And when did you pick it up and make your test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">A Well, I picked it up at the front desk when it came in. I didn\u2019t analyze it until the 1st of November.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">Q Who did you get it from? Do you remember who was on the front desk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">A Let\u2019s see \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">Q If you can remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">A Well, since it\u2019s initialed on the front, it was originally accepted in by Jay Tobin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">Q Yeah, and who was there? Tobin is your Chief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">Q He gave it to who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">A He gave it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">Q O.K. Now, who would be the police officer who received it first, if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">A No. He would have received it first. Apparently there was nobody else out at the front desk at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">But even before appellant could cross-examine her, the evidence was admitted, over an objection based upon improper chain of custody.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: The question is whether the chain of custody is probably accurate and doesn\u2019t have to be precise. That\u2019s why I was asking that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-21\">MR. EVANS: I object to it for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-22\">THE COURT: I note your objection and it may be well-taken, Mr. Evans. I don\u2019t know. You have other objection beside chain of custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-23\">MR. EVANS: Well, I don\u2019t know at this time whether \u2014 as to the admission? I only have, we\u2019ve got, the State\u2019s put on two witnesses, both testified, diametrically opposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-24\">THE COURT: This concerns chain of custody. I\u2019m asking if there\u2019s anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>MR. EVANS: Not at this time, and I think that\u2019s critical of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">THE COURT: All right. I\u2019ll overrule your objection. Mark it in evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Despite that setback, the appellant persisted, but Ms. Sullivan, unlike the trooper, stood by her recollection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">\u201cQ Miss Sullivan, you\u2019ll have to educate us, I guess, a little bit on chemistry and things, and also the further handling of this particular item. You\u2019ve told us that it was delivered to you by Mr. J. O. Tobin, who is the head chemist down there. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">A It was delivered to me at the front desk, yes. It was probably by Jay Tobin. The only reason I mentioned him is because he has initialed the blue sheet, which means that he accepted it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">Q Did Officer Presnell initial, do his initials appear on that sheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">A No, they don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">Q Not at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-15\">Q Well, if he\u2019d handled it, it should\u2019ve had his initials on there, shouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAe\">A It probably would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-17\">. Q Well, is there ever any mix-up in this down there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-18\">A No. They\u2019re usually not put on chain of custody because they don\u2019t actually do anything with the evidence but process it in and send it back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-19\">Q That\u2019s all Mr. Tobin did in this case, was process it in while you think Presnell was out to lunch. That\u2019s your conjecture, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-20\">A All I\u2019m saying is that Jay processed it in. Where Trooper Presnell is is \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-21\">Q O.K. All right. And then he delivered it to you while he was still at the front desk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Q And you took it where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">A Back into the drug locker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">Q All right. And how many specimens would be in the drug locker at any one time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">A Let\u2019s see, approximately, I would say two hundred to be tested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The confusion was at least partially attributable to the intermittent interweaving of the testimony, during the course of trial, in front of the jury. That fact does not alter the failure of the State to identify or even to link inferentially the evidence sought to be admitted to that obtained as a result of the sale set up by appellant. This failure, of course, affected the very relevance of the chemist\u2019s testimony, and while its absence would not have affected the minimal sufficiency of a conspiracy conviction, it had such obvious persuasive effect that its admissibility cannot be said to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Although for purposes of admissibility the chain of custody authentication of evidence need not be beyond a reasonable doubt, it must create a reasonable probability of sameness, just as in a like instance it must preclude by reasonable probability, any tampering. The evidence here was never identified as being the same or similar to that obtained by Trooper Pasker, and instead of supporting an inference of sameness, the State threw out four conflicting possibilities in a multiple choice evidentiary game for judge and jury to choose from. The procedure either went</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">from Pasker to Sullivan; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayd\">from Pasker to Presnell to Sullivan; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5G\">from Pasker to Tobin to Sullivan; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arh\">from Pasker to Presnell to Tobin to Sullivan,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">and in any of the four, the State would have its inference of sameness supported. But in the absence of both Presnell and Tobin, the only thing reasonably probable was that whatever Ms. Sullivan analyzed <em>she </em>obtained from Tobin and returned to Pasker. Between Pasker and Sullivan there is far too much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>speculative possibility without the testimony of Presnell or Tobin to establish its identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The remaining pro se issues were reviewed and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and ease remanded for retrial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Cecil County.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
