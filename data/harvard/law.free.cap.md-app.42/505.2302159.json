Rowe is 89 years old. She formerly lived in Davidsonville, in Anne Arundel County, but she now is in a nursing home. She has six children \u2014 five daughters and a son.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">In January, 1974, with Melissa\u2019s written consent, and with the express or tacit consent of her other children, Melissa\u2019s son Marvin petitioned the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to have Melissa declared a person under disability and to have himself appointed as guardian of her property. Melissa was alleged to suffer from \u201cgeneralized arteriosclerosis with infirmity and cerebral arteriosclerosis with intermittent cerebral insufficiency\u201d, an allegation that was supported by the certificates of two physicians. Her disability was alleged to be a physical rather than a mental one; and, upon Melissa\u2019s consent, her nomination of Marvin as guardian, and the two physician\u2019s certificates, the court made the requested declaration and appointment. Most of Melissa\u2019s property at the time consisted of about 90 acres of land in Anne Arundel County having a value of some $150,000. That is what everyone seems to be fighting about.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">In June, 1975, appellant, one of Melissa\u2019s daughters, filed a lengthy petition (which she amended in November, 1975) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>seeking (1) removal of her brother as guardian, (2) an accounting, (3) rescission of certain deeds of trust and releases, (4) to have her brother, her nephew, the lawyers who represented Melissa and the guardian, and others made \u201cparties defendant\u201d in the proceeding, and (5) other relief. In this petition and amended petition appellant made a number of allegations of very serious wrongdoing which, <em>if true, </em>would not only warrant removal of the guardian, but would likely justify a variety of civil proceedings and possibly criminal action against a number of other people as well. She accused her nephew (Melissa\u2019s grandson) of converting Melissa\u2019s assets to his own use; she accused several lawyers of most serious conflicts of interest and both active and passive complicity in schemes to defraud Melissa and to misappropriate her assets; and she accused her brother of mismanagement, conflict of interest, and worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">These petitions touched off a proceeding, or series of proceedings, that dragged on over a three-year period before four judges of the circuit court, and produced a record (excluding depositions and transcripts of hearings) exceeding 1,630 pages. The end of all this came on May 22, 1978, when the court dismissed appellant\u2019s petition against all defendants <em>with prejudice. </em>What is before us, of course, is the correctness of that action; and, to resolve that issue, we must consider who and what was before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Notwithstanding the assertion in her petition and amended petition that she was acting on behalf of her mother, her brother and sisters, and herself, appellant maintained throughout most of the proceeding that she was acting as a statutory \u201cinterested person\u201d solely on behalf of Melissa and the guardianship estate, and not in her own interest. But in that limited capacity of \u201cinterested person\u201d, she filed exceptions to accounts and reports prepared by the court auditor, as well as extensive interrogatories, demurrers, motions for summary judgment, requests for subpoenas duces tecum, and a host and variety of other pleadings of one type or another. Through counsel, she participated in the taking of depositions and in at least three hearings in open court, all conducted at her request. When her nephew, one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>those persons named by her as a \u201cparty defendant\u201d went into bankruptcy, she requested and received leave to file a claim in the bankruptcy on behalf of her mother and the guardianship estate. It is fair to say that the entire proceeding in the circuit court, from beginning to end, was occasioned by and was in response to the charges leveled by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In the course of these protracted proceedings, and in large part through the discovery efforts of appellant, a mass of documents was brought before the court. Some of these documents were merely placed routinely in the court file, as appendages to pleadings of one type or another; others were more directly brought to the court\u2019s attention, and even placed in evidence at one of the several hearings conducted along the way. In November, 1976, at a hearing on certain law motions then pending, including appellant\u2019s exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, appellant had two groups of documents pertaining to the 1974 deed of-trust sought to be annulled admitted into evidence in support of her exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In June, 1977, appellant filed with the court a 46-page \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d (supplemented by a 2-page \u201cSupplemental Statement of Facts\u201d) to which was appended 143 pages of exhibits laying out in great detail all of the alleged wrongdoings on the part of the various people she caused to be named as defendants in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">A month later, a hearing was held with respect to some of the staggering array of pleadings and motions then open. At that hearing, the court observed that the allegations set forth in appellant\u2019s pleadings were serious ones and would have to be answered. They sufficed, said the court, to shift the burden to the \u201cdefendants\u201d to show that their actions had been proper ones; and that would require a hearing on the merits \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>to determine whether appellant\u2019s charges were, in fact, valid. In connection with that hearing, the court also noted that appellant \u201cwould have to introduce formally at the hearing those matters that constitute the file. They would have to be introduced as exhibits.\u201d Counsel for appellant, apparently in recognition of this requirement, offered the originals of his various exhibits at this \u201cpreliminary\u201d hearing, but was told, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we wait until the hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>merits and then do that. We\u2019ll just clog up our files with them....\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On at least two occasions, appellant had formally asked the court to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Melissa, and periodically bemoaned the fact that this had not been done. On January 3, 1978, the court appointed \u201ccounsel\u201d for Melissa, but that appointment was rescinded shortly thereafter. Instead, on January 25,1978, <em>appellant </em>was appointed as guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and her attorney was appointed as counsel for her, as such guardian. In this new capacity, appellant promptly filed a 17-page motion seeking summary judgment that the two deeds of trust were null and void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While pursuing all of these requests for affirmative relief, including, as noted, the filing of extensive interrogatories, she resisted any effort on the part of the defendants to engage in their own discovery, in particular refusing to answer interrogatories served upon her. Her defense seemed to be that she was not a \u201cparty\u201d upon whom interrogatories could be served. When the court ruled that she would have to answer the interrogatories, her counsel sent a letter to the court (with a copy to the Commission on Judicial Disabilities but not to other counsel) \u201cformally resigning] as a natural and non-statutory individual party, specifically retaining all statutory positions to which she has been appointed or approved by Court Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Finally, after denial of several last-minute motions by appellant, trial was set for May 22, 1978. This proceeding commenced with appellant taking the stand and testifying that her mother was <em>mentally </em>incompetent \u2014 so detached from reality as to be unable even to receive notice of the trial. She offered letters from two physicians supporting that assertion. Her counsel, Jerome Piven, then advised the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and the assembled parties and their counsel: (1) of his great astonishment to learn that the office or position of guardian <em>ad litem </em>\u2014 that for which he had persistently pressed and ultimately obtained for his client \u2014 had been abolished years earlier, and thus no longer existed in Maryland,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that (2) his client, as a statutory interested person, was not a party, nor a representative of a party, and thus had no status in the case. Upon this basis, after three years of pleadings and hearings, all stemming from the petitions filed by him on behalf of appellant, he simply asked to be \u201cexcused from this case\u201d \u2014 \u201c... I don\u2019t belong here. I have no power to act as an attorney here today____I\u2019m asking to be excused from this courtroom because I have no status----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Upon questioning by the court, Piven, in effect, said: Here are all these pleadings and exhibits; you, court, take care of the matter henceforth; I\u2019m out of the case. He specifically declined to offer any further evidence in support of appellant\u2019s allegations \u2014 no testimony, not the exhibits which had previously been marked and identified, not his \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d or the exhibits appended to it. In short, he left the court with no formal evidence (except perhaps the documents admitted into evidence at the November, 1976, hearing on exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report) to support his client\u2019s charges \u2014 only some 1,600 pages of pleadings \u201cfor whatever use the Court wishes to make of [them]\u201d. At that point and upon that premise, the court granted the motions made by all of the defendants that appellant\u2019s amended petition be dismissed with prejudice. It did, however, order that \u201call records from the beginning of this estate [be] turned over to the Court auditor so that there will be a full and complete audit of this estate....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Appellant, represented by different counsel, now asks this Court to strike the orders of dismissal and to remand the case to the circuit court \u201cwith appropriate instructions as to procedure in the premises.\u201d She claims that the court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>in refusing to stay the proceedings until appointment of a substitute guardian, and in requiring appellant to proceed with the \u201cpresentment of evidence\u201d. Both of these complaints relate, on the one hand, to appellant\u2019s responsibility to proceed with some evidence to substantiate her charges, and, on the other hand, to the court\u2019s overall responsibility to its ward, Melissa Rowe.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Appellant\u2019s position seems to be that, as a mere \u201cinterested person\u201d, she was entitled to bring matters pertaining to the guardianship estate to the attention of the court, but had no responsibility (or standing) to proceed any further. Having made all these charges, it was then up to the court to investigate them, obtain and evaluate the evidence, and grant the relief requested by her. Such is patently <em>not </em>the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">As an heir of Melissa, appellant was, and is, an \u201cinterested person\u201d in terms of the guardianship. Estates and Trusts article (hereafter \u201cE.T.\u201d) \u00a7 13-101 (i). As such, she \u201cmay invoke the jurisdiction of the court at any time to resolve questions concerning the estate or its administration.\u201d E.T. \u00a7 13-203 (d). She is authorized, specifically, to file a petition for an accounting, to remove the guardian, and for the granting of \u201cother relief\u201d (E.T., \u00a7 13-210 (a)), which is precisely what she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The law provides that upon such a petition, \u201c[u]pon hearing after notice <em>and upon good cause shown, </em>the court may issue an appropriate order.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) E.T. \u00a7 13-210 (c). The critical word here is \u201cshown\u201d \u2014 the court may act when good cause has been <em>shown, </em>when the cause has been <em>proved, demonstrated. </em>This is done by the presentation of evidence. A court may not, under \u00a7 13-210 (c), pass substantive and final orders supported only by bald allegations, or by documents or assertions that are not in evidence. When presented with a petition such as was filed here, its obligation is to conduct a hearing so that the complaining party can produce evidence in support of his complaint and so that the parties complained about can have an opportunity to defend themselves. This is what due process is all about. This is what the statute requires. Under the circumstances that pertained here, and faced with Mr. Piven\u2019s sudden and obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>unanticipated exodus from the case, the court was not wrong in dismissing appellant\u2019s amended petition. It could not have granted the relief prayed absent some further evidence to establish the alleged wrongdoing; and there seemed to be no one willing to proceed with that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">It <em>was </em>wrong, however, in dismissing the amended petition <em>with prejudice, </em>because that might serve to preclude any further inquiry into the allegations made in it. A guardianship is not an ordinary type of lawsuit in which the court\u2019s role is merely that of fact-finder and adjudicator. It has a much deeper involvement \u2014 a much more significant function \u2014 in a guardianship proceeding. As stated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Kicherer v. Kicherer </em>(Sept. Term, 1978, No. 109, Opinion filed May 4, 1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201cLest sight be lost of the fact, we remind all concerned that a court of equity assumes jurisdiction in guardianship matters to protect those who, because of illness or other disability, are unable to care for themselves. In reality the court is the guardian; an individual who is given that title is merely an agent or arm of that tribunal in carrying out its sacred responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\"><em>See also </em>39 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Guardian and Ward, </em>\u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Quite apart from any allegations by appellant, the court\u2019s own file in this case reflected the fact that the guardian had never, over the three-year period of his guardianship, rendered a proper account of his actions, as required by Maryland Rule V74 and E.T. \u00a7 13-209. Especially when coupled with the charges made by appellant, that fact alone should have spurred the court, on its own motion, to inquire into both the affairs of the guardianship and Mr. Rowe\u2019s fitness to continue as guardian. Moreover, with respect to one of the challenged deeds of trust, the court had before it documents, apparently valid on their face, indicating that:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">(1) the mortgage was executed in May, 1974 \u2014 five months <em>after </em>creation of the guardianship;</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">(2) it was not executed by Marvin Rowe as guardian who (in that capacity) was vested with tjtle to Melissa\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>and was the only person who validly could execute such a deed of trust at that time (E.T. \u00a7 13-206);</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">(3) it was executed instead by Melissa herself, who had no power to do it, and by Marvin Rowe and his wife, individually;</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">(4) the interest rate on the mortgage was 12% (plus five \u201cpoints\u201d) which, unless the transaction were in some way exempt from the State usury law in effect at the time, would have made the loan a usurious one; and</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">(5) the lawyers who represented Melissa in her affairs prior to the guardianship, and who continued to represent the guardian with respect to guardianship matters, also represented the mortgagee, John Hanson Savings &amp; Loan, Inc., and acted as settlement attorneys; indeed, one such lawyer was shown as a director and member of the Executive Committee of the Association and actually voted to make the loan. He also served as a trustee for the Association under the deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The validity of this deed of trust, and the underlying note for $55,000 was obviously of critical importance to the guardianship estate, and to Melissa herself. If not valid, payments made on it might have constituted a waste of guardianship assets, especially in light of appellant\u2019s further allegations that the proceeds of the loan had been misappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">We shall not describe the other allegations made by appellant in any greater detail. Suffice it to say that these charges alone, coupled with the documents in the court\u2019s own file, and of which it was made aware, required an answer \u2014 not merely a pleading, but an explanation on the record. The court is not expected, as the judge suggested, to descend from the bench and act as a prosecutor; but neither may it forever foreclose an inquiry into these matters by dismissing the petition <em>with prejudice. </em>Charges of wrongdoing on the part of a guardian, or adversely affecting the guardianship estate, are, and must remain, viable until withdrawn or resolved on their merits. Perhaps the audit ordered by the court can serve as the vehicle for determining the validity of such charges as were made in this case. Perhaps some collateral proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>may be the vehicle to resolve some of these, issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If neither suffices to permit the court to carry out its supervisory responsibility, it will have to act upon its own motion in some other way, <em>and </em>promptly!</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">As an editorial comment, we observe that this is the type of case that necessarily brings discredit upon the whole legal and judicial community. It may turn out that the charges made by appellant are absolutely groundless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But it should not take nearly four years to find out.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\n<em>Orders and final decrees vacated; case remanded to Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (1) to enter orders dismissing amended petition without prejudice and (2) for further proceedings as may be required in conformance with this opinion; costs to be paid half by appellant, half by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">. A number of documents that were produced in court that day in response to appellant\u2019s subpoena duces tecum were marked for identification as petitioner\u2019s exhibits but were not formally admitted into evidence, despite counsel\u2019s request that they be so admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\">. The grounds for this motion were essentially those asserted in appellant\u2019s earlier motion for summary judgment, which had been denied by the court, the basic difference being that this second motion was filed by her as guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\">. <em>See </em>comment to Maryland Rule 205 e. There has been no provision for a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for at least nine years. Some of the confusion in this case might have been avoided if counsel and the court had kept even moderately current on the Maryland Rules of Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\">. We were advised at oral argument that the mortgagee has attempted to foreclose on the disputed deeds of trust, and that their validity has been brought into issue in the foreclosure proceeding. As a result, and in light of our conclusion that appellant\u2019s amended petition should be dismissed, it is not necessary for us to reach the issue of whether appellant would have standing to challenge the validity of the mortgages in the guardianship proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\">. A swift resolution of these complaints is in everyone\u2019s interest. At oral argument, counsel for appellees lamented the fact that they never had the opportunity to present their defense to appellant\u2019s charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
