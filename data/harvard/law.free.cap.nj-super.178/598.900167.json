J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">The issue on this appeal is whether plaintiff (Resorts), a gambling casino operator licensed under the Casino Control Act (act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-1 <em>et seq., </em>can recover $1,500 in credit extended to defendant on his issuance of three $500 checks, despite the fact that the checks were not deposited in the time required by <em>NJ.S.A. </em>5:12-101(c) and one check was undated, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(b)(2). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(f) provides that any check \u201ccashed, transferred, conveyed or given in violation of this act shall be invalid and unenforceable.\u201d Resorts contends that notwithstanding the invalidity of the <em>checks </em>drawn by defendant, plaintiff may sue on the underlying obligation incurred by defendant, of which the checks are mere evidence, as provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-802(l)(b) of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cIf the instrument is dishonored action may be maintained on either the instrument or the obligation ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">The essential facts in this case are not in dispute. On July 3, 1978 defendant signed and issued three separate instruments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>forms furnished by Resorts (referred to in the industry as counter checks or \u201cmarkers\u201d) to the order of Resorts. Each was drawn on defendant\u2019s bank, New Jersey Bank of Westwood, in the sum of $500. It is not disputed that in exchange for these checks credit was given to defendant in the form of cash or chips to enable him to gamble in plaintiff\u2019s casino. Two checks were dated by \u201cpit clerks\u201d on the transaction date, July 3,1978, but one check remained undated until July 30, 1978, when that date was inserted by plaintiff\u2019s \"cage manager,\u201d Gary Thompson. All three checks were deposited with plaintiff\u2019s bank for collection for the first time on or about July 30, 1978. The checks were returned unpaid by defendant\u2019s bank because of insufficient funds in the account. Thereafter, plaintiff communicated with defendant in an effort to obtain payment but was unsuccessful, and this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Clearly, subsection (c) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2was violated by plaintiff\u2019s failure to deposit each check for collection within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>seven banking days of the date of the transaction. This subsection allows a casino operator to hold a check for less than $1,000 for seven banking days. A delay of 14 days is allowed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>checks from $1,000 to less than $2,500, and 90 days for checks in the sum of $2,500 or more. Subsection (b)(2) was also violated with respect to the undated check. That subsection requires every check to be \u201cdated, but not postdated.\u201d It is possible, as the trial judge found from unclear answers to interrogatories furnished by plaintiff, that subsection (b)(3) was also violated. This section requires that checks be presented \u201cto the cashier or his representative\u201d to be exchanged only for a credit slip or slips which \u201cmay be presented for chips at a gaming table.\u201d However, we find it unnecessary to resolve this issue in view of the clear violation of the deposit requirements of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>5:12-101(c) as to all checks and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(bX2) as to the undated check.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On cross-motions for summary judgment in the trial court, Judge Thomas Franklin, ruled in favor of defendant. He reasoned that the Casino Control Act intended \u201cstrict\u201d regulation and control of licensed gambling activities \u201cto further ... public confidence and trust,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-l(b)(6) and (13); that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(a)(l) prohibits a casino operator from cashing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>any check or making any loan or giving any credit to enable a person to gamble unless certain conditions are met, and that, in addition to voiding the checks themselves, noncompliance with the conditions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101 prevents an \u201cunderlying obligation\u201d from coming into being and becoming enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We concur with Judge Franklin\u2019s reasoning and result. As he noted, the public policy of this State has traditionally opposed enforcement of gambling debts. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:40-3; <em>Schwartz v. Battifarano, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>478, 483-84 (1949) (a judgment based on a gambling transaction declared void by statute is subject to collateral attack); <em>Fisher v. Brehm, </em>100 <em>N.J.L. </em>341, 345-346 (E. &amp; A. 1924) (despite the Negotiable Instruments Law, a check or note given to pay a gambling debt \u201cis not a negotiable instrument\u201d and cannot be enforced by a holder in due course). Our Supreme Court has more recently enforced a gambling debt, evidenced by checks, lawfully contracted in Puerto Rico. <em>Caribe Hilton Hotel v. Toland, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>301 (1973). However, in tracing the history of our public policy toward gambling, Justice Mountain concluded that \u201cour policy has become one of carefully regulating certain permitted forms of gambling while prohibiting all others entirely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. Indeed, only by constitutional provision or amendment can any type of gambling be lawfully conducted in this state, subject to approved \u201crestrictions and control.\u201d <em>N.J.Const. </em>(1947), <em>Art. </em>IV, \u00a7 VII, par. 2. While gambling in licensed casinos has been legalized, the Legislature has imposed strict conditions for advancing credit and cashing checks to facilitate such gambling. It provided that no licensee \u201cmay accept a check, other than a recognized traveler\u2019s check or other cash equivalent, from any person to enable such person\u201d to gamble unless specified conditions are met, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(b), including condition (4), namely, that \u201c[t]he regulations concerning check cashing procedures are observed by the casino licensee.. .. \u201d The question, therefore, is whether the language of the act and the purposes to be served sufficiently indicate that no obligation can arise from an extension of credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>upon the issuance of a player\u2019s check unless the act\u2019s conditions are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">As plaintiff contends, gambling in a licensed casino is now a lawful activity, and \u201cgambling debts\u201d properly reflected by checks are no longer unlawful. As noted above, plaintiff contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-802(l)(b) authorizes an action upon the underlying obligation when a check has been dishonored. Recognizing that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12~101(f) declares invalid and unenforceable a check transferred in violation of the act, plaintiff argues that a mere \u201cblemish\u201d in the handling of the check should not avoid the underlying obligation to repay consideration given in good faith. Indeed, the language used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(f) is not as broad as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:40-3, which voids all \u201cpromises, agreement, notes ... securities or conveyances\u201d given in payment of or as a loan for any illegal gambling transaction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff notes that its operations are monitored by the Division of Gaming Enforcement, which has authority to insure compliance with the requirements of the act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-76 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-79; and plaintiff contends that these enforcement procedures are sufficient to insure compliance with technical requirements for handling players\u2019 checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We do not find a solution to this problem in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-802. That section applies to negotiable instruments governed by Chapter 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code\u2014\u201cCommercial Paper.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-101 <em>et seq.; N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-102(l)(e). The essence of a negotiable instrument is that it be freely negotiable or transferable by delivery, with endorsement when necessary. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-202; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-805. Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-805 makes Chapter 3 applicable to certain negotiable instruments which are non-negotiable under the Code, namely, those \u201cnot payable to order or to bearer,\u201d see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-104(l)(d), mandating that \u201cthere can be no holder in due course of such an instrument,\u201d it permits the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tion of Chapter 3 to such instruments so that they can be treated as negotiable so far as their form permits, provided their \u201cterms do not preclude transfer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-805, New Jersey Study Comment. However, the Legislature has limited the transferability of the checks which were issued in this case essentially to transfers for collection purposes only. <em>N.J. S.A. </em>5:12-101(d) provides that such checks, even when cashed in conformity with the act, may not be transferred, conveyed or given, with or without consideration, to any person other than (1) the drawer, (2) a bank for collection or payment, or (3) an approved purchaser of the casino license. The section further provides: \u201cThe limitation on transferability of checks imposed herein shall apply to checks returned by any bank to the casino licensee without full and final payment.\u201d The checks may nevertheless be deposited for collection and are subject to Chapter 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4 101 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cBank Deposits and Collections\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-104(g) (\u201c \u2018Item\u2019 means any instrument for the payment of money even though it is not negotiable. .. \u201d). See also, Uniform Commercial Code Comment to \u00a7 3-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Therefore, we view checks given for the purpose of facilitating gambling in licensed casinos as <em>sui generis. Cf. Fisher v. Brehm, supra. </em>Whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-802(l)(b) applies or not, the question remains whether there is an underlying obligation that is enforceable. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-802(l)(b) also provides that \u201cdischarge of the underlying obligor on the instrument also discharges him on the obligation.\u201d <em>NJ.S.A. </em>12A:3-601 provides for discharge of a party from liability by various events or circumstances. Paragraph 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code Comment to \u00a7 3-601 states that discharge may be accomplished by a statutory provision applicable to an \u201cinstrument ... negotiated in a gaming transaction,\u201d meaning that the illegality of the transaction discharges the maker from liability. The maker of a nonnegotiable instrument may also assert defenses to liability that apply to ordinary contracts. See Uniform Commercial Code Comment to \u00a7 3-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>In our view, the Legislature sufficiently signified its intention to void the gambling obligation represented by these checks when it provided that only \u201cchecks cashed in conformity with the- requirements of this act\u201d shall be valid and enforceable. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(f). It is fair to say that giving credit against checks to facilitate gambling in a licensed casino is unlawful if the check cashing and collecting regulations are violated. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-122, which makes it a disorderly persons offense to violate \u201cany provision of this act the penalty for which is not specifically fixed.... \u201d We find no good reason to believe that the Legislature intended to allow enforcement of the underlying obligation for the loan while declaring the check void and unenforceable. While ordinary checks are frequently negotiated to third parties, including holders in due course, the act restricts the transfer of a player\u2019s checks so that rights of third parties, other than a successor licensee, will not arise. As between the player and the casino it makes no sense to say that the player cannot be sued on the check but can be sued on the underlying obligation. Voiding the check would be meaningless if the obligation it represents remains. Thus, we shun an interpretation of this statute that would make its express provisions meaningless. <em>See Foy v. Dayko, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 13 (App.Div. 1964), certif. den. 41 <em>N.J. </em>602 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The limitation on check collecting methods, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(d) and (e), and the restrictions on the issuance of credit by taking a player\u2019s check serve related purposes. As noted in <em>New Jersey Governor\u2019s Staff Policy Group on Casino Gambling, 2nd Interim Report </em>(1977), ready, unlimited credit can have a \u201cpernicious effect\u201d upon the compulsive or imprudent player. At 34-35. Recommended was a check-cashing system which was adopted by the Legislature to allow the use of a \u201ccurrently dated personal check, or a counter check\u201d drawn on the player\u2019s bank within verifiable credit limits, to be deposited promptly (two business days were recommended) to \u201cserve players who wish to gamble beyond their immediate cash resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. The time limit on depositing checks is clearly intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>contain the extent to which a player can pledge his future income. <em>Id. </em>The regulations are a compromise intended to serve the needs of the casinos as well as players. Nothing in the act prevents a player from establishing an account with a casino by the deposit of cash or traveler\u2019s checks which can be withdrawn freely. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Plaintiff contends that enforcing these regulations by the self-policing method of voiding the underlying obligation will make collection of all checks and markers too uncertain for the casino industry. We disagree. A casino can readily establish compliance with the conditions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101(b) and (c). Stamping the transaction date on the check would memorialize the current dating of the check. Similar practices could certify to the submission of the check to the cashier or his representative and the issuance of a credit slip to be exchanged for chips at a gaming table. Proving the date on which the check was deposited for collection presents no problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We merely hold that casinos must comply with the Legislature\u2019s strict control of credit for gambling purposes. Unless they do, the debts reflected by players\u2019 checks will not be enforced in our courts. If relaxation or clarification of this perceived mandate is desirable it can be provided by amendatory legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The judgment below in favor of defendant is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-101 in its entirety provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">a.
