J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">For the reasons set forth in our opinion in the companion case of <em>Supercade Cherry Hill, Inc., v. Eatontown, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, decided under even date, we are satisfied that ordinance 89.7.-15.3 (1979) is invalid in its exclusion from commercial zones of places of amusement involving \u201ccoin operated amusement, ... or entertainment machines.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">For the same reason and for the further reason that the permitted limit of the use of only two such machines incidental to a principal use bears no reasonable and substantial relationship to any proper and legitimate purpose that would be served by the regulations, we are convinced that this restriction also is <em>ultra vires </em>the municipality and, thus, is invalid. <em>Home Builders League v. Berlin, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>127 (1979); <em>State v. Baker, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>99 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">In view of this disposition, the variance issue has been mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Law Division is reversed and the Mayor and Council are directed to order the issuance to plaintiff of licenses for eight additional coin-operated amusement machines at plaintiff\u2019s roller rink, upon compliance with all conditions of the licensing ordinance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
