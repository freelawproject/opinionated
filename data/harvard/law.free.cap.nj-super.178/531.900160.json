S.A. </em>24:21-20(aXl)). He moved for an order suppressing evidence, a bottle of methadone, seized by Union Township police during an inventory of his automobile on Route 22 near Springfield Road in the township in the morning of October 25, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The essential facts surrounding the seizure may be briefly summarized. Officers Thomas Kramer and Robert Sabattis of the Union Township police,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who were at the time patrolling the area in a marked police radio car, stopped the 1964 Chevrolet Impala which defendant was driving westbound on Route 22 because it \u201chad an expired inspection sticker on the windshield.\u201d A registration check revealed that \u201cthe registration on the vehicle was suspended.\u201d Defendant was the sole occupant of the vehicle. A check of his driver\u2019s license revealed that it, too, had expired. Officer Kramer testified that since defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>car had stopped in the single lane \u201caccess\u201d road from Route 22 to Springfield Road and was \u201cblocking off Springfield Road completely,\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Due to the heavy roadway conditions, heavy traffic conditions and the hazardous location of the vehicle and the amount of time it would take for the driver to get his own wrecking service there, towing service, I requested the police towing to immediately remove the vehicle to prevent accidents and the traffic congestion at that loeation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Kramer informed defendant that his car was going to be towed and then \u201clooked from outside the vehicle to see if\u201d there was any \u201cphysical property that [might] be of value laying in the vehicle.\u201d He \u201cobserved a small bottle laying ... on the floor in front of the driver\u2019s ... seat.\u201d The bottle was about one-third full and contained a \u201c[p]inkish\u201d liquid. Based upon his training at the State Police Narcotics School and his experience with prisoners who were \u201con a Methadone program\u201d when arrested, Kramer believed that the contents of the bottle \u201cprobably was Methadone.\u201d He thereupon \u201cstarted an inventory of the vehicle to prepare for the tow truck.\u201d Defendant had not been asked \u201cif he wished to remove any items from his car.\u201d On \u201cfurther examination of the bottle\u201d which was found in the car, defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The trial judge granted the motion to suppress, reasoning that since defendant was not under arrest before the police inventory search procedure had begun, he \u201cshould have been given the opportunity, either to take his personal property out or accompany the car, give him a summons and accompany the car while it was going to be impounded.\u201d In arriving at this conclusion, the judge appears to have placed substantial reliance upon the holding in <em>State v. Mangold, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>575, 587 (1980), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">... if a vehicle is lawfully impounded and its owner or permissive user is present, that person must be given the option of either consenting to the inventory or making his own arrangements for the safekeeping of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>contained in the vehicle. Absent consent or alternative security provisions, an inventory may not be undertaken ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We granted the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We reverse. It is clear to us that the impoundment of defendant\u2019s vehicle was at the time entirely proper. Here, the car was blocking access to the only exit lane from Route 22 westbound to Springfield Road. The position of the vehicle was creating a hazard for other drivers and impeding traffic. Immediate action was necessary in order to protect \u201cthe public safety and the efficient movement of vehicular traffic.\u201d <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>364, 369, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3092, 3097, 49 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>1000, 1005 (1976). Defendant was not <em>lawfully </em>capable of driving the car and it would have been unreasonable for the police to wait until he could \u201cmake other arrangements for the custody of the vehicle.\u201d <em>State v. Slockbower, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4 (1979). He had at the time no valid driver\u2019s license and \u201cthe registration on the vehicle was suspended.\u201d In that situation, to allow him to drive the vehicle would have been \u201ccountenancing continuous violations.\u201d <em>State v. Roberson, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 555 (App. Div.1978), certif. den. 77 <em>N.J. </em>487 (1978); see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-4 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10. In the circumstances, \u201csubstantial necessities grounded in the public safety,\u201d <em>State v. Slockbower, supra, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 12, mandated the impoundment. <em>And see, State v. Mangold, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Beyond this, we find reliance by defendant and the trial judge on the holding in <em>Mangold, </em>at 82 <em>N.J. </em>587, that \u201c[ajbsent consent or alternative security provisions, an inventory may be not undertaken,\u201d to be misplaced. The inventory of defendant\u2019s car was undertaken on October 25, 1979, more than six months before the <em>Mangold </em>decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consistent with pertinent principles expressed in <em>State v. Carpentieri, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>546 (1980), <em>State v. Howery, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>563, 568-571 (1979), <em>cert. </em>den. 444 <em>U.S. </em>994, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>527, 62 L.Ed.2d 424 (1979), and <em>United States v. Pel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>tier, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>531, 535-537, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2313, 2316-2317, 45 L.Ed.2d 374, 380-381 (1975), we perceive no sound basis for applying the <em>Mangold </em>holding retroactively to invalidate the police inventory of the automobile in this case. On the contrary, we are entirely satisfied that consideration of the \u201crelevant factors\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> involved in determining the proper approach to the applicability of the \u201cnew variant of the exclusionary rule device,\u201d <em>State v. Howery, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 569, announced in <em>Mangold, </em>requires that this \u201cnew variant\u201d be given prospective application only. Since the impoundment and inventory were entirely valid at the time, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized during the course of the inventory should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In view of our determination, we find no need to comment on the State\u2019s contention that \u201c[t]he seizure of the methadone may be upheld pursuant to Office Kraemer\u2019s [sic] plain view observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, under review, is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent herewith. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\"> The only two witnesses at the hearing on the motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\"> The police tow truck arrived at the scene \u201cin a matter of a minute or two.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"><em> State v.
