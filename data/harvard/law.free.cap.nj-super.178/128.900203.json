J. A.

The summary judgmert declared the letter of credit cancelled and permanently enjoined the New Jersey bank from making payment of the draft. The principle issue involved is whether, as the foreign bank contends, it is entitled to reimbursement because the document submitted conformed to the terms of the letter of credit and any alleged fraud or contractual breach with respect to the document or the underlying transaction did not affect the bank\u2019s obligation to pay-</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On March 1, 1976, Peoples Trust of New Jersey, now United Jersey Bank (UJB), issued an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $166,000 for the account of Lustrelon, Inc. The beneficiary named therein was \u201cMessrs. Johann Prutscher, Vienna\u201d (Prutscher). The letter of credit was addressed to Creditanstalt Bankverein of Vienna, Austria (Credit), as the confirming bank. It was issued in connection with a contract entered into between Lustrelon and Prutscher on February 19, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Lustrelon is a New Jersey corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of plastic products. Prutscher, whose place of business was in Vienna, was the holder of a patent on corner interlock joints for plastic furniture elements sold under the trademark of \u201cLogo.\u201d Prutscher agreed to provide Lustrelon the molds and tools required to manufacture the elements and granted Lustrelon \u201cthe sole and exclusive right and license under Licensor\u2019s Know-how and Licensor\u2019s Patent Right\u201d to manufacture and sell \u201cThe System\u201d during the period of the contract. Lustrelon agreed to pay Prutscher royalties in accordance with the schedule set forth in the contract and, in addition, undertook</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">... to provide PRUTSCHER with a bank guarantee for the worth of the mould 166,000$ for the contract period. Guarantee should be sent prior to the shipment of the initial complete set of moulds and automatically becomes valid with the date of the shipments (text of guarantee as attached).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The guarantee, termed \u201cirrevocable,\u201d was intended \u201cto cover possible loss by damage [to] or physical loss of these tools\u201d and obligated Lustrelon to pay Prutscher</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>... the total amount or any part thereof upon receipt of the first written request and assigned [sic] certified statement from Messrs. Johann Prutscher, Vienna, to the bank confirming failure of Lustrelon to return moulds on first written demand from Messrs. Johann Prutscher, Vienna, and without further investigation of the legal situation to Messrs. Johann Prutscher, Vienna. The relevant sum will be remitted within a period of 14 days after receipt of such request to a bank account to be named by the beneficiary hereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Lustrelon complied with the requirement by having UJB issue the letter of credit referred to hereinabove, the proceeds of which would be available to Prutscher by a sight draft \u201caccompanied by documents specified below\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">Against a signed certified statement from Messrs. Johann Prutscher, Vienna, confirming failure of Lustrelon, Inc. to return molds as per contract dated February 19, 1976 on first written demand from Messrs. Johann Prutscher, Vienna.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The letter of credit was expressly made subject to the \u201cUniform Customs and Practice for Commercial Documentary Credits fixed by the International Chamber of Commerce (1974 Revision) Publication 290\u201d (UCP). Credit confirmed the letter of credit and sent a written acknowledgment of its confirmation to UJB.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">After receiving the tools and molds from Prutscher, and encountering difficulties in their use, Lustrelon wrote to Prutscher in August 1976 complaining of defects in the system and expressing a desire to terminate the contract and return the molds. Prutscher requested Lustrelon to return the molds via shipping agents in New York engaged for that purpose by Prutscher in early October. The molds were delivered to the agents and were ultimately received by Prutscher in Vienna on or about November 22, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">On November 19, 1976 Prutscher presented to Credit a written demand for payment under the letter of credit, with instruction to remit the amount into its account in the Gewerbe-und-Handelsbank in Vienna. The demand was accompanied by Prutscher\u2019s sight draft for $166,000 and the following statement \u201c... duly signed and confirmed by our [Prutscher\u2019s] Company\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxK\">We, Messrs. Johann PRUTSCHER, Diefenbachgasse 35, 1150 Vienna, Austria, confirm the failure of LUSTRELON, INC. to return moulds as per Contract dated 19th February 1976, on first written demand from us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Upon receipt of the draft and statement from Credit, UJB informed Credit by telex message dated November 29,1976 that the draft \u201cdoes not bear your endorsement and drawn to our order.\u201d UJB also advised Credit that Lustrelon was applying to the court in New Jersey for an injunction against payment and, since a period of 14 days was allowed for settlement, suggested that no action be taken \u201cuntil we advise you of court decision.\u201d On December 1 another telex message from UJB notified Credit that Lustrelon had obtained an order restraining payment by UJB, that further proceedings were scheduled for December 21 and that a copy of the order was being forwarded. Credit responded on December 2 that it was forwarding a duly endorsed replacement draft notwithstanding the acceptance by all bankers in this country of drafts in the form originally presented. UJB was further informed that Credit\u2019s confirmation of the letter of credit \u201cis an independent undertaking of our bank and therefore is not subject to any decisions of a court at your end,\u201d and that Credit would \u201chave to effect payment on December 13, 1976 at the latest\u201d and \u201cmust claim cover from you for our payment made under the irrevocable 1/c confirmed by us according to your instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Lustrelon cabled Credit on December 5 that the molds had been returned to Prutscher \u201cand accordingly any statement or certificate to the contrary is false.\u201d Referring to the restraining order, Lustrelon advised Credit to \u201cwithdraw demand and draft against United Jersey Bank\u201d since \u201cyou have no greater rights as alleged confirming bank [and] . .. any payment by you is at your sole risk and responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On December 6 UJB dispatched another telex message to Credit calling its attention to its counsel\u2019s advice that \u201cbeneficiary\u2019s statement dated November 19 not in proper form since not certified in accordance with terms of credit would you revert to this matter.\u201d The next communication, on December 14, was a letter from Credit to UJB reminding it of Credit\u2019s \u201cindependent obligation towards Messrs. Johann Prutscher suable against us\u201d and stating that since \u201c[f]or this reason we were obliged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>meet the liability assumed,\u201d payment of the amount of the letter of credit was made on December 14 to Prutscher\u2019s assignee, Gewerbe-und-Handelsbank. Expressing the opinion that Prutscher\u2019s \u201cstatement\u201d complied with the letter of credit and that \u201ca supplement of the statement is superfluous,\u201d Credit nevertheless enclosed a duplicate \u201cwhich is now certified in respect of its contents, too.\u201d Credit also disclosed that while the \u201clegal questions concerning the L/C\u201d were not affected by the underlying transaction and Lustrelon\u2019s claims against Prutscher, it had requested Prutscher \u201cto explain the case to us\u201d and was told that although \u201cit was true that the moulds and tools had been returned\u201d they were not sent \u201cin accordance with the contract of February 19, 1976,\u201d /. e., \u201cthe merchandise was <em>not </em>shipped in the same condition as provided in the contract.\u201d UJB was again requested to reimburse Credit for the amount paid plus its commission and charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">UJB replied on December 21. It first informed Credit that the \u201ccorrected certified statement of beneficiary referred to in our telephone conversation December 16\u201d had not yet been received. With respect to the court proceedings, UJ3 informed Credit that \u201cdespite our strong opposition and declared intent and desire to pay against proper documentation when received,\u201d the court had continued the restraint preceding the outcome of the Lustrelon-Prutscher litigation, that Lustrelon had been permitted to amend its complaint to assert certain claims against Credit and that a writ of attachment had been issued and levied upon the proceeds of the letter of credit in UJB\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">There was, as indicated, ongoing litigation during the foregoing exchange of messages. It began with Lustrelon\u2019s filing of a verified complaint against Prutscher and UJB on December 1, 1976, seeking damages from the former for breach of contract and warranty and for conversion of plaintiff\u2019s funds if payment of the amount of the letter of credit resulted from Prutscher\u2019s forwarding to UJB a certificate falsely claiming \u201cthat the molds and tools were not returned to defendant, Prutscher.\u201d As to UJB, judgment was sought enjoining it from paying the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of credit and declaring the letter of credit null and void \u201cby virtue of the fact that plaintiff has returned the tools and molds.\u201d A temporary restraining order was issued and the matter of a preliminary injunction was set down for hearing on December 15. UJB counter-claimed against Lustrelon for a judgment dissolving the restraint and declaring that it was obligated to pay the draft and entitled to be reimbursed by plaintiff. Thereafter, Lustrelon filed an amendment to its complaint adding as defendants Credit and Gewerbe-und-Handelsbank. It sought damages from Credit for allegedly improperly honoring the letter of credit despite knowledge of infirmities in and falseness of the document submitted. Jurisdiction was obtained over Credit through the execution of the writ of attachment on funds held by UJB to cover the letter of credit, and, on December 21, an interlocutory injunction was issued restraining UJB and Credit from, respectively, honoring the letter of credit and making demand for reimbursement. Credit filed an answer, cross-claim and counterclaim seeking, in substance, payment either from Lustrelon or UJB. The record does not disclose whether Prutscher answered the complaint, although the pretrial order lists an attorney as appearing on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Credit, UJB and Lustrelon all moved for summary judgment. After hearing argument of counsel, the trial judge issued a letter opinion in which he observed, initially, that a default judgment had previously been entered in favor of Lustrelon and against Prutscher in an amount in excess of $200,000 as damages for Prutscher's fraud and breach of contract. He correctly observed that the issue before the court was the propriety of Credit\u2019s honoring of Prutscher\u2019s signed draft under the letter of credit. He held the letter of credit to be void, made permanent the injunction against UJB \u201cthat no funds are due from UJB to Credit,\u201d ordered the return of the \u201cfrozen funds\u201d to Lustrelon, and entered judgment in the amount of the released funds in favor of Credit and against Prutscher. The resultant judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to the extent Credit is aggrieved thereby, is the subject matter of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The trial judge\u2019s letter opinion is seriously flawed. It is, in the first place, brimful of factfinding despite the existence of disputed issues which, assuming their relevancy or materiality with respect to the letter of credit and the rights and obligations of the parties thereunder, would clearly have required a plenary trial, thus precluding the entry of summary judgment at least to the extent of the issues involved in this appeal. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The trial judge found that Prutscher committed a fraud upon and breached its contract with Lustrelon. He also found that \u201cat Prutscher\u2019s request the forwarding agent designated by Prutscher falsely represented that the molds and tools had not been delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract,\u201d without making any inspection of the molds and tools. Apparently incensed by that which he deemed to be unconscionable conduct on the part of Prutscher, the trial judge was harshly critical of Credit for honoring Prutscher\u2019s demand for payment under the letter of credit. Characterizing the events in December 1976 as \u201cmaneuvering,\u201d the trial judge branded Credit\u2019s action as \u201creckless and ... an obvious attempt to avoid any logical determination of the merits of the litigation before this Court.\u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">It was done with full knowledge of the at least partially substantiated claims of plaintiff that the certification of Prutscher was false. It was not the right of Credit to interpret either the law of this State or the Austrian law in the light of the serious conflict of facts then before it. Aside from appearing reckless, there is the inference raised that such action by Credit, an Austrian bank, dealing with the Austrian defendant (the ultimate wrongdoer) constituted a type of unholy alliance which this Court will not accept as a mandated action under any civilized law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The trial judge found further that the Prutscher \u201ccommunication to UJB\u201d was not \u201c \u2018certified\u2019 as required by all law, including Austrian law.\u201d He said that payment by Credit to Prutscher was not \u201cforced\u201d and was \u201cimmoral and collusive,\u201d and even if payment was required under Austrian law, \u201cthis Court would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>not allow such a misuse of the law to frustrate justice in this country.\u201d The trial judge found \u201cas a fact that Credit knew of the infirmities in the documentation presented by Prutscher to UJB [sic].\u201d He also found that \u201cCredit could or would have been protected at the time by an injunction since Prutscher and Credit were within the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d The trial judge was mistaken in this regard. It is plain that Credit was not subject to the jurisdiction of the court when payment was made on December 14. The writ of attachment that was issued as process in the action was obtained on December 20, so that notice thereof, together with a copy of the complaint, necessarily could not have been served upon Credit until some time thereafter. Further, the trial judge charged, without support in the record, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">... [t]he action of Credit with the knowledge it had at the time, in attempting to force UJB to make payment even after an injunction had been sought, and in paying Prutscher or Prutscher\u2019s assignee knowing that Prutscher was committing a fraud on Lustrelon, was designed to frustrate the power of this Court and to prevent it from making a fair determination on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">It is abundantly evident that the trial judge here misconceived his function in considering the motions for summary judgment. His limited role was to determine whether there were genuine issues as to material facts, but not to decide the issues if he found them to exist. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, supra, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>at 73. This would have been particularly so in this case since, as is apparent from the trial judge\u2019s remarks, good faith on the part of the paying bank was put in question. <em>Cf. Kraftsman Container v. United Ctys. Trust Co., </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>488, 497 (Law Div. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Beyond the foregoing, the trial judge\u2019s letter opinion is deficient in its. failure to address the nature and purpose of a letter of credit and, in particular, the obligation thereunder of the issuing or, as here, the confirming bank, a clear understanding of which was critical to a proper resolution of the issues involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Letters of credit, widely used especially in international trade and commerce, are intended generally to facilitate the purchase and sale of goods by providing assurance to the seller of prompt payment upon compliance with specified conditions or presentation of stipulated documents without the seller\u2019s having to rely upon the solvency and good faith of the buyer. <em>New Jersey Bank v. Palladino, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>33, 41 (1978), <em>Intraworld Industries, Inc. v. Girard Trust Bank, </em>461 <em>Pa. </em>343, 336 A.2d 316 (Sup.Ct.1975). A letter of credit, however, may also serve as a guarantee of performance of obligations. <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. Heritage Bank, </em>595 F.2d 171, 173 (3 Cir. 1979). Such instrument is known as a \u201cstandby letter of credit.\u201d <em>New Jersey Bank </em>v. <em>Palladino, supra. </em>The laws applicable to domestic letters of credit are now contained in the Uniform Commercial Code\u2014\u201cLetters of Credit,\u201d enacted in this State as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:5-101 <em>et seq. </em>Since no one argues to the contrary, we may safely assume that the legal principles applicable to the letter of credit here involved should be as set forth in the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:5-103 defines a letter of credit as \u201can engagement by a bank or other person made at the request of a customer and of a kind within the scope of this Chapter (12A:5-102) that the issuer will honor drafts or other demands for payment upon compliance with the conditions specified in the credit.\u201d The credit may be either revocable or irrevocable. <em>Ibid. </em>Other pertinent definitions are \u201cissuer,\u201d the bank or other person issuing the credit; \u201ccustomer,\u201d the one who causes an issuer to issue a letter of credit; \u201cbeneficiary,\u201d the person entitled under the terms of the credit to draw or demand payment, and \u201cconfirming bank,\u201d a bank which engages that it will itself honor a credit already issued by another bank. <em>Ibid. </em>In the context of this case it is important to note that a \u201cconfirming bank by confirming a credit becomes directly obligated on the credit to the extent of its confirmation as though it were its issuer and acquires the rights of an issuer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:5-107(2). Another pertinent definition is found in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>12A:5-103(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>A \u201cdocumentary\u201d draft or a \u201cdocumentary demand for payment\u201d is one honor of which is conditioned upon the presentation of a document or documents. \u201cDocument\u201d means any paper including document of title, security, invoice, certificate, notice of default and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">There can be no doubt that the issuer must honor a draft or demand for payment which complies with the terms of the relevant credit regardless of whether the goods or documents conform to the underlying contract between the customer and the beneficiary. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:5-114(2). The issuer has no responsibility to monitor that contract. It must pay, provided the proper documents are presented, regardless of whether the contract has been performed. <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. Heritage Bank </em>and <em>Intraworld Industries, Inc. v. Girard Trust Bank, </em>both <em>supra. </em>The issuer need only determine whether the documents presented appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. <em>Ibid.; see, also, New Jersey Bank </em>v. <em>Palladino, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 42. In this respect both the issuer and the beneficiary are held to a standard of strict compliance and, in the absence of conformity, the beneficiary cannot force payment and the bank pays at its peril. Chase <em>Manhattan Bank v. Equibank, </em>550 F.2d 882, 886 (3 Cir. 1977). Nonetheless, setting aside for the moment the case where there is notification of fraud or irregularity not apparent on the face of the document presented, the issuer is under no obligation to ascertain and assumes no responsibility for the genuineness, accuracy or truthfulness of the document. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:5-109(2); <em>see, also, Banco Espanol de Cr\u00e9dito v. State Street Bank &amp; T. Co., </em>385 F.2d 230, 235 (1 Cir. 1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 390 <em>U.S. </em>1013, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1263, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>163 (1968). A comparable provision appears in Article 9 of the UCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">With these principles in mind we turn to a consideration of whether the document submitted h\u00e9re conformed to that called for by the letter of credit. We observe preliminarily that Lustrelon, not UJB or Credit, chose the words to be used, even though they were in substance the same as in the form of guarantee prepared by Prutscher. The document required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>presentment was a \u201csigned certified statement\u201d by Prutscher \u201cconfirming failure of Lustrelon Inc. to return moulds as per contract dated February 19, 1976 on first written demand.\u201d Undeniably, the document presented was a signed statement by Prutscher which, in the exact words of the letter of credit, purported to confirm \u201cthe failure of LUSTRELON INC. to return moulds as per contract dated 19th February, 1976, on first written demand from us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">But the trial judge, accepting the argument advanced by Lustrelon, held that the statement failed to comply with the letter of credit because it was not \u201ccertified.\u201d Whether a contrary view would have been expressed if Prutscher had said \u201cwe certify\u201d or \u201cwe certify and confirm\u201d is not indicated in the record. But, in that case, the further argument might have been made that since Lustrelon\u2019s concern was the truthfulness of the statement, which could not be assured by Prutscher\u2019s use of the words \u201cwe certify,\u201d a certification by a disinterested person was intended. Or if Prutscher had complied with what is said to be the requirement of Austrian law that the authenticity of the signature be certified by an authorized public official of that country, Lustrelon might still have argued noncompliance in that such certification would not address the factual accuracy of the statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The UCP, to which the letter of credit was expressly made subject, is designed to obviate such problems. The customs and practices defined therein, unless in conflict with mandatory provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, are valid and binding between the parties to the letter of credit. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>White and Summers, Uniform Commercial Code </em>(1972), \u00a7 18-3 at 611. Article 33, pertinent here, deals with miscellaneous documents not otherwise defined in the UCP. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">When other documents are required, such as Warehouse Receipts, Delivery Orders, Consular Invoices, Certificates of Origin, of Weight, of quality or of Analysis, etc. and when no further definition is given, banks will accept such documents as tendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">In our view, absent a definition of \u201ccertified,\u201d the document was acceptable under the UCP and should have sufficed. In any event, it appears that when UJB informed Credit that the statement was not certified, the latter obtained from Prutscher and sent to UJB on December 14, 1976, a supplemental copy of the original statement on which is typed, over the signature of \u201cIng. Anton Kornfeld,\u201d \u201cWe hereby certify the above statement to be true and correct.\u201d We are satisfied that the document submitted, if not in its original form then as supplemented, complied with the letter of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">But the conclusion we have reached on this issue is not dispositive of the appeal. There remains for consideration Lustrelon\u2019s contention that Credit failed to exercise good faith in honoring the letter of credit and supporting documents. The argument advanced is that \u201c[a] confirming bank does not act in good faith when, after the issuing bank advises it of fraud in the transaction and of a court restraint, it, nevertheless, honors the draft.\u201d This is an oversimplification and inaccurate statement of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">An exception to the general rule requiring the issuer to honor a documentary draft which is conforming on its face is found in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>12A:5-114(2)(b). Under the limited circumstances established by this section, the issuer has the option to honor or dishonor the draft, or the customer may enjoin the issuer from honoring it. The section provides that where the document which on its face appears to comply with the terms of the credit but \u201cis forged or fraudulent or there is fraud in the transaction,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>... as against its customer, an issuer <em>acting in good faith </em>may honor the draft or demand for payment despite notification from the customer of fraud, forgery or other defect not apparent on the face of the document but a court of appropriate jurisdiction may enjoin such honor. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The Uniform Commercial Code imposes a general obligation of good faith in the performance or enforcement of every contract or duty within the statute. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>12A:l-203. Unless additional requirements are prescribed by specific provision, \u201cgood faith\u201d is defined in the Code as \u201chonesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:1-201(19); U.C.C. Comment, par. 19. There are no other requirements referable to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>12A:5-114(2)(b). We have found no reported case in this jurisdiction, and none has been brought to our attention, interpreting \u201cgood faith\u201d in the context of the issuer of a letter of credit. However, in cases involving holders in due course of negotiable instruments, it has been said, with pertinency here, that \u201cgood faith\u201d as used in the Code \u201cis determined by looking to the mind of the particular holder.\u201d <em>Breslin v. New Jersey Investors, Inc., </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>466 (1976); <em>General Investment Corp. v. Angelini, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>396 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">. .. The study comment [New Jersey Study Comment IB to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>12A:3-302 at 134] points out that under the predecessor Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law various tests of good faith evolved, most courts, including New Jersey\u2019s, having adopted the so-called \u201cwhite heart\u201d criterion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cUnder this test, good faith is determined by looking to the mind of the particular holder who is claiming to be a holder in due course, not what the state of mind of a prudent man should have been. <em>[Breslin </em>v. <em>New Jersey Investors, Inc., supra </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 471]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The test, according to <em>General Investment Corp. v. Angelini, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">... is neither freedom from negligence in entering into the transaction nor awareness of circumstances calculated to arouse suspicions either as to whether the instrument is subject to some defense not appearing on its face or whether the promise to pay is not as unconditional as it appears therein ... Ordinarily where the note appears to be negotiable in form and regular on its face, the holder is under no duty to inquire as to possible defenses, such as failure of consideration, unless the circumstances of which he has knowledge rise to the level that the failure to inquire reveals a deliberate desire on his part to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that investigation would disclose a defense arising from the transaction .... [58 <em>N.J. </em>at 403-404]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>What constitutes \u201cgood faith\u201d is somewhat elusive where an issuer of a letter of credit chooses to honor a draft upon presentment despite notification by the customer of alleged fraud, forgery or other defect not apparent on the face of the supporting document. In such case, the issuer has actual notice of the claimed infirmity. Yet the Code, without further guidance, extends to the issuer acting in good faith the option of honoring the demand for payment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:5-114(2Xb). The explanatory comment does not cast much light on the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">... [S]ince these matters frequently involve situations in which the determination of the fact of the non-conformance may be difficult or time-consuming, the issuer if he acts in good faith is given the privilege of honoring the draft as against its customer, that is to say, with a right of reimbursement against him. The issuer may, however, refuse honor. [U.C.C. Comment, par. 2 at 584]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">But it is evident that since the subjective element of \u201cgood faith\u201d is \u201chonesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned,\u201d its antithesis, \u201cbad faith,\u201d must be \u201ca thing done when it is in fact done dishonestly.\u201d <em>New Amsterdam, etc., Co. v. National Newark, etc., Co., </em>117 <em>NJ.Eq. </em>264, 277 (Ch. 1934), aff\u2019d 119 <em>NJ.Eq. </em>540 (E. &amp; A. 1936). It \u201c \u2018contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with a furtive design or some motive of interest or ill will.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The term \u201c\u2018bad faith\u2019 requires a showing of some indicia of dishonest conduct or a showing of facts and circumstances \u2018... so cogent and obvious that to remain passive would amount to a deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a defect in the transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edwards v. Northwestern Bank, </em>39 <em>N.C.App. </em>261, 265-266, 250 <em>S.E.M </em>651, 655-656 (Ct. App.1979). <em>See also, Factors &amp; Note Buyers, Inc. v. Green Lane, Inc., </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 49-50 (Law Div. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Whether, in light of the foregoing, Credit <em>in fact </em>acted in good faith in honoring the documents submitted by Prutscher need not be decided by us on this appeal, nor should the trial judge have done so on the motions for summary judgment. The test of good faith is a subjective standard to be determined by the facts in each case. <em>Convalescent Home of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>First Church of Deliverance, </em>49 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>213, 221, 8 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>823, 829, 365 <em>N.E.2d </em>1285, 1291 (Ct.App.1977). Unless only one inference from the evidence is possible, the question is for the trier of the fact. <em>Community Bank v. Ell, </em>278 <em>Or. </em>417, 564 P.2d 685 (Sup.Ct.1977). We have no hesitancy in concluding that a plenary trial is required here on the issue of Credit\u2019s good faith in honoring the draft. To that end, the matter must be remanded to the trial court for consistent further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In light of the remand, we deem it useful to comment briefly on several of the trial judge\u2019s statements in his letter opinion. Credit was accused of making payment \u201cwith full knowledge of the at least partially substantiated claim of plaintiff that the certification of Prutscher was false.\u201d The trial judge said that \u201cit was not the law of this State or of Austrian law in the light of the serious conflict of facts then before it.\u201d He expressed the view that Credit should have awaited a judicial determination on the merits. If the trial judge\u2019s concept was that Credit was bound to withhold payment upon notification of the alleged falseness of the certificate, he was mistaken. As long as the documents otherwise conformed to the requirements of the credit, the bank plainly had the option under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:5114(2)(b) to honor the demand for payment, the exercise of which was governed only by the standard of good faith. Credit was not obligated to resolve the dispute between the parties. This would be so especially where, as appears to be the situation here, a question arose whether Prutscher\u2019s statement meant that the molds had not been returned, which would ostensibly have been false, or that the molds had not been returned \u201cin the same condition as provided in the contract,\u201d which undoubtedly would have provoked a factual dispute with respect to the meaning of the guarantee. An issuing bank would be \u201cplace[d] in an intolerable position if the law compelled it to serve at its peril as an arbitrator of contract disputes between customer and beneficiary.\u201d <em>Intraworld Industries, Inc. v. Girard Trust Bank, supra, </em>461 <em>Pa. </em>at 358, 336 A.2d at 327. Whether Credit took part in an \u201cunholy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>alliance,\u201d or acted \u201crecklessly\u201d or with design \u201cto frustrate the power of this Court and to prevent it from making a fair determination on the merits,\u201d or \u201cwith knowledge of fraud . .. [took] actions to frustrate morality and justice\u201d would be relevant, if at all, only upon the issue of good faith and must await a plenary trial. We express no opinion on the merits of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">So much of the judgment as declares the letter of credit \u201cterminated, cancelled and of no further effect,\u201d permanently enjoins UJB from honoring any draft presented against the letter of credit, declares that no funds are due from UJB to Credit, or in any way relates to the rights and obligations under the letter of credit of plaintiff, UJB and Credit, including the right to reimbursement, is reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing.. In the circumstances here present, we would expect such proceedings to be held before a judge other than the one hitherto involved. Jurisdiction is not retained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> \u201cTo certify\u201d or \u201ccertified\u201d is not susceptible of precise definition. <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>(5 ed. 1979), defines \u201cto certify\u201d as \u201c[t]o authenticate or vouch for a thing in writing. To attest as being true or as represented.\u201d It is to be noted that one of the definitions of \u201ccertify\u201d in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1966) is \u201cconfirm.\u201d And it has been held that the word \u201ccertify\u201d is not indispensable in a certificate. <em>State v.
