J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">It is conceded that the petition of nomination for Nelson E. Page as a candidate for the Board of Education of the Township of North Bergen contains the signatures of only ten persons, the minimum required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:14-9. It also is conceded that one of said signers has been convicted of a crime which disenfranchises him and which thus renders him not a qualified voter of the school district and thus ineligible to sign the petition, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:14-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">Although, after notice of the defect, appellant obtained additional signatures of qualified voters, the pertinent statute does not permit such defect to be cured. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:14-12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">When a nominating petition is found to be defective <em>excepting as to the number of signatures, </em>the secretary of the board shall forthwith notify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>candidate of the defect and the date when the ballots will be printed and the candidate indorsing the petition may amend the same in form or substance, <em>but not to add signatures, </em>so as to remedy the defect at any time prior to said date. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Law Division is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
