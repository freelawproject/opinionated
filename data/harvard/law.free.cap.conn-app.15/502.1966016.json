The defendant now appeals from the trial court\u2019s subsequent denial of his \u201cpetition for a new trial,\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which petition was based on his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of newly discovered evidence. The defendant\u2019s \u201cpetition for a new trial\u201d was filed as a part of the criminal proceeding below.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The resolution of this appeal requires little discussion. It is conceded by all parties to this appeal that the defendant failed to bring a separate action but instead filed his \u201cpetition for a new trial\u201d within the technical confines of the docketed criminal case. \u201cA petition for a new trial is properly \u2018instituted by a writ and complaint served on the adverse party; although such an action is collateral to the action in which the new trial is sought, it is by its nature a distinct proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>14 Conn. App. 88, 101, 540 A.2d 378 (1988), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>180 Conn. 141, 144, 429 A.2d 810 (1980). Our Supreme Court has established the rule that \u201c[t]he defendant must bring a petition under [Practice Book] \u00a7 904 [in a separate proceeding instituted by writ and complaint served on the adverse party] if he wishes to seek a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 728-30, 535 A.2d 808 (1988). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court should have dismissed the defendant\u2019s petition because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to rule on the improperly brought \u201cpetition for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">There is error in the form of the judgment, the order denying the defendant\u2019s petition for a new trial is set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the defendant\u2019s petition for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) The superior court may grant a new trial of any action that may come before it, for mispleading, the discovery of new evidence or want of actual notice of the action to any defendant or of a reasonable opportunity to appear and defend, when a just defense in whole or part existed, or the want of actual notice to any plaintiff of the entry of a nonsuit for failure to appear at trial or dismissal for failure to prosecute with reasonable diligence, or for other reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>cause, according to the usual rules in such cases. The judges of the superior court may in addition provide by rule for the granting of new trials upon prompt request in case where the parties or their counsel have not adequately protected their rights during the original trial of an action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 904 provides: \u201cA request for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence shall be called a petition for a new trial and shall be brought in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. The judicial authority may grant the petition even though an appeal is pending.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
