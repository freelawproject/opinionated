We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. On September 11, 1981, the plaintiff, while employed by the named defendant, sustained a compensable injury to her neck which was diagnosed as a cervical disc injury. On January 5,1983, the plaintiff underwent an anterior C4-C5 discectomy and fusion. The fusion required that a piece of bone from her hip be removed and grafted on the indicated vertebral bodies. The cervical fusion surgery and bone graft left surgical scars on the claimant\u2019s hip and on the front portion of her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The plaintiff sought an award under General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (d) for both scars. The commissioner determined that neither scar was compensable. The compensation review division reversed that decision, concluding that the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d exclusion of \u00a7 31-308 (d) precludes compensation only for \u201cscars resulting directly from an incision on the back\u201d and that \u201c[njeither of the scars here . . . derived from an incision on the back.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendants argue that the decision of the review division is contrary to the clear language of General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (d), which provides that \u201cno compensation shall be awarded ... for any scar resulting from . . . any spinal surgery.\u2019\u2019Claiming that this language is unambiguous, the respondents urge us to rely upon that well established principle of statutory inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>pretation which requires \u201cthat statutory language is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning. . . . [I]f the language of the statute is clear, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature and there is no room for judicial construction of the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u201c \u2018The objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981). Although it is axiomatic that, where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, construction of the statute by reference to its history and purpose is unnecessary; <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Manchester Police Union, </em>3 Conn. App. 1, 6, 484 A.2d 455 (1984); that axiom only applies in full force \u2018[wjhere . . . the language of a statute is . . . <em>absolutely </em>clear\u2019 on its face and where no ambiguity is disclosed by reference to its background. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 552-54, 400 A.2d 712 (1978). Where such absolute clarity is lacking and such an ambiguity is disclosed, the court must look to the language of the statute, its history, purpose, objective and underlying policy. Id. What appears to be clear statutory language should not be read to arrive at an \u2018ambiguous or unreasonable result\u2019 or to \u2018defeat a legislative intent which becomes evident when the statute is read in the light of its history and purpose.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>supra, 522.\u201d <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>3 Conn. App. 432, 437-38, 489 A.2d 398 (1985), aff'd, 200 Conn. 630, 513 A.2d 52 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The background to the disfigurement provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (d) discloses ambiguity in the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d exclusion. \u201cThe portion of the statute authorizing an award for disfigurement had its origin in the enactment of \u00a7 1328e of the 1939 Cumulative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Supplement, which amended \u00a7 5237 of the 1930 Revision of the General Statutes (providing compensation for partial incapacity) by authorizing an award \u2018for any serious and permanent disfigurement of the face, neck, head or hands.\u2019 In 1943, by the enactment of \u00a7 698g of the 1943 Supplement, the disfigurement provision was amended by adding \u2018forearms\u2019 after \u2018head.\u2019 With these amendments (and other amendments unrelated to the disfigurement provision), \u00a7 5237 was carried into the 1949 Revision of the General Statutes as \u00a7 7431. ... [That provision] became \u00a7 31-162 of the 1958 Revision, but it was amended by \u00a7 7 of No. 580 of the 1959 Public Acts, which added after the word \u2018hands\u2019 the words \u2018upper arms and legs below the knees.\u2019 The sections of the entire compensation act were rearranged and renumbered in 1961 so that \u00a7 31-162, as amended in 1959 and, in a respect immaterial to this appeal, in 1961, [was] designated \u00a7 31-308.\u201d <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>I.S. Spencer\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 162, 165, 223 A.2d 808 (1966). Although the enumeration of specific body parts in the disfigurement compensation provision placed Connecticut\u2019s compensation law \u201c[a]t the most restrictive end of the spectrum\u201d; 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 58.32, p. 10-344.140; \u201c[i]t is obvious that the course of these various amendments was to increase the portions of the body embraced in the disfigurement provision and that this purpose was accomplished by the enumeration of additional specific portions of the body in line with the method followed in the drafting of the original disfigurement provision. . . . [T]he broadening of the disfigurement provision, by successive amendments, to include additional enumerated portions of the body has tended to follow the increasing exposure of modern dress. <em>Finoia </em>v. <em>Winchester Repeating Arms Co., </em>130 Conn. 381, 384, 34 A.2d 636 [1943]; <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>148 Conn. 87, 92,167 A.2d 458 [1961].\u201d <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>I.S. Spencer\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 165-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Public Acts 1967, No. 67-842 amended General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 and replaced the enumeration of compensable body parts with an all-inclusive coverage of \u201cscar[s] on, any part of the body\u201d but excluded those \u201cresulting from a hernia operation or any spinal surgery.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the disfigurement coverage of \u00a7 31-308 was changed from a provision of enumerated inclusions to one of enumerated exclusions, nothing in the 1967 amendment or its legislative history indicates that the coverage of \u00a7 31-308 was intended to diminish. In fact, the legislative history reflects an intent to continue the trend of broadening the compensability for disfiguring scars. The only references to the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d exclusion in the legislative history accompanying the 1967 amendment to \u00a7 31-308 referred to this exclusion as covering \u201cscars which are disfiguring... due to an operation on the back\u201d; 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., p. 4039, remarks of Representative Paul Pawlak, Sr.; and an \u201coperation for a . . . back injury.\u201d 12 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1967 Sess., p. 2259, remarks of Senator Anthony P. Miller. In 1975, Public Act 75-48 changed the \u201chernia operation\u201d exclusion to \u201can inguinal hernia operation\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> exclusion in order to permit recovery for scars resulting from chest hernias, thereby making the disfigurement provision consistent with the \u201cprevious practice\u201d of allowing compensation for \u201cvisible scars.\u201d 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1975 Sess., p. 1292, remarks of Representative Joseph S. Coatsworth.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Thus, it appears from the history of \u00a7 31-308, as amended, that the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d and \u201cinguinal hernia operation\u201d exclusions were intended to be narrow provisions designed to add other parts of the body to the coverage of the statute and thus to continue, in a different form, the long established compensation exclusion for disfigurement of body parts which are not \u201cordinarily exposed.\u201d <em>Finoia </em>v. <em>Winchester Repeating Arms Co., </em>supra, 384; see also <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>supra, 92 (\u201ceither frequently or usually exposed to view\u201d). Nowhere in the statute itself or in the 1967 legislative comments on the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d amendment was there any mention of eliminating scars on the front of the neck, an \u201cordinarily exposed\u201d part of the clothed body which had been included in our state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation disfigurement provision since 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Further ambiguity in the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d exclusion, as it applies to a scar on the front of the neck from spinal fusion surgery, is evident in light of changing medical practice. Anterior incisions on the neck for cervical disc surgery were not generally known in 1967. Only recently has the frontal approach been widely utilized. IB R. Gray &amp; L. Gordy, Attorneys\u2019 Textbook of Medicine (3rd Ed.) Para. 10A.75 (2), p. 10A-68. Thus, in 1967, when the legislature excluded \u201cany scar resulting from . . . any spinal surgery,\u201d it did not contemplate that its exclusion would have any impact on a claimant seeking compensation for scarring on the front of her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Reference to the background of \u00a7 31-308 (d), therefore, discloses that the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d exception requires judicial construction in order not to \u201c \u2018defeat a legislative intent which becomes evident when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>statute is read in the light of its history and purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>supra, 438, quoting <em>State </em>v. Delafose, supra, 522. Given the statutory language, the legislative history, and the state of medical arts in 1967, we hold that, through enactment of the \u201cspinal surgery\u201d exclusion in General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (d), the legislature intended to eliminate scarring benefits for scars, resulting directly from an incision on the back in the course of spinal surgery, but did intend to continue to compensate employees for scars which are disfiguring or distracting from the personal appearance of the individual. Since neither of the scars involved here resulted directly from an incision on the back during spinal surgery, the review division properly concluded that the plaintiff should be compensated for the scars pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\"> The named defendant is the plaintiff\u2019s employer.
