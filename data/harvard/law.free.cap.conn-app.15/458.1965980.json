The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in holding that the defendants established adverse possession of the disputed land, (2) in holding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-575, (3) in leaving title to portions of the subject property unresolved, and (4) in concluding that the state is a necessary party to the action. The defendants have presented these alternate grounds for affirming the judgment: (1) \u201cThe claims of the plaintiff are barred by the [three-year] statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 52-577\u201d; and (2) \u201cThe plaintiff failed in his burden of proof to establish his right to damages and to an injunction.\u201d We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">On July 25, 1983, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Betty J. Matto, brought this action against the defendant Dan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Beard, Inc., in three counts, seeking to enjoin it from dredging fill and gravel from her property, from trespassing thereon, and from removing boundary markers. In addition, she sought a declaratory judgment as to the ownership of the land abutting the original easterly portion of her property, and monetary damages. Betty J. Matto died on August 9, 1983, and her husband, Ralph J. Matto, executor of her estate, was substituted as plaintiff on August 13, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Before trial began on November 4, 1985, the court granted the motion of Daniel Nichols Beard that he be named a party defendant and that the plaintiff amend the complaint to show Beard\u2019s alleged interest in the disputed property abutting the original easterly boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land. In this motion, Beard alleged (1) that he was the president and the principal and controlling shareholder of the named defendant Dan Beard, Inc., (2) that \u201che [was] the owner of the property abutting the plaintiff\u2019s land referred to in the plaintiffs complaint and claims the same by adverse possession,\u201d and (3) that he had an interest in the controversy adverse to the plaintiff or was a necessary party for a complete determination of the questions involved in the action. The court also granted the motion of Ralph J. Matto to become an additional party plaintiff as the sole devisee of the real estate owned by his deceased wife, Betty J. Matto, the original plaintiff. The pleadings were amended to reflect the court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, the following allegations were made. Betty J. Matto acquired a certain parcel of land on the easterly side of River Road in Shelton, bounded on the east by the Housatonic River, 130 feet, more or less, by warranty deed of Building Coordinators, Inc., executed on its behalf by the plaintiff, Ralph J. Matto, its president, on April 2, 1980. Prior to this acquisition of the property, and continuing to the present, the corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>defendant has maintained a dredging operation in the Housatonic River. Because of these dredging operations, the plaintiff\u2019s property bounded on the Housatonic River has been eroded, undermined and washed away; gravel and fill have been taken, and continue to be taken, from the property; he is unable to utilize and develop the property; and land which was formerly under water and adjacent to the property is now located at or above sea level. As a result, the plaintiff has lost the reasonable use of riparian property adjacent to navigable waters and his right, as riparian owner, of reasonable access to the Housatonic River. The defendant Dan Beard, Inc., has refused the requests of the plaintiff that it cease and desist from its dredging operations and that it remove its machinery and equipment from the land which now abuts the easterly portion of his property, some or all of which land the individual defendant Daniel Nichols Beard now claims by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The second count alleged that as a result of these dredging activities, land formerly under water was now at or near sea level and should belong to the plaintiff together with riparian rights. In the third count, the plaintiff alleges that the corporate defendant had caused the removal of boundary stakes which had been set after a survey of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The <em>defendant</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>filed an answer denying the plaintiff\u2019s allegations and pleading three special defenses. The first and second special defenses alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations and by laches. The third special defense alleged that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>by virtue of the adverse user and possession of the premises by \u201cthe <em>defendant </em>and <em>his </em>predecessor in title\u201d for more th\u00e1n fifteen years prior to the commencement of this action, \u201cthe <em>defendant </em>and <em>his </em>predecessor have thereby acquired and the <em>defendant </em>now has sole and exclusive title to the premises as well as the corresponding riparian rights therein.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In a counterclaim, it was alleged that \u201cby reason of adverse possession on <em>its </em>part and the part of <em>its </em>predecessor in title\u201d for more than fifteen years prior to the commencement of this action, \u201cthe <em>defendant </em>now has sole and exclusive title to the premises and corresponding riparian rights therein.\u201d In this counterclaim, the <em>defendant </em>sought a decree that <em>\u201cit </em>has acquired title to said premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">After a two day trial, the court issued a lengthy memorandum of decision. The following facts were found. On October 31,1979, the plaintiffs corporation, Building Coordinators, Inc., acquired by warranty deeds of Alice R. Bardugone and Louis J. Francini two contiguous parcels of land, the first of which is the property described in the plaintiffs complaint. They were conveyed by warranty deed to the plaintiffs decedent on April 2,1980. When the premises were later surveyed in July 1980, the plaintiff learned that the easterly boundary was entirely on land, and not at the river\u2019s edge, and that the operations and machinery of the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., were on a portion of his land. The surveyor\u2019s stakes marking the easterly boundary had been run over by the corporate defendant\u2019s trucks and subsequently disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The plaintiff took immediate action to protect the decedent\u2019s rights, first by sending a letter on July 1, 1980, to the <em>defendant Beard </em>notifying the defendants of the claims and demanding that they cease operations on the property, and later by speaking to him. Failing in these attempts, the decedent\u2019s attorney, on June 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>1981, formalized these demands by certified letter to the <em>defendant Beard. </em>When these oral and written demands were not met, the attorney sent a final letter on October 15,1981, again without result. This suit followed on July 25, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The trial court further found: \u201c[T]he plaintiffs property\u2019s easterly boundary fronted on the Housatonic River in 1965, except for forty feet of roadway northerly of the <em>Beard </em>property\u2019s northerly boundary and that roadway being on land below the high-water mark of the Housatonic River. The forty feet had been built by <em>Beard </em>dredging the river and placing the fill in the river to the east of the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It was not \u201ca roadway in the ordinary sense\u2014its use was limited to passage by <em>Beard\u2019s </em>equipment only, and for the location <em>o\u00ed Beard\u2019s </em>machinery used for dredging from time to time.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In 1970, the roadway extended the full length of 130 feet of the Matto property\u2019s easterly boundary and \u201cextended easterly from the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary into the river and was below the high-water mark ... to Two Mile Island, an island located in the Housatonic River and owned by the <em>defendants.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court further found that \u201c[T]he Housatonic River is a tidal river and, therefore, has high and low-water marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Additionally, the court found: \u201cIn 1975 the roadway continued to exist along the full length of the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary, as did the causeway extending easterly to Two Mile Island. In 1975 on the island causeway were two land locked sump ponds, the second one having been created in 1972 by the defendant company and, as a result of both the roadway and causeway described, the plaintiff\u2019s land no longer fronted on the river. In 1980, the same situation continued to exist as in 1975 and 1970 .... <em>Beard . . . </em>built the roadway along the easterly boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>erty and on the river in the course of <em>his </em>dredging operations. The causeway, from the plaintiffs easterly boundary to Two Mile Island, was commenced in 1974 and finished in 1975. The <em>defendant\u2019s </em>derrick was located on the roadway easterly of the premises in 1975 and 1980, but not in 1970. Daniel Beard owns personally the adjoining land southerly of the Matto premises and the Company owns Two Mile Island. Since 1946, <em>Beard </em>has stockpiled gravel on the Matto property temporarily and moved equipment across that property \u2018off and on.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The court also found that \u201cthe <em>defendant\u2019s </em>dredging operations have eroded and undermined a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s premises at the southeasterly corner, however, the exact dimensions of that portion have not been delineated for the court. The <em>defendant </em>has removed from that portion of the premises an undetermined amount of gravel and fill.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There was no evidence \u201cto show when the fill and gravel was removed so that the court is unable to determine a starting point for the period of adverse possession. The court finds that the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>operation has filled the land immediately abutting the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary and below the high-water mark, from time to time, and to such an extent that the plaintiff no longer has access from his premises to the Housatonic River, the plaintiff is unable to utilize his property as he had anticipated and his riparian rights have been affected. The <em>defendant </em>continues to use the filled land and prevents the plaintiff from exercising his riparian rights.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Additionally, the court found \u201cthat the so-called roadway to the east of the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary and below the high-water mark existed for a distance of forty feet northerly from the plaintiff\u2019s southeasterly corner ... in 1965. The remaining ninety feet of the easterly boundary had access to the river .... [It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>was] not until 1970 [that] the so-called roadway [was] completed along the entire easterly boundary and that thereafter the area to the east of the easterly boundary of the so-called roadway, and located in the river, was filled by the <em>defendant </em>to create sump ponds, a causeway to Two Mile Island and on which the <em>defendant </em>placed some of its machinery from time to time, but not continuously .... [T]he <em>defendant\u2019s </em>trucks have crossed the southeasterly portion of the plaintiff\u2019s premises from 1973 to date in order to convey material to and from its machinery located on the land created by filling the river land.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The final finding of fact was that in 1980 Matto made known to <em>Beard </em>that <em>Beard </em>was encroaching on the decedent\u2019s property, violating her rights. Matto became aware of this by having the easterly boundary line staked out. Thereafter, he discussed the matter with <em>Beard, </em>wrote to <em>Beard </em>on July 1, 1980, and subsequently sent two letters to <em>Beard </em>through his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On the basis of its findings, the trial court made the following conclusions of law: The special defense \u201cthat <em>it </em>has acquired the land by virtue of adverse possession\u201d (emphasis added) is a question of fact and must be established by clear and positive proof. Further, that the land in issue, located easterly of the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary, extends from the high-water mark into the river, and that the land below the high-water mark is owned by the state, citing <em>Hotchkiss Grove Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>161 Conn. 50, 54, 282 A.2d 890 (1971). Finally, that \u201c[t]he land filled by the <em>defendant </em>below the high-water mark and easterly of the plaintiffs easterly boundary line belongs to the state of Connecticut, however, the plaintiff upland owner has certain exclusive yet qualified rights therein. . . . [0]ne may not acquire rights by way of adverse possession to land owned by the state .... Neither the plaintiff nor the <em>defendant </em>can claim title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>to this parcel of land in the river to the east [of] the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary. However, riparian rights of an upland owner may be acquired by adverse possession. <em>Dimmock </em>v. <em>New London, </em>157 Conn. 9, 15 [245 A.2d 569 (1968)]; <em>S. O. &amp; C. Co. </em>v. <em>Ansonia Water Co., </em>83 Conn. 611, 624 [78 A. 432 (1910)].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The court, therefore, ruled as follows: \u201cThe <em>defendant </em>acquired the riparian rights of the plaintiff to the portion of the roadway below the high-water mark for a distance of forty feet from the plaintiff\u2019s southerly boundary, since <em>it </em>filled the land before 1965 and used it continuously, openly, notoriously, exclusively, adversely to the plaintiff\u2019s and his predecessor\u2019s in title\u2019s rights and under a claim of right for an uninterrupted period of fifteen years. The filling of the land and the continuous maintenance of the fill on the land was sufficient by itself to fulfill the requirements of adverse possession; it constituted a using of the land. In addition thereto, the use for dredging the river was open, notorious, exclusive, adverse to the owner\u2019s rights, made under a claim of right, and uninterrupted for a period of fifteen years , . . from 1965 to July, 1980. However, the filling of the remaining filled portion, below the high-water mark, on the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary for a distance of ninety feet . . . did not occur until 1970 ... so that the use was not for a continuous period of fifteen years\u201d (emphasis added) before the plaintiff exerted his rights in 1980 and 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">With respect to the southeasterly portion of the plaintiff\u2019s premises \u201cto which the defendants claim title by adverse possession, the court [found] that they [had] not demonstrated by clear and positive evidence continuous use for an uninterrupted period of fifteen years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>As to the special defense of the statute of limitations contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-575,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court found for the defendants. The statute requires that a person, not in possession of realty which another is holding adversely, reenter the land within fifteen years of being disseized and assert title, and to commence an action within one year of his entry in order for that reentry to be effective to interrupt the running of the statutory period. The court found that the plaintiff and his decedent had made four entries upon the premises. The first was made by their surveying and staking of the boundaries and by Matto\u2019s discussion with Beard relative to their claims. Matto\u2019s letter of July 1, 1980, and those of his counsel on June 16 and October 15, 1981, constituted additional entries. The plaintiff did not, however, commence action within one year after any of these entries. Suit was instituted on July 25, 1983, against the corporate defendant, and Beard, himself, was not made a defendant until November 4, 1985. As a result, the plaintiff\u2019s claims of title were denied by the court for failure to exercise his rights under \u00a7 52-575. It also ruled, on that basis, that the plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction, or to damages for the cost of removing the fill in the river easterly of the eastern boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The court responded to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that no rights of the corporate defendant came into existence until 1973, when it was incorporated, as follows: \u201cWhile it is true that the Company existed only since 1973, <em>Beard and his brothers and their various corporations </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>have been conducting the dredging operation continuously since the 1930\u2019s and therefore there has been the required continuity of time of the dredging and fill operations to complete the process known as tacking.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In recapitulation of its holdings, the court ruled as follows: (1) \u201c[JJudgment may enter for the <em>defendant </em>on all of the counts of the plaintiffs complaint by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to institute suit within one year of his reentry upon the property [pursuant to General Statutes] \u00a7 52-575\u201d (emphasis added); (2) \u201c[t]he <em>defendant, </em>in its counterclaim, has proved only that it has adversely possessed the plaintiff\u2019s riparian rights easterly of the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary for a distance of forty feet northerly measured from the southeasterly corner of the plaintiff\u2019s premises as shown on the map attached\u201d; (3) \u201c[t]he <em>defendant\u2019s </em>claims to the remaining portion of the plaintiff\u2019s riparian rights and the southeasterly corner of the plaintiff\u2019s premises are denied for the failure to comply with the fifteen year requirement of continuous possession\u201d; and (4) \u201c[t]he plaintiff\u2019s claim for a declaratory judgment is denied for failure to include all affected parties, particularly the State of Connecticut, the owner of the land, over which riparian rights are claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The trial court refused to consider the special defense of the three year statute of limitations for torts provided in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> holding that \u201c[o]nce the fifteen year period is complete, the plaintiff no longer has any rights to be enforced and the three year statute is unavailing.\u201d The court also ruled that the defense of laches was inapplicable, \u201csince the plaintiff acted promptly to claim his rights after they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>became known to him and the defendant based none of its actions on the plaintiffs inaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">It is necessary for our consideration of the plaintiffs appeal that we review additional facts established by the record, but not discussed by the trial court in its memorandum of decision. The defendant Daniel Nichols Beard, and not the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., is the owner of Two Mile Island. He acquired this island by warranty deed of Royal P. Wright and Ralph O. Wright, dated February 20,1941. When he purchased the property, it was a true \u201cisland\u201d separated from the west shore of the Housatonic River and the property now owned by the plaintiff. It was, however, then accessible at low tide by foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">On July 16, 1946, Daniel Beard received the following permit from the War Department: \u201c[Ujpon the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, and under the provisions of Section 10 of the Act of Congress approved March 8, 1899, entitled \u2018An act making appropriations for the construction, repair, and preservation of certain public works on rivers and harbors, and for other purposes,\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> you are hereby authorized by the Secretary of War, to construct two bulkheads of grounded barges filled with gravel in Housatonic River at Shelton, Connecticut, just below the north end of Two Mile Island and on the west shore of the river just below Wright Street in accordance with the plans shown on the drawing attached hereto marked: \u2018Proposed Bulkheads in Housatonic River Adjacent to Two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Mile Island and West Shore of River\u2019 subject to the following conditions.\u201d This document, introduced as an exhibit by the defendants, consists of a single sheet. The attachments of plans and conditions referred to therein were not submitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The following head note appears on this permit: \u201cNOTE.\u2014It is to be understood that this instrument does not give any property rights either in real estate or material, or any exclusive privileges; and that <em>it does not authorize any injury to private property or invasion of private rights, </em>or any infringement of Federal, State or local laws or regulations, nor does it obviate the necessity of obtaining State assent to work authorized. IT MERELY EXPRESSES THE ASSENT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS CONCERNS THE PUBLIC RIGHTS OF NAVIGATION. (See <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>188 U.S. 410.)\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On September 20,1973, Douglas M. Costle, commissioner of environmental protection, brought an action against The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., <em>Douglas M. Costle, Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., </em>Superior Court, Fairfield County, Docket No. 150906; under General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 25-11,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> seeking tem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>porary and permanent injunctions ordering the defendant in that case to cease dredging operations in the Housatonic River, and to restrain it from selling or otherwise disposing of illegally removed sand, gravel and other material found at the site. On November 5, 1973, a second suit; <em>Douglas M. Costle, Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., </em>Superior Court, Fairfield County, Docket No. 151455; was instituted under General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7\u00a7 25-7d and 25-7e<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> seeking temporary and permanent injunctions ordering the removal and dismantling of two illegal earthen and gravel causeways connecting Two Mile Island with the Shelton mainland and installed without appropriate permits as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Both cases were consolidated for trial. Daniel Nichols Beard, as the owner of Two Mile Island, and Dan Beard, Inc., as the successor operator of the dredging activities at Two Mile Island, were cited as additional defendants in these actions on April 23, 1974, when a joint stipulation was entered into between the parties for settlement of the actions. With the approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>court, it was agreed that Daniel Nichols Beard would file an application with the commissioner of environmental protection for the necessary permit and approval for the two existing causeways or roadways connecting Two Mile Island with the Shelton mainland. Pending such approval, the litigation would be stayed. After the filing of the stipulation, a mistrial was declared in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On July 11,1974, the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard applied to the department of environmental protection for a permit to approve the existence and maintenance of the two existing causeways from Two Mile Island to the west bank of the Housatonic River. As part of this application, the \u201cNAMES AND MAILING ADDRESSES OF ALL ADJOINING PROPERTY OWNERS WHOSE PROPERTY ALSO ADJOINS THE WATERWAY\u201d listed by Beard were those of Ralph Hopkins and Riverview Cemetery. The name and address of the then owner of the plaintiffs property was not furnished as such an adjoining owner, even though a review of the attached plan discloses that the property of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, shown as being owned by \u201cN/F A. Bardugone,\u201d adjoined the southerly portion of the northernmost of the two existing causeways and the \u201cLagoon\u201d created between the two causeways. On October 17,1974, a permit was approved by the department of environmental protection for \u201cretaining and maintaining a 100 ft. by 250 ft. causeway which is located in the approximate center of the island; a 100 ft. by 225 ft. causeway which is located on the northern end of the island. . . . The causeways are located adjacent to Two Mile Island and the west bank of the Housatonic River in Shelton and <em>are primarily used as access to the Island. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">This permit expressly stipulated that it \u201cis subject to and in no way derogates any present or future property or other rights or powers of the State of Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>icut, and <em>conveys no property rights in real estate or material nor any exclusive privileges, and is further subject to any and all public and private rights </em>and to any federal, state or local laws or regulations pertinent to the property or activity affected hereby.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">General and special conditions were attached. Of these, the following is relevant: \u201c3. That no attempt shall be made by the permittee or the owner to forbid the full and free use by the public of all tidal or navigable waters at or adjacent to the work or structure; that there shall be no unreasonable interference with navigation by the work herein authorized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The first and principal claim of the plaintiff is that the trial court erred in holding that \u201c[t]he <em>defendant, </em>in its counterclaim, has proved only that it has adversely possessed the plaintiffs riparian rights, easterly of the plaintiffs easterly boundary for a distance of forty feet northerly measured from the southeasterly corner of the plaintiffs premises as shown on the map attached.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Therefore, it has high and low-water marks. The plaintiffs property is bounded easterly 130 feet by the Housatonic River. This description is equivalent to a boundary at the high-water mark, since the land between high and low-water marks, called the foreshore, remains in the state. <em>Mihalczo </em>v. <em>Woodmont, </em>175 Conn. 535, 538, 400 A.2d 270 (1978); <em>Short Beach Cottage Owners Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 200. \u201cIn using the term \u2018high-water mark\u2019 the line of mean high-water mark or \u2018ordinary high-water mark is always intended.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pacheco, </em>69 U.S. (2 Wall.) 587, 590, 17 L.

Instead, its eastern boundary of 130 feet fronts on a \u201croadway\u201d built by the defendants below the high-water mark of the river and extending in width from the plaintiff\u2019s land to the new shore line created by it. The trial court found this \u201croadway . . . had been built by Heard dredging the river and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>placing the fill in the river to the east of the plaintiffs easterly boundary.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As the court observed, it was not a \u201croadway in the ordinary sense\u2014its use was limited to passage by <em>Beard\u2019s </em>equipment only, and for the location of <em>Beard\u2019s </em>machinery used for dredging from time to time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Since the upper ninety feet of the plaintiffs boundary still fronted on the river in 1965, and only the lower or southerly forty feet of that boundary then bordered the roadway built by dredging the river and filling the foreshore, that is, the land under the waters of the river between the high and low-water marks, the trial court found for the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., on its counterclaim but only to that limited extent. That was beyond the allegations of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The defendant Dan Beard, Inc., had alleged in its counterclaim that by virtue of adverse possession it had acquired <em>\u201csole and exclusive title to the premises </em>[obtained by filling the foreshore between the high and low-water marks] <em>and corresponding riparian rights therein\u201d </em>(emphasis added) along the entire easterly boundary of the plaintiffs property. The trial court disallowed that claim in its entirety. Rather, the court found that \u201c[t]he <em>defendant, </em>in its counterclaim, has proved only that it has adversely possessed the <em>plaintiffs riparian rights easterly of the plaintiffs easterly boundary </em>for a distance of forty feet northerly measured from the southeasterly corner of the plaintiffs premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.) No such claim that it adversely possessed the plaintiffs riparian rights was alleged in the counterclaim of the defendant Dan Beard, Inc. The court erred in ruling beyond the claim of the defendant Dan Beard, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The defendant Daniel Nichols Beard acquired Two Mile Island on February 20, 1941. Some time after<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ward, the dredging of the Housatonic River for sand and gravel began from the-island. On July 16, 1946, he received from the War Department authorization to construct two bulkheads of grounded barges filled with gravel. According to his testimony, these bulkheads were placed in the area of property that he then owned on the west shore of the river, adjoining the plaintiffs property on the south. The authorized location does not appear in the record because the approved plan was not attached to the authorization in exhibit. Notwithstanding the War Department\u2019s explicit caveat in the headnote of the document that the permit \u201cdoes not authorize any injury to private property or invasion of private rights,\u201d it was Beard\u2019s testimony that these barges were placed at what is claimed to be Matto property. The trial court, however, did not make such a finding. Beard\u2019s further testimony was that at some time thereafter \u201cB. N. Beard Company and Dan Beard, Inc.\u201d filled in the area of the second or northernmost causeway \u201cand in front of Matto\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">On September 20,1973, Douglas M. Costle, commissioner of environmental protection, sued to enjoin The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., from dredging operations in the river. A further injunction action was brought against the same corporation on November 5, 1973, seeking the removal and dismantling of the two illegally constructed earthen and gravel causeways then connecting Two Mile Island with the Shelton mainland. At some undisclosed date in 1973, Dan Beard, Inc., was incorporated and came into existence. Its corporate relationship to the defendant The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., in the two injunction actions is not in evidence or in the record. Judicial notice is taken that on April 22,1974, the commissioner of environmental protection amended his writ and complaint in each of these two cases to add as defendants Daniel Nichols Beard and Dan Beard, Inc., and to allege further that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cDaniel Nichols Beard claims title to Two Mile Island\u201d and that \u201cDan Beard, Inc., is engaging in and is carrying on dredging activities at Two Mile Island [only] in the same manner heretofore complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On the basis of this inconclusive evidence of the corporate relationship between B. N. Beard Company, The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., and the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., and notwithstanding the burden of proof requirement that adverse possession \u201cis not to be made out by inference, but by clear and positive proof\u201d; <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra; the trial court concluded as follows: \u201cWhile it is true that [Dan Beard, Inc.,] existed only since 1973, <em>Beard and his brothers and their various corporations have been conducting the dredging operation continuously since the 1930\u2019s and therefore there has been the required continuity of time of the dredging and fill operations to complete the process known as tacking. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We find error in this conclusion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The authoritative rule of tacking successive possessions for the acquisition of title after fifteen years is found in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>31 Conn. 530 (1863). See <em>Marquis </em>v. <em>Drost, </em>155 Conn. 327, 332, 231 A.2d 527 (1967). The \u201ccontinuity of <em>time </em>of the dredging and fill operations\u201d does not \u201ccomplete the process known as tacking,\u201d as the trial court erroneously ruled. (Emphasis added.) <em>Privity of estate </em>is not necessary, but rather, <em>privity of possession. </em>\u201cIt is sufficient if there is an adverse possession <em>continued uninterruptedly </em>for fifteen years whether by one or more persons. This was settled in <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Willcox, </em>3 Day 258 [1808]. Doubtless the possession must be <em>connected </em>and <em>continuous, </em>so that the possession of the true owner shall not constructively intervene between them; but such continuity and connection may be effected by any conveyance agreement or understanding which has for its object a transfer of the rights of the possessor, or of his pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>session, and is accompanied by a transfer of possession in fact.\u2019\u2019(Emphasis in original.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>supra, 531-32. Privity of possession is defined as a continuity of actual possession, as between prior and present occupant, the possession of the latter succeeding the possession of the former under deed, grant, or other transfer or by operation of law. <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>22 Or. 77, 85, 29 P. 73 (1892), citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>supra. The successive fillings of gravel and sand in the river foreshore, in undetermined amounts extending an unmeasured distance into the river by B. N. Beard Company, by The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., and by Dan Beard,.Inc., respectively, does not establish the necessary privity of possession. Such a circumstance only shows a succession of independent actions, one not necessarily supporting the other. 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Adverse Possession, \u00a7 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The trial court did not specify the plaintiff\u2019s riparian rights which it concluded that the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., adversely possessed east of the southerly forty feet of the plaintiff\u2019s boundary on the river. The plaintiff, as owner of upland property bounding on navigable waters, has no riparian right to extend his property beyond the high-water mark into the foreshore between the high and low-water marks by the deposit of fill. Since the plaintiff possessed no such riparian right appurtenant to the upland property, the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., could not obtain by adverse possession the right to deposit fill on the foreshore of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u201cIt is settled law in this State that the public, whose representative is the State, is the owner of the soil between high and low-water mark upon navigable water where the tide ebbs and flows. . . . The owner of the adjoining upland has certain exclusive yet qualified rights and privileges in the waters and submerged land adjoining his upland. He has the exclusive privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>lege of wharfing out and erecting piers over and upon such soil and for these purposes of occupying and using it in any manner which does not interfere with navigation, and he may convey these privileges separately from the adjoining land. He also has the right of accretion and generally of reclamation and the right of access by water to and from his upland. . . . These rights, which are in the nature of a franchise, constitute a species of property and are separable and alienable as thus separated in the same manner as other property. . . . The fundamental riparian right on which all others depend is the right of access. <em>Orange </em>v. <em>Resnick, </em>94 Conn. 573, 582, 109 Atl. 864 [1920]. The riparian proprietor\u2019s right of access is distinguished from that which individual members of the general public enjoy. . . . The exclusive franchise of reclamation and of wharfing out is merely a mode of exercising the right of access and \u2018in this State at least no distinction can be drawn between them.\u2019 <em>Orange </em>v. <em>Resnick, </em>supra, p. 582.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Knowles-Lombard Co., </em>122 Conn. 263, 265-66, 188 A. 275 (1936). A riparian owner, however, may not \u201cremove the sand from the public beach lying between high and low-water mark and sell it. This is in no respect exercising his right of access but is an act of ownership.\u201d Id., 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u201cThe foreshore, the land lying between the high and low-water marks of navigable waters, is subject to the rights of several classes of persons. First, there is the <em>jus publicum: </em>the right shared by all to navigate upon the waters covering the foreshore at high tide and, at low tide, to have access across the foreshore to the waters for fishing, bathing or any other lawful purpose . . . . Second, there is the <em>jus privatum: </em>the right of the owner of the foreshore. . . . When ownership of this land, as is usually the case, is vested in a governmental authority, it is said to hold title in trust for the public good, with the right to control and regulate com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>merce and navigation thereon, as well as fishing or bathing, subject to the <em>jus publicum </em>.... Third, there are the rights of the riparian owner, the owner of upland fronting on navigable tidal waters. . . . [T]he riparian rights of an upland owner are the rights of reasonable, safe and convenient access to the water for navigation, fishing or similar purposes . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Arnold\u2019s Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>63 Misc. 2d 279, 283-84, 310 N.Y.S.2d 541, (1970); <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>Town of Oyster Bay, </em>234 N.Y. 15, 20-21, 136 N.E. 224 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The riparian rights of an upland owner may not be impaired by reason of an illegal fill of the foreshore extending beyond the upland ownership. <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>Town of Oyster Bay, </em>supra, 21-22. Where title to the foreshore owned by the state is inalienable, as is the case under consideration, title to the foreshore upon its illegal filling cannot be obtained by adverse possession. <em>Hinkley </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>234 N.Y. 309, 315, 137 N.E. 599 (1922). Similarly, upon such illegal filling of the foreshore owned by the state, the riparian rights of the upland owner cannot be taken by adverse possession of the filled foreshore. See <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>Town of Oyster Bay, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In view of the stated law relating to the various rights in the foreshore between the high and low-water marks of navigable waters belonging to the pertinent classes of persons, we conclude that the trial court erred in holding: \u201cThe <em>defendant </em>acquired the riparian rights of the plaintiff to the portion of the roadway below the high-water mark for a distance of forty feet from the plaintiffs southerly boundary, since it filled the land before 1965 and used it continuously, openly, notoriously, exclusively, adversely to the plaintiffs and his predecessors in title\u2019s rights and under a claim of right for an uninterrupted period of fifteen years. The filling of the land and the continuous maintenance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>fill on the land was sufficient by itself to fulfill the requirements of adverse possession; it constituted a using of the land. In addition thereto the use for dredging the river was open, notorious, exclusive, adverse to the owner\u2019s rights, made under a claim of right, and uninterrupted for a period of fifteen years. The fifteen years were continuous from 1965 to July 1980.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe use is not exclusive if the adverse user merely shares dominion over the property with other users. <em>Short Beach Cottage Owners Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>154 Conn. 194, 199, 224 A.2d 532 (1966).\u201d <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Additional error is found in these conclusions because the use of the foreshore for dredging operations after October 17, 1974, was continued under the authority of the permit of the department of environmental protection issued for retaining and maintaining the two causeways over the foreshore from the west bank of the river to Two Mile Island. \u201cThis authorization . . . constitute^] the Certificate or Permit required by Section 25-7d of the 1972 Revision of the General Statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Furthermore, this permit was issued to the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard, and not to the defendant Dan Beard, Inc. Therefore, no rights of adverse possession could accrue under it to support the corporate defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The terms of the state permit also precluded the acquisition of any adverse possession rights. First, the permit stipulated that it \u201cconveys no property rights in real estate or material nor any exclusive privilege, and is further subject to any and all public and private rights.\u201d Therefore, the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., cannot assert that it was continuing its dredging and filling operations after October 17,1974, under a claim of right. Second, the general conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>included: \u201c3. That no attempt shall be made by the permittee or the owner to forbid the full and free use by the public of all tidal or navigable waters at or adjacent to the work or structure; that there shall be no unreasonable interference with navigation by the work herein authorized.\u201d The terms of this condition prevent the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., from successfully claiming that it adversely possessed the foreshore adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s property to the exclusion of all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The trial court specifically found that the foreshore adjacent to the southern forty feet of the plaintiffs boundary was filled before 1965, and that the filling of the foreshore adjacent to the remaining ninety feet of the plaintiffs boundary did not begin until 1970, and extended farther and deeper into the river even later. Prior to the issuance of the permit for the causeways to the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard on October 17, 1974, such filling of the foreshore incidental to the dredging of the river was in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 25-7d (Revised to 1972),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and constituted a public nuisance under General Statutes \u00a7 25-7e (Revised to 1972).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statues \u00a7\u00a7 25-7d and 25-7e (Revised to 1972) were first enacted as Public Acts 1963, No. 569, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> respectively, effective June 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>1963. Additionally, General Statutes (Revised to 1972) \u00a7 25-10<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> prohibited the removal of sand and gravel from lands under tidal waters without a state permit issued under \u00a7 25-11<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> by the commissioner of environmental protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">As noted earlier, the commissioner of environmental protection instituted two injunction actions against The Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., based upon the alleged violations of these statutory requirements. The first sought to enjoin the dredging and sale of illegally removed sand and gravel under General Statutes (Revised to 1972) \u00a7 25-11. The second sought to have the two illegally built causeways to Two Mile Island removed and dismantled. These actions were settled by the application of the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard for the necessary permits, which were issued on October 17, 1974, with conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">According to the facts found by the trial court, the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard is in violation of his permit for the retention and maintenance of the two causeways to the island. A \u201ccauseway\u201d is defined as \u201ca raised road across water or marshy land with the water or marshy land on both sides of the road.\u201d <em>Citizens Committee for the Hudson Valley </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>302 F. Sup. 1083, 1089 (S.D.N.Y. 1969). Although the permit provided that the causeways were to be \u201cprimarily used as access to the Island,\u201d the trial court found instead that the two causeways are used as an integral part of the dredging operation of the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., in the washing and cleaning of the sand and gravel taken from the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The application of the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard made on July 11, 1974, to the department of environmental protection for a permit approving \u201cthe existence and maintenance of two existing causeways located at Two Mile Island\u201d contained this statement: \u201c14. USE OF CAUSEWAYS: Access to and from Shelton mainland and to and from Two Mile Island.\u201d An exhibit attached to Beard\u2019s application consisted of a \u201cPlan of Existing Causeways to Two Mile Island on the Housatonic River\u2014Shelton, Connecticut. Application by: Dan Beard Construction Co., Inc., June 28, 1974, Rev. Aug. 1974.\u201d This survey showed the two existing causeways, the one to the north or upriver being 100 feet wide and 225 feet long, and the other to the south being 100 feet wide and 250 feet long. In place of the river, there was depicted on the plan submitted for approval a single oval-shaped \u201cNon-Tidal Lagoon.\u201d This was situated between the two causeways, north and south, and between the so-called \u201croadway\u201d below the high-water mark, along the easterly boundary of the property shown as owned then or formerly by A. Bardugone, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, and the west bank of Two Mile Island, east and west. The plan showing the existing causeways and the lagoon was approved by the permit granted on October 17, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The so-called roadway previously constructed below the high-water mark and adjacent to the plaintiff\u2019s property was not expressly or impliedly approved by the department of environmental protection permit for the continuation of the two causeways. Since the roadway constructed below the high-water mark by fill from the river is \u201cbounded by water on only one side [the east], it, in itself, is not a causeway.\u201d <em>Citizens Committee for the Hudson Valley </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>supra. Nor was approval for the roadway sought by the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard in his application by designation, description or survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In its memorandum of decision, the trial court made the following relevant findings: \u201c[T]he 1970 aerial map shows the roadway extending the full length of 130 feet of the Matto easterly boundary. All of the so-called roadway extended easterly from the plaintiffs easterly boundary into the river and was below the high-water mark. The Housatonic River is a tidal river and therefore has high and low-water marks. The 1970 aerial map shows land which projects easterly of the aforementioned roadway to Two Mile Island, an island located in the Housatonic and owned by the <em>defendants. </em>In 1975, the roadway continued to exist along the full length of the plaintiffs easterly boundary, as did the causeway extending to Two Mile Island. In 1975 on the island causeway were <em>two land locked sump ponds, </em>the second one having been created in 1972 by the defendant company and, as a result of both the roadway and causeway described, the plaintiffs land no longer fronted on the river.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">According to the testimony of the defendant Daniel Nichols Beard, the north causeway, which together with the \u201croadway\u201d borders on the northerly part of the plaintiffs property, was built in 1970. The south causeway had already been built at that time. From his testimony it is evident that since 1970, the river between the causeways, and its west bank below the high-water mark, were, in effect, appropriated by the defendants to their sole private and business use. The two sump ponds between the causeways were created in 1972. That was two years before the application for the state environmental permit for continuation of the two causeways with a single lagoon of nontidal water between them. Water is pumped into the smaller of two sump ponds. \u201c[I]t is a by-pass from the washland, it goes into one pond, and the silt [collects] in that pond, and there is a pipe from that pond to another\u2014to the big pond that\u2014by the time it gets over to the big pond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the water is clear so nothing goes back in the river.\u201d From the big pond, the water is recycled into the wash-land. When the silt that is washed out of the sand and gravel fills the smaller of the sump ponds, the silt is then dredged out of the pond and sold as \u201cfilt.\u201d Machinery and equipment necessary for the dredging and cleaning operations is located on a causeway and on the roadway constructed below the high-water mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The two causeways, the two sump ponds, and the roadway below the high-water mark adjoining the plaintiffs\u2019 boundary on the river were made by digging sand and gravel out of the river before the issuance of the permit by the department of environmental protection in 1974 for the continued retention and maintenance of the two causeways. That segment of the river formerly bordering the plaintiff\u2019s property, having been enclosed by the two causeways and converted into two sump ponds for the cleaning of sand and gravel dredged from the river, became an integral part of the sand and gravel operations of the defendant Dan Beard, Inc. All of this exceeded the expressed purpose and violated the scope of the state permit issued for retention of the causeways to provide \u201caccess to and from Shelton mainland and to and from Two Mile Island.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">We find the trial court erred in holding that the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., has proved under its counterclaim by clear and positive proof that it has adversely possessed the plaintiff\u2019s riparian rights to the foreshore easterly of the southern forty feet of the plaintiffs\u2019 boundary on the Housatonic River by the illegal filling of the foreshore in its sand and gravel dredging operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">In his prayer for relief, the plaintiff sought: (1) damages; (2) an injunction that the <em>defendant </em>cease and desist from its dredging operation insofar as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>removes fill and gravel from the plaintiffs property and that it not trespass on plaintiffs real estate; (3) an injunction that the <em>defendant </em>cease and desist from the removal of plaintiffs boundary markers; and (4) a declaratory judgment as to who owns the land now presently abutting the original easterly portion of plaintiffs land.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The trial court denied the plaintiffs claim for monetary damages for trespass and invasion of his property on this basis: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claim for fill removed from the southeasterly portion of the premises must be denied since the court has no evidence on which to base a finding of the amount of fill taken, <em>although fill was taken </em>.... [Therefore] no basis exists upon which to base a finding of money damages.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We do not agree with the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Some damage necessarily follows any wrongful invasion of another\u2019s property. This necessary damage is actual, as distinguished from the mere nominal damages involved in some casual and inoffensive tort; but it is nominal as distinguished from any specific damage suffered and proved. In a case like this, some damage results from the mere invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s property rights, and its amount, not being determinable by proof, must be comparatively small and in that sense nominal. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Ivler, </em>187 Conn. 31, 45-46, 450 A.2d 817 (1982). As a general rule, however, this court will not reverse and grant a new trial for the mere failure to award nominal damages. <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>186 Conn. 754, 756, 443 A.2d 1273 (1982); <em>Leabo </em>v. <em>Leninski, </em>2 Conn. App. 715, 725, 484 A.2d 239 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">As to the plaintiff\u2019s further claims for monetary damages and for injunctive relief, the court briefly concluded: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claims of title must be denied by reason of his failure to exercise his rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00a7 52-575<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and therefore he is not entitled to an injunction, or his claim for money damages, claimed to be measured by the cost of removing the fill in the river, easterly of his easterly boundary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The trial court erred in this summary denial of injunctive relief on the grounds stated. The first injunction sought to enjoin the \u201cdredging operation insofar as it removes fill and gravel from <em>plaintiffs property </em>and [from] trespassing] on <em>plaintiffs real estate. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court having previously found that \u201c[t]he plaintiff has demonstrated by the preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s dredging operations have eroded and undermined a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s premises at the southeasterly corner,\u201d it should have considered the plaintiff\u2019s further allegations that the dredging activities of the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., have caused, and continue to cause, irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at law exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to the injunction sought to enjoin the defendant \u201cfrom the removal of plaintiff\u2019s boundary markers.\u201d The court had previously made these express relevant findings: \u201cIn December 1979 or January 1980, the plaintiff had the premises surveyed and in 1980 the engineer set out stakes on the boundary lines of the premises. The defendant\u2019s trucks ran over the stakes and they subsequently disappeared.\u201d It is a criminal offense to destroy or remove boundary markers placed by a surveyor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The final claim on appeal is that the court erred in concluding that the state is a necessary party to the action. The plaintiff had sought \u201c[a] declaratory judgment as to who owns the land presently abutting the original easterly portion of plaintiffs land.\u201d After having concluded that the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., had proved its counterclaim that it had adversely possessed the plaintiff\u2019s riparian rights to the foreshore easterly of the southern forty feet of the plaintiff\u2019s boundary on the Housatonic River by the filling of the foreshore belonging to the state, the court ruled: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claim for a declaratory judgment is denied for failure to include all affected parties, particularly the State of Connecticut, the owner of the land, over which riparian rights are claimed.\u201d We find error in this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">While the presence of the state in this action might have been expedient in view of our conclusions respecting the misuse of the causeway permit issued by the department of environmental protection, its joinder at this time and proceeding was not necessary for an adjudication of title to the filled-in foreshore. Moreover, notwithstanding its final denial of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for a declaratory judgment, the court in its memorandum of decision had earlier made such judgment when it concluded: \u201cThe land filled by the defendant below the high-water mark and easterly of the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary line belongs to the State of Connecticut .... Neither the plaintiff nor the <em>defendant </em>can claim title to this parcel of land in the river to the east [of] the plaintiff\u2019s easterly boundary.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In view of our conclusions, we need not consider the defendants\u2019 alternate grounds for affirming the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff on the counterclaim of the defendant Dan Beard, Inc., and a new trial is ordered solely upon the issue of the plaintiffs entitlement to injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-11\"> The plaintiff, in addition to his representative capacity, is a party to the action individually as devisee of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> Both in the pleadings and in the memorandum of decision, the parties and the court have, in many instances, used the singular \u201cdefendant\u201d as opposed to the plural \u201cdefendants\u201d or to the specific defendant, corporate or individual, intended.
