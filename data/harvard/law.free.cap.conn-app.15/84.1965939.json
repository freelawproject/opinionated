We find error in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The claimant, Brian Collins, filed a claim for compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>under chapter 568 of the General Statutes for an injury which he suffered on September 12,1981, while he was a volunteer fireman and member of engine company no. 5 of the city of Milford (city), one of six such companies serving that city. On that date, his company took part in a parade which concluded at a city park where a muster was planned. The claimant\u2019s company had voted to participate in this muster at a regularly scheduled monthly meeting. The other five volunteer fire companies also participated in the parade and the muster, which consisted of competition among the various volunteer fire companies, the display of antique fire engines and the sale of food and beverages. At approximately 3 p.m., the claimant was asked by Lieutenant William Soda of engine company no. 1 if he would assist other members of that company in loading an antique fire engine on a trailer and assist in returning it to the company headquarters. The trailer was owned by engine company no. 1 and the car towing it was owned and operated by Lieutenant Soda. The claimant rode in the trailer in order to keep the antique fire engine secure. While returning to engine company no. 1 headquarters, the claimant fell from the trailer and fractured his left ankle. He was subsequently hospitalized, and remained out of work until March 22, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">On October 2, 1981, Collins filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits which the city disputed on the ground that the \u201c[ejmployee was not injured as a result of fire fighting activities.\u201d A formal hearing was held and on November 23,1982, Commissioner Rhoda Loeb found that the claimant was engaged in fire duties within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 when he was injured. The commissioner determined that the claimant was \u201con the direct geographical route back to Station 7 of engine company no. 1 when the accident occurred meeting the requirements of \u00a7 7-314, for this section includes fire duties as directly returning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>from a parade.\u201d The commissioner further found that the requirements of \u00a7 7-322a were met in that the claimant was injured while rendering assistance to another volunteer fire company engaged in \u201cfire duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The defendants argue that the commissioner erred in finding that the fire engine being returned was \u201capparatus or equipment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-314. We do not agree. Parades have been specifically named as functions for which volunteer firemen may receive workers\u2019 compensation under \u00a7 7-314a. Because equipment or apparatus other than active fire trucks is often included in parades, it is therefore a reasonable interpretation of the statute that antique equipment is covered by \u00a7 7-314. We note that the claimant\u2019s conduct, helping to return the antique fire engine, on the date of his injury is within the purview of General Statutes \u00a7 7-322a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as he was an active member of a volunteer fire company, whose services were accepted by an officer in charge of another company.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The defendants next claim that the commissioner erred in finding that the claimant was engaged in fire duties at the time of his injury. The term \u201cfire duties\u201d is defined in \u00a7 7-314 to include: duties while at fires, answering or returning directly from fires, participation in fire drills or parades, or going to and returning directly from fires, drills or parades. For purposes of the term \u201cfire duties,\u201d the statute makes no distinction between \u201cfires\u201d and \u201cparades.\u201d We conclude that the compensation review division was correct in sustaining the finding of the commissioner that \u201cparades\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>are \u201cfire duties,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The commissioner\u2019s factual findings, however, were insufficient to support the review division\u2019s sustaining of the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the claimant was returning directly from the parade at the time he was injured, thus making his injury compensable under \u00a7 7-314a.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We conclude that the record is inadequate for a determination that the claimant was returning <em>directly </em>from a parade at the time he was injured. The commissioner found that the claimant was returning \u201cdirectly\u201d from fire duties when he fell off the trailer and was injured. In upholding this finding by the commissioner, the review division rejected the town\u2019s argument that \u201cdirectly\u201d should be interpreted temporally rather than spacially or geometrically. The review division concluded: \u201cWe hold rather to the latter meaning of the adverb as expressed in the Euclidian axiom that \u2018a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We reject the conclusion of the review division that \u201cdirectly\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 7-314 is limited to spacial considerations. Directly has been variously defined as: \u201cin a direct way, without anything intervening\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.); \u201cwithout a moment\u2019s delay, at once, immediately, in a little while; shortly\u201d; Webster, Third New International Dictionary; \u201cin a straight line or course; without curving, swerving, or deviation\u201d; Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed.). Thus, there are circumstances under which a claimant could traverse a direct geographical route but would engage in conduct before or during the sojourn which would take his conduct out of several of these definitions. By contrast, a claimant may follow a circuitous geographical route and, under the particular circumstances, still be found to have traveled directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In determining whether a particular claimant was, in fact, returning \u201cdirectly\u201d from \u201cfire duty,\u201d the commissioner must make factual determinations regarding the intervening time, the nature of the activities of the claimant before commencement of his return and the nature of the activities of the claimant during the actual return. These determinations must be coupled with a consideration of the geographical route followed. All of these factors must be considered in deciding whether the claimant returned directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We believe that this fact-bound determination must be made on a case by case basis. There is no simple geometric formula which can be the sole basis for determining whether a claimant is traveling directly to or returning directly from fire duties for which workers\u2019 compensation may be provided in the event a volunteer fireman is injured. Rather, the commissioner must engage in a thorough analysis of both intervening temporal events and the geographic route followed before making the factual finding that the claimant\u2019s conduct comports with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 7-314 and 7-314a.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In this case, the commissioner must determine whether the muster was an integral part of the parade bringing it within the purview of \u00a7 7-314a. If, however, the commissioner finds that the muster was not part of the parade, then the commissioner must determine whether the muster was an intervening event which prevented the claimant\u2019s return from being direct as that term is used by \u00a7 7-314. The commissioner must also determine whether the claimant engaged in any conduct, before or during the transport of the antique fire engine, which would constitute a deviation from a direct return to the firehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">There is error, the decision of the compensation review division confirming the award is set aside and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the matter is remanded for a new hearing limited to the issue of whether the claimant was returning directly to the firehouse at the time he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Active members of volunteer fire departments shall be construed to be employees of the municipality for the benefit of which volunteer fire services are rendered while in training or engaged in volunteer fire duty and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the workers\u2019 compensation commission and shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of chapter 568 for death, disability or injury incurred while in training for or engaged in volunteer fire duty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 7-314. definitions, exemption from public records and meetings law.
