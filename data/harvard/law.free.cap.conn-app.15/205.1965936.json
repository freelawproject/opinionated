The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in finding that General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits the imposition of a cumulative civil penalty in excess of $1000, (2) in finding that a vacancy on the three member board did not invalidate a decision by the remaining two members, and (3) in sustaining the board\u2019s decision which found U.S. Vision, Inc., in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 20-153.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The board of examiners for opticians was presented with an eleven count statement of charges by the department of health services. The statement of charges alleged that the plaintiff was operating seven \u201coptical shops\u201d without licensed opticians on the premises. In particular, the statement of charges alleged that on eight separate occasions the plaintiff operated an optical shop without the personal and direct supervision of a licensed optician. Seven different establishments were cited, each of these shops operated under separate permits. The charges also alleged that on two occasions an unlicensed employee performed regulated activities, including the measuring of the pupillary distance of eyes, without a licensed optician on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The department of health moved for a summary suspension of the plaintiffs permits to operate optical shops. The board denied the motion for summary suspension, finding insufficient evidence of a clear and immediate danger to warrant the suspension of the permits prior to a full hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">A hearing on the statement of charges was held on April 29, 1985. On August 12, 1985, the board issued its decision finding that U.S. Vision, Inc., had violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-153 and 20-154<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on ten sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>rate counts, including two counts for allowing an apprentice optician to provide optical services without the supervision of a licensed optician. The board imposed a $500 fine for each violation and ordered U.S. Vision, Inc., to discontinue the practice of operating optical shops without a licensed optician on the premises. The board, however, found insufficient evidence to conclude that individual licensed opticians were guilty of any violation. Further, it dismissed one count alleging a course of conduct with the intent to violate \u00a7\u00a7 20-153 and 20-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The plaintiff conceded at the administrative hearing that the apprentice\u2019s conduct was in violation of \u00a7 20-153 and that, although she had been told she should not fit, measure, adjust or put glasses on a client\u2019s face, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>or dispense glasses when a licensed optician was not on the premises, she did in fact perform optical services without the supervision of a licensed optician. The board found that the apprentice made visual measurements, indicated what style and size frame would be appropriate for a customer\u2019s face and measured the pupillary distance of eyes. The board also found that on a separate occasion the apprentice fitted a customer with eyeglasses and made adjustments to the frames. The plaintiff also concedes the board\u2019s finding that on eight separate occasions a store was open for business without a licensed optician present.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the board erred in assessing multiple fines against it. In particular, the plaintiff contends that General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) limits the board\u2019s authority to assess a cumulative civil penalty to $1000. We disagree. Section 19a-17 (a) (6) provides that the board has the authority to \u201cassess a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars\u201d for any violation of chapter 381. We note at the outset that the legislature has chosen to call this sanction a \u201ccivil penalty.\u201d In applying the statutory language of \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) to the facts presented by this case, we must give the plain language of the statute its logical meaning. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>13 Conn. App. 699, 706-707, 539 A.2d 588 (1988); <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>13 Conn. App. 393, 399, 536 A.2d 991 (1988). It is undisputed that the health department could have brought ten separate actions for the ten separate violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-153 and 20-154<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the board has the authority to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ten separate civil penalties of up to $1000 each, constituting a cumulative civil penalty far in excess of the penalty imposed in this case. The defendant contends, however, that because the health department brought the ten separate counts in a single statement of charges, the $1000 limitation applies, not to each separate violation, but to the entire statement of charges. The interpretation of \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) proffered by the plaintiff is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">If we adopted the plaintiffs construction of the statute, the health department would remain free to bring separate actions to achieve a result the plaintiff contends it has no authority to achieve in a single action. Here, the health department could have brought ten separate actions resulting in an unnecessary burden on the plaintiff and the judicial system. The principles of judicial economy; <em>Sauter </em>v. <em>Sauter, </em>4 Conn. App. 581, 584-85, 495 A.2d 1116 (1985); and statutory construction; <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>supra; lead to the conclusion that the legislature intended a single result whether the health department brings one action or ten separate actions for precisely the same conduct. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) is a limitation on the civil penalty which the board may impose for each violation of the chapter, but does not affect the cumulative civil penalty the board may impose for separate violations under the chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Since the penalty for each separate violation was less than the statutory maximum penalty, the court was not in error in finding that the board had authority to assess a penalty of $500 for each violation of the statute, totaling $5000.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The plaintiff next claims that because there was one vacancy on the three member board, the remaining two members were not a legally constituted body and, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>no board could legally have existed at the time of the hearing or at the time of the decision, the order is void. The plaintiff argues that the use of \u201cshall\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 20-139a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> mandates that a three member board be convened in order that the board be vested with the powers set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-138 et seq. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 20-139a provides that the board be comprised of three members, two opticians and one member of the general public, all of whom are appointed by the Governor. A vacancy caused by the resignation of one of the optician members had not been filled at the time of the proceedings. It is undisputed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>remaining two members participated in and concurred in the result which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The plaintiffs position that a vacancy on an administrative board created by a resignation deprives the board of its statutory authority would lead to an unreasonable result not intended by the legislature. \u201cThe rule is that all bodies charged with the performances of public duties continue to function though a vacancy exists.\u201d <em>Brein </em>v. <em>Eclectic Examining Board, </em>103 Conn. 65, 87, 130 A. 289 (1925). A board may act as long as there exists a quorum comprising a majority of all the members who have been appointed and have not been disqualified. <em>Liquified Petroleum Gas Commission </em>v. <em>E. R. Kiper Gas Corporation, </em>229 La. 640, 647, 86 So. 2d 518 (1956). There is no language in General Statutes \u00a7 20-139a that requires the board to act unanimously or that requires any specific number of members to act. Two members of the board constitute a majority and have all of the authority that is granted to a three member board. General Statutes \u00a7 20-139a (d) grants the board the power to \u201chear and decide matters concerning suspension or revocation of license\u201d and to \u201cimpose sanctions where appropriate.\u201d The general intent of the legislature that only a majority is needed to render a decision is supported by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 (h)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 4-179<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which similarly state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>a majority of a board is sufficient for its legal functioning. We, therefore, conclude that the two member board was vested with full authority to impose sanctions under \u00a7 20-153.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the court erred in concluding that the board correctly interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 20-153.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The relevant portion of the statute provides: \u201cThe department may grant annually ... an optical permit to any optical establishment . . . conducted under the personal and direct supervision of a licensed optician, for permission to sell, dispense or supply to the ultimate wearer optical aids to vision, instruments, appliances, eyeglasses, spectacles and other kindred products.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The board .concluded that the language of the statute requires that an optician be on the premises \u201cat all times.\u201d The board also concluded that a practical reason for the requirement is that there is a high probability that when an \u201coptical shop is open, a customer will have services performed which should be done under the direct supervision of the licensed optician even when no licensed optician is in fact on the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Statutes must be interpreted to give meaning to their plain language and to provide a unified body of law. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>supra, 398. An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is ordinarily an aid to its construction and should be accorded great weight. <em>Local 1186 </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>182 Conn. 93, 105, 438 A.2d 12 (1980). This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ordinarily true where the statutory language is ambiguous and the \u201cgovernmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation is'reasonable . . . .\u2019 <em>\u201d Anderson v. Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 555-56, 400 A.2d 712 (1978). \u201cLike courts, \u2018administrative agencies must necessarily interpret statutes which are made for their guidance. To rule otherwise would be to ignore the subtle and intricate interaction of law and fact. It is inherent in our judicial system of dispute resolution that the interpretation of statutes, like the development of the common law, grows out of the filtering of a set of facts through the law, as seen by the administrator or judge.\u2019 <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 356-57, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977).\u201d <em>Eagle Hill Corporation </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>2 Conn. App. 68, 76, 477 A.2d 660 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The plaintiff contends, in this appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining the board\u2019s interpretation of <em>$ </em>20-153, that the requirement that optical establishments be conducted under the direct supervision of a licensed optician is limited by the type of business that is actually conducted in the store. The plaintiff argues that the language in \u00a7 20-153, \u201csell, dispense or supply [eyeglasses] to the ultimate wearer optical aids,\u201d determines the conduct that must be supervised by a licensed optician and \u201csuch supervision is not required in the absence of such activity.\u201d We cannot agree with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s analysis fails to include critical language immediately preceding the language it relies upon for its proffered construction of the statute. The relevant portion of the statute provides \u201cfor permission to sell, dispense or supply to the ultimate wearer optical aids to vision, instruments, appliances, eyeglasses, spectacles and other kindred products.\u201d Contrary to the construction proposed by the plaintiff, the described conduct defines \u201coptical establishment, office, department or store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Thus, giving all the words in the statute their logical and plain meaning; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 707; and reading \u00a7 20-153 as a unified whole, we conclude that an optical establishment is any enterprise which has permission to carry on any of the services described in the statute and that the direct supervision of a licensed optician is required for the operation of such enterprises, whether the establishment is actually carrying on those services or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">This conclusion is consistent with the public purpose expressed by the legislature when it enacted these statutes. \u201cThe provisions of this chapter [381] are enacted in the exercise of police powers of the state, and the purposes thereof generally are to protect public health, welfare and safety. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-139. In enacting regulations that require a qualified person to be present on the business premises, the legislature seeks to assure the public that the qualified person shall be in a position where he can exercise direct and immediate control over the conduct of the regulated business. Log<em>lisci </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>123 Conn. 31, 38, 192 A. 260 (1937). We note that an optical establishment is required to display its permit in a conspicuous place at all times. General Statutes \u00a7 20-157. The message that this permit communicates to the public is that a qualified person is on the premises. Allowing these establishments to choose, arbitrarily, when they will have a licensed optician on the premises would unjustifiably place the burden on the customer to determine whether a licensed optician is, in fact, on the premises. The plaintiffs construction of \u00a7 20-153 would also place an unwarranted burden on unlicensed employees when customers, seeking regulated services, enter such establishments at times when no licensed optician is on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Finally, we note that in interpreting \u00a7 20-153, great deference must be accorded the construction given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the statute by the board, which is charged with enforcement of that statute and the regulations. <em>Pergament Norwalk Corporation </em>v. <em>Kaimowitz, </em>4 Conn. App. 633, 637, 496 A.2d 217 (1985). The board concluded that the express language of \u00a7 20-153 requires that \u201conce a store is open for business and given a permit [the store] has to be under the direct and personal supervision of a licensed optician at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Although it may be technically feasible to operate an optical establishment without actually conducting regulated services, the facts of this case illustrate the practical impossibility of walking such a fine line. Here, on two occasions, an unlicensed employee dispensed regulated services to health department investigators while there was no licensed optician on the premises. In fact, the plaintiff concedes that it was its practice to operate its optical stores one day of each week without a licensed optician on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The operator of a regulated business is not entitled to decide for himself when he will engage in such activity. See <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>140 Conn. 582, 584-85, 102 A.2d 349 (1954). If we were to construe \u00a7 20-153 as the plaintiff proposes, there would be no obstacle to operating optical establishments five days each week without a licensed optician on the premises. We cannot conclude that the legislature intended such a bizarre and irrational result when it enacted \u00a7 20-153. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>4 Conn. App. 87, 92, 492 A.2d 839 (1985). Nor can we conclude that the legislature intended that the health department would be required to police such an unwieldy regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Finally, we conclude, after a review of the record and briefs, that the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">In this opinion Stoughton, J. concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-16\"> U.S. Vision, Inc., doing business as Leased Optical and doing business as Wall and Oachs, was the named defendant in the statement of charges. Also cited as defendants were five licensed opticians who managed the separate stores. The board found that the department failed to present any evidence which would support a judgment against the individual licensed opticians for the alleged violations of General Statutes \u00a7 20-153. The charges against the individual opticians were not appealed to the Superior Court and are, therefore, not on appeal to this court.

The majority opinion cites no authority in support of this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Pursuant to its authority under General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 19a-17, the board made the following order: \u201c(1) That U.S. Vision <em>be fined </em>five hundred dollars for each of ten separate counts of violations of Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 20-153 and \u00a7 20-154. A check for $5000 should be made payable to the State of Connecticut and be submitted within 30 days.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The administrative order of the board, despite limitations under \u00a7 19a-17, by its very terms imposed separate criminal \u201cfines\u201d upon U.S. Vision without the attendant due process safeguards and constitutional protections. The board did not impose a civil \u201cpenalty for each separate violation,\u201d as the majority states. This action of the board was ultra vires and imposed criminal sanctions, rather than an authorized civil penalty, upon the named plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the board relied specifically upon the following statutory provisions for the imposition of its penalty upon U.S. Vision: \u201c17. Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 20-154 provides in pertinent part that: The certificate of registration, permit or license of any optician or of any optical permittee may be revoked, suspended or annulled or any action taken under section 19a-17 upon decision after notice and hearing by the board for any of the following reasons: . . . violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted hereunder .... 18. Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 20-153 provides in perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>nent part that: The department may grant annually, upon the filing of an application as required by it, an optical permit to any optical establishment, office, department or store conducted under <em>the personal and direct supervision </em>of a licensed optician, for permission to sell, dispense or supply to the ultimate wearer optical aids to vision, instruments, appliances, eyeglasses, spectacles and other kindred products.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17 provides that the board \u201cmay take any of the following [disciplinary] actions, singly or in combination . . . upon finding the existence of good cause: (1) Revoke a practitioner\u2019s license or permit; (2) Suspend a practitioner\u2019s license or permit; (3) Censure a practitioner or permittee; (4) Issue a letter of reprimand to a practitioner or permittee; (5) Place a practitioner or permittee on probationary status . . . [or] (6) Assess a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars . . . .\u201d Relevant to this discussion is the criminal penalty for a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 20-153 and 20-154 provided in \u00a7 20-161 as follows: \u201cAny person who violates any provison of this chapter, for the violation of which no other penalty has been provided, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both. <em>For purposes of this section each instance of patient contact or consultation which is in violation of any provision of this section shall constitute a separate offense. . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The issue under consideration is controlled by the specific and contrasting definitions adopted by the legislature as to sanctions for the optical permit violations under consideration on this appeal. The legislature\u2019s penalty distinction would be meaningless if the civil penalty provided \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) were to be a criminal fine as allowed by \u00a7 20-161 for separate offenses and as imposed by the board in this case. The legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>intent in its distinction between the civil penalty of \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6), and the criminal penalty of a fine or imprisonment, or both, and for multiple offenses, under \u00a7 20-161, is evident in the clear language of these statutory provisions. A civil penalty is remedial in nature, while a criminal penalty is penal. For this reason, the imposition of a criminal penalty mandates the safeguards of due process and other constitutional protections. An administrative agency, such as the board here, may impose civil penalties only. Criminal penalties are the exclusive province of a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018penalty\u2019 in its broadest sense includes all punishment of whatever kind. 13 Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 53. A fine is always a penalty, but a penalty may not always be a fine. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>111 Fed. Rep. 525. A fine is a \u2018pecuniary punishment imposed by a lawful tribunal upon a person convicted of crime or misdemeanor.\u2019 2 Bouvier Law Dictionary (3d Rev.) 1225; <em>Southern Express Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Walker, </em>92 Va. 59, 63, 22 S.E. 809; <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>4 Lans. (N.Y.) 136, 140.\u201d <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>96 Conn. 361, 368, 114 A. 104 (1921); <em>Second National Bank of New Haven </em>v. <em>Loftus, </em>121 Conn. 454, 459, 185 A. 423 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s conduct considered by the board under the provision of \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) is not a crime punishable in a criminal proceeding in a court of law. The constitutional protections applicable to criminal prosecutions do not attach to the imposition of a civil penalty under \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6). The statute\u2019s provisions for disciplinary action by the board allow for civil administrative sanctions of a remedial character in support of the enforcement of \u00a7 20-154, which provides that \u201c[t]he certificate of registration, permit or license of any optician or of any optical permittee may be revoked, suspended or annulled or any action taken under section 19a-17 upon decision after notice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>hearing by the board for any of the following reasons: . . . violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted hereunder. . . .\u201d Supplemental to such civil sanctions, criminal prosecution is available under the provisions of \u00a7 20-161 for a violation of any \u201cprovision of this chapter, for the violation of which no other penalty has been provided.\u201d Our concern in this appeal relates solely to the legality of the board\u2019s administrative civil penalty under \u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The board acted illegally when it ordered \u201c[tjhat U.S. Vision <em>be fined </em>five hundred dollars ($500) for <em>each </em>of ten separate counts of violations of Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 20-153 and \u00a7 20-154\u201d for a total of $5000. (Emphasis added.) Unlike the criminal penalty prescribed in \u00a7 20-161 which permits multiple penalties in its provision that \u201c[f]or purposes of this section <em>each instance </em>of patient contact or consultation which is in violation of any provision of this section <em>shall constitute a separate offense,\u201d </em>\u00a7 19a-17 (a) (6) expressly and limitedly authorizes the assessment of a \u201ccivil penalty of up to one thousand dollars.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The multiple \u201cassessment\u201d of a civil penalty or \u201cfine,\u201d as was imposed by the board here, is illegal for want of legislative authorization. By the terms of \u00a7 19a-17, the legislature intended to punish only the course of action which the alleged individual acts under administrative review constitute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 Conn. 657, 665-66, 539 A.2d 133 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">This interpretation of \u00a7 19a-17 is supported by the 1986 amendment to that statute. Public Acts 1986, No. 86-365, \u00a7 2, provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Each board or commission . . . may take any of the following actions, singly or in combination, based on conduct WHICH OCCURRED PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A permit OR A license upon finding the existence of good cause . . . .\u201d While the amended version of \u00a7 19a-17 is not controlling in this case, it is signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>cant. This specific language demonstrates the legislative intent that \u00a7 19a-17 proscribe and punish a course of ongoing conduct, rather than separate actions' or events in the course of that behavior. \u201cIt is an accepted canon of statutory construction that \u2018[a] subsequent legislative act may throw light on the legislative intent of a former related act. <em>General Realty Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>133 Conn. 238, 242, 50 A.2d 59 [1946].\u2019 <em>Hartford </em>v. Suffield, 137 Conn. 341, 346, 77 A.2d 760 (1950).\u201d <em>Sandrew </em>v. <em>Pequot Drug, Inc., </em>4 Conn. App. 627, 630 n.5, 495 A.2d 1127 (1985); see also <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Multiple fines may be imposed for multiple acts only in a criminal prosecution as expressly allowed under \u00a7 20-161. The board was limited in its civil disciplinary sanctions to the express terms of \u00a7 19a-17, which does not permit multiple \u201cfines\u201d for each act established on administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">To this extent I disagree with the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
