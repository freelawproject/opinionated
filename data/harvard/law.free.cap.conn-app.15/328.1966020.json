The defendant claims that the failure to disclose such charges violated the strictures enunciated in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). The witness first testified for the defendant. Later, upon learning that the witness was a confidential police informant who had supplied information about the defendant to the police, the state called him as a rebuttal witness. The state denied that it had intentionally withheld any information disclosable under <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">After a full evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court found no <em>Brady </em>violation and denied the motion.
