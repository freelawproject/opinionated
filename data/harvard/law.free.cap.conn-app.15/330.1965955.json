On appeal, the defendant raises the following claims of error: (1) the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for acquittal and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>a new trial based on claims of prosecutorial and juror misconduct; (2) the court erred in ruling, in response to the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, that consecutive sentences could be imposed upon convictions for carrying a pistol without a permit and criminal possession of a pistol;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) that his convictions under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 53-217 (a) were in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution; and (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for the crimes of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We have carefully reviewed the entire record of the present case and find each and every claim of error to be without merit. The defendant has not successfully borne the burden of showing the manner in which either the allegedly tainted language of the prosecutor or the alleged improper juror misconduct prejudiced him or denied him his right to a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowakowski, </em>188 Conn. 620, 452 A.2d 938 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kluttz, </em>9 Conn. App. 686, 521 A.2d 178 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Similarly, when construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict, we find it clear that the jury could reasonably have concluded, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 671, 485 A.2d 913 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Iovieno, </em>14 Conn. App. 710, 713, 543 A.2d 766 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Finally, we find that under the holding of <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932), the defendant has not been denied protection against multiple trials and multiple punishments for the same offense under the double jeopardy clause. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>198 Conn. Ill, 120, 502 A.2d 374 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>197 Conn. 588, 592-93, 500 A.2d 547 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> We need not consider the defendant\u2019s second claim of error since, at sentencing, the trial court imposed concurrent sentences of five years for each charge of which the defendant was convicted. The claim of error regarding the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine that the defendant \u201ccould\u201d be sentenced consecutively is a moot issue for the purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
