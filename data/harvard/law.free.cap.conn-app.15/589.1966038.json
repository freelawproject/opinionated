We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The factual background of this case is long and convoluted. In 1985, the state\u2019s first attempt to have this vehicle forfeited ended with a decision by this court that those proceedings were invalid for lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1981 BMW Automobile, </em>5 Conn. App. 540, 500 A.2d 961 (1985) <em>(BMWI). </em>The sequence of events leading up to <em>BMW I </em>are detailed in that opinion and will not be repeated here. Significant developments subsequent to the earlier decision are as follows. On January 9, 1986, slightly more than one month after the decision in <em>BMW I, </em>a second search and seizure warrant was issued for the seizure of the BMW. The vehicle was seized by the state police the following day and a summons was served on the defendant, Daniel D. Skuret, the current owner of the automobile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A summons was also served on Russell Kuskowski who was the BMW\u2019s record owner at the time of the initiation of <em>BMW I </em>and who was represented to be its owner when <em>BMW I </em>was argued in this court. Kuskowski had been represented at those proceedings, as well as in the criminal charges brought against him at that time, by Skuret, who is a member of the Connecticut bar. Subsequent to his arrest on the criminal charges, Kuskowski assigned his interest in the BMW to Skuret in payment of legal fees. The propriety of this transfer will be discussed in greater detail in part IV of this opinion, infra. Because Kuskowski no longer had an interest in the automobile, the trial court dismissed the present action as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On January 17, 1986, the defendant appeared and filed a motion to dismiss the action claiming, inter alia, that (1) the search and seizure warrant was not based on probable cause due to its reliance on four year old information, and (2) at the time the warrant was executed, there was no allegation of criminal activity on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the part of the defendant, the vehicle\u2019s current owner. The court granted the motion and dismissed the forfeiture action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The state\u2019s first claim of error involves the court\u2019s determination that the search and seizure warrant issued was not grounded in probable cause because the affidavit concerned activities that had occurred in 1982, and had grown \u201cstale\u201d by January, 1986, when the second warrant was executed. The state argues that an allegation that property has been used in the commission of a crime cannot become stale. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Under both state and federal constitutional law, a search and seizure warrant shall not issue but upon probable cause. U.S. Const., amend. IV; Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 7. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThrough the fourteenth amendment the fundamental federal constitutional safeguards as to the issuance of warrants embodied in the fourth amendment, as interpreted and applied in decisions of the United States Supreme Court, are made obligatory upon the states. <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 33, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726 [1963].\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 443, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Licari, </em>153 Conn. 127, 214 A.2d 900 (1965).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 409, 439 A.2d 387 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\u201cWe have stated that \u2018[p]robable cause to search exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the particular items sought to be seized are connected with criminal activity or will assist in a particular apprehension or conviction . . . and (2) there is probable cause to believe that the items sought to be seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>will be found in the place to be searched.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 528-29, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980).\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>185 Conn. 104, 111, 440 A.2d 841 (1981). Thus, a finding of probable cause to search involves a bipartite analysis and adequate information is required for each determination. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">To fulfill these requirements, the state included information in its warrant and supporting affidavit to the effect (1) that the vehicle sought to be seized \u201chad been used\u201d as the means of committing the crime of \u201cPossession of Cocaine with Intent to Sell, \u00a7 21a-277 (a) [and] Sale of Cocaine, \u00a7 2la-277 (a),\u201d and (2) that the vehicle could be found at an automotive repair business located in Ansonia or in the possession of the owner, Skuret. The issuing judicial authority found these allegations supported by facts set forth in the warrant application and sufficient to establish probable cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The trial court found the allegations of the criminal use of the vehicle to be stale. There is no claim of a contemporaneity problem with the second prong of the inquiry, i.e., the information regarding the locus of the property at the time of the execution of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The staleness doctrine involves the concept that the passage of time can diminish the reliability of information provided in a search warrant request. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>172 Conn. 242, 250, 374 A.2d 215, cert. denied, 431 U.S. 967, 97 S. Ct. 2925, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1063 (1977). The doctrine, however, concerns itself with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>location </em>of the items to be seized and the likelihood that those items are located in the place alleged by the warrant application. See, e.g., <em>Sqro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U.S. 206, 53 S. Ct. 138, 77 L. Ed. 260 (1932); <em>Durham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>403 F.2d 190, 193-94 n.3 (9th Cir. 1968); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>7 Conn. App. 354, 356, 508 A.2d 824 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>7 Conn. App. 265, 269-70, 508 A.2d 795 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In many circumstances, the passage of time may affect the likelihood that the items sought have been moved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the present case there is no question of the timeliness of the information in the affidavit regarding the current locus of the automobile.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We conclude, however, that the trial court\u2019s application of the staleness doctrine to the first prong of the probable cause analysis, (i.e., the connection between the property and the alleged criminal activity) was misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Where, as here, facts have been alleged which constitute probable cause that certain events have taken place, the mere passage of time cannot diminish that conclusion. Stale does not simply mean old. An analogy can be drawn between the first prong of the probable cause analysis for a search warrant and the probable cause analysis for an arrest warrant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Just as probable cause to arrest, once found, cannot be dissipated by the passage of time, probable cause to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>property has been used in connection with a crime similarly cannot be diminished.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that, under the facts of this case, the trial court erred in applying the staleness doctrine to the first prong of the probable cause analysis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The state also contends that the trial court erred in concluding that, without an allegation of the defendant\u2019s involvement in criminal activity, the forfeiture action could not lie. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 54-33g \u2018provides for a civil action <em>in rem </em>for the condemnation and forfeiture of the [property] which was used in violation of the law. ... In such an action the guilt or innocence of the owner of the [property] is not in issue. The only issue is whether the [property] was used in violation of law. This follows from the nature of the action which is one against the <em>res, </em>an action <em>in rem.\u2019 State </em>v. <em>Bucchieri, </em>176 Conn. 339, 345, 407 A.2d 990 (1978), quoting <em>Alcorn v. Alexandrovicz, </em>112 Conn. 618, 623, 153 A. 786 (1931).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>194 Conn. 589, 592, 483 A.2d 1085 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">This rule may indeed be harsh in some situations and, to counteract its claimed unfairness, certain exceptions to the rule have been made and constitutional protections often have been invoked. For example, the statute itself provides an exception to forfeiture for the holder of a \u201cbona fide mortgage, assignment of lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>or rent, [or of a] lien or security interest.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g (c). See footnote 1, supra. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has noted two instances where a forfeiture statute may violate the due process rights of the property\u2019s owner: \u201c \u2018[I]t would be difficult to reject the constitutional claim of an owner whose property subjected to forfeiture had been taken from him without his privity or consent. . . . Similarly, the same might be said of an owner who proved not only that he was uninvolved in and unaware of the wrongful activity, but also that he had done all that reasonably could be expected to prevent the proscribed use of his property. . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 593 n.4.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1977 Buick Automobile, </em>196 Conn. 471, 486, 493 A.2d 874 (1985), quoting <em>Calero-Toledo </em>v. <em>Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 689, 94 S. Ct. 2080, 40 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The status of the defendant in the present case does not bring him within any of the elucidated exceptions nor within any other exception of which we can conceive. In fact, as the recipient of Kuskowski\u2019s interest in the automobile, at a point in time after the alleged criminal activity and with knowledge of both that criminal activity and the state\u2019s attempts to have the vehicle adjudged a nuisance, the \u201cinnocence\u201d of this defendant is in question. For us to allow the transfer of the vehicle\u2019s ownership to purge the criminal taint of the uses to which it had been put would be to thwart the obvious purpose of the statutory provision.Under the defendant\u2019s contention, any property used in the commission of a crime could be exempted from the in rem forfeiture statute through the simple expedient of a laundering transaction. This result would further neither the spirit nor the letter of our forfeiture statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In his motion to dismiss this action in the trial court, the defendant claimed that he had been served with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>a defective summons. The trial court did not address this claim in its memorandum of decision, relying instead on the issues previously discussed in this opinion. In his brief, however, the defendant again raises this claim, presumably as either an alternative ground for affirmance or as an adverse ruling for which he seeks review. We decline to review this claim for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">First, the defendant failed in two respects to comply with our rules of practice. Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1) provides: \u201cIf the appellee wishes to (A) present for review alternate grounds upon which the judgment may be affirmed, or (B) present for review adverse rulings or decisions of the court which should be considered on appeal in the event the appellant is awarded a new trial . . . that appellee <em>shall </em>file a preliminary statement of issues within fourteen days from the filing of the appellant\u2019s preliminary statement of the issues.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant did not file a preliminary statement of issues. The defendant also failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 4066 (a), which requires that the appellee\u2019s brief contain \u201c[a] counter statement of any issue involved as to which the appellee disagrees with the statement of the appellant or a statement of any other grounds which were properly raised by an appellee under Sec. 4013.\u201d The defendant did not include a statement of issues in his brief and, even if he had, the claim he now raises is neither a \u201ccounter statement\u201d of an appellant\u2019s issue nor an issue \u201cproperly raised . . . under Sec. 4013.\u201d The defendant\u2019s failure to follow the dictates of our Practice Book provides sufficient grounds for our refusal to review the claim now raised by the defendant. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>14 Conn. App. 463, 471. n.4, 541 A.2d 534 (1988); <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Consumer Protection, </em>12 Conn. App. 251, 257 n.11, 530 A.2d 641 (1987); see also <em>Cristofaro </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>ing Commission, </em>11 Conn. App. 260, 265-66, 527 A.2d 255 <em>(Bieluch, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 204 Conn. 810, 528 A.2d 1156 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Second, we find fatal the defendant\u2019s failure to request an articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051 regarding the trial court\u2019s disposition of this claim at trial. Without a clear finding by the trial court of the facts which underlie the defendant\u2019s claim, we do not know the true nature of the issue we are asked to review. The defendant has clearly failed to carry his burden in properly presenting a claim for our review. See <em>Leo </em>v. <em>Leo, </em>197 Conn. 1, 3-4, 495 A.2d 704 (1985); <em>Vaiuso </em>v. <em>Vaiuso, </em>2 Conn. App. 141, 149, 477 A.2d 678, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 807, 482 A.2d 712 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s failure to identify this issue in a preliminary statement of issues, his failure to request an articulation of the trial court\u2019s disposition of the claim, his failure to file a statement of issues in his brief, and his introduction of the issue for the first time in his appellee\u2019s brief constitutes appeal by ambuscade. We refuse to consider this issue. See Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">At oral argument before this court, the parties were questioned regarding the propriety of the 1982 transfer of the BMW from its then owner, Kuskowski, to the defendant. Although this issue is not dispositive of the substantive claims presented in this appeal, it raises questions which we cannot ignore.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The following chronology can be gleaned from the relevant records and files. Kuskowski was arrested on May 3, 1982. On the following day, a search and seizure warrant was issued for the BMW and an in rem summons was served on Kuskowski, thereby initiating the first forfeiture action brought pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 54-33g. An appearance was filed on behalf of Kuskowski in the criminal case by the law offices of the present defendant on May 11,1982. On July 16, 1982, Kuskowski executed an assignment of \u201call right, title and interest that he may have\u201d in the BMW to his attorney, the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Kuskowski thereafter went to trial, before a jury, and was convicted of the crimes with which he was charged on February 2, 1983. On March 1, 1983, the defendant filed his appearance in the in rem action on behalf of the \u201cowner\u201d of the vehicle and also filed a motion to dismiss the original forfeiture action on behalf of \u201cthe owner, Russell Kuskowski.\u201d On May 3, the trial court found the BMW to be a nuisance pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-33g and ordered it forfeited to the state. That forfeiture was the subject of our decision in <em>BMW I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The issue raised by the foregoing information is a possible violation of Disciplinary Rule 5-103 (A) of our state Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In pertinent part, that rule provided that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation he is conducting for a client, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>that he may: (1) Acquire a lien granted by law to secure his fees or expenses. (2) Contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">It is generally accepted that this provision was originally a response to the common law disapproval of champerty and maintenance;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.8 comment; however, it is also currently recognized as an attempt to avoid unnecessary conflicts of interest between attorneys and clients. \u201cThe possibility of an adverse effect upon the exercise of free judgment by a lawyer on behalf of his client during litigation generally makes it undesirable for the lawyer to acquire a proprietary interest in . . . the outcome of the litigation. . . .\u201d Code of Professional Responsibility EC 5-7; see also C. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 8.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">As they appear from the various documents before us, the facts strongly suggest that the defendant\u2019s acceptance of Kuskowski\u2019s interest in the BMW was in violation of this rule. It is not within the province of this court, however, to determine whether or not a violation has in fact occurred. This court, therefore, will refer the matter to the statewide bar counsel pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 27F for investigation and such action as that authority deems proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The possible ethical violation discussed in the concurring opinion did not occur in the course of argument in the present case, but during the argument in <em>BMW I </em>which took place in 1985. We do not condone any misrepresentation which may have been made during the hearing of the earlier case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In this opinion Bieluch, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 54-33g. summons to owner on seizure of PROPERTY.

I agree with the majority opinion, as far as it goes. I write separately because in my view it does not go far enough in bringing to light an apparent violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility by the defendant occurring in the presence of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Part IV of the majority opinion properly notes a possible violation of the code by the defendant in acquiring his interest in the car which is the subject matter of this litigation, and it properly notes that the matter will be referred to the statewide bar counsel, because the appropriate grievance panel has jurisdiction over ethical violations not occurring in the presence of the court. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30 and 31 (a). It does not note, however, that in the course of the argument of this appeal, facts were disclosed to us which constitute a possible violation of the code occurring in the presence of this court, over which that committee does not have jurisdiction. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\"><em>State </em>v. <em>One 1981 BMW Automobile, </em>5 Conn. App. 540, 500 A.2d 961 (1985) <em>(BMW I), </em>was briefed, argued and decided on the explicit representation by Daniel D. Skuret, the attorney for Russell Kuskowski in that case, that Kuskowski was the owner of the car and that Skuret represented him as his attorney. That is quite clear from even a cursory reading of <em>BMW I, </em>from a reading of Kuskowski\u2019s brief in that case, which I have reviewed, and from the facts stated in the majority opinion in this case. We have now learned, in the course of this appeal, that since July 16,1982, Kuskowski had no interest whatsoever in the car, and that on that date Skuret acquired ownership of the car as a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>fee. Skuret, however, continued to represent both to the trial court in 1983, and to this court in 1985, that Kuskowski was the owner of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Disciplinary Rule 7-102 (A) (4) of the code, entitled \u201cRepresenting a Client Within the Bounds of the Law,\u201d in effect and governing Skuret\u2019s conduct before this court in 1985, provided: \u201c(A) In his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not: . . . (4) knowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.\u201d Rule 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct contain an essentially similar provision. Skuret\u2019s course of conduct in representing to this court that Kuskowski was the owner of the car, when in fact Skuret himself was its owner, raises a possible ethical violation, flowing from his duty as an attorney in the course of <em>BMW I </em>to be candid and honest to this tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Of striking significance is the strong suggestion from the records of <em>BMW I </em>and this case that Skuret knowingly misrepresented to this court, in the course of <em>BMW I, </em>that Kuskowski was the car\u2019s owner, when in fact Kuskowski was not its owner, and when Skuret\u2019s ownership itself may have been in violation of the canons of ethics. This, it seems to me, is a possible violation of Disciplinary Rule 7-102 (A) (4), occurring in the presence of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Furthermore, by that misrepresentation Skuret induced this court to decide <em>BMW I, </em>indeed to decide it in <em>his </em>favor, when, had we been properly informed that Kuskowski no longer had any interest in the car, arguably we would have dismissed the appeal as moot. It is a fundamental principle of appellate jurisdiction that a property owner must maintain his interest in the property which is the subject matter of litigation throughout an appeal in order to maintain his standing to appeal. See <em>Groesbeck </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>1 Conn. App. 66, 68-69, 467 A.2d 1245 (1983). So far as we were informed in <em>BMW I, </em>the owner of the car was Kuskowski. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>It was <em>his </em>appeal as owner that we decided. Certainly, had we known in 1985 that the true owner of the car was Skuret, the attorney purportedly representing Kuskowski, who in fact no longer had any interest in whether the car was forfeited to the state, the disposition of <em>BMW I </em>may well have been different. Indeed, had we dismissed <em>BMW I </em>as moot, the present case would never have been litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">This course of conduct, however, cannot be addressed by a grievance panel, because it occurred in the presence of the court. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30 and 31 (a). It is my belief that this conduct should be addressed by the entire Appellate Court, or by some panel or tribunal acting as an arm of this court. Regrettably, the Appellate Court has determined to ignore this possible affront to the integrity of its appellate process. I disagree with that determination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
