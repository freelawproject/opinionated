Nevertheless, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">The defendant pleaded non-assumpsit and limitations, on which issues were joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">1st Exception. At the trial of this cause the plaintiff to maintain the issue on his part joined, proved to the jury, that at the April term 1824 of <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county court, <em>Samuel Peach, </em>the defendant in this cause, recovered a judgment against a certain <em>Nathan Waters </em>and the other parties to it, upon a bond given to him as trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">Samuel Peach <em>vs. </em>Nathan Waters. April 12th, judgment for $14,485, debt and costs, to be released on payment of $7,247.87J, with interest from 21st September 1811, till paid, and costs. Or. By $1,400, 29th March 1822. By $1,105.89, 3rd April 1824.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">And that process of execution issued from said court for the purpose of making the money due on said judgment, which came to the hands of the sheriff of <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county, and was levied upon certain lands as the property of the said <em>Nathan Waters; </em>and the plaintiff proved by <em>Richard W. Isaac, </em>a competent witness, that he was deputy sheriff, and charged with the execution of said process, and caused the said lands to be advertised for sale on the 30th day of December 1826; that on the day before the said sale was to take place, witness went to the defendant to know whether it would be necessary for him the witness to attend the said sale, and whether he the defendant would attend; that the defendant informed witness that he would not attend the sale, but his brother <em>Richard Peach, </em>would come from <em>Annapolis </em>and attend the sale for him the defendant, and that he the defendant had fully authorised his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>said brother to settle the business, and that he would be satisfied with whatever settlement his brother made in relation to the business. On the day of the sale <em>Richard </em>Peach, who wras proved to be the attorney for defendant, and who -obtained the judgment, was present, and the bidding being dull, he said, \u201cbuy the land gentlemen;\u201d \u201cbuy the land-doctor,\u201d (speaking to the plaintiff,) \u201cI will burst the deeds from <em>Nathan Waters </em>to <em>\u201cNathan J. Waters </em>and <em>Samuel </em>Radcliff'e; I will give you a \u201cgood title, and I will put you in possession of the land, and it shall not cost you a cent.\u201d And plaintiff became the purchaser of said lands for the sum of $1,350. And witness further stated, that he did not receive any part of the purchase -money, but that the said <em>Richard Peach, </em>as attorney, gave him a receipt on the day of sale in satisfaction of the said execution, stating at the same time, that he and the purchaser would \u25a0settle about the purchase money among themselves. Witness -further proved, that he called on defendant some time in the year 1827 or 1828, in -relation to the payment of the poundage fee due on said execution, when defendant informed him, that the purchase money for said lands had been paid, and the land settled for. Witness further stated, that he called on defendant the day before said sale as above stated, because he believed there would be no sale of said properly, unless the said defendant attended at said sale. No person had bid for the land, until the said <em>Richard Peach </em>had made the above declarations, and shortly after they were made, the said lands were knocked off to the said <em>Charles Duvall, </em>as the highest bidder. And the plaintiff further proved by competent testimony, that the defendant in this cause was examined under oath, in virtue of a commission issued in 1837, from the Court of Chancery, in a cause wherein the plaintiff in this case was complainant, and <em>\u25a0Nathan Waters </em>and others were defendants, instituted by the plaintiff, for the purpose of vacating the deeds heretofore referred to, and upon said examination, and in conversations with the witness, defendant stated, that he was satisfied with the application of the purchase money by said <em>R. Peach, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the said witness upon cross examination stated, that in said conversations, he understood defendant to say, that his brother <em>Richard </em>Peach, had acted as his attorney. The said deputy sheriff also proved on cross examination, that on the day of sale, <em>R. Peach </em>did not represent himself as the agent of the said defendant, and that he did not hear the defendant\u2019s name mentioned on that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">The defendant thereupon prayed the court to give the jury the following instructions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">1. That <em>Richard </em>Peach, as the mere attorney of <em>Samuel Peach, </em>had no authority to make the contract declared on ii&gt; this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-7\">2. That if the jury shall believe from the evidence, that <em>Richard Peach </em>did enter into the agreement mentioned in the declaration, that said agreement is not binding on <em>Samuel Peach, </em>unless the jury shall further find from the evidence, that <em>Richard Peach </em>was authorised by <em>Samuel Peach, </em>to make as his agent such a contract, and that he did, in pursuance of such authority, actually make the contract as the agent of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\">3. That the alleged contract being a contract concerning lands, would not be binding on <em>Samuel Peach, </em>unless it was-reduced to writing, and signed by <em>Samuel Peach, </em>or by some agent thereunto by him lawfully authorised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">4. That the said contract was not, in the contemplation of the parties, to be completed within one year from the date thereof; then that the same was void, unless reduced to writing, and signed by <em>Samuel Peach, </em>or his lawfully authorised agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">The court (Stephen, C. J. and Key, A. J.) granted the first, second and third prayers, but refused to' grant the fourth prayer. The plaintiff excepted to the instructions granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-11\">2nd Exception. Upon the evidence contained in the preceding bill of exceptions, which is to be considered' as part of this exception, the plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they should find from the evidence, that there was an agreement between the plaintiff and <em>Richard Peach, </em>as the authorised agent of the defendant, and in virtue of said agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ment the plaintiff purchased the land, as stated in the preceding exception, and paid the purchase money to the said defendant or his agent, and that the said agreement had not been complied with on the part of the defendant, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon the count for money had and received, although they should find that the said agieement was not in writing, and signed by the defendant, or some person by him fully authorised; which instruction the court gave. The defendant by his counsel, thereupon prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they should find from the evidence, that the agreement was made, and the purchase money paid on the 30th December 1826, and that the original writ in this cause did not issue until the 1st day of March 1840, that then the action is barred by limitations, unless they should find -some subsequent assumption or promise by the defendant, either to repay the money or perform the said contract, and they must find for the defendant; which prayer the court granted, and gave the instruction accordingly. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">3rd Exception. In addition to the testimony contained in the preceding bills of exceptions, and which is to be considered as part of this bill of exceptions, the plaintiff, for the purpose of removing the bar of the statute of limitations, offered to prove by <em>Thomas F. Bowie, </em>esquire, an attorney and counsellor at law and solicitor in chancery, a competent witness in this cause, that he is acquainted and familiar with the practice and course of proceedings in courts of law and chancery in <em>Maryland, </em>and that he has examined certain records of proceedings instituted in <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county court, the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Chancery, by the plaintiff in this action, first, for the purpose of getting possession of the lands mentioned and referred to in the preceding evidence, and after-wards, for the purpose of vacating and annulling certain deeds for the said lands from <em>Mathan Waters </em>to <em>Mathan J. Waters, </em>and <em>Samuel Radcliffe, </em>and that he was solicitor for said <em>Duvall </em>in said cause and proceedings from the year 1835 to 1839, and that from the knowledge of the course and manner of said proceedings in the said county court, Court of Chancery, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the Court of Appeals, and in his opinion, judging by his examination of the said proceedings- instituted and conducted by the plaintiff as aforesaid, the said plaintiff\" had used reasonable- diligence- in his efforts to acquire possession of the said lands under the-said purchase and agreement, and to set aside- and vacate- said deeds, and procure a good title to the same. And the plaintiff further offered to prove by the said witness, that the said proceedings were first commenced by the said' <em>Duvall, </em>the plaintiff in this case, in the year 1827, or 1828,. or 1829, as he knows by inspection of the record, and were-continued by him in the county court, Court of Chancery, and' Court of Appeals, continuously down to the year 1839. And-' the said plaintiff also offered in evidence, a duly authenticated record of the-proceedings in the Court of Appeals, on an appeal from Chancery, wherein the said <em>Charles Duvall </em>was complainant, and the said <em>JYathan Waters </em>and others were defendants, in which cause the validity of said deeds had been in issue in the- said courts between- the present plaintiff claiming: under the sheriff\u2019s sale and agreement aforesaid, and those-claiming title to the said lands under the- aforesaid deeds, for the purpose of shewing when said proceedings commenced and ended, and that the issues involved in the cause embraced the validity of said deeds.. But the defendant, by his counsel, objected to the admissibility of the said evidence,, which objection the court, sustained, and refused to permit any of the said evidence to go to the jury. The plaintiff' excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">The verdict and judgment being- against the- plaintiff, he prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b188-6\">The cause was argued before- Archer, Dorsey, and Spence, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-7\">By Digges and Tuck for the appellantsy and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-8\">By Pratt and C. C. Magruder for'the appellee.-</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b188-9\">Spence, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJd\">delivered the opinion of this-court..</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">After a careful examination of the several legal propositions decided by the county court and brought up to- this court for revision, we are prepared to say, that in them wefind no-error..</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The first and second propositions under the first bill of exceptions appear to us so manifestly clear, that we find great difficulty in suggesting argumenis or reasons which will render their correctness more conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The third proposition arising under the first bill of exceptions, raises the question, whether the agreement set out in the declaration and relied on by the plaintiff, is such an agreement as is within the statute of frauds. The parol agreement, or rather that part of the agreement relied on, to charge the defendant as set out in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, is as follows, viz: \u201cAt which said sale, the said <em>Charles </em>then and there became the purchaser, upon the express promise and undertaking of him the said Samuel, that if he- the said <em>Charles </em>would purchase the lands as aforesaid, he the said <em>Samuel </em>would invalidate the deed for said lands, which had been before that time executed by the said <em>JSIatkan </em>to a certain <em>JYalhanJ. Waters </em>and a certain <em>Samuel Radcliffe, </em>under which the said <em>JYathanJ. </em>and <em>Samuel Radcliffe </em>claimed to hold the same as their property, and would put the said <em>Charles </em>in possession of said lands so-as aforesaid purchased by him ; that the said <em>Charles </em>confiding in the promise and agreement of the said <em>Samuel, </em>so as aforesaid, then and there made, then and there became the purchaser, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We are fully persuaded that this agreement fidls entirely within that class of cases which the authorities determine to be agreements within the statute of frauds, and in principle almost identical with <em>Lamborn vs. Watson, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J. </em>252.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The second exception presented a question under the statute of limitations. The court instructed the jury, \u201cthat if they should find from the evidence that the agreement was made and the purchase money paid on the SOth December 1826, and that the original writ in this cause did not issue until the 1st day of March 1840, that then this- action was barred by limitations, unless they should find some subsequent assumption or promise by the defendant, either to re-pay the money or perform the said contract.\u201d In <em>Maryland, </em>to remove the bar raised by the statute of limitations, there must be such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>acknowledgment of a subsisting debt, as is equivalent to an express or implied assumpsit or promise to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">This court cannot decide whether the county court erred in refusing to let the record of the proceedings in the Court of Appeals, on an appeal from Chancery, wherein <em>Charles Duvall </em>was complainant and <em>Nathan Waters </em>and others were defendants, go to the jury, because that record is not made a part of the third bill of exceptions, nor is it in the record; but we think the county court did not err in refusing to let the testimony of <em>Thomas F. Bowie go </em>to the jury, because that was parol evidence of facts of which the plaintiff had record evidence, and therefore was not the best evidence in legal contemplation. JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
