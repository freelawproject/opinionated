Reigarl, </em>(named in said testament and last will,} surviving her; that the said <em>Elizabeth L. Reigart </em>after-wards, to wit, on the 27th day of March, 1827, intermarried with the said <em>Josias Stevenson, junior. </em>The defendant further proved by <em>F. Slower, </em>a competent witness, that he was acquainted with the said <em>Josias Stevenson, junior, </em>in his life time,- and with the said <em>Elizabeth L. Stevenson, </em>his wife, formerly <em>ElizabethL. Reigarl, </em>and that she is his niece; that some time in the year 1829, the said <em>Stevenson </em>and his wife were at the house of the witness in <em>Philadelphia, </em>and the said <em>Stevenson </em>then said that he wanted his wife\u2019s legacy, but that he did noli like to go to <em>Lancaster </em>to get it; the reason why he wanted it \u25a0was, that he could invest it in <em>Baltimore; </em>that it was his intention to invest it in <em>Baltimore </em>for his wife\u2019s exclusive use; that he wanted to protect the money for his wife. Witness told him that he considered it proper that he should do so, as the executors were trustees of this fund, and it was the evident intention of the grand-father to secure it for the benefit of his' grand-daughters. He said he could invest it to more advantage in <em>Baltimore, </em>where it would yield eight or ten per cent.; and he frequently repeated, in the course of the conversation, that he intended to settle the money on his wife, and for her exclusive use. <em>Mrs. Stevenson </em>was present during the conversation. <em>Stevenson </em>told witness that the executors wanted security, and he spoke of <em>Mr. Reigarl, </em>his father-in-law, as the chief obstacle to his getting the legacy, and he expressed a great deal of surprise at the conduct of the executors, as he did not want the money for himself, hut to invest it in <em>Baltimore, </em>where it would yield more and be less troublesome to him. Witness thinks that he saw <em>Stevenson </em>afterwards, and <em>Stevenson </em>told him that he had bought a house in <em>Baltimore, </em>near the Circus, in the name and for the benefit of his wife. The defendant also proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>by <em>Judge Dale, </em>a competent witness, that some time in the fall of 1828, <em>Stevenson </em>came to <em>Lancaster </em>for his wife\u2019s legacy. Said <em>Stevenson, </em>and <em>Dr. Samuel Dufresne, </em>one of the executors of <em>Dr. Albert Dufresne, </em>came together to his office, and spoke to witness about it. <em>Dr. Samuel Dufresne </em>made two objections to paying over the money; ihe <em>first </em>was that <em>Mrs. Steve7ison </em>was yet in her minority, and that the property was hers, and that her husband could not execute a valid release to the executors; the <em>second </em>was, that he himself was entitled to it on the contingency that she died without issue; but he said that he would waive both objections if <em>Stevenson </em>would invest the property for <em>Mrs. Stevenson\u2019s </em>use. Witness suggested a conveyance by <em>Dr. Dufresne </em>to <em>Mrs. Stevenson, </em>of real estate in <em>Lancaster, </em>but <em>Stevenson </em>said that he did not want real estate in <em>Lancaster; </em>that he would rather have it in money, and said that he could invest it to more advantage in <em>Baltimore. </em>Eventually, they partly came to the conclusion that one-half should be paid in real estate, and the other half in money. Witness remarked to Stevenson, that if he received one-half in cash, it would be a very pretty beginning, but he said that he did not want any of it for himself; that he was in business already. They finally came to this agr\u00e9ment, that one-half, consisting of real estate in <em>Lancaster, </em>should be transferred in trust, for the use of <em>Mrs. Stevenson, </em>and that the other half should be given to <em>Stevenson, </em>and that he should invest it for the use of his wife, in real estate in <em>Baltimore. </em>Witness told him it would be his interest, as it was his duty, to invest it for his wife, and he said it was what he wished, and what he intended to do. <em>Stevenson </em>at all times repeated that he did not want the money for his business, but to invest it in real property for his wife. He came again to <em>Lancaster </em>in the spring of 1829, and he said that he had obtained the opinion of two of the ablest lawyers in <em>Baltimore, </em>that he was entitled to the legacies. Witness looked at the opinion, and read it over. Witness then told <em>Mr. Stevenson, </em>that by the laws of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>no person who was an executor, was required to pay over money, without a refunding bond and security. Witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>referred him. to the act of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>of 21st March 1772, entitled \u201cAn act for the most easy recovery of legacies,\u201d and read it to him from the book of laws, and at said <em>Stevenson\u2019s </em>request, witness lent him the book, which he carried to the office of his counsel in <em>Lancaster. </em>He returned and said that he could not give the required security in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>but could do so in <em>Maryland. </em>Shortly after this, <em>Dr. Samuel Dufresne </em>came over to my office and said that <em>Stevenson </em>was pressing him for the money, and that he would do almost any thing to get rid of the matter. Witness then went up to see <em>Mr. Reed, </em>the other executor, and told him that he thought <em>Dr. Dvfresne </em>would give way, and <em>Reed </em>said, \u201czounds! the money shan\u2019t go out of my hands that way.\u201d During all this time, <em>Stevenson </em>said that he only wanted the money where it would be under his own eye, and of no more use to him. <em>Reed </em>came down to my office. It was finally agreed amongst them, that <em>Dr. Samuel Dufresne </em>should convey certain parcels of property in <em>Lancaster, </em>valued at $9,000, to <em>Mrs. Stevenson, </em>for her use, and her use alone, and that the balance of the money, being $10,520, or thereabouts, including the inteiest, should be paid to said <em>Stevenson, </em>to be by him invested in real property in <em>Baltimore, for </em>the use of his wife. Witness did not see the money paid, nor was he present when it was paid, but he prepared a release to the executors, which was executed both by <em>Mr. </em>and <em>Mrs. Stevenson, </em>and left in my hands, upon the understanding that it should be delivered over to the executors, upon the execution and delivery of the deed, for the real property in <em>Lancaster. </em>The reason why the deed was not executed and delivered at the time was, that <em>Mrs. Stevenson </em>made some objection to <em>Mr. Reigart, </em>as trustee, and said that it should remain until they returned to <em>Baltimore, </em>and that if they should make an arrangement, that some other person was to be inserted as trustee in the deed, and if not, then the deed was to be executed and delivered for the property, with <em>Mr. Reigarfs </em>name as trustee. The deed was executed and delivered on the 22nd July 1829.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The defendants then offered in evidence the said deed, which \u25a0is as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">It is agreed that the appellee may, at the argument of \u2022this case in the Court of Appeals, read as a part of the record in the above case, a copy of the deed of trust from <em>Dufresne </em>and others to <em>Philip Reigart; </em>and that an argreement, if any further one be necessary, will be signed on the part of the appellants, to annex the same to the record, as a part of the bill of exceptions in which it is called for. It is further agreed, that the record shall be made out and sent up, without the actual introduction of said deed as a part of the evidence, a reference being made for its insertion in the place where it \u25a0ought to be introduced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">The defendant further proved by said <em>Judge </em>Dale, that he .considered the said deed as a literal execution of the agreement. The said witness on his cross examination further stated, that the release was executed in the month of May 1829, and that said <em>Dr. Samuel Dufresne </em>is dead, and that he died about ten years since. The defendant further proved by <em>Franklin Reigart, </em>a competent witness, that on the very day on which, as he understood, the .money was paid, and before the money was paid, there was some conversation at the dinner table between <em>Stevenson </em>and th.e father of the witness, in relation to said legacies. <em>Stevenson </em>said that he had a great deal of trouble with the executors, and he complained that they demanded a bond with securities in <em>Lancaster. </em>The father of witness then told <em>Stevenson </em>that he could easily get rid of the difficulty, if he would do .what he ought to do.. <em>Stevenson </em>said that he had promised the executors to invest it in property in <em>Baltimore, </em>in his wife\u2019s name, and that he intended to invest it in <em>Baltimore </em>in her name, and that would .clear the executors, but they still demanded security. Witness went after dinner on that day with <em>Stevenson, </em>to see <em>Schaum, </em>whom <em>Stevenson </em>asked to be his security, but <em>Mr. Schaum </em>declined .to be so, upon which <em>Stevenson </em>said to him, that he, <em>Schaum, </em>would run no risk, as he <em>Stevenson </em>had promised the executors that if they would \u00a1pay him the money he would buy property in <em>Baltimore </em>fo.r t.he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>use of fa is wife. <em>Stevenson </em>contended in conversation with the father of witness, that he was not bound to take any real property, and his father to'M <em>Stevenson </em>that the executors only required him to conform with the will, and that by the will the legacy was given, so that neither the father nor the husbands of the grand-daughters could touch it. They both were a little warm on the subject. Witness says that sometime in 1830, he was in Baltimore, and <em>Stevenson </em>there took him to a piece of property near the Circus., where repairs were being made, and told him that that was the property he had purchased. The defendant was proved by <em>Peter Reed, </em>a competent witness, that he was one of the executors of <em>Dr. Albert Dufresne. </em>Witness knew <em>Mr. Stevenson </em>after his marriage, and says he had cause to know him, as he troubled him very much about the legacy. They tormented <em>Dr. </em>Dufresne, the other executor, almost to death, he was sickly and crabbed; hut witness stuck out, and told <em>Stevenson </em>that he would not pay him unless the lav; required it. Witness asked <em>Stevenson </em>why he did not do as the will required. Witness told him that he should not have the money unless he acted according to th'e will. <em>Stevenson </em>tried to get security, but could not. He said he would buy property in <em>Baltimore. </em>Witness told him that the will called for the money to go to the separate use of the girl, and the bond required was a bond to secure it to her separate use. Witness being cross examined stated, that the bond required by the executors, was a bond according to the act which <em>Judge Dale, </em>at the time of this conversation, read to <em>Stevenson </em>from the book. At the time of this conversation witness says, that one legacy had been paid to <em>Stevenson </em>in cash, and it was -only about the other legacy that there was \u2022any dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">The plaintiff then further to maintain the issue on its part joined, proved by competent testimony that the said <em>Josias \u25a0Stevenson </em>and the said <em>Elizabeth L. Reigarl </em>were married on the 27th day of March, 1827.

The case has been ably and ingeniously argued by the counsel engaged for the respective parties, and much aid has been derived during our researches, from the light thrown upon it by the discussion at the bar. Upon the fullest examination we have been able to bestow upon it, we have come to the conclusion that there is no error in the decision of the court below, and that the judgment there rendered ought to be affirmed. In deciding upon the merits of this controversy, we think that the true construction of the will of the testator in reference to the character of the legacy given to his grand-daughter, <em>Mrs. Stevenson, </em>that is, whether it was absolute, or for her separate use, is wholly immaterial and irrelevant, and that the rights of the parties must depend upon the validity or invalidity of the agreement, under or in virtue of which it was paid over to her husband* Under this aspect of the case, many of the prayers made by the appellants\u2019 counsel in the court below, which kept out of view the operation and effect of that agreement, were wholly abstract, and did not involve the true point in controversy between the parties, and therefore received at the hands of the court that fate, which upon established legal principles, unavoidably awaited them, it being the undoubted duty of the court not to wander or suffer themselves to be led into the wide and extended fields oflegal science, for the purpose of solving or settling legal principles having no relevancy to the case before them, but to eonfine themselves to those questions of law alone, which arise upon the facts and circumstances established by the testimony, and which properly belong to the case before them. The great and leading question therefore in this case seerns to be, whether the agreement made by the husband of <em>Mrs. Stevenson </em>with the executors of her grand-father\u2019s will* if satisfactorily proved to have existed, was founded upon a sufficient consideration to render it obligatory upon him, so as upon the non-fulfilment of it on his part* to create the relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of debtor and creditor between him and his wife. We cannot entertain a doubt of the sufficiency of the consideration to support his promise to the executors, in reliance upon which they paid him the legacy. If it was founded upon an equitable duty, such as would be enforced by a court of equity, that alone seems to be sufficient to give it efficacy, and binding operation, even in a court of law. In <em>Cowper\u2019s Rep. </em>290,, <em>Lord Mansfield </em>says, \u201cwhere a man is under a moral obligation which no court of law or equity can enforce, and <em>promises? </em>the honesty and rectitude of the thing is a consideration. As if a man promises to pay a just debt, the recovery of which is barred by the statute of limitations; or if a man, after he comes of age, promises to pay a meritorious debt, contracted during his minority, but not for necessaries; or if a bankrupt in affluent circumstances, after his certificate, promises to pay the whole of his debts; or if a man promise to perform a secret trust, or a trust void for want of writing by the statute of frauds. In such and many other instances, though the promise gives a compulsory remedy, where there was none before either in law or equity, yet as the promise is only to do what an honest man ought to do, the ties of conscience upon an upright man are a sufficient consideration;\u201d and <em>Butter, Justice, </em>in his opinion says, \u201cthe true rule is, that wherever a defendant is liable in equity and conscience to pay, that is a sufficient consideration;\u201d and he says that the rule, that to constitute a valid consideration for a promise, there must be a benefit to the promisor or loss to the promisee, is much too narrow. The executors in this case held the wife\u2019s legacy as trustees, and wherever it is necessary for a husband to resort to a court of equity to get possession of his wife\u2019s legacy, that court will require him to do equity, by making a settlement upon his wife and children,, before it will lend him its aid in the recovery of it. This is considered to be an equitable duty on his part, and formed, we think, a sufficient consideration for his promise in this case. The waiver moreover on the part of the executors of the refunding bond, which it appears by the laws of <em>Pennsylvania </em>they had a right to require, formed' an additional consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>for the agreement on the part of the husband for the benefit of his wife. It is also to be considered in the decision of this controversy, that according to the proof, the husband received the money of his wife, not in virtue of his marital rights, so as to amount to a reduction of the legacy into possession, but as her trustee and for her benefit; on the death of the husband therefore, it continued to be her property, for which she had a claim against his estate, and did not go to his personal representatives. On this point the authorities hold a language uniform, explicit and unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The agreement then being valid and obligatory upon the husband, is to be considered as a substitution for the equity of the wife, which operated for the benefit of the wife and children, though not named, and which a court of equity would specifically execute against the husband, upon a bill filed for that purpose. In support of this doctrine, see the case of the <em>Attorney General vs. Whorwood, </em>where <em>Lord Hardwick </em>recognises the validity of an agreement made by a husband with a trustee, for the purpose of obtaining his wife\u2019s money out of his hands, which the trustee had received upon the sale of her father\u2019s estate, and decreed an execution of the agreement, on the death of the husband, against his representatives. The agreement was, to invest the money in the purchase of land, to be settled for her benefit for life, and if there were no children, then on himself. In that case his lordship said \u201cthat it had been truly insisted, on behalf of the wife, that on the husband\u2019s application for the money, the court would undoubtedly have ordered a further settlement.\u201d If then the parties did not come into court, but acted among themselves, and the husband had agreed to do that which the court would have directed, had the wife insisted on it in a proper suit, it should have its full effect. It has been solemnly settled by this court, and has also been decided by <em>Chancellor </em>Kent, in <em>New </em>York, that the wife\u2019s equity will prevail against an assignment of the husband for valuable consideration or in payment of a just debt. See 4 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J. </em>282; 5 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>484, where <em>Chancellor Kent </em>also decides, that the court may, in its discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>give the whole or part only of the property to the wife according to the circumstances of the case; to same effect, see 6 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>178.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">If we are correct in the views which we have taken, as to the binding and operative effect of the agreement of the husband in this case, the next question which arises is, did his failure to invest according to the terms and conditions under which he received the legacy, give to his wife the right to elect to consider him her debtor to the amount of it, as so much money bad and received to her qse? Upon principle, and authority, we think it did give her that right. He received the money upon a special trust and confidence, th^J it would be invested for her benefit; he received it as her trustee; and upon his failure to make that investment, the consideration upon which he received it failed, and she had a right to consider it as so much money had and received for her use. See 1 <em>Harr. &amp; </em>Gill, 258, where it is said, \u201cif one man takes another\u2019s money to do a thing, and refuses to do it, it is a fraud; and it is at the <em>election </em>of the party injured, either to affirm the agreement, by bringing an action for the non-performance of it, or to disaffirm the agreement <em>ah initio, </em>by reason of the fraud, and bring an action for money had and received for his use.\u201d The action for money had and received is an equitable action, and equally as remedial in its effects as a bill in equity. In <em>Moses vs. Macfarlan, 2 Burr. </em>1012, <em>Lord Mansfield </em>says, \u201cthe gist of this kind of action is, that the defendant, upon the circumstances of the case, is obliged by the ties of natural justice and equity to refund the money.\u201d There can be no doubt that the wife may be a creditor against her husband\u2019st estate, after his death. 1 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>Gill, </em>280; <em>Powell on Contracts, </em>109; 3 P. <em>Will. </em>335; 1 <em>Vernon, </em>427. These last cases, it is true, were cases in equity, and there were no creditors to contend with, but they shew that as between husband and wife the relation of debtor and creditor may exist; and in the case in <em>Vernon, </em>the wife was administratrix of her husband, and was permitted to retain for her claim out of his assets. But whether the debt be legal or equitable, this court have decided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>it is equally within the power and jurisdiction of the orphans court to allow it. In this case, however, for the reasons already given, we think the claim of the wife supported by such considerations as constitutes it a debt recoverable in a court of law. We do not think that the decision of this court, reversing the decision of the orphans court allowing the claim, can operate to bar the recovery, it being the exercise of an appellate jurisdiction, reviewing the order of an inferior court, possessing in reference to the subject before it, a <em>prima facie </em>jurisdiction only. As to the objection, that the executors transcended their powers in demanding the execution of the agreement, before they would consent to pay over the money to the husband, we think that it is entitled to no consideration. The agreement having been entered into by the husband, with a full knowledge of all the facts, without fraud or surprise, and being founded upon a valid consideration, cannot be otherwise than obligatory. It seems, however, that the executors may interfere to protect the wife\u2019s equity; for in 5 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>473, <em>Chancellor Kent </em>refers to a case where it appears the bill was filed by the executor of the testator, to stay the husband who had instituted a suit in the spiritual court for his wife\u2019s legacy. <em>Lord Mansfield </em>said, it made no difference who was plaintiff in equity, and he directed that the money should be disposed of for the benefit of the wife. We do not think that the husband can shelter himself under a mistake of the law; he not only appears to have taken legal advice upon the subject of his marital rights, in relation to the legacy, but if he had not, there is, we think, nothing in this case to except it out of the operation of the general rule, that ignorance of the law cannot be made available with a full knowledge of all the facts. The case of <em>Bowley and Lammott </em>was decided upon a principle wholly inapplicable to this case. That was a case where a forfeiture of title would have been incurred, if the general rule, that a knowledge of the law in civil cases shall be presumed, where there is a full knowledge of the facts, had been permitted to operate; it was to charge the party with a <em>fraudulent </em>concealment of title, in the absence of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>knowledge, upon the legal presumption, which imputed knowledge. In that case, the application of such a principle was looked upon as being too monstrous and unjust, to receive for a moment the countenance or sanction of the court; it was a doctrine most glaringly unjust, and alike repudiated by the rules of morality, a refined sense of justice, and the principles of law. It was therefore rejected. We think there is nothing in the objection, that the claim of the wife against her husband\u2019s estate had not been allowed by the orphans court; the decision of that court, whether favorable or unfavorable, not having a conclusive effect upon the question, when submitted to a court of law for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We believe we have now taken a view of all the questions involved in the prayers piade by the respective parties in the court below', and upon the best consideration we have been able to give to the subject, we approve of the judgment of that tribunal, and think it ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The <em>first, second, third </em>and <em>fifth </em>prayers made to the court below by the counsel for the plaintiff, were properly rejected, as being mere abstract legal propositions, putting the agreement entirely out of view, upon which the defendant rests her claim to retain.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The <em>fourth, </em>we think, was properly rejected for the reasons before expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The <em>sixth </em>prayer, as to the binding effect of the decision of the Court of Appeals, in the case of the appeal from the orphans court, W'as properly rejected for the reasons already given. The effect of the agreement, as now proved, not being in the view of that court when the decision was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The <em>seventh </em>prayer was, we think, also properly rejected; for the reasons already given, we think the agreement was a valid one, and supported by an adequate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">The <em>eighth </em>prayer, founded on a mistake of law, for the reasons already assigned, was likewise properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">The <em>ninth </em>prayer was also properly rejected; under the agreement, it was his duty to invest; no laches is imputable to the wife or executor, so as to create a forfeiture: if a delu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>sion existed, it sprung from his bad faith, he having always declared his intention to be, to make the investment according to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The <em>tenth </em>prayer was also properly rejected, for the reasons already given. The proposition contained in this prayer was too untenable to receive for a moment the sanction of the court, that is, that the claim of the wife was totally destitute of evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The court, we think, were right in rejecting the <em>eleventh </em>prayer, for the reasons already given; the claim, we think, did not require the sanction of the orphans court.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The court, we think, were right in rejecting the <em>twelfth </em>prayer, there being no evidence in the case to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The court were clearly right in rejecting the <em>thirteenth </em>prayer; there was evidence sufficient to go to the jury to prove such promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The court were right in rejecting the <em>fourteenth </em>prayer, for the reasons before stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The court, were right in rejecting the <em>ffteenth </em>prayer, foi reasons which have beer, already stated; there was a sufficient consideration to sustain the promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">The court were right in rejecting the <em>sixteenth </em>prayer, there being no evidence to warrant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Tor reasons already given, the court were right in rejecting the <em>seventeenth </em>prayer; if the agreement was a valid one, her consent when the money was paid under it, would not annul or vacate it. She was entitled to the benefit of it, and her consenting to the payment of the money when it was paid, without at that time annexing any conditions or qualifications to such payment, would not deprive her of the benefit of that agreement. No stipulation on her part was necessary for the protection of her interest. She had a right to rely upon and claim the benefit of the contract which had been made by the executors for her use.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">The court were also right in rejecting the <em>eighteenth </em>prayer. The release had nothing to do with the agreement; the agreement having been made, the release was made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>discharge the executors, it was only collateral to the agreement. The prayer was clearly not warranted by the proof, and was, therefore, properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">, The <em>nineteenth </em>prayer was properly rejected. <em>Mrs. Stevenson </em>being one of the personal representatives of her husband, could institute no suit against herself, at law; the act of limitations, therefore, did not apply to the case, and created no bar to the recovery of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The court were right in granting the defendant\u2019s prayer; the record containing sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding the facts upon which it was predicated. The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
