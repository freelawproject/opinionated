Berry, Deborah Waring, William Edmonds </em>and <em>Rebecca </em>his wife, <em>John E. Berry, Otho B. Beall </em>and <em>Priscilla Waring, </em>alleging that on or about the 1st July 1826, a certain <em>Benjamin Berry, </em>late of, &amp;c., (who has since departed this life,) the grand-father of your oratrix, being seized in fee simple of a certain tract, parts of tracts or parcels of land, with the appurtenances, situate, lying and being in <em>Prince George's </em>county aforesaid, commonly called <em>\u201cGood Luck,\" </em>containing, or supposed to contain 250 acres, more or less, and being desirous of selling the said land, and a certain <em>John T. Berry </em>(one of the defendants hereinafter named,) being disposed to purchase the same, a contract was accordingly on the day and year aforesaid entered into, by and between the said B. B. and the said J. T. B. for the sale and purchase thereof. The said J. T. B. agreeing to pay, and the said B. B. agreeing to take for the said land and premises the price and sum of thirteen dollars per acre, so that the entire purchase money amounted to the sum of $3,250, interest being payable thereon from the day and year aforesaid; and your orator and oratrix further shew unto your honor, that the said J. T. B. paid to the said B. B., at the time of making said contract of sale, the sum of fifteen dollars on account and in part of the said purchase money, for which amount the said B. B., as your orator and oratrix are informed, passed to the said J. T. B. his receipt in writing of that date; and the said J. T. B. was thereupon immediately let into the possession of the said lands and premises, and has always since continued to use, enjoy and occupy the same. And your orator and oratrix also state unto your honor, that some time after the making of the said contract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>sale, to wit, on the 15th October 1827, the said B. B. executed a certain instrument of writing, his own proper hand and seal being thereto signed and affixed, and thereby for and in consideration of the natural love and affection which he bore unto your oratrix, his grand-daughter, (then named <em>Eleanor </em>Waring) gave, assigned and transferred unto her the purchase money aforesaid, as will more fully and at large appear by reference to a copy of the said instrument of writing, which is herewith filed, marked A, to which your honor is referred, and asked to consider as a part of this bill of complaint. And your orator and oratrix aver, that the said J. T. B. was duly notified of the execution of the said instrument of writing, purporting to be an assignment of the said purchase money to your oratrix, very soon after the same was executed, to wit, on or about the 1st November in the year 1827, aforesaid. And your orator and oratrix further represent unto your honor, that the said B. B. in his lifetime was always ready and willing to perform his part of the said contract, and if the said J. T. B. had paid to your oratrix the purchase money aforesaid, with the interest thereon, would have conveyed to him in fee simple the land and premises aforesaid. But the said J. T. B. in the lifetime of the said B. B., wholly failed to make any payment in addition to the one herein before mentioned, either to the said B. B., or your oratrix his assignee, so that the said B. B. departed this life without making him any conveyance or deed for the same; that the said B. B. a short time before his death, to wit, on the 8th December 1827, made and executed in due form of law, his last will and testament in writing, and thereby devised the said land and premises aforesaid, to his four following grand-daughters, to wit, your oratrix and her three sisters, <em>Deborah Waring, Rebecca Waring, </em>now the wife of one <em>William Edmonds, </em>and <em>Priscilla Waring, </em>at present residing in <em>Montgomery </em>county in the State of <em>Ohio </em>aforesaid, as will appear by reference to an extract from the said will, herewith filed as exhibit B, which your orator and oratrix pray may be also taken and considered as a part of this bill of complaint, in consequence of which devise, your orator and oratrix are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>advised, that the legal title to the lands and premises in question on the death of the said B. B. passed to your oratrix and her said sisters as tenants in common, and she therefore prays that her said sisters and the said W. E., the husband of the said <em>Rebecca, </em>may be made defendants to this bill of complaint. Your orator and oratrix also state, that the said B. B. by his said will, appointed a certain <em>John E. Berry and Otho B. Beall, </em>two of the defendants hereinafter named, and <em>Spencer Mitchell, </em>executors thereof; and the said <em>Spencer Mitchell </em>having declined accepting the trust confided to him in part by the said will, letters testamentary were in due form of law granted thereon to the said <em>John E. Berry </em>and <em>Otho B. Beall; </em>and your orator and oratrix further represent unto your honor, that the said J. T. B. being as aforesaid, notified of the assignment which your oratrix held of the purchase money aforesaid, after-wards made her the following payments on account thereof, to wit, on the 24th October 1828, the sum of $131.98, and on the 30th July 1832, the sum of $56.56; and your orator and oratrix therefore well hoped that the said J. T. B. would have paid to them the balance of the said purchase money, the whole thereof being long since due with interest as aforesaid, as in equity and conscience he was bound to do. But now so it is, that the said J. T. B. has hitherto wholly refused to pay to your orator and oratrix the balance of the said purchase money and interest or any further part thereof, sometimes pretending that he, the said J. T. B., is and hath always been ready and willing to perform the said agreement on his part, but that he cannot obtain a good and marketable title to the said land and premises, whereas your orator and oratrix charge, that the title which passed to your oratrix and her said sisters as aforesaid, under the will of the said B. B. is good and valid, and that your orator and oratrix are willing, as far as they can, to convey the same to the said J. T. B., upon being paid the balance of the said purchase money with the interest thereon; and they are further advised and insist, that your honor will compel the said <em>Deborah, Priscilla </em>and <em>Rebecca, </em>and the said <em>William Edmonds </em>her husband, on payment thereof, to join <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>with your orator and oratrix in such conveyance as maybe necessary for conveying to the said J. T. B. the said title. .And at other times, the said J. T. B. and the said Deborah, <em>Priscilla, William </em>and <em>Rebecca </em>his wife, pretend that your orator and oratrix are not entitled to receive the entire balance of the said purchase money, &amp;c., but that the said sisters of your oratrix are entitled to equal proportions thereof, whereas your orator and oratrix insist, that in virtue of the before mentioned assignment, they are exclusively entitled to the same; and upon other occasions, the said J. T. B. and the said J. E. B. and O. B. B. as the executors of the said B. B., pretend that the said executors are entitled to receive the purchase money aforesaid, and insist that he, the said J. T. B. has made payments to them, for which he ought to be allowed a credit, all which actings, doings and pretences of the said defendants are contrary to, &amp;c., and tend, &amp;c. Prayer that J. T. B., D. W., W. E. and R. his wife, P. W., J. E. B., and O. B. B., executors of B. B., may, upon their respective oaths, true answers make, &amp;c., and that an account may be taken of what is now due your orator and oratrix on account of the purchase money aforesaid, and interest, and that the said J. T. B., may by decree, be compelled to pay the same, or that the said lands and premises may be decreed to be sold in satisfaction thereof, your orator and oratrix insisting, that in virtue of the aforesaid assignment, they have an equitable lien thereon for that purpose; and that the said D. P. W. and R. his wife, may be decreed to unite with your orator and oratrix in such conveyance or deed, as may be necessary for transfering and assuring to the said J. T. B. and his heirs on payment of the said purchase money and interest the title aforesaid, and that your orator and oratrix may have other and further relief in the premises, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">Exhibit A: <em>Know all men by these presents, </em>that I, <em>Benjamin Berry, </em>of, &amp;c., for and in consideration of the natural love and affection, which I have and bear unto my grand-daughter <em>Eleanor Waring, </em>have given, assigned and transferred unto her, all the purchase money for a tract of land called <em>Good Lack, </em>which I lately sold to a certain <em>John T.

Berry </em>admitted, that it is true that B. B., about the 1st of July 1826, sold to a certain J. T. B., a tract of land called <em>\u201cGood </em>Luck,\u201d lying and being in <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county, and containing about one hundred and forty-four acres, and not containing two hundred and fifty acres, as stated by the said complainants, and that the said B. B. sold <em>the </em>said land to the said J. T. B., at and for the sum of thirteen dollars per acre, and not for the sum of fifteen dollars per acre, as stated by the said complainants, and this respondent denies, that the said J. T. B. was to pay interest on the purchase, from the 1st of July 1826, as alleged by the said complainants, but agreed to pay interest only from the 1st of January 1827, when he took possession of said land. This respondent is competent to speak and depose particularly respecting the terms of said contract, because he was present when the same was entered into between the said parties. This respondent further admits, that the sum of fifteen dollars was paid, on the day stated by the said complainants, by the said J. T. B., in part of the said purchase money for said land, and a receipt given him for the same by the said B. B., with regard to the assignment mentioned by the said com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>plainants, and marked exhibit A. This respondent alleges, that sometime in the year 1834, the complainants had recorded <em>among </em>the land records of <em>Prince George\u2019s county, </em>such an instrument, (and which was the first notice this defendant had of such pretended assignment,) purporting to have been executed by the said B. B. in his life time, who was the father of this respondent, but whether the same was in fact executed by the said B. B., oris altogether a spurious instrument, this respondent is wholly unable to say, and prays that this honorable court will require of the complainants the strictest proof of its authenticity and genuineness; and he is advised and insists, that if it is genuine, it is nevertheless void in law, and conveys ' no interest to the of the complainants; and this respondent cannot positively say whether the said J. T. B. ever had any notice of said pretended deed of assignment or instrument of writing, but does not believe that <em>he ever had. Further </em>answering, this respondent expressly denies that the said B. B., in his life time, was ever willing, or intended to convey the said land to the said J. T. B., in fee simple, upon his paying the purchase money for the same to the said complainant <em>Eleanor, </em>as alleged by these complainants, and consequently, by his last will and testament gave and devised the said tract of land, together with other parcels or tracts of land, to his four grand-daughters, to wit, the complainant E., D. W., <em>Rebecca, </em>now wife of W. E., and P. W., and as stated by the said complainants, as appears from the extract taken from said will, which is a true extract, and marked exhibit B, by the complainants, and made a part of their bill of complaint. This respondent admits that the said will bears date the 18th of December 1827. This respondent further admits, that the said B. B., by his last will and testament, appointed himself, O. B. B., and a certain <em>Spencer Mitchell, </em>his executors thereof, and that after the said <em>Spencer Mitchell </em>declined accepting the trust confided to him in part by the said will, letters testamentary were in due form granted thereon to this respondent and the said O. B. B. Further answering, this respondent says, that he does not know that the said J. T. B. ever made any payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>to the said complainants, or either of them, in virtue of said pretended assignment; that this complainant, as one of the executors o\u00ed B. B. aforesaid, about the 20th October 1828, gave the said complainant Eleanor, an order on the said J. T. !B., which he believes was accepted and paid, and he presumes that this is the first payment mentioned by the said complainants as having been made by the said J. T. B. to them, in virtue of the said assignment, and this respondent states that he recollects that about the last of July 1832, he gave, as executor as aforesaid, a similar order on the said J. T. B., in favor of the said E., and which he believes was accepted and paid by the said J. T. B. in pursuance of this respondent\u2019s order; and this respondent further states, he never did recognize the said complainant E. as assignee of the purchase money for said land, and he does not believe that J. T. B. ever did, and he believes that this last mentioned order as the second payment of $56.56, alleged by the said complainants to have been made them by the said J. T. B., in virtue of said assignment. This respondent further answering, says, that it is true that he has always denied the right of the complainants, or either of them, to receive any part of the said purchase money from the said J. T. B., and always claimed the right to receive it himself as one of the executors, and believed that he was entitled to it as residuary legatee of his father, and that the said J. T. B. has, at divers times, made this respondent, as co-executor as aforesaid, large payments on account of said lands, and has also, he believes, made the said O. B. B., as co-executor of said B. B., large payments on said land, for which he is entitled to a credit. And this defendant denies all and all manner of confederacy, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">The other parties having answered the bill or been proceeded against by publication, it was then agreed that the bill should be treated as amended, by charging that the assignment by B. B., deceased, to the complainant E., mentioned in the proceedings, was intended and designed for the common benefit of herself and sisters, and that the devise of the land sold by said <em>Berry </em>to the defendant J. T. B., which is to be found in the last will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and testament of the said <em>Berry, </em>deceased, was made to give full effect to the aforesaid assignment to the said complainant, E., and also, by stating the agreement between the said B., deceased, and the said defendant J. T. B., in regard to the price of the land sold as aforesaid and the period from which the purchase money is to bear interest, so as to conform to the admissions contained in the answers in these respects; that' the answers already filed shall be treated as answers to the said amendment, and the testimony is to be treated as testimony taken after issue joined upon such amended bill and answers thereto. It is further agreed, that if the Chancellor shall decree in favor of the complainants, the cause shall go to the auditor for an account, and liberty shall be given to each party to introduce testimony before the auditor in regard to the precise quantity of land sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">The defendant <em>John E. Berry </em>filed his points and exceptions as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\">1st. That the assignment to <em>Eleanor </em>Waring, referred to in the bill of complaint, was fraudulent and void, and was not recorded as it ought to have been.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-7\">2nd. That the devise to the said <em>Eleanor </em>and her three sisters, under the will of <em>Benjamin Berry, </em>of the tract of land called <em>Good Luck, </em>sold to the defendant <em>John T. Berry, </em>was a void devise, he having sold the said lands to <em>John T. Berry </em>anterior to his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-8\">3rd.

That the complainants cannot recover against the said <em>John E.

Berry, </em>and failed to pay it over to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-10\">5th. Because they do not ask for a decree against this defenant, and such a decree does not come within the scope of their bill, nor within its prayer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Exceptions of <em>John E.

The purchaser <em>John T. Berry </em>and the executor <em>John E.

The parties are hereby authorised, according to the terms of their agreement, filed on the second instant, to have a survey made of the land sold, by the surveyor of <em>Prince George's </em>county, or to take testimony in relation to the said account, before any justice of the peace, on giving three days notice, provided that such survey be made or testimony taken and filed in the chancery office, in this case, on or before the 15th day of January next.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-8\">A survey was accordingly made, and the quantity of land sold admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">On the 8th March 1842, the auditor reported accounts A and B.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-10\">Account A is a statement of the debt due by the defendant <em>John T.

The balance shown to be due with interest to the date of this report, has been distributed, at the foot of this account, amongst the complainants and the defendants, sisters of the said <em>Eleanor. </em>This distribution has been made, although the sisters are not complainants, because the complainants have called upon them to join in a conveyance on the payment of the balance of the purchase money, and the defendant <em>John T.

The amount shown by this account has, at the foot thereof, been distributed in the same manner and for the same reasons as in account A, and in making that distribution the auditor has credited the executor with his payments to the complainant <em>Eleanor, </em>before her marriage, and to the defendant <em>Priscilla, </em>by deducting the same, with interest, as charged to him in the account, from their respective shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">The defendant <em>John E.

C. Magruder and Pratt for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-9\">By Alexander for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b254-10\">Archer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Adt\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Exceptions, in pursuance of the act of 1832, ch. 302, have been taken to the sufficiency of the averments in the bill, to charge <em>John E. Berry, </em>the present appellant, with the sum decreed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The questions, therefore, which have been raised in this court against the sufficiency of the bill, are open for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The bill and its amendment have been filed manifestly with the design of compelling the specific execution o\u00ed a contract, in obtaining from <em>John T. Berry </em>the balance of the purchase money due from him for the purchase of a tract of land from <em>Benjamin Berry. </em>There is not only no allegation, but no intimation in the bill that any of the purchase money has come into the hands of <em>John E. Berry, </em>either as executor of <em>Benjamin Berry </em>or otherwise, and therefore no foundation whatever furnished for any decree against him for any portion of the purchase money. Whatever may be the proof, no decree, but upon proper and corresponding allegations, can be passed. The adherence to this familiar principle is necessary to prevent surprise and consequent injustice. The decree must therefore, upon this ground, be necessarily reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">That upon proper allegations, which the facts of the case would have justified, the Court of Chancery would have had jurisdiction to have decreed the payment over to the parties entitled, their proportion of the purchase money, we entertain no doubt. The right to the purchase money is claimed by <em>John E. </em>Berry, as residuary legatee of <em>Benjamin Berry, </em>and it was proper, therefore, that he should be a party to the controversy, that full and complete justice might be administered to all the parties interested. It was necessary for the safety of the vendee, who was about to be compelled to pay the purchase money, that all the contested rights to the purchase money should be adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">We apprehend there is sufficient proof in the record of the receipt of the sum of money, part of the purchase money, by <em>John E. Berry, </em>which is stated in account B. His answer admits the receipt of large sums of money, which he asserts belongs to him as residuary legatee of <em>Benjamin Berry, </em>and in account A, it is stated, that there was paid to <em>John E. Berry, </em>one of the executors of <em>Benjamin Berry, </em>as per receipt, filed 16th August 1829, the sum of $791.92. The ratification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>this account was had by consent of <em>John E. Berry </em>and the other parties to the case, which, we apprehend, constituted sufficient evidence of the receipt of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">To the ratification of account B, <em>John E. Berry </em>has excepted, and among other reasons, that the claim against him is barred by limitations. It is no objection to this defence, that it was not taken in the answer, because, as we have seen, the bill gave him no intimation that any claim would be made against him, by any allegation contained therein, and the defence was tahe\u00f1as soon, as by the proceedings he had notice that any claim was to be made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Limitations, however, it is said, constitutes no defence. The money was received in 1829, and the bill was filed in 1835. Thus a period of six years had elapsed from the receipt by <em>John E. Berry, </em>of the purchase money with which he is attempted to be charged and the filing of the bill. The lapse of such a period, as would bar at law, an action for money had and received, would, by analogy, bar this claim in equity. It is true that <em>John E. Berry, </em>in the receipt of this money, might be considered as a <em>quasi </em>trustee, and as having received it for the use of those to whom it belonged, but he was not acting under a continuing or express trust, but his duty was to pay it over immediately on its receipt, and an action at law might have been maintained for its recovery; the statute ought therefore to be considered as running from the time of the receipt of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The rights acquired to this purchase money were by assignment, and not by last will and testament. The admission of the parties is, that the devise of the land was, with the view of confirming the claim under the assignment. The claim, therefore, does not partake of the character of a legacy, so that limitations would not attach. Limitations, then, in our view, being a bar to the claim against <em>John E. Berry, </em>and such defence having been interposed, we deem it fruitless to remand the cause to the Court of Chancery for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">So far, therefore, as the decree affects the appellant, (except, in so far as the same was passed by consent,) it is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">DECREE REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
