M. Company. The latter was a manufacturing institution, and required land for its operations. The note not being paid, Z. brought his action against both; the Gompany only appeared; the declaration counted upon the note. The proof showed that the agent was the general agent of the Company; had bought other land for the use of the Company which it retained and paid for, and that the agent was in the habit of signing its notes as agent, which were paid by the Company. Held : that the bond of conveyance was the only legal evidence of the nature and character of the contract, and that the purchase was made by W. on his own account; and as the Company was not authorised to become surety by its charter, the note was a nullity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-8\">Where a note is executed by an agent before it is admissible in evidence, it is necessary to prove, not only his signature, but the authority by which it is made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-9\">A bond of conveyance which recites that the obligor did \u2019sell to the obligee, and contract and agree to grant and convey to him, his heirs and assigns, a certain tract of land, acknowledging the receipt of the cash part of the purchase money from him, with the notes of the obligee, and another for the balance thereof, and stipulating until default should be made in the payment of the purchase money, that he should hold the land sold as aforesaid, demonstrates that the obligee made the purchase on his own account, and parol evidence is not admissible to contradict it in that respect.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-10\">Where by the terms of a charter a manufacturing company had no power to assume the responsibility of a surety, the note of such a company executed upon no other consideration than as surety, is void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Parol evidence is inadmissible to prove that a grant made to one person was intended to be made to another.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b293-5\">Appeal from the <em>Howard District </em>Court of <em>Anne Arundel </em>County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>commenced on the 17th April 1840, by the appellee against the appellants and <em>Amos A.

That if the jury find from the evidence that the note offered in evidence was given to the plaintiff to secure the payment of a portion of the purchase money, for land sold by the plaintiff to A. A.

That the contract for the land to secure the payment of the purchase money, of which the note offered in evidence was given, was the individual contract of A. A.

Schley for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-11\">By R. I. Bowie for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Stephen, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIg\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We think there was error in the opinion of the court in the first bill of exceptions. The principle appears to be well settled, that where a note is executed by an agent, before it is admissible in evidence, it is necessary to prove, not only his signature, but the authority by which it is made. Speaking of the action of <em>assumpsit </em>on promissory notes, <em>Roscoe, </em>in his treatise on evidence, 174, says: \u201cThe making of the note will be proved by proving the handwriting of the defendant, or if made by an agent, by proof of the handwriting, and authority of such agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">After it was admitted by both plaintiff and defendant, that the note given in evidence by the plaintiff was one of the notes referred to in the bond of conveyance, and that it was given to secure the payment in part of the purchase money for the land therein described, the defendants prayed the court to give several instructions to the jury, all of which were granted except the <em>first, twelfth </em>and <em>fifteenth </em>prayers; for the refusal to grant which, the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">It seemed to be conceded by the counsel for the appellants in the course of the argument, that the court below were right in refusing the <em>twelfth </em>prayer, it is therefore only necessary to decide upon the propriety of rejecting th <em>e first </em>and <em>the fifteenth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The <em>first </em>prayer was, that the promissory note offered in evidence by the plaintiff, was not the note of the said <em>Savage Manufacturing Company, </em>and that they were not legal parties thereto. This prayer we think the court ought to have granted. It appears by the bond of conveyance (the execution of which was admitted by the parties,) that the purchase was made by <em>Williams, </em>on his own account. The conveyance was to be made to him and his heirs, and there is an express stipulation that he and his heirs shall quietly and peaceably enjoy the property purchased, without any hindrance by the said obligor, or any person claiming under him. The purchase, therefore, being made by him on his own account, and the note being given to secure the payment of the purchase money, the note was invalid and a nullity, so far as the appellants were attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to be bound thereby. It being conceded, that by the terms of their charter, they had no power to assume such a responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The <em>fifteenth </em>prayer, we think, also ought to have been granted. The bond of conveyance was the only legal evidence of the nature and character of the contract, and it demonstrated that Williams, and not the company, was the purchaser of the land therein specified. Parol evidence was not admissible to vary or contradict it in that respect, as seems to be clear upon authority. See <em>Ros. Ev. J. </em>9, and 12 <em>John. Rep. </em>77, where it is said, that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove that a grant made to one person was intended to be made to another. See also, same book, page 488, where it is said, \u201cthat parol evidence is inadmissible to show that a lease executed in the name of, and reserving a rent to one person, was intended for the benefit of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">For these reasons we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below was erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
