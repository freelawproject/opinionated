Waltz, </em>about seventeen years ago, and the possession or improvement No. 2, as shown on the plats, was made about ten or twelve years ago, and that the same were made under the defendant, and as his acts; and further, that during the whole time from the year 1803, down to the present time, he never heard of any person claiming said lots of land, or any of them, except the said General <em>John Swan </em>and the defendant, and that at the time of the institution of this suit, and for several years before, <em>Dudley Lee </em>the defendant, was in possession of said lots as the tenant of <em>James Swan. </em>It was admitted by the plaintiff, that the land in controversy has been demised to the defendant and his heirs, by the last will and testament of the said General <em>John Swan, </em>deceased, his father, made on the 27th of May 1820.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">Whereupon the defendant by his counsel, prayed the court to instruct the jury, that they might presume the death of the respective parties hereinbefore named, as the holders and owners of said lots, without heirs at the time the said lots of land were granted to the said <em>John Swan, </em>by the State of <em>Maryland </em>as aforesaid, and that the State of <em>Maryland </em>therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>at the time the patent was issued to the said General <em>John </em>Swan,, for the said lots of land, or a part of the tract of land called <em>South </em>Bar, had a right to grant the same, they then being liable to escheat, and that the title in fee of said lots, did pass by the said patent for <em>South, Bar, </em>from the State of <em>Maryland </em>to the said General <em>John Swan, </em>and that therefore the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this case upon the title so adduced, and relied upon by him as aforesaid; which prayer and instructions the court (Buchanan, C. J. and Buchanan, A. J.,) refused, being of opinion, that the said patent for <em>South Bar, </em>passed no title whatever to the said <em>John Swan, </em>for said lots so embraced in the same. To which refusal and opinion, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">4th Exception. The defendant then further to support the issue on his part joined, in addition to the evidence offered in the third bill of exceptions, which is to be taken and considered as forming a part of this fourth bill of exceptions, proved by competent testimony, that General <em>John Swan </em>was taxed with the said tract of land called <em>South Bar, </em>including said lots, from the year 1805, to the time of his death, and paid the taxes on the same, and that since his death down to the present time, the said land in controversy has been taxed to the defendant, who had paid the taxes on the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">Whereupon the defendant by his counsel, prayed the court to instruct the jury, that they may and ought to presume, that deeds of conveyance wmre duly made, executed and ackowledged, conveying to the said <em>John Swan, </em>in his life time in fee, the said lots of land so owned by the soldiers, the respective said original owners thereof, which instruction the court refused to give; to which opinion and refusal of the court, the defen - dant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-7\">The verdict and judgment being against the defendant, he prosecuted the present appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b207-8\">The cause was argued before Stephen, Archer, Dorsey and Spence, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-9\">By Alexander and Schley for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-10\">By Price for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Stephen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB4\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">During the trial of this case, several exceptions were taken to the opinions of the court below, upon which it becomes the duty of this court now to decide. The plaintiff to support the issue on his part joined, offered in evidence certain certificates and extracts from the books of the land office, for the purpose of shewing title, in the respective persons named in said papers, to the respective lots of land, to recover which this action was instituted, at the time said papers and entries were made; to the sufficiency of which extracts from the books of the land office for such purpose, the defendant objected, on the ground that said extracts did not furnish sufficient evidence to prove that said lots of land had been allotted to the respective persons therein named by the commissioners, so as to vest the legal title to said lots in said persons respectively; but the court was of opinion and so instructed the jury, that the said extracts were legally sufficient for the purpose for which they were offered; to which opinion and instruction the defendant excepted; and whether in that opinion there was error, it is now necessary to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">By the act of 1788, chapter 44, it was made the duty of the commissioners to distribute the lots in controversy among certain officers and soldiers by lot, and to endorse the name of the officer or soldier on the ticket, containing the number drawn by such officer or soldier; and the law provides that thereupon, an estate in fee simple should be' vested in the officer or soldier in such lot, without any patent, deed or grant, to be issued for that purpose: a legal estate in' fee therefore vested in the officers and soldiers by operation of law, without any further evidence or muniment of title to be' furnished by the officers of government for that purpose. The law directing the distribution, also provides that the commissioners shall make a record of all the lots by them distributed among the said officers and soldiers, and return the same to the Register of the Land Office, to be by him safely kept. The said law also recognises the validity of the books, in which-are entered the certificates of all the lots distributed as' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>aforesaid, ascertaining and defining their respective boundaries and locations. From these books and the record returned into the land office by the commissioners, the certificates and extracts offered in evidence were taken and certified by the register of the land office, and we are of opinion that they were good and sufficient evidence lor the purpose for which were offered. So far as the question of title was involved, they were by law invested with all the legal properties and attributes Of a patent, and were therefore competent and admissible evidence; the certificates of the register embracing every thing which the records of his office can furnish in relation to the title and ownership of such lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The plaintiff then in addition to the preceding evidence, offered in evidence an escheat patent for the land for which the ejectment was brought, and there rested his cas\u00e9; relying upon the same as legally sufficient, together with the evidence in the first bill of exceptions to vest the legal title of the land, for Which the suit Was brought, in him, and to entitle him to recover; but the defendant objected to the sufficiency of the patent for that purpose^ on the ground that it did not appear on the face of the patent whose lands were escheated, nor were any of the facts or circumstances set forth to shew that said lands were liable to escheat; but the coUrt overruled the objection, and were of opinion that the patent was legally sufficient to vest the title in fee in the plaintiff in the lands it purported to convey, and that therefore the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In this opinion of the court there was no error, so far as th\u00e9 same was objected to by the defendant. In 2 H. &amp; J. <em>Rep. </em>126, the principle is stated to be, that an escheat grant is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title, and is available for that purpose until the contrary is proved. It is not necessary dr usual according to the practice of the land office, to state On the face of th\u00e9 patent whose lands w\u2019ere escheated, of the facts or circumstances which shew the lands were esch\u00e9atable. Where a warrant regularly issued, has been executed by the proper officer, and a certificate returned, which has laid a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>time in the land office without caveat, to justify the emanation of a grant, it is but a fair, reasonable, <em>prima facie </em>presumption, that the land taken up was escheatable, and that the title passed to the grantee. But the court erred in that part of their opinion, in which they declared that the plaintiff was entitled to recover all the land covered by the patent, as well that part which was escheated, as that which had been taken up as vacancy. It appears by the proof in the case offered by the plaintiff himself, that lot numbered 1225, had been allotted to a certain <em>John </em>Kidd, which was taken up and included in his patent, as vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We think there was no error in the opinion of the court in the third bill of exceptions. The lots were distributed to the soldiers in 1789, in virtue of the act of Assembly passed for that purpose, and <em>South Bar </em>was patented on the 2nd March 1805, a period of time too short to warrant a presumption of the death of the holders of such lots, without heirs, under the circumstances of the case; there being no proof moreover that the soilders ever resided on the lots, or in the neighborhood where they were situated, or any evidence offered of any facts or circumstances on which such a presumption could be properly founded. But such a presumption at all events, ought not to be made in support of a title, acquired in violation of law and the rules of the land office, which require two-thirds of the value to be paid to the State, before a title can be obtained in lands liable to escheat, and which also require that a warrant of resurvey should be founded upon a seisin in fee, in the lands upon which the resurvey is to be made; neither of which essential conditions appear to have been complied with in the case of the patent for <em>South Bar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We think there was no error in the opinion of the court in the fourth bill of exceptions. The possession of the defendant of the lots in controversy was only a partial one, and that for so short a period as ten or fifteen years, with a general claim of title, was too short a period to warrant the presumption of a conveyance of the lots to the patentee of <em>South Bar, </em>as prayed for by the defendant. For the reasons above stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the judgment of the court below is reversed and a procedendo ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
