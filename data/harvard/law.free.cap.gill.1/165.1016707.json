And the said defendants further, by way of rejoinder,' say, that the said note for eight hundred and five dollars, in said replication mentioned, was not given, and does not include the said several levies, assessments and sums of money mentioned in the replication as having been levied, as stated in the said replication, and assigned to the said <em>William Clarke, </em>and received and collected by the said <em>Thomas M. D.

D. Baden, </em>as collector as aforesaid, did collect and receive the said several sums of money, levies and assessments mentioned in the ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>plication of the said plaintiff, and that the said sums of money, levies and assessments, were levied and imposed upon the inhabitants of the said county, as also staled by the said plaintiff, and were assigned to the said <em>William Clarke, </em>as stated in the said replication.

Baden, </em>collector as aforesaid, and that he did collect and receive the same as alleged by the said State in its said replication. And they do therefore, find the sum of one thousand and fifty-seven dollars and thirty-six cents, current money, really and justly due to the said plaintiff, on the writing obligatory aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">The defendants moved the court to arrest the judgment in this case, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">1. Because the condition of the bond sued upon, does not cover the breaches assigned in the replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">2. Because the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment in the present state of the pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">3. Because the breaches assigned in the replication are not within the condition of the bond sued upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">4. Because the replication should have stated, and set out the names of the several and respective parties, for whose use the several sums of money and levies were made and levied, mentioned and referred to in the replication, and the several amounts levied for each individual and person; and also, because the said replication does not state that these several sums</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and levies were assigned in writing to the said <em>William Clarke7 </em>as it should have done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\">The county court overruled the motion in arrest, and rendered judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">At the trial of this cause, the plaintiff to sustain the issues joined on its part, offered in evidence to the jury the following paper r</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\"><em>$805.

But the court (Stephen, C. J. and Key, A. J.,) overruled the objection, and were of opinion, and so instructed the jury, that the said evidence, if believed by them, would be sufficient in the absence of contradictory evidence, to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict on all the issues joined, against all the defendants in this cause. The defendants excepted, and prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b178-12\">The cause was argued before Archer, Dorsey, Chambers. and Spence, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-13\">By T. S. Alexander and C. C. Magruder for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-14\">By R. Johnson and T. F.

D. Baden </em>had collected and received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>sum. of money, for the recovery of which, the action was instituted. But do the issues tried by the last jury at all vary, in respect to those issues, the effect and operation ascribed by this court to the testimony adduced by the appellee on the first trial? We think that they do not. If the promissory note or certificate of indebtedness given by <em>Thomas M. D. Baden, </em>the collector, was an implied admission that he had collected and received the amount therein specified, it was equally an implied admission that the same had been levied, and the levies transferred to <em>William Clarke. </em>Upon no other ground than his acknowledgment of the existence of those facts, can his giving such a note or certificate be accounted for. Such admissions by the collector having been determined by this court, in the first trial before it, to be <em>prima facie </em>evidence against the collector and his securities, the county court proceeding with the trial under the <em>procedendo, </em>could not do otherwise than overrule the objection made to the testimony, and was fully justified in the instruction which it gave to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Two reasons have been urged why the judgment of the county court ought to have been arrested. The first is, that \u201cthe replication is uncertain in its statement of the persons for whom the levies mentioned therein, were made, and the sums respectively allowed to them.\u201d Whether this objection to the replication, if taken by the proper demurrer, in the court below, should have been sustained, we mean to express no opinion. But as it was taken in arrest of judgment, it wag correctly overruled. If as insisted, it was necessary that the replication should state the amount of each levy, and the name of the person for whom it was made; and that proof thereof must be offered to enable the jury to find the verdict which they did; after the finding of the verdict on the motion in ay-rest, the court are bound to assume, that such testimony was .given to the jury however false, in point of fact, that assumption might be. In acting on a motion to arrest the judgment, the court is not to look to the bills of exceptions, or out of the other proceedings in the cause as exhibited by the record, in forming its presumption of the proof which had been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Similar reasons may be assigned for overruling the second ground, relied on for arresting the judgment; which ground was, \u201cthat there is no sufficient averment of a legal transfer and assignment of said levies to <em>William </em>Clarke, and consequently no title in him, to demand payment thereof.\u201d It was not necessary, as has been insisted, that such transfer to be valid, must have been in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">If the consequences of the affirmance of this judgment be so disastrous to the interests of the appellants, (the securities) as it has been represented they may be, they certainly had the means of avoiding the dilemma in which, it is said, they are now involved, had they used them at the proper epoch in the cause. Had a special demurrer to the replication, assigning as the grounds of its insufficiency, that it did not state the amounts of the several levies, and the names of the persons for -whom made, been overruled by the county court, .a knowledge of those facts, so essential to the defence of the securities, could readily have been obtained in time for them to make their defence, and prepare for the trial, by an application to the court for an order requiring the appellee to file a bill of particulars of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Approving of the conduct of the court below, in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment, and the objection stated in the bill of exceptions, to have been raised to the testimony offered by the appellee, and also approving of the instruction given by the court to the jury, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
