And whereas the plaintiff during all the time aforesaid, of right ought to have had, and still of right ought to have the use of a certain road passing through and over a certain close of the plaintiff and unto the said mills, for the plaintiff and his servants and his customers to the said mills to go, return, pass and re-pass, to and from the said mills with horses, &amp;c., at his and their free will and pleasure, when, and as often as they required, for the purpose of carrying grists and saw logs and other timber, and wheat and rye and corn, &amp;c., and other custom to the said mills as aforesaid, to wit, at, &amp;c. Yet the defendants well knowing the premises, whilst the plaintiff was of right entitled to the use of the said road as aforesaid, to wit, on the day and year aforesaid, wrongfully and injuriously cut, dug and made, and caused to be cut, dug and made, a eertain canal called the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, </em>of great width and depth, to wit,of the width of sixty feet and of the depth of ten feet, with high and huge embankments, to wit, of the height of ten feet and of the breadth of twenty feet at the base, in and along the whole length of the lands and premises of the said plaintiff, and in and across the said public road, and continued and kept the said canal so cut, excavated and made as aforesaid, from the day and year aforesaid, to the time of the issuing of the writ original in this cause, and the said public road during all that time hath been obstructed, shut up, closed up and rendered impassable for the said plaintiff and- his servants, and for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>customers to his said mills, and during all that time the plaintiff and his servants, and the customers having business at his said mills, have been unable to pass and re-pass, to go to and come from the said mills with their horses, carts, wagons and other vehicles, as they of right ought to have done, to wit, at the county aforesaid. By means of which said premises the' plaintiff has been deprived of, and has lost during all the time aforesaid, the use, benefit and advantage of his said mills, and has lost and been deprived of all his gains, tolls and profits- and custom, which without the said obstructing he would have derived from his said mills, to wit, at the county aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">And whereas also, heretofore, to wit, on the day and year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, the plaintiff was and still is seized and possessed of a certain farm, which until the committing of the grievance hereinafter mentioned, was free from all overflowing and injury from being flooded with water, and* until the committing of the grievance hereinafter mentioned,, was sound, dry and firm land, and produced large quantities of grain, and of grass and hay, to wit, at the county aforesaid, yet the defendant knowing the premises, unlawfully cut, dug and placed a certain canal called the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,. </em>along, through and by the said land of the plaintiff, and so negligently, imperfectly and improperly made and constructed the embankments and other works of the said canal, that the water of the said canal has percolated and passed through the said embankments of the said canal and overflowed, submersed,flooded and greatly injured the lands of the plaintiff adjacent to, and lying along the said canal, and the plaintiff from the day and year aforesaid, to the day of the impetralion of the writ original in this cause, by reason of the said flooding and inundation, has lost all the use and profits and benefit of the said* land, and has been unable to produce either grain or grass on the said land, or to apply the same to any useful or profitable' account or purpose, to the damage of the plaintiff of five thousand dollars, and therefore he brings suit, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">The appellees pleaded: 1.

The plaintiff further to support the issue on his part joined, proved by competent testimony, that the defendant made and constructed the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal </em>through the said land or farm of the plaintiff and near his said mills, and in constructing the same, dug up, excavated and wholly destroyed so much of said public road as to cut off thereby all communication by said road, with said mills by the customers thereof, as also by the plaintiff himself; and that ever since the said canal has been so constructed, and the said public road so dug up, excavated and wholly destroyed by the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s said mills have not been used by said plaintiff, and have become entirely useless and unproductive to him, and have stood idle, and the customers of the same have been deprived of the use of said road for the purpose of going to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>from them to have their grain ground and their timber sawed into plank and other lumber, as they were accustomed to do before the said road was destroyed by the making of the said canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">The defendant then to support the issue on his part joined, offered in evidence the following <em>deed from the </em>plaintiff and his wife to the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">\u201cThis indenture, made this 24th July 1835, between <em>Jacob Leopard </em>and <em>Delia leopard </em>his wife, of, &amp;c., of the one part, and \u201cthe <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal </em>Company\u201d of the other part: whereas the said canal is intended to pass through the lands of the said J.

L. and D. L. his wife, are willing to execute these presents. Now, therefore, this indenture witnesseth, that the said J. L. and D. L., for and in consideration of the premises, and also in consideration of the sum of $1,075, to them in hand paid by the president and directors of the said company, <em>See., </em>have granted, &amp;c., unto the said O. and O.

It was further admitted that the land so conveyed, is the very land upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the said canal has been constructed, and that the said canal has been constructed in all respects in accordance with the charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">The defendant, thereupon moved the court to instruct the jury that upon the foregoing evidence, the plaintiff is not, in the face of his said deed, entitled to recover for any damage done his mills by reason of the construction of the canal across said public road, and the destruction of said public road; which instruction the court accordingly gave.

Whether the declaration states facts sufficient, if proved, to enable the appellant to maintain his action, or whether the facts proved sustain the allegations in the declaration? are questions which, in the case before us, under the act of 1825, ch. 117, we are not called on to decide. We are not permitted to affirm or reverse the judgment of the county court, upon any point which is not shown,By the record, to have been there raised and decided. The matter brought up for review in this court is the granting, by the court below, of the appellee\u2019s prayer for an instruction to the jury, that upon the evidence given in the cause, \u201cthe plaintiff (the appellant,) is not, in the face of his said deed, entitled to recover for any damage done his mills, by reason of the construction of the canal across said public road, and the destruction of said public road.\u201d The prayer as made to the court, for the purpose of obtaining its determination thereof, since the act of 1825, concedes by implication the sufficiency of the pleadings in the cause: and so far from inviting the court to the examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>thereof, or raising any question thereon for its decision, it in effect withdraws them from its consideration, and invokes it to decide the isolated question whether such were not the legal effect and operation of the deed referred to, that, thereby the testimony given in the cause showed no cause of action in the appellant. The question raised by the prayer made to the court below bears no resemblance to the inquiries which the court are called on to make where an objection is raised to the admissibility of evidence offered, generally, in a trial before the jury. There the attention of the court is necessarily called to the pleadings in the cause; the admissibility of the evidence being entirely dependent on them. The court cannot judge of its pertinence or materiality but by their inspection. Nor is it like the case of a demurrer, which is a direct attack upon the pleadings themselves, wherein the court must of necessity inspect all the pleadings in the case, as well to enable it to ascertain the sufficiency of the particular pleading demurred to, as in giving its judgment thereon to mount up to the first material error in pleading. Nor does it resemble a motion in arrest of judgment, where the court have no means of judging of the validity of a verdict, but by referring to the pleadings and issues in the cause, upon which it wholly depends, and without which it has no operation, and is incapable of forming the basis of a final judgment in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The leading motive of the legislature in passing the act of 1825, was to\u2019remedy an evil which had been severely felt and was loudly complained of, that in this court the judgments of the county court were reversed upon points never raised or decided below, and which, had they been there raised, would at once, by amendment or otherwise, have been obviated and never been presented for the consideration of the appellate court. Such is the nature of the objection now taken in this court, and such would have been its fate if raised in the county court. It is that the plaintiff below could not recover, because his cause of action has been defectively stated in his- declaration, though fully established by proof. Whether this defect exist or not, we have deemed it unnecessary to inquire; be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>cause the defect, if true, is excluded from the consideration of this court by the express words and legislative intent of the act of 1825. A different decision would, in a great degree, virtually operate as a repeal of the act of 1825.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Before the county court could grant the instruction prayed for, it must assume the truth of all the testimony given to the jury, tending to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, and of all inferences of fact fairly deducible therefrom. And must also determine, that so far as the rights of the appellant are concerned, the appellee had authority, for ever, to destroy that part of the public highway crossed by the canal. Assuming the non-existence of this right, whatever may be the imperfections of the declaration in the cause, we are clearly of opinion, that the testimony before the jury, if believed by them, was abundantly sufficient to entitle the appellant to a verdict. See the cases of <em>Chichester vs. Lethbridge, Willes\u2019 Rep. </em>71. <em>Rose and others vs. </em>Miles, 4 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>101. <em>Hughes vs. </em>Heiser, 1 <em>Binney, </em>463. <em>Greasly vs. Codling and </em>another, 2 <em>Bingham, </em>263. <em>Wilkes vs. Hungerford Market Company, </em>2 <em>Bingham\u2019s New Ca. </em>281; and <em>Stetson vs. Faxon, </em>19 <em>Pick. Rep. </em>147.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The authority of the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company </em>to destroy this public highway, and to perpetuate its destruction, has in the argument been claimed to exist under two distinct grants; the one emanating from the sovereign power of the State, through which the canal passes; the other from the appellant himself. Under the first, the charter of the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, </em>it is, in effect, asserted in the argument, that it has the power conferred on it, of occupying as its site, and of destroying by crossing, and perpetuating the destruction of every public highway between the <em>City of Washington </em>and the <em>Ohio River. </em>Such a proposition we think is not warranted by any act of legislation before us, and nothing but a grant of such a power in terms the most full and unequivocal, would induce this court to believe that the legislatures referred to, designed to confer it. Such terms are not to be found in the charter of the canal company, and we do not deem it necessary to use arguments or illustrations to show the nonexistence of such a power.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Assuming then that the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company </em>has no right, in cutting its canal across public highways, utterly to destroy them, and that it is bound to unite, for the public accommodation, the highway thereby divided, by a reasonably convenient thoroughfare over or under its canal; has the appellant by the deed of conveyance he has executed to the company, precluded or estopped himself from claiming a right to use the highway thus illegally destroyed by the canal company? That a public prosecution for a nuisance might be sustained for this destruction of the highway, is we think quite clear, and that all persons, other than the appellant, who, by reason of this obstruction or destruction of the highway, have sustained any special or particular injury or damage, may maintain an action on the case against the canal company, appears to us, a proposition equally manifest. Is there, in the deed referred to, any stipulation or covenant, or any thing from which it can be implied, that the appellant contracted to surrender or disrobe himself of this privilege of using the public highway? a privilege possessed by every other citizen of the State. If there be, we have not discovered it. In construing this deed we must presume, in the absence of all proof to the contrary, (if indeed we could look to such proof, were it before us,) that the parties to it understood their relative rights, powers and duties, in respect to the subject matter of their contract. The parties then knowing that the canal company were bound to re-construct and keep open the highway for the benefit of the public, could the appellant suppose, that in executing the deed before us, he surrendered for ever a highly valuable privilege, of which every other member of the community Was left in the free and uninterrupted enjoyment. What motive could he have had in making, or the canal company in exacting, such a surrender? The record discloses nothing from which we can be induced to believe that it was the intention of the parties to the deed, that such a sacrifice should have been made. And if in construing the deed we could look to the proof in the record, we could not be induced to believe that the appellant knowingly assented to it. That an annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>income of one thousand dollars, pertaining to realty, and which might endure forever, would, for the gross sum of $&gt; 1,075, be surrendered and forever abandoned, cannot in our opinion be predicated of the appellant, under the circumstances of this case. The doctrine of estoppel, so much relied on in the argument, we regard as wholly inapplicable to the case before us. The appellant claims no privilege; asserts no right inconsistent with his grant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b239-5\">Chambers J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALZ\">dissented,and delivered the following opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">I concur with the majority of the court in the opinion that the canal company was under a legal obligation in a reasonable time to provide a safe and sufficient passage way for the public, in lieu of the public county road which their charter permitted them to dig up and convert into the site of their canal, and that the injury to the plaintiff was of a character, according to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, to entitle him to recover in a proper form of action. Still, in my opinion, the instruction of the court below was properly given, that the plaintiff could not recover for any damage done his mills by reason of the <em>construction of the canal across said public </em>road, and the <em>destruction of said public road. </em>According to my view, the words, \u201cin the face of his said deed,\u201d in no degree affects the case. The deed certainly had the effect to confer a right on the company to open the canal, but the most that it seems to me can be made of the introduction of these terms, is to consider them as intended as a reason why the legal proposition asserted, was true. How far the reason, if it be intended as a reason, which influenced the counsel in moving the instruction, was adopted by the court, there is nothing in their language to disclose, but it is not with the reasons, real or imputed, that we have to deal. The proposition of law expressed by the court is, that the plaintiff could not recover. Recover where, when, how ? Was it intended that the facts deposed to, would not, in any future suit, in any court, at anytime, form a ground of action? I think not, but that on the contrary, the application must be to that particular action then on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>If to the instruction as asked, had been supplied the words, \u201cin this action,\u201d or, \u201cin this form of action,\u201d it could not be denied, I presume, that the court must have looked to the declaration to see whether it enabled the plaintiff to recover. Now I have not been able to comprehend the legal distinction between the different expressions in an instruction, \u201ccould not recover in this form of action,\u201d \u201ccould not recover in this action,\u201d or \u201ccould not recover.\u201d It is said the act of 1825, ch. 117, shuts out all questions not shewn by the record to have been decided by the court below. Admitted. But the very question at issue is, \u201cwas the point raised in the court below.\u201d The true interpretation of that act is the precise matter of debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Since the earliest days of judicial history it has been an' axiom, that a plaintiff cannot bring a suit for one thing and recover a different thing. The familiar illustration is, you shall not sue for a horse and recover an ox. Did the act of 1825 design to change this fundamental principle? I cannot think its letter or spirit justify us in saying so; yet with due deference, it appears to me such is the plain result of the doctrine which will condemn the opinion of the court below. The principle now proposed to be adopted is, that you must look <em>alone </em>to the evidence, entirely disregarding the pleadings, and if the case made by the evidence entitles the plaintiff to recover, the court will not be permitted to give such an instruction as the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Now'if the action be for injury to a horse, and the proof be of injury to an ox, the plaintiff, looking only to the case made by the proof, <em>is </em>entitled to recover, because, according to the principle assumed, he has made out a case by proof for which he could maintain an action,, if his pleadings had conformed to the character of his proof. The pleadings however, it is said, are to be totally disregarded, and in effect, the case is to be treated in all respects in this court as if the pleadings were technically suited to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">It may well be said too, that there is a more general sense in which both may be included within the same descriptive terms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The horse and the ox as properly belong to the same family of \u201cbeasts,\u201d as the \u201cpublic county road\u201d and the \u201ccanal,\u201d or \u201cbridge,\u201d do to the family of \u201chighways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">If suit is brought for a particular species, it is not enough to prove title to another species of the same genus, else we should find no stopping point short of the universal term of \u201cproperty,\u201d or something similar, which should include every thing to which title could be made. But where will be the end of this principle of interpretation in its practical difficulties? The case of ejectment or replevin will best illustrate it. The replevin is instituted for a horse; the proof is that defendant seized and carried away a horse, and also an ox, from the plaintiff\u2019s enclosures; the defendant proves title to the horse, but makes no defence in proof as to the ox.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The defendant in a motion reciting the evidence which proves his title to the horse, asks an instruction to the jury, that if they believe this evidence \u201cthe plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d The court refuse the instruction, and according to the principle assumed, their decision must be affirmed in this court. In such a case what judgment is to be entered? Plaintiff has no title to the article for which his replevin was instituted, but he has proved title to another article, for which, is he entitled to judgment? And may not the same doctrine, when carried out to its inevitable results, be applied to the case of an ejectment for land, in which a recovery may be had for a horse? It does not remove the difficulty to say that objection may be taken below to the admissibility of the testimony. If the testimony was not admitted, the case does not arise, and it is very true, if there is no case, there is no difficulty. But the matter in hand is how to dispose of the difficulty when the case <em>does </em>arise. I cannot agree that the act of 1825 was designed to insulate a question to an extent subversive of the most fundamental rule in the history and nature of suits at law. On the contrary, it is my opinion, that an instruction like the present, \u201cthat the plaintiff cannot recover,\u201d not only authorises, but imperatively demands from the court, a reference to the character and nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and that as the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tiff in this case claimed damages <em>alone, </em>for cutting and digging the canal in and across the public road, and thereby destroying it, he cannot recover for the failure of the canal company to provide some other proper passage way for the \u201cpublic county road,\u201d which they had the right to dig up and destroy, and consequently, that the court below was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
