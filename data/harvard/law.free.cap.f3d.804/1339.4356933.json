United States, </em>576 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). On 11 August 2015, this Court requested supplemental briefs by the parties addressing the impact, if any, of <em>Johnson </em>on this appeal. Having now concluded that <em>Johnson </em>has no impact on the issues in this appeal, we hereby reinstate our prior decision as provided below, and add at the end why <em>Johnson </em>has no impact on this case raising ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the application of the career-offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2 to the guidelines range for Denson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-21\">\n<em>REINSTATED DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-22\">Tony Denson, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The district court granted a certificate of appealability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>(\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of whether Denson\u2019s attorney rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing by failing to object to treating Denson\u2019s Florida conviction for possession of a short-barreled shotgun, in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 790.221(1), as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for career offender- guidelines calculations under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Denson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">I. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Denson has the burden to show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of the deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cIn a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). Whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Id. </em>Here, the district court correctly denied Denson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim because he did not establish either deficient performance or prejudice. We explain why.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">II. CAREER OFFENDER GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">Denson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim hinges on his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the district court\u2019s designating him a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. Under \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant qualifies as a career offender if he \u201chas at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means an offense punishable by one year in prison that either \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d or \u201cis a burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk for physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 explicitly states that \u201cunlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a),\u201d such as a \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d is a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. n. 1. Because this guidelines commentary is authoritative and binding, possession of such a firearm qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d without resort to the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d traditionally used to determine whether an offense falls within the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), <em>United States v. Hall, </em>714 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2013) (concluding that possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) based on the binding guidelines commentary).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-12\">At the time of Denson\u2019s predicate offense, Florida\u2019s definition of \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d was virtually identical to the federal definition of \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a), referenced in the guidelines commentary. <em>Compare </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6846(a)(1)-(2), <em>with </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 790.001(10) (1992). In other words, a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>the Florida law was, for the purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2, a \u201cfirearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a),\u201d and, according to the binding commentary, unlawful possession of such a firearm qualifies as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">III. PERFORMANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">As to deficient performance, Denson is unable to show that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell beldw an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. This is so because an objection to classifying Denson\u2019s Florida short-barreled shotgun offense as a crime of violence would have run counter to the express and authoritative language of the guidelines commentary and thus would have been merit-less. Failing to make a meritless objection does not constitute deficient performance. <em>See Freeman v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>536 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cA lawyer cannot be deficient for failing to raise a meritless claim.... \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">IV. BEGAY V. UNITED STATES</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">In an effort to show his counsel\u2019s performance nevertheless was objectively unreasonable, Denson points to <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and to this Court\u2019s application of <em>Begay </em>in <em>United States v. McGill, </em>618 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2010). <em>Begay </em>was decided about a year before Denson was sentenced. In <em>Begay, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a New Mexico driving under the influence offense was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). 553 U.S. at 141-42, 128 S.Ct. at 1584. The ACCA\u2019s residual clause defines the phrase \u201cviolent felony\u201d using language virtually identical to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s residual clause defining a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>Begay </em>explained that an offense that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another\u201d is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause only if it is \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes, burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, or unlawful use of explosives. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 128 S.Ct. at 1585.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">McGill was decided almost a year after Denson\u2019s sentencing and involved whether the same Florida offense at issue here\u2014 possession of a short-barreled shotgun\u2014 was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See McGill, </em>618 F.3d at 1274. In <em>McGill, </em>this Court applied <em>Begay </em>and determined that, while possession of a short-barreled shotgun presented a serious risk of physical injury to another, the risk was \u201cnot \u2018similar in kind\u2019 to \u2018use of explosives,\u2019 its closest enumerated analog\u201d in the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1277. Thus, Florida\u2019s short-barreled shotgun offense is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-10\">Denson maintains these cases show that his Florida short-barreled shotgun offense should not have been deemed a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and, had his counsel made a Begay-like objection, the sentencing court would not have designated Denson a career offender under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">Denson\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our recent precedent in <em>United States v. Hall. </em>Like Denson, the defendant in <em>Hall </em>relied upon <em>Begay </em>and <em>McGill </em>to argue that \u201cthe analysis for the term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 is exactly the same because the two definitions are virtually identical\u201d and, therefore, possession of a short-barreled shotgun cannot be a crime of violence under the career-offender guideline. <em>Hall, </em>714 F.3d at 1273. This Court rejected that argument based on <em>United States v. Stin-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number><em>son, </em>in which the Supreme Court \u201cmade clear that \u2018commentary in the Sentencing Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1272 (quoting <em>Stinson v. U.S., </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993)) (brackets omitted). In Hall, this Court concluded that because <em>\u201cStin-son </em>controls,\u201d and the guidelines commentary designating the. possession of a short-barreled shotgun as a crime of violence is authoritative and binding, the usual \u201ccategorical approach\u201d used in <em>Begay </em>and <em>McGill </em>to determine if an offense falls within the residual clause does not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 1274. We further determined that the commentary did not fall within <em>\u201cStin-son\u2019s </em>stringent exception requirements, as the commentary provision violates neither the Constitution nor any other federal statute, and it is not inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, the guideline text itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">Although Denson attempts to distinguish <em>Hall </em>on its facts, <em>Hall\u2019s </em>legal conclusion \u2014 as to the binding effect of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s commentary \u2014 controls the outcome of Denson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. We also reject Denson\u2019s argument that <em>Hall </em>was undermined to the point of abrogation by <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). Contrary to Denson\u2019s contention, <em>Hall </em>did not employ the modified categorical approach addressed in <em>Descamps, </em>and this panel remains bound by <em>Hall. </em>In any event, to the extent Den-son contends that <em>Hall </em>is wrongly decided, reasonably effective representation does not include a requirement that trial counsel make arguments or objections based on predictions as to how the law may develop. <em>See Marquard v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>429 F.3d 1278, 1313 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that counsel\u2019s performance was not ineffective for .failing to contemplate a future Supreme Court decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">V. PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">Denson also failed to show prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>To prove \u2022 prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result- of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. Because Florida\u2019s offense of possession of a short-barreled shotgun is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s binding commentary, Denson has not shown that any objection by defense counsel to Denson\u2019s career offender status would have been likely to change the outcome of his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">VI. <em>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES, </em>576 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (2015)</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-14\"> In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Johnson, </em>576 U.S.-,-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2257, 2253. We have held that \u201cthe decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>is limited to criminal statutes that define elements of a crime or fix punishments\u201d and does not apply to the advisory sentencing guidelines that \u201cdo neither.\u201d <em>United States v. Matchett, </em>802 F.3d 1185, 1193-94, No. 14-10396, 2015 WL 5515439, at *6 (11th Cir. Sept. 21, 2015). The vagueness doctrine in <em>Johnson </em>\u201cdoes not apply to [the] advisory sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, \u201c[b]e-cause there is no constitutional right to sentencing guidelines \u2014 or, more generally, to a less discretionary application of sentences than that permitted prior to the Guidelines \u2014 the limitations the Guidelines place on a judge\u2019s discretion cannot violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>a defendant\u2019s right to due process by reason of being vague.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1195, 2015 WL 5515439 at *7 (quotations omitted). Accordingly, Denson\u2019s arguments based on <em>Johnson </em>fail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">In addition, as the government points out in its supplemental brief, prior to <em>Johnson,. </em>no court had held the residual clause void for vagueness, and indeed the Supreme Court had twice held that the residual clause was not vague. <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1598 n. 6, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007); <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 1, -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2277, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). Trial counsel is not required to make argument or raise objections based on predictions as to how the law may develop. <em>See Marquard, </em>429 F.3d at 1313. This is a second independent reason why <em>Johnson </em>has no impact on our previous decision that Denson had failed to show deficient performance resulting in prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">For these reasons, the district court properly denied Denson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1337-9\">. Denson also argues the underlying substantive issue that the sentencing court wrongly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1\u2019s career offender enhancement. Because this issue is outside the scope of the COA, we do not address it. <em>See Murray </em>v. <em>United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
