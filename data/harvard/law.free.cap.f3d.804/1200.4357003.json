The court having been polled at the request of one of its members, and a majority of the judges who are in regular active service and not disqualified not having voted in favor (Fed. R.App. P. 35 and 5th CiR. R. 35), the petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-24\">In the en banc poll, 4 judges voted in favor of rehearing (Judges Dennis, Prado, Graves, and Costa), and 11 judges voted against rehearing (Chief Judge Stewart and Judges Jolly, Davis, Jones, Smith, Clement, Owen, Elrod, Southwick, Haynes, and Higginson).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1196-25\">PRADO, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<judges id=\"A96\">joined by DENNIS and GRAVES, Circuit Judges,</judges>\n<p id=\"AbH\">dissenting from Denial of Rehearing En Banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-26\">Plaintiffs allege that U.S. border patrol agents violated the Fourth Amendment by stopping them solely because of their Hispanic appearance. The respective district courts denied the border patrol agents\u2019 motions to dismiss, holding in part that Plaintiffs could assert a claim for damages under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). On appeal, the panel reversed, asserting that undocumented immigrants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may not, as a matter of law, assert <em>Bivens </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>claims against border patrol agents for illegally stopping and arresting them. <em>De La Paz v. Coy, </em>786 F.3d 367, 369 (5th Cir.2015). Because I believe that the issue raised in this case is an important one, and I disagree with the panel\u2019s reading of the relevant case law, I dissent from this Court\u2019s denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">As the panel\u2019s opinion points out, the first step in assessing whether a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is available is to determine whether allowing a <em>Bivens </em>action to proceed would extend <em>Bivens </em>to a \u201cnew context.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 675, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 68, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001)). Where the legal and factual components of a case fall within the \u201ccore holding of <em>Bivens,\u201d Malesko, </em>534 U.S. at 67, 122 S.Ct. 515, the context is not \u201cnew\u201d and a <em>Bivens </em>action may proceed. <em>Turkmen v. Hasty, </em>789 F.3d 218, 234 (2d Cir.2015); <em>Malesko, </em>534 U.S. at 67, 122 S.Ct. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">The claims asserted by Plaintiffs here are squarely within the holding of <em>Bivens. </em>In <em>Bivens, </em>the Supreme Court permitted a suit for damages by a plaintiff who alleged that federal law enforcement officers violated the Fourth Amendment when they entered his residence, searched through his belongings, and detained him. <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 389-90, 91 S.Ct. 1999. Without qualification, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cdamages may be obtained for injuries consequent upon a violation of the Fourth Amendment by federal officials\u201d and that, \u201c[hjistorically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty.\u201d Id. at 395, 91 S.Ct. 1999. The claims at issue here \u2014 which stem from routine stops, searches, and arrests by federal law enforcement officers \u2014 fit well within this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">In an effort to distinguish the case at hand from <em>Bivens, </em>the panel\u2019s opinion errs by defining the \u201ccontext\u201d too narrowly. Namely, the opinion makes much of the fact that Plaintiffs are undocumented immigrants rather than U.S. citizens or legal residents and that they were stopped by border patrol agents rather than some other law enforcement agency. I believe these distinctions are not only erroneous, but are at odds with existing case law from this Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and others.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>Nor do the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Arar v. Ashcroft, </em>585 F.3d 559 (2d Cir.2009) (en banc), or the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Mirmehdi v. United States, </em>689 F.3d 975 (9th Cir.2012), support the panel\u2019s conclusion as the material facts in those cases are much different than the ones at issue here and in <em>Bivens. </em>In <em>Mirmehdi, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>claims did not arise from a routine stop; rather, they were based on the allegation that federal agents had knowingly lied to the immigration judge about the plaintiffs\u2019 involvement in a terrorist organization in order to convince the judge to withhold bond. <em>Mirmehdi, </em>689 F.3d at 979-80. The Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Arar </em>is even further afield from the case at hand. In Arar, the court addressed only the availability of a <em>Bivens </em>remedy arising from the plaintiffs \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201c[t]he transfer, without formal charges, trial, or court approval, of a person suspected of being a terrorist or supporter of a terrorist group to a foreign nation for imprisonment and interrogation on behalf of the transferring nation.\u201d <em>Arar, </em>585 F.3d at 563-64, 564 n. 1 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1410 (9th ed.2009)). This understanding is supported by the Second Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>Turkmen v. Hasty, </em>in which the court stated that its Bivens-related holding in Arar was limited to \u201cthe acts of federal officials in carrying out Arar\u2019s extraordinary rendition[.]\u201d 789 F.3d at 234. The fact that the courts in <em>Arar </em>and <em>Mirmehdi </em>held that these were new contexts for the purposes of allowing a <em>Bivens </em>claim is not surprising given their particular facts. Nor is it relevant to the case presently before this Court as neither Arar nor <em>Mir-mehdi </em>involved the type of routine domestic searches, seizures, and arrests by federal law enforcement officers at issue in this case and <em>Bivens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Finally, the panel\u2019s opinion unnecessarily puts us in conflict with another Circuit. In <em>Turkmen, </em>the Second Circuit allowed a group of undocumented immigrants to bring <em>Bivens </em>claims against federal officials, stating that \u201ca <em>Bivens </em>remedy is available for Plaintiffs\u2019 ... Fourth Amendment unreasonable and punitive [ ] search[ ] claims.\u201d 789 F.3d at 237. The court reasoned that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment is at the core of the <em>Bivens </em>jurisprudence, as <em>Bivens </em>itself concerned a Fourth Amendment claim ... for the defendants\u2019 use of unreasonable force without probable cause, resulting in the plaintiffs unlawful arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The panel\u2019s opinion in our case, however, reaches the opposite conclusion \u2014 holding that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is unavailable to undocumented immigrants challenging stops and arrests in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">Because I disagree with the panel\u2019s analysis and believe that the decision to take the extraordinary step of denying <em>Bivens </em>remedies for routine traffic stops and arrests to an entire class of people warrants review by the entire court, I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1196-19\">. The panel\u2019s opinion refers to foreign nationals present in the United States without lawful immigration status as \u201cillegal aliens\u201d; I choose to refer to these individuals as \"undocumented immigrants\u201d instead.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">. <em>See Martinez-Aguero v. Gonzalez, </em>459 F.3d 618, 620-21, 625 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that a Mexican national who alleged that she had been illegally arrested and beaten by a border patrol agent \u201cmay bring a <em>Bivens </em>claim for unlawful arrest and the excessive use of force under the Fourth Amendment\u201d). The panel\u2019s justification for ignoring Fifth Circuit law\u2014 that the <em>Bivens </em>issue was not directly raised before this Court in <em>Martinez-Aguero </em>\u2014 is unpersuasive. As this Court has stated, \u201c[wjhen confronting decisions of prior panels ... we are bound by 'not only the result but also those portions of the opinion necessary to that result....\u2019\u201d <em>Gochicoa v. Johnson, </em>238 F.3d 278, 286 n. 11 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Seminole Tribe v. Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 67, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996)). Because we affirmed the denial of qualified immunity in <em>Martinez-Aguero </em>and allowed the case to proceed to trial, the availability of a <em>Bivens </em>remedy was necessary to the decision and is binding Fifth Circuit law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">. <em>See, e.g., Escobar v.
