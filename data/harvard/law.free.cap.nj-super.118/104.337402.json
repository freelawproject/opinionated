(1) Under the circumstances existing in this case, the final decree of foreclosure through which respondents derived their title is not open to collateral attack by appellants. <em>Andes v. Boyajian, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>344, 348 (Oh. 1951) and cases cited therein. (2) With full knowledge of the alleged deficiency in the final decree of foreclosure filed in 1963, appellants waited approximately five years before seeking relief. Such unexplained and unexcused delay in enforcing an alleged known right has resulted in prejudice to respondents who, in good faith and for value, purchased the property in question. Appellants are now estopped from obtaining relief. See <em>Clark v. Judge, </em>84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>35, 53 (Ch. 1964), aff\u2019d 44 <em>N. J. </em>550 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b123-10\">Kolovsky, J. A.

J. </em>1 (1965), applies to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">However, I agree that we should affirm because (1) plaintiffs attempt to attack in his, mortgage foreclosure action the validity of the prior tax foreclosure judgment is a collateral attack not permitted by the cases; (2) even if plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tiff\u2019s belated challenge of the sufficiency of the inquiry had been by way of a direct application in the tax foreclosure proceeding, the record in this case would call for a rejection of the challenge; and (3) the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant-appellant Solomon had \u201cfailed to sustain the burden of proof that any part of the lands are not within the territorial limits of the Township of Millstone.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
