We accept this fact for purposes of the determination herein, and reject the hospital\u2019s argument that the trial court should not have considered the incidence of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">We hold that the true meaning of the indemnification clause here involved is that Briscoe, the indemnitor, is liable thereon for the costs and expenses here involved if, in fact, there was causal connection between any act or omission by Briscoe or any of its subcontractors (including by decedent or any other employee of any such) in the execution of the work and the occurrence of the fatal event on account of which the main action was brought. This is without qualification as to negligence <em>vet non </em>attending any such action or omission and without regard to the allegations in the death action. The ultimate burden of persuasion on that fact issue is on the third-party claimant. But <em>cf. NOPCO Chemical Div. v. Blaw-Knox Co., </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>274 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The foregoing fact issue will have to be tried on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"> We regard it as of no moment in relation to the issue of Briscoe\u2019s liability on the indemnification clause that the costs and expenses of defending the death action were assumed by the hospital\u2019s general insurer rather than borne directly by the hospital. The trial judge\u2019s determination in favor of Briscoe on the basis of that fact was erroneous. We deem the collateral source rule to be applicable in this regard. See <em>Dudar v. Milef Realty Corporation, </em>258 <em>N. Y. </em>415, 180 <em>N. E. </em>102, 105 (Ct. App. 1932). Looked at another way, the present real party in interest, the hospital\u2019s general insurer, is entitled to be subrogated to the hospital\u2019s rights under the indemnification clause. This is the well-nigh universal rule. See <em>Boiler Engineer &amp; Sup. Co. v. General Controls, Inc., </em>443 <em>Pa. </em>44, 277 <em>A. </em>2d 812 (Sup. Ct. 1971), and the many authorities there cited in accord. No New Jersey decision to the contrary has been pointed out to us, and we are in agreement with the Pennsylvania court. Presumably, the potentiality of recovery on subrogated claims enters into the insurers\u2019 fixing of premium rate structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We do not pass upon Briscoe\u2019s additional argument that before calling in its own general liability insurer the hospital was obliged to have had recourse to the defense of the accident claim available through the separate liability policy Briscoe allegedly supplied the hospital under the contract. There is insufficient relevant factual data before us at this juncture to determine this issue \u2014 certainly in terms of entry of a summary judgment. We remit it to the trial court for determination on the remand. Consideration might well be given at that time, among other things, to whether Briscoe should not have called the hospital\u2019s attention to the stated recourse when it refused defense of the death claim on the hospital\u2019s call.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Iteversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
