Enscor LLC (Enscor), a Tennessee-based general construction company licensed in Mississippi, was audited by the Mississippi Department of Revenue (DOR) for the tax period beginning April 1, 2011, and ending April 30, 2014. A notice of the audit was sent to Enscor via certified mail. Following the audit, the DOR issued Enscor a withholding tax assessment of $51,099.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On October 23, 2014, Enscor, through its attorney and authorized representative, James McGee Jr., appealed the assessment to the DOR's Board of Review pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 27-77-5(1) (Rev. 2010), which provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Any taxpayer aggrieved by an assessment of tax by the agency ... and who wishes to contest the action of the agency shall, within sixty (60) days from the date of the action, file an appeal in writing with the [B]oard of [R]eview requesting a hearing and correction of the contested action specifying in detail the relief requested and any other information that might be required by regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   McGee instructed the DOR to forward all further communications to his law office in Jackson, Mississippi. The Board of Review scheduled a hearing on the appeal for March 19, 2015, and mailed a letter to McGee's office on November 12, 2014, as notification of the hearing. The letter stated that the failure to appear at the hearing would constitute a withdrawal of the appeal and, once withdrawn, the assessment could not be appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 11, 2015,\n   the DOR sent an email to Sandra Crosby, an employee with McGee's firm, as a courtesy reminder of the hearing. However, no Enscor representative attended the hearing; so the Board of Review involuntarily withdrew Enscor's appeal, making the assessment subject to collection by the DOR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Upon learning of the involuntary withdrawal of its appeal, Enscor insisted it did not receive notification of the hearing date and filed a timely petition contesting the withdrawal with the Mississippi Board of Tax Appeals (BTA). The BTA scheduled a hearing on February 17, 2016, specifically to address the issue of the withdrawal of Enscor's appeal. At the hearing, the DOR argued that once the appeal had been involuntarily withdrawn, the matter was final and \"no longer subject to review by the Review Board, [BTA], or any court,\" citing section 27-77-5(8) (Rev. 2010), which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Once an appeal is withdrawn, whether voluntary or involuntary, the action from which the appeal was taken, whether a tax assessment, a denial of [a] refund claim, a denial of [a] waiver of tax penalty, or an order of the [B]oard of [R]eview, shall become final and\n   <em>\n    not subject to further review by the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    oard of\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    R\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    eview, the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    BTA\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    or a court\n   </em>\n   . The agency shall then proceed in accordance with law based on such final action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Emphasis added). The DOR further asserted that Enscor had failed to rebut the presumption that notice of the hearing \"was properly delivered and received.\" Enscor was represented at the hearing by another attorney with McGee's law firm. Requesting that the BTA grant Enscor's request to reconsider the audit results, Enscor's counsel explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In summary, we do not contest the factual and legal conclusions reached by the [DOR] on [its] motion to dismiss. It seems pretty straightforward in this case that generally not appearing before the Board of Review would result in an involuntary withdrawal of the appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   As I'm sure [you] are all aware, we represent hundreds of clients before the [DOR] in disputes all the time. It was never our intention to withdraw the appeal or to somehow negligently fail to appear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   That being said, we would like to submit to the Board that it was an unfortunate sequence of events that occurred in our offices which led us to not put the Board of Review date on our calendar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4. On March 2, 2016, the BTA affirmed the Board of Review's decision to involuntarily withdraw Enscor's administrative appeal, concluding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   IT IS, THEREFORE, HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED by the [BTA] that the [DOR's m]otion to [d]ismiss is sustained and the taxpayers' appeal is DISMISSED with prejudice and that the tax assessment from which the appeal was taken has become final and is\n   <em>\n    not subject to further review by the Board\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    of Review, the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    BTA\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    or a court\n   </em>\n   and that the [DOR] may proceed in accordance with law based upon such final action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Emphasis added). The DOR instituted collections on the withholding tax assessment by enrolling a lien against Enscor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 5. Seeking relief, Enscor, along with Jeffrey and Cynthia Smith (the principals of Enscor), filed a complaint with the Hinds County Chancery Court on June\n   22, 2016, against Ed Morgan, in his official capacity as Commissioner of the DOR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The action requested that the chancery court assume jurisdiction under Mississippi Code Annotated section 11-13-11 (Rev. 2004), which provides the chancery court with \"jurisdiction of suits by one or more taxpayers in any county, city, town[,] or village, to restrain the collection of taxes levied or attempted to be levied without authority of law.\" Determining whether jurisdiction is proper under section 11-13-11 requires the application of a three-part guideline by the chancery court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) whether the aggrieved taxpayer alleges an inadequate remedy at law in his complaint; (2) whether there is not an adequate remedy at law available to the aggrieved taxpayer; and (3) whether the taxpayer's allegations of fact, if proven to be true, warrant a conclusion that the taxes are being collected or levied without authority of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Bankston v. Miss. Dep't of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021048\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/95/1275/#p1277\">\n    95 So.3d 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1277-78 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012). Asserting that it had \"satisfied the criteria\" for the court to exercise jurisdiction and that the DOR assessed the withholding tax without authority of law, Enscor sought to vacate the BTA's findings and enjoin the DOR from the collection of said taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 6. The DOR filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. It claimed the chancery court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Enscor did not sufficiently plead all the requisite elements for jurisdiction under section 11-13-11, noting Enscor had an adequate remedy under law to appeal the BTA's order under section 27-77-7(1), which provides for judicial review of a BTA order by a taxpayer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, the DOR argued that should the court determine it had subject-matter jurisdiction, the DOR's notification of the March 19, 2015 hearing satisfied due process, and the Smiths failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted since the DOR levied the tax assessment against Enscor, not the Smiths as individual plaintiffs. In response, Enscor submitted an affidavit from Crosby, McGee's employee, which stated that after a thorough search, \"there exist[ed] no records of McGee Tax Firm ever receiving a [n]otice from the Board of Review advising us or [Enscor] that a hearing had been scheduled before the Board of Review in this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 7. After a review of the pleadings and a hearing, the chancery court granted the DOR's motion to dismiss with prejudice on November 17, 2016. The chancery court found that Enscor had failed to perfect subject-matter jurisdiction because it did not exhaust its administrative remedies as required by law under Mississippi Code Annotated section 27-77-5(8) (Rev. 2015), which provided a recently added exception to the finality of review for \"the issue of whether a taxpayer's actions or inaction constituted a failure on the part of the taxpayer to prosecute his appeal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the chancery court determined that it was \"precluded from considering whether the\n   facts support the conclusion that the taxes were collected without authority of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8. Aggrieved, Enscor appeals. While we find that the chancery court erred in holding that Enscor had an adequate remedy at law available, we conclude that neither the factual allegations in the pleadings nor the summary-judgment materials support the conclusion that the DOR acted without authority of law. Accordingly, we affirm on alternative grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 9. Enscor argues that the chancery court erred in granting the DOR's motion to dismiss because the court had subject-matter jurisdiction over Enscor's claim under section 11-13-11. \"A dismissal for lack of subject[-]matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.

As mentioned, a chancery court has subject-matter jurisdiction over a taxpayer's claims to restrain the collection of taxes where the following criteria are met: (1) the aggrieved taxpayer's complaint alleges \"an inadequate remedy at law\"; (2) no adequate remedy at law is available to the taxpayer; and (3) the factual allegations made by the taxpayer, if proven, \"warrant a conclusion\" that the challenged taxes \"are being collected or levied without authority of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Bankston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021048\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/95/1275/#p1277\">\n    95 So.3d at 1277-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7). Enscor claims that it \"acted properly in filing its [p]etition under [ section] 11-13-11\" and \"satisfied the three-pronged analysis which sets forth the threshold criteria for the [c]hancery [c]ourt to exercise jurisdiction over this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 11. The chancellor determined that Enscor had an adequate remedy at law, but Enscor contends it had no available remedy to challenge the involuntary withdrawal of its appeal. The basis for the chancellor's finding was the 2015 revision to section 27-77-5(8), which provided in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Once an appeal is withdrawn, whether voluntary or involuntary, the action from which the appeal was taken, whether a tax assessment, a denial of refund claim, a denial of waiver of tax penalty, or the denial of a claim to tax credits or incentives, or an order of the Board of Review, shall become final and not subject to further review by the Board of Review, the [BTA] or a court,\n   <em>\n    other than as to the issue of whether a taxpayer's actions or inactions constituted a failure on the part of the taxpayer to prosecute his appeal\n   </em>\n   . The agency shall then proceed in accordance with law based on such final action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis added). The parties do not dispute that the 2015 revision was not applicable in this case because the taxes were assessed in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the present case\n   is governed by the 2010 version of section 27-77-5(8), which stated that \"[o]nce an appeal is withdrawn, whether voluntary or involuntary, the action from which the appeal was taken ... shall become final and\n   <em>\n    not subject to further review by the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    oard of\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    R\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    eview, the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    BTA\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    or a court\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Virk v.

However, the DOR argues that because Mississippi Code Annotated section 27-77-7(1) (Rev. 2010) provided for judicial review of a BTA ruling, Enscor was afforded an adequate remedy at law under that statute to challenge the appeal's involuntary withdrawal. To support its argument, the DOR cites\n   <em>\n    Bankston\n   </em>\n   , in which this Court upheld a chancery court's finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the claimant had an adequate remedy at law under section 27-77-7(1).\n   <em>\n    Bankston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021048\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/95/1275/#p1277\">\n    95 So.3d at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). But unlike the present case, the appellant's ability to appeal in\n   <em>\n    Bankston\n   </em>\n   originated from Mississippi Code Annotated section 27-77-5(4) (Rev. 2005), which allowed for a taxpayer to appeal \"the issue of whether a written appeal from the order of the Board was timely filed with the [State Tax] Commission.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021048\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/95/1275/#p1277\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021048\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/95/1275/#p1277\">\n    at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 8) (quoting section 27-77-5(4) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 13. Therefore, we find\n   <em>\n    Bankston\n   </em>\n   distinguishable. Here, the 2010 version of section 27-77-5(8) precluded Enscor from appealing the assessment and deprived the BTA from jurisdiction over said appeal. Enscor properly alleged an inadequate remedy at law, and no adequate remedy at law was available to review the involuntary withdrawal of Enscor's appeal. Accordingly, the chancery court's finding that Enscor had an adequate remedy at law under section 27-77-5(8) was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14. The chancery court did not address Enscor's claim that the DOR acted without authority of law in levying the tax assessment. Enscor does not dispute that it was notified of the tax assessment levied against it; nor does it contend that the DOR lacked authority under the law to levy the taxes. Rather, Enscor argues that the DOR acted without authority of law by failing to notify Enscor of the Board of Review hearing and to provide it an opportunity to defend itself, which it asserts was a violation of its due-process rights. Upon review, we find that the allegations contained\n   in the pleadings, \"if proven,\" fail to support Enscor's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15. \"Due process does not require that a property owner receive actual notice before the government may take his property.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

With regard to the courtesy email reminder sent a week before the hearing, it is evident from the pleadings that Enscor's failure to receive this later notice of the hearing was due not to any failure on the part of the DOR, but to the law firm's computer system designating the email as \"spam\" and placing it in a separate \"spam\" folder. The pleadings stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [O]n March 11, 2015, Ms. Sandrel Nichols, an administrative assistant employed by the [DOR],\n   <em>\n    allegedly sent\n   </em>\n   an email to [McGee] advising that the hearing was scheduled for the date listed above. However, [McGee]\n   <em>\n    never received\n   </em>\n   this correspondence and was unable to reply accordingly.\n   <em>\n    It was only some time later that the email was discovered, in the representative's spam folder\n   </em>\n   .... Having\n   <em>\n    never received any notice\n   </em>\n   that a hearing had been scheduled on their behalf by the [DOR's] Board of Review, neither the Plaintiffs no[r] their representative appeared or presented any arguments or evidence to the Defendants in advance of the unilaterally scheduled hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Emphasis added). We find it somewhat disingenuous that Enscor would assert the email was \"allegedly sent,\" but admit that the email was later discovered in its \"spam\" folder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 19. We find that the pleadings show that the DOR provided notice \"reasonably calculated\" to notify Enscor of the hearing and afford it an opportunity to dispute the tax assessment. Accordingly, while Enscor satisfied the first two criteria under section 11-13-11, we find the pleadings failed to demonstrate that the DOR acted without authority of law, and we affirm the chancery court's dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, albeit on alternative grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Askew v.

We further find that Enscor failed to produce sufficient evidence to survive the DOR's motion for summary judgment. Attached to the DOR's motion was a copy of the November 21, 2014 notification letter and two affidavits from DOR employees, Sandrel Nichols and Carlton McGrone, attesting the notice letter had been sent through the U.S. mail system and addressed to McGee's law firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Enscor responded with an affidavit by McGee's employee, Crosby, in which she merely averred that she did \"not recall, nor have any evidence of receipt\" of the notice. \"[T]o survive summary judgment, 'the party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Huynh v.
