Conery, Judges.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   CONERY, Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff, Aline Waterman (Ms. Waterman), filed suit against the Acadiana Mall (the Mall) and related entities alleging injury from a fall on the premises. In her petition, the plaintiff noted the discovery of a ball and a wooden wedge in the vicinity of her fall. Following a three-day trial, however, the trial court rejected the plaintiff's claim and cited with particularity the lack of evidence regarding causation. The plaintiff appeals. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the petition instituting this matter, Ms. Waterman alleged that, on June 15, 2012, she was a patron of the Mall in Lafayette \"when suddenly and without warning she fell on an amusement ball, which was used as a door stop, causing serious injuries[.]\" Advancing theories of premises liability due to negligence, Ms. Waterman named the Mall and mall-related entities as defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She sought medical expenses and general damages associated with physical injuries she related to the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During pre-trial proceedings, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking the presumption associated with spoliation of the evidence. By the motion, the plaintiff argued that the defendants failed to produce photographs of the scene of the fall, a daily activity report allegedly prepared by the Mall's security personnel, the \"ball and wooden door-wedge\" that she asserted caused her fall, and a statement that she contended was taken from a \"key eyewitness\" to the fall. Although the record does not contain a formal ruling on the motion, the trial court ultimately explained during the three-day trial on the merits that the spoliation claim was inapplicable under the circumstances present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of her claim at trial, the plaintiff presented testimony from Mall employees involved in the facility's maintenance, much of which involved the origins of the suspect wooden wedge and ball. The former object, the plaintiff contended, had fallen onto the floor from the frame of large glass doors at the Mall's entrance. And the ball, the plaintiff contended, could have come from an arcade near the site. The plaintiff suggested that the presence of these items indicated negligence on the part of the Mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the close of evidence, the trial court ruled in favor of the Mall, finding that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof under La.R.S. 9:2800.6. The trial court explained in a combined judgment and reasons for ruling that \"there was much inconsistency in the testimony of almost every witness called to testify[.]\" In contrast, the trial court listed areas of consistency, including testimony indicating that \"[t]wo objects (a wooden wedge and a small ball shaped item) were near where [the plaintiff] fell.\" The trial court also explained that evidence indicated that \"a regular compliment of clean-up personnel\" was on duty when the accident allegedly occurred and that \"[w]ooden wedges such as the one found near where Plaintiff reported falling were used by mall personnel to stabilize a sliding door near that food court entrance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nevertheless, the trial court further explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [A] number of things were not established by the evidence. No one, not even the Plaintiff, could testify as to what caused her fall. No one could identify\n   the source of the ball like object although some witnesses speculated it came from the Tilt Arcade. No one testified to seeing the Plaintiff fall. The gentleman who accompanied her was not called as a witness although Plaintiff identified him as her former fianc\u00e9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Given that absence of proof, the trial court stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [C]onsidering all the evidence, Plaintiff has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, that a condition existing on the premises of the Defendant caused her fall. While there was much discussion about the wooden wedge and it was sufficiently established that the wedge belonged to Defendant, the Plaintiff failed to prove the wedge caused her fall. To the contrary, she admitted she did not know what caused her fall, only that two objects, a wedge and a ball like object were observed near where she fell. As noted, there was no testimony from her companion, or anyone who observed the fall, and could provide a reason for the fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Inasmuch as Plaintiff has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a condition existing on the premises of the Defendant caused her fall she has failed to establish her case sufficiently to recover. Moreover, even if one were to assume one of the objects caused the fall (which assumption would be improper considering Plaintiff's burden or proof), Plaintiff failed to prove the condition existed for some time before the fall and failed to carry the burden of proving constructive notice as mandated by the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pertaining to this latter point, the trial court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plaintiff did not establish that either object was present for such a period of time that it would have been discovered if the merchant had exercised reasonable care. To carry the burden of proving this temporal element, a plaintiff must present \"positive evidence\" of the existence of the condition prior to the accident. A claimant who simply shows that the condition existed without an additional showing that the condition existed for some time before the fall has not carried the burden of proving constructive notice as mandated by the statute. In this case, it was established that the food court entrance where the fall is alleged to have occurred was very busy. Many customers would have traversed the area. The fall was reported at 12:40 P.M. The lunch crowd would have been using the entrance for at least 30 minutes prior to the fall, without incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court subsequently denied the plaintiff's motion for new trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   reiterating its determination that the plaintiff \"admitted she did not know what caused her fall, only that two objects, a wedge and a ball like object were observed near where she fell.\" Thus, the trial court explained that \"[w]hile it might be possible that she slipped on the wedge or the small ball like object, she failed to establish the cause of her fall by a preponderance of the evidence. The presence of the two objects in the vicinity of her fall does not prove that either caused her to fall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiff appeals, assigning the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I. The trial court erred in denying Ms. Waterman's Spoliation Motion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   II. The trial court erred in not allowing Ms. Waterman to be refreshed with her deposition testimony; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   III. The trial court's judgment is not supported by law or fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Spoliation of Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By her first assignment of error, the plaintiff contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her request for entry of a sanction related to spoliation of the evidence. In addition to the formal motion referenced above, the plaintiff pursued a line of questioning at the bench trial in which she suggested that she was not provided with a copy of a full accident report upon demand. In her appellate brief, the plaintiff further references evidence that she suggested existed at one time, but that the Mall failed to retain or turn over during discovery. The plaintiff states that \"Acadiana Mall purposely failed to produce key evidence relating to the cause of [her] fall, including photographs, statements of a key eyewitness, and complete accident reports.\" Continuing, she asserts that \"[a]s a result, an adverse inference should have been ordered that Ms. Waterman's fall was caused by one (1) of the two (2) small objects that were lying on the ground in the food court entrance.\" The plaintiff contends, in support, that \"[i]t is customary and logical for Acadiana Mall [ ] to retain the evidence at issue, as it assists in investigating the scene of an accident.\" She further points to testimony of employees of the Mall which, she suggests, is indicative of additional evidence having been gathered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The evidentiary doctrine of spoliation of evidence \"refers to an intentional destruction of evidence for the purpose of depriving the opposing parties of its use in pending or anticipated litigation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

In the event a trial court determines that a suspect party failed to produce evidence within its control, the trial court may impose a sanction, including \"an instruction to the jury that it may infer that the evidence was detrimental to that party.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , 168 So.3d at 704. That adverse inference, however, is not applicable \"when the party gives an adequate explanation for the failure to produce the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal, a trial court's ruling on the issue of spoliation of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following consideration, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to apply the adverse presumption as urged by the plaintiff. We first point out that the plaintiff's presentation of the spoliation issue to the trial court and, in turn, the trial court's consideration of the motion is not squarely presented in this record. Certainly, the plaintiff's formal, pre-trial motion for sanctions related to the claim of spoliation of evidence is contained therein. The record contains no pre-trial ruling on that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, the trial court's refusal to apply the evidentiary doctrine of spoliation of the evidence is best reviewed within the context of the case. The transcript indicates that the matter complained of by the plaintiff in her assignment of error arose during a line of inquiry on redirect examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defense counsel objected, resulting in the following colloquy which merged concepts of relevancy of the questioning and spoliation of the evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. [Plaintiff's counsel] When you went back to the mall to talk - - I mean, to try to get a copy of the incident report - - I think, earlier, you testified that you - - an employee of the mall put you on the phone with somebody?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. Okay. And can you tell me what that conversation was, again[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MR. ROY [Defense counsel]: Your Honor, I think we've gone through all of this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Well, we have. And it's really irrelevant. Unless it has to do with a fact of the accident, whether they cooperated or not has nothing to do with whether they're liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   MR. PICHON [Plaintiff's counsel]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: I mean, I don't understand the point of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: - - nobody is denying that they said that they could not give her the report and that she would have to contact [the] home office. So nobody's denying that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   MR. PICHON: Okay. It was the conversations with the corporate guy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: Well, really, he didn't say anything, other than, you know, I'm not giving you the report. I mean, I don't know what that has to do with anything. Whether she got the report or not has nothing to do with whether they're liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   MR. PICHON: Fair enough, Your Honor. All right. And, Your Honor, the conversations with Mr. Mike Arnette, as we understand it, would have been - - We, now, believe that Mr. Mike Arnette might have been an attorney for corporate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   And that would have gone to - - Those conversations would have put him on notice that litigation would ensue and possibly gone to the spoliation motion, which we previously filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Well, I mean, first of all, we've been through the spoliation motion.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Spoliation applies if there is some testing or something that needs to be done to an object.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In this case, you've got a piece of wood and a ball. Okay? Everybody's got a picture of it. There's no spoliation. Nobody's denying it existed. So I just don't think spoliation is, really, an issue in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   MR. PICHON: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: And, secondly, the fact that she went and talked to somebody in an office doesn't mean she's going to file suit. I mean - - So I just don't think it's relevant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   MR. PICHON: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: It really doesn't go to the issue of liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   MR. PICHON: Thank you, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, absent further discussion on the record and lack of objection, the record does not reveal abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling to the extent it can be said to constitute a denial of the formal motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As a final point, we note that the plaintiff here requested an application of an adverse presumption. Significantly, however,\n   this matter proceeded as a bench trial, not one in which an instruction for the permissive application of an adverse inference would have been possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , 168 So.3d at 704 (providing for \"an\n   <em>\n    instruction to the jury\n   </em>\n   that it\n   <em>\n    may infer\n   </em>\n   that the evidence was detrimental to that party\" (emphasis added) ). Rather, the trial court was in a position to consider and weigh the totality of the evidence, or any corresponding lack thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Deposition Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   By her next assignment, the plaintiff asserts that \"[t]he trial court erred in not allowing [her] to introduce into evidence her own deposition testimony.\" Specifically, she points to her trial testimony wherein she explained on direct examination that, \"because her fall happened so fast, she did not know whether she fell on the small ball/toy or the wooden wedge.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She suggests, however, that she later \"clarified that she fell on one (1) of the two (2) small objects[.]\" On this point, she points to further questioning to which she stated that she \"believe[d] it was one of them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On the issue of whether the plaintiff could be presented with her deposition, the pertinent passage arose on counsel's re-direct examination of the plaintiff. The ensuing colloquy indicates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. Ms. Waterman, defense counsel asked you a number of questions, right? Correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. Some - - You answered to the best of your ability, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. And you answered truthfully, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. Okay. Now, you testified that you fell on either the ball or the wood, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. And you also said that, when you stepped on the floor, you had a sensation under your foot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   MR. ROY: Your Honor, it's leading, and counsel is - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   THE COURT: Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   BY MR. PICHON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Q. Well, let me ask this question: When you walked into the mall, did you have a sensation that you stepped on something, other than the floor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   MR. ROY: It's still leading, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   THE WITNESS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   THE COURT: It is leading. And I would note that she has never - - that has never come out of her mouth. It came out of his mouth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   MR. ROY: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   MR. PICHON: Well, Your Honor, I'm actually impeaching my own witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Because she said that in her deposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   MR. ROY: Well - - But, Your Honor - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah. But you can't impeach your own witness. Okay? You call your witness. You don't impeach her. She - - That has never come out of - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   MR. PICHON: Well, I'm not - - I'm trying to - - What I'm trying to do is - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   THE COURT: No. You're trying to bolster her testimony with some prior sworn testimony, which is contrary to what she said today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   She said she had no idea what she - - what happened until she fell and she saw a ball and a piece of wood on the floor. That what's she said today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Now, you're trying to get her to say something else. That's not what she said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   BY MR. PICHON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q. Well, do you recall taking a deposition?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   THE COURT: But, Mr. - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   THE WITNESS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   THE COURT: What I'm telling you, Mr. Pichon, is, you cannot bolster your witness's testimony through a deposition. A deposition can be used to impeach. It cannot be used to bolster testimony. She's testifying live.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   MR. PICHON: Right. I understand. But - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. So you can't go back to her deposition to try to bolster her testimony. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   MR. PICHON: But I - - Your Honor, are you saying that I can't ask her a question that was asked in the deposition?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   THE COURT: That's right. Because you cannot impeach your own witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   MR. PICHON: It was not for impeachment purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah. Well, I know. You're trying to bolster her testimony. You can't use a deposition for that, either.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   MR. PICHON: I understand, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   MR. PICHON: Understood. I'll move on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Given that exchange, and after review, we find no abuse of the trial court's discretion in rejecting counsel's request. First, the colloquy reflects that the plaintiff's counsel asserted both that the deposition testimony was necessary for impeachment and, within the same passage, as \"not for impeachment purposes.\" Such an argument relates to admissibility under La.Code Evid. art. 607(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   By the plaintiff's appellate brief, however, counsel suggests that the deposition was necessary to refresh the plaintiff's memory, so as to \"attempt to resolve any confusion as to whether [she] believed she slipped on something[.]\" The plaintiff asserts that the trial court's ruling was error as a matter of law pursuant to La.Code Evid. art. 611, related to \"[m]ode and order of interrogation and presentation[,]\" and La.Code Evid. art. 612. The latter article, titled \"[w]riting used to refresh memory[,]\" provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Civil cases.\n   </strong>\n   In a civil case, any writing, recording, or object may be used by a witness to refresh his memory while testifying. If a witness asserts that his memory is refreshed he must then testify from memory independent of the writing, recording, or object. If, before or during testimony, a witness has used or uses a writing, recording, or object to refresh his memory for the purpose of testifying in court, an adverse party is entitled, subject to Paragraph C, to have the writing, recording, or object produced, if practicable, at the hearing, to inspect it, to examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness.

The plaintiff instead explained as follows in an exchange with counsel at the time of the deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Q What was it, if you know, that caused you to fall? That is - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   A Well, the - - like I say, it had to be that hard little rubber ball that was\n   in the floor or it could have been the door stop.

In neither passage was she able to differentiate between the two. And, as revealed in the reasons for ruling, the trial court found that inability fatal to the plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   On this latter point, the trial court explained that, while there was discussion of the presence of the wooden wedge and that it belonged to the Mall, the trial court determined that: \"Plaintiff failed to prove the wedge caused her fall. To the contrary, she admitted she did not know what caused her fall, only that two objects, a wedge and a ball like object were observed near where she fell.\" And, \"[m]oreover, even if one were to assume one of the objects caused the fall (which assumption would be improper considering Plaintiff's burden of proof), Plaintiff failed to prove the condition existed for some time before the fall and failed to carry the burden of proving constructive notice as mandated by the statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As discussed below, both of these findings are supported by the record. Accordingly, even if upon a finding that the trial court's evidentiary ruling was in error, it was not one dictating a different outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matranga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867160\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/1077/#p1089\">\n    170 So.3d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   This assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Burden of Proof\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   By her final assignment of error, the plaintiff suggests that the trial court was manifestly erroneous in determining that she failed to meet her burden of proof and particularly questions the trial court's determination that she \"did not know what caused her fall, only that two objects, a wedge and a ball like object were observed near where she fell.\" The plaintiff pointedly suggests that \"there is ample evidence that Appellant slipped on one (1), if not both, of the two (2) small objects[,]\" and, further, that \"the record is clear that the presence of the wooden wedge\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the small red ball/toy on the ground in the entranceway resulted from Acadiana Mall'[s] wrongful conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In pertinent part, La.R.S. 9:2800.6 provides a plaintiff's \"[b]urden of proof in claims against merchants\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A. A merchant owes a duty to persons who use his premises to exercise reasonable care to keep his aisles, passageways, and floors in a reasonably safe condition.

In a negligence claim brought against a merchant by a person lawfully on the merchant's premises for damages as a result of an injury, death, or loss sustained because of a fall due to a condition existing in or on a merchant's premises, the claimant shall have the burden of proving, in addition to all other elements of his cause of action, all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   (1) The condition presented an unreasonable risk of harm to the claimant and that risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (2) The merchant either created or had actual or constructive notice of the condition which caused the damage, prior to the occurrence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   (3) The merchant failed to exercise reasonable care. In determining reasonable care, the absence of a written or verbal uniform cleanup or safety procedure is insufficient, alone, to prove failure to exercise reasonable care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   C. Definitions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   (1) \"Constructive notice\" means the claimant has proven that the condition existed for such a period of time that it would have been discovered if the merchant had exercised reasonable care. The presence of an employee of the merchant in the vicinity in which the condition exists does not, alone, constitute constructive notice, unless it is shown that the employee knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Given the statute's inclusion of mandatory language, a plaintiff seeking relief under La.R.S. 9:2800.6\"must [ ] prove each of the enumerated requirements of Section (B).\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

Rather, the plaintiff alternatively suggests that the wooden wedge, the ball, or both objects caused her fall. She reported at trial that she saw neither object beforehand, but found both after her fall. Nor did any other witness identify such causation, let alone one attributable to the Mall. Given that equivocation, the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in determining that the plaintiff failed to sustain her burden of proving causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Neither was the trial court erroneous in concluding that the plaintiff failed to prove that the Mall had constructive notice of the alleged condition causing the accident. In this regard, the supreme court has specially instructed that La.R.S. 9:2800.6(C)(1) includes a temporal element requiring a plaintiff to \"make a positive showing of the existence of the condition prior to the fall.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11918756\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/699/1081/#p1084\">\n    699 So.2d at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, it was the location of the wedge on the floor that arguably created the cited harm. No testimony identified how the wedge came to be located on the floor.
