These were not preliminary questions, but were inculpatory, as defendant had already specifically been pointed out as likely to have drugs on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When asked if defendant was Mirandized before or after the inculpatory question was asked, the officer who gave the warning replied, \"I'm not sure.\" As noted by the trial court, \"That's kind of a biggy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because the state has failed to carry its burden under\n   <em>\n    Miranda,\n   </em>\n   the trial court's ruling suppressing defendant's statement and evidence derived therefrom should be reinstated.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
