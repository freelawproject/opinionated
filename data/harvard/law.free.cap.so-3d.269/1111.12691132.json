R.S. 40:967(A) ; two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A) ; two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of La.

We subsequently issued a per curiam order, remanding the matter to the trial court to hold a hearing to determine whether defendant's pleas were knowingly and voluntarily made. Specifically, this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Our independent review of the record reflects a potential issue for appeal not addressed by counsel in her\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief. The record reflects that the trial judge imposed an illegally lenient sentence on defendant's convictions for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1. As stated above, the trial court sentenced defendant to fifteen years at hard labor for each of his felon in possession of a firearm convictions in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1, with only the first ten years of each sentence to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence However, La. R.S. 14:95.1 requires that the entirety of a defendant's sentence be imposed without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La R.S. 14:95.1 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

During defendant's\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy, the trial court advised defendant as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Court:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   You understand that at the end of your guilty plea it's my intention to sentence you to 15 years at hard labor in the Department of Correction.

Following supplementation of the appellate record with the transcript of the January 24, 2019 hearing, defendant filed a motion to dismiss his appeal in this Court.
