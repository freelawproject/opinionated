Claire Flowers and Brenda Jane Flowers Paixao (Jane) appeal the final judgment entered by the Leflore County Chancery Court in the probate of the estate of their father, Richard Harold Flowers Jr.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On appeal, Claire and Jane assert the following assignments of error: (1) their brother, Knox Lemee Flowers, lacked standing to be named executor of Richard's estate; (2) the chancellor's final decree failed to follow Richard's intent as expressed in his will; (3) the chancellor erred in awarding attorneys' fees to Knox's attorneys; (4) the chancellor erred by denying Claire and Jane's Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) motion to amend their petition. We find no abuse of discretion by the chancellor, and we therefore affirm.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nichols v. Phillips (In re Estate of Brill)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7024486\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/76/695/#p698\">\n    76 So.3d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 698 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On December 19, 2001, the Leflore County Chancery Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appointed Brenda Bargas Flowers to represent her husband, Richard Flowers Jr., as his conservator\n   due to Richard's physical and mental incapacity and inability to manage his affairs and his estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On December 14, 2005, Richard and Brenda filed a petition to adopt D.A.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the biological child of Richard and Brenda's daughter, Claire. The chancellor granted the petition on December 15, 2005, and entered an order of adoption, stating that D.A.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   be, and he is hereby decreed to be, the child of [Richard and Brenda], who shall have the exclusive custody of [D.A.], and equal parental rights, duties and responsibilities of and toward him to the extent they both were his natural parents with all the incidents, mutual rights, privileges, benefits, duties and responsibilities arising from a natural born parent and child relationship[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The order also provided that D.A. \"shall inherit from and through\" Richard and Brenda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5. Sadly, the record reflects that on April 25, 2006, a few months after adopting D.A., Richard died. In his last will and testament, dated January 21, 1983, Richard named his widow, Brenda, as the executor of the estate. Brenda filed a petition to probate the will, and on July 14, 2006, the chancellor appointed Brenda as executor of Richard's estate. Regarding the appointment of alternate executors, Richard's will specified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [I]f [Brenda] fails to qualify or ceases to act, I appoint as executrix of this will my wife's biological mother, Helen Audry Creasay Baker, to serve ..., or should she fail to qualify or cease to act[,] I appoint as executor of this will The First Greenwood Bank, a Branch of Grenada Bank, in Greenwood, Mississippi[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6. Richard left to Brenda all of his \"clothing and personal effects, all boats, boat trailers, boat motors, and all automobiles and vehicles\" registered in his name, and stock, among other things. Richard expressed in his will that he made no disposition of household furniture or chattels located in his and Brenda's residence, as the items also belonged to Brenda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7. Significant to the issues raised in this appeal, Richard further devised all of his \"residuary estate, being all property, real and personal, wherever situated, in which [he] may have any interest at the time of [his] death not otherwise effectively disposed of ... to Brenda ... should she survive [him] for a period of 179 days[.]\" Richard's will explained that should Brenda fail to survive Richard for 179 days, the property would then be held in a trust for his son, Knox; daughter, Claire; and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   any other child or children\n   <strong>\n    born\n   </strong>\n   to my wife, Brenda[,] ... and me, in such proportions and in such manner as my trustee shall deem necessary or desirable in their absolute discretion, for the beneficiaries' health, education, welfare, support and maintenance in their accustomed manner of living.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8. Richard's will further provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This Trust shall exist until the youngest living child of mine and my wife attains the age of twenty-five years, at which time the trust will terminate and all the remaining assets of this Trust shall be conveyed and delivered, to my children, Claire Clements Flowers, Knox Lemee[ ] Flowers and any other child or\n   children\n   <strong>\n    born\n   </strong>\n   to my wife, Brenda Bargas Flowers, and me, in equal shares, per stirpes[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9. Brenda began her duties as executor after her appointment on July 14, 2006. However, Brenda died on August 25, 2006, approximately 122 days after Richard's death. Brenda's will named Knox as the executor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10. On September 6, 2006, Knox filed a petition for appointment as Executor De Bonis Non with Will Annexed (hereafter \"Executor\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his petition, Knox acknowledged that Richard's will named Brenda as executor of Richard's estate. Due to Brenda's death, Knox requested to be substituted as Executor of Richard's estate. Knox also filed a petition to probate Brenda's estate and requested that a guardian ad litem be appointed for D.A., who was two years old at the time of the filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11. The record reflects that while Knox served as Executor of Richard's estate, the chancellor approved and authorized Knox's sale of real property owned by Richard's estate as follows: (1) a May 16, 2008 order approving the sale by Knox of real property located at 304 East Monroe Street, Greenwood, Mississippi, for the amount of $65,000, less the prorated taxes for the year 2008, a six-percent commission to Bowie Realty in the amount of $3,900, and a termite inspection in the amount of $107; (2) a September 11, 2009 order approving the sale of real property located at 306 West Church, Greenwood, Mississippi, for the amount of $20,200 and authorizing the execution of any and all documents necessary to complete the sale, less the prorated taxes for the year 2009 in the amount of $1,225.32, and a six-percent commission to Bowie Realty in the amount of $1,212. The record shows that all of the beneficiaries of Richard's will received notice of the sale of the real property. The chancellor then ordered Knox, as Executor, to deposit the balance of the funds in the estate account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12. Additionally, in his capacity as Executor of Richard's estate, and again with notice to all of the intended beneficiaries named in Richard's will, Knox liquidated Richard's investment account and deposited the balance of the funds in the estate account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13. The record reflects that during the course of the lengthy litigation below, Claire filed several motions relating to Richard's estate, including a December 2007 motion seeking a full accounting of Richard's estate and Brenda's estate, and a January 2008 motion to disqualify Knox as the Executor. The chancellor addressed all of Claire's motions in an order dated February 8, 2008. The chancellor ultimately ordered as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The Conservatorship [of Richard by Brenda] is terminated and closed[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Knox, as Executor of [Brenda's Estate], ... will list the household goods and personal belongings of Brenda ..., as well as lockbox contents that came into his possession as Executor and will state where these items are presently located, and any items converted to his personal possession or disposed of for his benefit will be noted and charged against any Executor's fee, as may be determined and approved by this Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Knox, as Executor of [Brenda's Estate], shall furnish an accounting of the Estate from the date of death to the date of any final decree granting [Claire] Guardianship of [D.A.] due to the appeal on file at this time ... and that [Claire] is entitled to an accounting, if and when she becomes a vested remainder beneficiary of this estate from the date of such vesting until delivery of assets to her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [T]he probated claim of [Claire] ... is granted in the amount of $1,200.00 and this court authorizes and directs [Knox] to pay said sum in full satisfaction of the probated claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The record also reflects that in the February 2008 order, the chancellor granted Claire \"leave to withdraw her Petition for Disqualification of [Knox as the] Executor (Fiduciary) dated January 28, 2008,\" and ruled that \"it is therefore withdrawn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 14. Claire later filed a motion requesting that the chancellor recuse himself, claiming that she discovered evidence of judicial misconduct. The chancellor denied Claire's motion, stating that Claire failed to present any facts to substantiate her allegations. The chancellor also admonished Claire \"for bringing frivolous motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 15. On September 4, 2009, Claire filed her second motion for disqualification of Knox as executor of Richard's estate, arguing that Knox failed to follow the instructions of Richard's will since no residuary or assets passed to Claire or Knox as bequeathed in Richard's will. Relative to this claim, the record reflects that the chancellor found that no assets remained to pass to the beneficiaries of Richard's will. Claire further asserted that Richard's will provided that an accounting shall be done by the executor and given to the heirs once a year. Claire claimed that Knox failed to provide an accounting as requested by the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 16. Claire also argued that Richard's will provided that Brenda is to be named executor, and that if Brenda should fail to qualify as executor, then Richard's will named Brenda's mother, Helen Baker, as the alternate executor. Claire claimed that Helen informed Claire that she was never approached to be executor of Richard's will and did not know that Richard named her as an alternate executor in his will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 17. The chancellor held a hearing on the matter on September 11, 2009, and ultimately denied Claire's motion to disqualify Knox as Executor. The chancellor found that Claire presented no facts to substantiate her claims that Knox should be disqualified as Executor. The chancellor also found that Claire's motion was \"substantially the same petition and claims as ... filed ... on January 28, 2008, by Claire, and was set to be heard on February 1, 2008, when [Claire] was granted leave of the court to withdrawn her petition.\" As a result, the chancellor admonished Claire for bringing repetitive and frivolous motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 18. Over the next several years, Claire filed numerous petitions revolving around the care and adoption of D.A. On August 19, 2013, the chancellor entered a decree of adoption stating \"[D.A.], a child born on July 10, 2004, be and is hereby adjudged\n   and declared to be adopted by [his paternal grandparents,] ... Cecil Carter Lang and wife, Linda S. Lang, and that the said child and the [Langs] be given and accorded all of the rights, benefits and responsibilities arising from a natural born parent and child relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 19. On April 15, 2015, Claire filed a petition for a full accounting, asserting again that she believed that Knox misappropriated funds and chattels belonging to Richard's estate, and that Knox mismanaged the estate to the detriment of the heirs and against the instructions of Richard's will. As stated, Claire's claims of mismanagement stem from the lack of sufficient assets in Richard's estate to pass to the will's beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20. The record reflects that on September 15, 2015, Claire, acting pro se, filed a 616-page pleading in the trial court challenging prior rulings and raising various claims for relief. In this 616-page pleading, Claire set forth petitions for the following: (1) a trial by jury, (2) a change of venue, (3) relief from the judgments, and (4) requested compensatory and punitive damages. Claire named her sister, Jane, as an interested party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21. In this 616-page pleading, Claire set forth her petition for relief from the judgments, claiming that she was entitled to relief from the prior orders of the chancellor, including the final decree of adoption of D.A., due to fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, and misconduct by numerous parties, including Knox, Floyd Melton Jr. and Floyd Melton III (Knox's attorneys), Cecil and Linda Lang, and Richard A. Oakes Jr. (attorney for the Langs). Claire asserted that the numerous chancellors assigned to this action acted\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   in ways prejudicial to the administration of justice and to the ideas of \"fair\" hearings. The [d]efendants, including the chancellors, intentionally made their actions and inactions so convoluted between the cases to ensure that no one would be inclined to assist Claire with correcting the great injustice that has occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 22. In this same petition for relief from the judgments, Claire further asserted that Oakes and the Langs were brought into these cases to ensure that D.A. was kept away from her, and to \"ensure that their own pockets were lined with funds 'legally obtained' through the court, a court which was prejudicial and unable to provide the appropriate administration of justice.\" Claire also alleged that the Langs and Oakes ensured the Langs would wrongfully obtain Social Security death benefits on behalf of D.A. by keeping his last name as Flowers and not notifying Social Security of the adoption of D.A. in August 2013. Finally, Claire alleged that Oakes was in direct violation of Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 23. In her petition for compensatory and punitive damages, also set forth in the 616-page pleading, Claire claimed that she suffered the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [P]hysical, emotional, and monetary damages as a direct result of the actions and inactions of the [d]efendants (excluding Brenda Jane Paixao, D.A., and Christopher Lang) ... [and she] is entitled to an award of compensatory and punitive damages for fraud, negligence, negligence per se, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress, conversion, civil conspiracy, and malice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 24. On January 4, 2016, Claire filed an amended petition for compensatory and punitive damages, which constituted part of the 616-page pleading, claiming that the proximate consequences of the defendants' negligence or wantonness, jointly and severally, caused Claire to suffer physical and emotional injuries and monetary damages. On January 8, 2016, Claire filed a motion for leave to admit an amended petition for compensatory and punitive damages, part of the 616-page pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 25. On January 19, 2016, the chancellor held a hearing on Oakes's Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Claire's 616-page pleading. Oakes argued that \"[n]owhere in [Claire's] petition does anything come anywhere close to pleading fraud with the degree of specificity required to survive a Motion to Dismiss.\" The chancellor issued a bench ruling granting Oakes's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The chancellor also granted Oakes's and the Meltons' motions to strike themselves as defendants in the cause due to Claire's failure to obtain leave from the court under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 21 to add them as defendants. The chancellor advised Claire to file a written motion \"to add Oakes or whoever as a defendant.\" The record reflects that Claire filed no appeal of the chancellor's rulings regarding the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss or motion to strike. Thus, Oakes and the Meltons were stricken as defendants from this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26. On February 16, 2016, in response to the chancellor's order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), Claire filed a Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) motion for leave to amend her 616-page pleading. In her motion, Claire stated that she \"specifically requests that she be allowed to amend those portions of the complaints by which the court ruled were insufficient at stating a claim for relief. Those portions include stating fraud and negligence per se with the correct specificity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27. On February 26, 2016, Oakes filed a response to Claire's Rule 15(a) motion for leave to amend her 616-page pleading, requesting that Claire's motion be denied. Oakes argued that Claire failed to \"attach a proposed amended petition that would permit the chancellor to determine whether justice requires that leave to amend be granted.\" Oakes further stated that he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   was dismissed as a respondent in the above captioned causes as a result of [Claire's] failure to obtain leave of court to add him as a party. Even if the [c]ourt were to grant [Claire's] motion to allow her to amend her petitions, such amendments would have no effect on [Oakes] as he has been dismissed as a respondent and he would not be reinstated as such simply by [Claire] amending her petitions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The record shows that the additional defendants listed in Claire's 616-page pleading also joined Oakes's motion requesting that the chancellor deny Claire leave to amend her pleading. At a hearing held on March 30, 2016, the chancellor denied Claire's motion to amend her pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 28. On March 31, 2016 (filed on May 6, 2016), the chancellor entered his final decree, drawing a conclusion to the lengthy litigation below. In his final decree, the chancellor provided in his findings that \"on August 25, 2006, Brenda Bargas Flowers died and Knox Lemee[ ] Flowers was properly appointed Executor to serve without bond, inventory, appraisal and accounting to any court on September 6, 2006.\" The chancellor also held that Knox's fee for acting as Executor was required to be determined by Brenda's estate, as \"there [were] no assets left\" in Richard's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 29. The record reflects that in the text of the final decree, the chancellor expressly\n   identified the bank records and expenditures. The chancellor also expressly set forth an accounting of the estate's debts and assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 30. Additionally, in the final decree, the chancellor awarded Melton Law Firm \"reasonable attorney's fees\" for services rendered, and held that \"the fee for Melton Law Firm ... is to be determined [by Brenda's Estate] as there are no assets left\" in Richard's estate. The chancellor also awarded Orsborn, Sutphen, and O'Neal reasonable accounting fees for services rendered, and again stated that the fee would be determined by Brenda's estate, as no assets remained in Richard's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 31. The chancellor recognized that while Brenda briefly served as executor of Richard's estate upon her appointment on July 14, 2006, she (as executor) advanced personal funds to pay obligations of Richard's estate. The chancellor reviewed the amounts provided, and he found that these amounts were advanced and expended by Brenda in her capacity as executor to pay legitimate expenses of Richard's estate and thus constituted debts to Brenda's estate. As a result, the chancellor held that Brenda's estate was entitled to be reimbursed from the funds remaining in Richard's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 32. Since Richard's estate lacked assets, the chancellor found moot the issue of whether Brenda and D.A. would be entitled to a widow's allowance or minor's allowance, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Brenda ... is entitled to a widow's allowance and [D.A.], the surviving minor child of Richard ..., is entitled to a minor's allowance in an amount to be determined by this court. [However,] the Court makes no ruling on the widow's allowance nor the minor's allowance as there are no funds left in the Estate from which to pay such allowances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 33. The chancellor then ratified the petition to close Richard's estate, and the chancellor held that no further accounting by Knox as Executor was necessary. The chancellor denied Claire's motion to perfect an inventory and to produce vouchers. The chancellor held that \"the [e]state has produced all accountings and documents necessary to satisfy this court that all moneys and assets of the estate have been properly expended and accounted for.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 34. On May 6 and on May 9, 2016, the chancellor denied Claire's motions for leave to amend in accordance with Rule 15(a) as to the Meltons, Oakes, and Waldo Sterling Stuckey Jr. In all three orders on the matter, the chancellor explained: \"[T]he motion filed by [Claire] fails to state how she would amend her prior pleadings or fails to attach a proposed amended pleading which would allow the court to determine whether justice required that she be given leave to file amended pleadings[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 35. Claire and Jane now appeal, raising four assignments of error, which we address in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 36. Chancellors are \"entitled to deferential review in matters involving questions of fact\"; and when reviewing a chancellor's findings of fact, this Court applies a manifest-error standard.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Brill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7024486\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/76/695/#p698\">\n    76 So.3d at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 13). We review a chancellor's legal findings de novo.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7024486\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/76/695/#p698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Knox as Executor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 37. Claire and Jane argue on appeal that Richard failed to name Knox as\n   executor in his will. As a result, Claire and Jane assert that Knox should never have been named executor of Richard's estate. Claire and Jane claim that due to the chancellor's error in appointing Knox as executor, \"every single action [Knox] took was void.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 38. Claire and Jane also argue that Knox breached his fiduciary duty to administer the estate. Claire and Jane state that Claire failed to receive any money from Richard's estate, contrary to Richard's intent as expressed in his will. Upon review of this case on appeal, we address Claire and Jane's argument regarding Richard's testamentary intent, the accounting of Richard's estate, and the assets of the estate at length later in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 39. First, we will solely address Claire and Jane's assignment of error asserting that the chancellor abused his discretion in appointing Knox as Executor of Richard's estate. As stated, Richard's will named Brenda as his primary executor, with his mother-in-law, Helen Baker, and The First Greenwood Bank, listed as alternate executors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Richard died, the chancellor admitted Richard's will to probate and appointed Brenda as executor of Richard's estate on July 14, 2006, in accordance with Richard's will. Brenda began performing her duties as executor upon her appointment, as evidenced by her payment toward debts of Richard's estate. After probate began on Richard's estate, and after Brenda's death, Knox separately petitioned the court on September 6, 2006, to be appointed as both the executor of Brenda's estate and as Executor of Richard's estate. In his petition, Knox acknowledged that Richard's will named Brenda as Executor of Richard's estate, but since Brenda died, Knox requested to be substituted as Executor of Richard's estate. The chancellor then appointed Knox as Executor of Brenda's estate and also as Executor of Richard's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 40. The record reflects that in January 2008, less than a year and a half after Knox's appointment, Claire filed her first motion to disqualify Knox as Executor of Richard's estate. The record shows that in an order entered in February 2008, the chancellor granted Claire \"leave to withdraw her Petition for Disqualification of Executor (Fiduciary) dated January 28, 2008,\" and ruled that \"it is therefore withdrawn.\" On September 4, 2009, Claire filed another motion to disqualify Knox as executor.

If the nominee accepts the appointment under the will, and does not waive his rights by failing to take the proper steps as required by statute for proving the will, the court must, after proper proceedings, appoint him to the office unless he be shown to be incompetent or disqualified for some legal cause.

The record reflects that over the years, Claire filed several petitions wherein she indeed raised the issue of Knox's qualifications and the propriety of his appointment to the consideration of the chancellor-one in January 2008, and a second in September 2009.

Upon review, we find that the chancellor was within his discretion to award attorneys' fees to Melton Law Firm, as well as executor's fees to Knox.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9193594\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/878/1052/#p1057\">\n    878 So.2d at 1057-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 22) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2091-7-261\">\n    Miss.

Finally, Claire and Jane appeal the denial of Claire's motion for leave to admit her amended petition for compensatory and punitive damages. Claire and\n   Jane argue that leave to amend should have been granted because none of the respondents asserted that they would be prejudiced if the motion were granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 60. In her amended petition, Claire sought to include claims against the various attorneys involved in the representation of Richard's estate, Brenda's estate, and the guardianship of D.A. At a hearing on Claire's motion, the chancellor made a bench ruling wherein he granted Oakes's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Claire's petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The chancellor also granted Oakes's and the Meltons' (among others) motions to strike themselves as defendants in the cause due to Claire's failure to obtain leave from the court under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 21 to add them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 61. As stated, in response to the chancellor's order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), on February 16, 2016, Claire filed a motion for leave to amend her petition for compensatory and punitive damages, and her amended petition for compensatory and punitive damages in accordance with Rule 15(a). In her motion, Claire stated that she \"specifically requests that she be allowed to amend those portions of the complaints by which the court ruled were insufficient at stating a claim for relief. Those portions include stating fraud and negligence per se with the correct specificity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 62. The defendants listed in Claire's petition joined Oakes's motion requesting that Claire's motion for leave to amend be denied. The defendants argued that Claire failed to \"attach a proposed amended petition that would permit the chancellor to determine whether justice requires that leave to amend be granted\" and that the parties were \"dismissed as [respondents] ... as a result of [Claire's] failure to obtain leave of court to add [them] as part[ies].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 63.

In his order denying Claire's motion for leave to amend in accordance with Rule 15(a), the chancellor explained the following: \"[T]he motion filed by [Claire] fails to state how she would amend her prior pleadings or fails to attach a proposed amended pleading which would allow the court to determine whether justice required that she be given leave to file amended pleadings[.]\" The record reflects that the motion to amend filed by Claire contained only bare allegations and contained no facts or actions from which to determine the existence of a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 9(b) (providing that fraud must be pled with specificity);\n   <em>\n    Faul v.

No general averment of a fraudulent course of business, and no bare statement of a corrupt design on the part of the defendant, is sufficient. The acts themselves which are claimed to be fraudulent must be clearly set out. It must further appear by definite averment in what manner the fraudulent acts wrought injury to the complainant.

Furthermore, as previously stated, the record also shows that Oakes, Stuckey, Melton Jr., and Melton III were dismissed from the litigation as defendants because Claire failed to obtain leave of court before she added the attorneys as parties as required by Rule 21.
