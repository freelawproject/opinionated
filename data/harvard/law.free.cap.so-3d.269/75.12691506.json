Richard Lamar Green (\"Green\") was convicted in the Circuit Court of Rankin County for the attempted murder and kidnapping of his wife, Cathleen Green (\"Cathy\"). Green appeals his convictions, arguing that the State presented insufficient evidence to convict him of both counts. The Court finds that a reasonable juror could have found that the State had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of both convictions based on the testimony, evidence, and applicable law. We affirm Green's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Green and Cathy had been arguing for a few days. Cathy wanted a divorce because she was ready to be with someone else. Green found Cathy's phone and demanded that she unlock it, but she refused. Green became so agitated by Cathy's refusal that he walked outside and retrieved a machete from the toolbox of his vehicle. He then walked back inside and into the bedroom where Cathy and their four-year-old son were watching cartoons. Green removed Cathy from her bed, separating her from their child. Cathy threw her phone to the child and told him to call 911. Green dragged Cathy out of the bedroom and away from her son. He then forcibly dragged her down the hall, leaving bruises up and down her arms. Cathy was kicking and flailing as she tried to free herself from Green's grip, but he would not release her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Upon reaching the living room (and out of their child's sight), Green repeatedly struck Cathy in the head with the machete. She tried to defend herself and received defensive wounds in the process. Cathy was screaming, asking Green, \"stop, stop, what are you doing?\" Green told Cathy, \"I'm going to kill you with this machete.\" She was rendered helpless on the living room floor. When Green came back past her, Green told their son, \"don't\n   look at mommy.\" Cathy began pleading for her life. She told Green, \"I'm your wife. What have you done? I have kids. I only have so much time. I only have so much blood. You've got to do something now that you've done this.\" Green just looked at her, put his head in his hands and said, \"I'm going to have to kill myself now.\" Cathy was left motionless, grew cold, and her bowels emptied. Green walked over her and out the front door, locking the door behind him. He also took all the cell phones from the house. Then, son in tow, he fled. Instead of killing himself, Green called 911 to report what he had done to Cathy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The first officer to arrive was able to see Cathy lying on the floor behind the locked door. Other officers arrived to the scene and broke the window to enter. Cathy's face was covered in blood. Blood spatters covered the walls and a large amount of blood surrounded Cathy. Cathy's right pinky finger had been severed and was lying to the left side of her body. The officer testified that seeing all of her wounds was difficult because of the excessive blood, but that he could see that she had one laceration on her forehead and another behind her head. He also observed hair and brain matter on the floor around her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Cathy was in and out of consciousness. She was able to tell the officers that \"Richie\" had caused the injuries with a machete, and that he had left with their son. The Pearl Police Department issued a county-wide be-on-the-lookout (\"BOLO\") notice for Green's vehicle, and a state-wide BOLO was dispatched. An investigator arrived, took photographs, and collected blood samples. He also observed pools of blood, hair, and brain matter on the carpet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Green later was apprehended in Pike County and returned to the Pearl police station. Green was read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, which he, orally and in writing, agreed to waive. Green then confessed. The confession was recorded and played for the jury at trial. Cathy testified live. Her testimony corroborated Green's confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Cathy was hospitalized for one week and then was transferred to a rehabilitation center for four weeks. Cathy's skull was shattered, and part of it was missing. The cranium had been broken in a complex fashion and depressed against her brain. The inner lining of Cathy's skull was damaged, and her brain itself had been damaged. She also had brain matter in her wounds. Cathy received fifty staples on the crown of her head. Part of her head tissue died. Cathy also had sustained a cut that extended halfway down her face. Her eye socket was fractured, and a piece of her nose had been cut off. Cathy's pinky finger was amputated, and each of the tendons in one hand had been cut. Her ring finger also was broken. Cathy sustained cuts down her back and bruises down her neck and behind her ear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Green was indicted for the attempted murder and kidnapping of Cathy. At trial, the law-enforcement officers, 911 operator, Cathy, and Cathy's treating physician testified. After the State rested, Green moved for a directed verdict. Green argued that the State had failed to prove all of the necessary elements for the charge of attempted murder. Specifically, Green argued that he had abandoned his attempt to murder Cathy because he called 911. Additionally, Green argued that no evidence was produced to support the charge of kidnapping. Instead, Green argued that what took place was merely a\n   struggle that proceeded from one room to another. Despite evidence to the contrary, Green further claimed that he never restrained Cathy or kept her from leaving. The trial court denied Green's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. The jury found Green guilty, as charged in the indictment, of attempted murder in Count I and of kidnapping in Count II. The jury unanimously sentenced Green to life imprisonment on Count I. The jury was unable to agree on a penalty for Count II. The trial judge held a sentencing hearing on Count II and sentenced Green to a term of thirty years to be served consecutively with the sentence in Count I in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Green filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\"), or alternatively, a motion for a new trial. Green argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, reasserting his arguments that he had abandoned any attempt to murder Cathy and that he had not kidnapped Cathy. The trial judge denied Green's motion. Aggrieved, Green appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. Green does not challenge the weight of the evidence. Rather, Green challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, raising two issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I. Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to convict Green of kidnapping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II. Whether the State presented sufficient evidence to convict Green of attempted murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12. In considering whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction, this Court employs a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

Green argues that the State failed to produce sufficient evidence to support his kidnapping conviction and asks this Court to reverse that conviction and to render a judgment of acquittal in his favor. Mississippi Code Section 97-3-53 defines kidnapping as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Any person who, without lawful authority and with or without intent to secretly confine, shall forcibly seize and confine any other person, or shall inveigle or kidnap any other person with intent to cause such person to be confined or imprisoned against his or her will[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-53\">\n    Miss.

Green argues that any kidnapping was incidental to the \"alleged assault\" against Cathy, and that, if this Court affirms\n   his conviction, \"a kidnapping charge could be brought concurrently to every single assault.\" Curiously, Green cites\n   <em>\n    Cuevas v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n    338 So.2d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1238 (Miss. 1976), in support of his argument. In\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   , a Scott County prisoner confronted a jailer with a pistol and forced him to accompany him downstairs to the sheriff's office at gunpoint.\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n    338 So.2d at 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

An illustration might well be a strong-armed robbery where the victim is detained and perhaps moved a few feet while being relieved of his wallet. The detention and movement would not support kidnapping albeit with force and unlawful. On the other hand, if the confinement or asportation be not merely incidental to a lesser crime, but a constituent part of the greater crime, the fact of confinement or asportation is sufficient to support kidnapping without regard to distance moved or time of confinement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n    at 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   Court concluded that the prisoner's purpose in \"seizing and detaining [the hostage] was obviously to make good his escape.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The confinement and movement of [the hostage] by force from the service entrance of the building to the parts department of the building was sufficiently proved to support Cuevas' conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n    at 1238-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15. Green's argument that his kidnapping conviction should be reversed under\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   is without merit. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]f forcible detention or movement is merely incidental to a\n   <em>\n    lesser\n   </em>\n   crime than kidnapping, such confinement or movement is insufficient to be molded into the\n   <em>\n    greater\n   </em>\n   crime of kidnapping.\"\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n    338 So.2d at 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). At the outset, there was no \"lesser crime\" than kidnapping in this case. Attempted murder is a \"greater\" crime than kidnapping under Mississippi's sentencing guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the jury was not presented with evidence that would show the kidnapping was \"merely incidental\" to the attempted murder of Cathy. Rather, the jury was presented with testimony and evidence demonstrating that the kidnapping was a separate, independent crime. Green confessed that he did not use the machete to hack or slash Cathy until after he had removed her from the bed and dragged her, fighting and screaming, down the hall and into another room, outside the presence of the child. The forcible seizure, removal, and asportation of Cathy against her will was a separate, distinct, and independent crime that occurred prior to Green's attempt to murder Cathy. Following\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   , the distance of asportation or\n   time of confinement is immaterial.\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n    338 So.2d at 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16. Green acknowledges that\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   is the majority rule. Notwithstanding, Green argues that we should apply law from other jurisdictions\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and adopt a Mississippi Court of Appeals dissent from\n   <em>\n    Salter v.

The Court of Appeals majority, citing this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   , held that, by ordering the employees into the bank vault against their will, the defendant fulfilled the statutory definition of kidnapping, and that the distance of asportation was not important.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376639\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/876/412/#p417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The dissent opined that \"the better view to me is that telling people to move around inside the bank, even into the bank vault, did not have significance independent of the bank robbery itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376639\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/876/412/#p417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376639\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/876/412/#p417\">\n    at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Southwick, P.J., dissenting). Although the defendant's act of forcing the employees into a bank vault at gunpoint \"did not have significance\" to the dissenting author, we surmise that it was a significant, terrifying experience for the bank employees.

The jury heard testimony that Green intended to murder Cathy and that Green took action to carry out the crime, well beyond mere preparation, by repeatedly striking her with a machete.

The detention and movement would not support kidnapping albeit with force and unlawful. On the other hand, if the confinement or asportation be not merely incidental to a lesser crime, but a constituent part of the greater crime, the fact of confinement or asportation is sufficient to support kidnapping without regard to distance moved or time of confinement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9685391\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/1236/#p1238\">\n    338 So.2d at 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 29. Green's case is akin to the strong-armed robbery illustration in\n   <em>\n    Cuevas\n   </em>\n   . Here, Green did not remove Cathy from her house or transport her to any location outside of her own house. The Model Penal Code states that \"a person is guilty of kidnapping\n   <em>\n    if he unlawfully removes another from his place of residence\n   </em>\n   or business, or\n   <em>\n    a substantial distance\n   </em>\n   from the vicinity where he is found, or if he unlawfully confines another for\n   <em>\n    a substantial period\n   </em>\n   in a place of isolation ....\" Model Penal Code \u00a7 212.1 (Am. Law Inst. 2017) (emphasis added). Similarly, after an analysis of kidnapping laws in numerous jurisdictions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit determined that four factors are used in each approach to kidnapping:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (1) the duration of the detention or asportation; (2) whether the detention or asportation occurred during the commission of a separate offense; (3) whether\n   the detention or asportation which occurred is inherent in the separate offense; and (4) whether the asportation or detention created a significant danger to the victim independent of that posed by the separate offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Gov't of Virgin Islands v. Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22714\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/604/221/#p227\">\n    604 F.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227 (3d Cir. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 30. The instant case involves no substantial duration of detention or asportation. Green's act of moving Cathy to the living room also created no significant danger to Cathy independent of Green's attempt to murder her. In fact, Green stated that when he became agitated with Cathy, he first went to his truck to retrieve his machete; he then came back into the house and commenced his assault on Cathy. Therefore, although the majority reasons that Green began his assault on Cathy only after the asportation was complete, Green already had commenced his attempted murder on Cathy when he walked into the house to the bedroom where Cathy was located. Because Green's removal of Cathy to the living room and his assault of Cathy are so interwoven, I believe that the removal was merely incidental to the attempted murder of Cathy. Accordingly, I would hold that, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence was insufficient to support Green's kidnapping conviction. I would affirm his conviction of attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   WALLER, C.J., AND KITCHENS, P.J., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
