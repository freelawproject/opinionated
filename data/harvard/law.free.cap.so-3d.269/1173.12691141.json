Chase\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter involves a dispute over damages awarded as a result of a personal injury incident. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (hereinafter \"Lloyd's of London\"), the excess insurer, challenges the amount of damages the trial court awarded for past medical expenses. The plaintiffs answer on appeal, contesting certain elements of the trial court's award. After consideration of the record before this Court, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Joseph McCloskey, Matthew Squyres and Allen Roberts were involved in an automobile accident on July 9, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While traveling westbound on Interstate 10, in St. Bernard Parish, plaintiffs' vehicle was rear ended by a truck owned by Higman Barge Lines, Inc. After granting plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, the trial court reserved the issues of causation and damages for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A five day bench trial began on December 11, 2017. On the last day of trial, Diagnostic Management Affiliates, Preferred Provider Organization, LLC (hereinafter \"DMA\"), a non-party, filed a motion to quash a trial subpoena issued to DMA. In the alternative, DMA sought a protective order. Specifically, DMA requested that the trial court preclude testimony and production of documentation, sought by Lloyd's of London, regarding payments between DMA and its contracted physicians. A hearing was held January 16, 2018, on the motion to quash. By judgment dated January 31, 2018, the trial court granted DMA's motion finding testimony and production of documentation from DMA is precluded by the collateral source rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After taking the merits of the matter under advisement, the trial court entered judgment on August 2, 2018, in favor of plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the trial court's award is as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. McCloskey, Jr.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Past medical expenses .....................$ 462,296.33\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Future medical expenses ..................$ 453,281.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Past wages .........................$ 33,381.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Future wages .........................$ 156,245.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   General damages .........................$ 1,600,000.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Squyres\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Past medical expenses ......................$ 170,641.56\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Future medical expenses ...................$ 35,000.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Past wages .........................$ 0\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Future wages .........................$ 0\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   General damages .........................$ 350,000.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Roberts\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Past medical expenses ......................$ 274,284.05\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Future medical expenses ...................$ 189,546.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Past wages .........................$ 57,732.78\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Future wages .........................$ 169,688.07\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   General damages .........................$ 500,000.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lloyd's of London appealed the trial court's judgment. Plaintiffs subsequently filed an answer to the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lloyd's of London presents two assignments of error: (1) the trial court improperly granted DMA's motion to quash the trial subpoena and subpoena duces tecum, thus committed legal error by not allowing Lloyd's of London to call a DMA representative as a witness at trial; and (2) the trial court erred in awarding Mr. McCloskey future medical expenses for pain management because it was not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdictional Issue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As a threshold matter, we are tasked with determining whether the trial court's judgment of January 31, 2018, granting DMA's motion to quash is\n   properly before this Court. DMA filed its motion to quash subpoena, or in the alternative motion for protective order, on December 15, 2017, the last day of the five day bench trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of trial, the trial court left the record open and set a hearing on the motion to quash for January 16, 2018. On January 31, 2018, the trial court issued a judgment granting the motion, finding the information sought from DMA is precluded by the collateral source rule. No judicial review was sought from this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lloyd's of London maintains that the judgment is an interlocutory judgment, not immediately appealable, and can be raised in its appeal. Conversely, plaintiffs argue that Lloyd's of London failed to timely request review of the judgment on DMA's motion to quash and as such, waived the right to seek review of the January 31, 2018 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The determination of discovery questions as to a non-party in the case is a final appealable judgment.\n   <em>\n    St. Bernard Port\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harbor &amp; Terminal Dist. v.

Each plaintiffs' treating physician testified regarding treatment and procedures performed. Additionally, each plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   medical expenses were itemized and bills entered into evidence. This itemization included the medical procedures which were funded by DMA. Applying a manifest error standard of review, we find a reasonable factual basis exists for the trial court's award. Given that the medical procedures and treatments of each plaintiff was the result of injuries sustained in the accident, plaintiffs are entitled to recover the full amount of medical expenses associated with such procedures and treatments. We find no merit to this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Pain Management Medical Expenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Lloyd's of London asserts that the trial court erred in awarding Mr. McCloskey damages for future medical expenses associated with his pain management treatment. Lloyd's of London maintains that future pain management was not warranted because Mr. McCloskey was discharged from his pain management doctor as a result of testing positive for cocaine. We find this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The trial court found credible the testimony of Mr. McCloskey's treating physician, Dr. Everett Robert (hereinafter \"Dr. Robert\"), which established future pain management was required as a result of surgeries Mr. McCloskey received relative to the July 9, 2014 accident. Dr. Robert testified that he recommends Mr. McCloskey see a pain specialist four times a year for the remainder of his life. Dr. Robert also noted that Mr. McCloskey's discharge from a pain management clinic was irrelevant. He maintained that he continues to recommend Mr. McCloskey receive pain management treatment. Dr. Robert recommended future pain management treatment irrespective of Mr. McCloskey's drug use. The trial court agreed with Dr. Robert's recommendation, stating that Mr. McCloskey's positive drug test does not preclude him from being treated by another physician once he is no longer using drugs. \"[T]he issue to be resolved by a reviewing court is not whether the trier of fact was right or wrong, but whether the factfinder's conclusion was a reasonable one.\"\n   <em>\n    Stobart v.

To support their claims for lost wages plaintiffs submitted payroll documentation from their employer, Duxworth Roofing and Sheet Metal (hereinafter \"Duxworth\"), as\n   well as federal tax documentation. Plaintiffs also testified that a portion of their earnings was received in cash payments. They testified that on payday, every week, employees would pick up a check with an envelope containing cash attached to the check. The trial court considered this testimony in reaching its conclusions as to each individuals lost wage claim. We now consider the merits of each plaintiffs claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mr. McCloskey and Mr. Roberts lost wage claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In its reasons for judgment, the trial court found that: (1) Mr. McCloskey did not establish that he received cash payments from Duxworth; and (2) Mr. Roberts did not provide reliable verification of the likely cash payments he received from Duxworth. \"A trial court has broad discretion in assessing awards for lost earnings, but there must be a factual basis in the record for the award.\"\n   <em>\n    Burch v. SMG, Schindler Elevator Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 2014-1356, p. 13 (La.App. 4 Cir. 4/7/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804674\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/652/#p662\">\n    191 So.3d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662. The record supports a factual basis for the trial court's award and its determination of lack of evidentiary support for Mr. McCloskey and Mr. Roberts' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. McCloskey testified that he was paid $700.00 per week. He maintained that $500.00 of that was paid by check, as represented by Duxworth's payroll documentation, and the remainder was received in cash. Mr. Roberts testified that he was making $120.00 per day working at Duxworth, a portion of which was paid in cash. Additionally, he testified that he was making between $150.00 and $200.00 on the weekends at a second job as an oyster shucker. He claimed that credit card tips were electronically deposited and that cash tips were pocketed. Lloyd's of London argued that the additional money sought by Mr. Roberts was not represented on payroll or federal tax documentation and that it was money given to employees for expenses, not income. Mr. McCloskey and Mr. Roberts also offered the testimony of Donovan Squyres as corroboration that Duxworth paid a portion of its employee earnings in cash. Donovan Squyres was Mr. McCloskey and Mr. Roberts' supervisor and had knowledge of Duxworth's pay day procedure. Donovan Squyres testified that Duxworth would give employees a weekly\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   in addition to regular earnings because they were staying on location at the job site. However, an official representative of Duxworth did not testify at trial, although a subpoena was issued, and no official testimony established that the cash was additional income Duxworth provided to its employees. The trial court, while acknowledging the likelihood that Duxworth made cash payments to its employees, noted that the cash payments could not be sufficiently verified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court awarded lost wages to Mr. McCloskey and Mr. Roberts, but refused to include cash payments in its calculations. It is not the role of this Court to reverse the factual findings of a trial court unless it is determined that a reasonable basis does not exist for the trial court's factual determinations and that the trial court's finding was clearly wrong.\n   <em>\n    Waters v.

The trial court reviewed all the evidence and chose not to include cash payments as income in the lost wage calculation. While acknowledging that plaintiffs probably received cash payments, the trial court found insufficient evidence to include cash payments in its award. The record before this Court demonstrates that the trial court's findings are reasonably supported. We therefore do not find that the trial court's ruling was manifestly erroneous. We find no merit to this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mr. Squyres lost wage claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Squyres argues the trial court erred in not awarding him any lost wages. Like the other plaintiffs, Mr. Squyres submitted documentation showing previous income earned. He testified that he worked at Duxworth in 2003, 2004, 2009 and 2014. In order to recover for lost wages, a plaintiff is tasked with proving that he would have been earning wages if not for the accident subject of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Burch\n   </em>\n   , 2014-1356, p. 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804674\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/652/#p662\">\n    191 So.3d at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Mr. Squyres offered his own testimony to support his claim for lost wages. Although a plaintiff's own testimony can be used to establish a claim for lost wages, the trial court is allowed broad discretion is assessing awards for lost earnings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Driscoll v.

While Mr. Squyres presented previous income documentation, the inconsistencies and gaps in years of income fail to adequately attribute loss of earnings to the July 9, 2014 accident. Additionally, as noted by the trial court in its reasons for judgment, Mr. Squyres did not offer testimony from an economist regarding his loss of earnings. The record demonstrates that Mr. Squyres did not establish that he would have been earning wages if not for the accident. As such, we find a reasonable basis exists for the trial court's determination.

Dr. Stokes' reports contained amounts for both generic and name brand medications for the future prescription needs of Mr. McCloskey and Mr. Roberts. At trial, Dr. Stokes submitted cost for both generic and brand name medications. He explained that cost is contingent upon the medication a physician prescribes. He further testified that his reports include cost for both- generic and name brand- because the patents for name brand medications expire over time, resulting in a reduction in cost. Additionally, Dr. Stokes opined that neither of plaintiffs' treating physicians indicated that name brand medications were required. The trial court was not obligated to base its award for future cost of prescriptions on name brand medications. \"[T]he appropriate amount of damages, by a trial judge..., is a determination of fact, one entitled to great deference on review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064335\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/1104/#p1116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064335\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/1104/#p1116\">\n    at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We do not find that the amount awarded is so low and disproportionate that it shocks the conscience. Mr. Roberts suffered injuries to his shoulder, back, ear and head. In its reasons for judgment, the trial court noted that as a result of the accident, Mr. Roberts would suffer permanent restrictions which would limit the type of work he could perform in the future. The trial court also took into account the testimony of Mr. Roberts' wife regarding the effects of his pain and suffering. Considering the vast discretion afforded to the trial court, and the fact that it took into account all elements associated with Mr. Roberts' injuries, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's award of $500,000.00 in general damages. Therefore, no circumstances exist under which to disturb the trial court's award.
