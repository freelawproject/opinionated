Leslie Danielle Dewitt appeals her conviction for two counts of touching a child for lustful purposes pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-23(2) (Rev. 1998). Dewitt argues that a new trial is warranted because of the service of an unqualified juror who withheld disqualifying information, the trial court incorrectly denied a motion to prevent the admission of a recorded conversation involving the appellant, and the trial court committed reversible error in denying the introduction of a lesser-included jury instruction. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Leslie Danielle Dewitt, a female and once junior high and high school girls' basketball coach at Hancock High School, was convicted of two counts of touching a child for lustful purposes. The child, Bethany Foster,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   also female, was a tenth-grade basketball player under Dewitt at Hancock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Foster testified at trial that her and Dewitt's player-coach relationship, which began in junior high school and through basketball, developed over time during her high school years. Foster would routinely practice with Dewitt after school-hours and babysit her son at Dewitt's home. The two maintained a close relationship for years prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Foster also testified that while in high school in December 2009, she was sixteen years old and spending the night at Dewitt's house with a teammate. Foster stated that after everyone else had gone to sleep, Dewitt committed sexual acts against her. Foster testified that Dewitt kissed Foster, placed her hand on Foster's vagina, and placed her fingers in Foster's vagina. Foster testified that the physical aspect of their relationship was repeated on more than twenty occasions from December 2009 until July 2010. It became routine. Foster also testified that during this time Dewitt placed her mouth on Foster's vagina and also used a sex toy on Foster's genitals. Dewitt denies that any sexual conduct ever occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Foster did not tell anyone about the nature of the relationship. She testified that it was too embarrassing and that she was concerned what her friends and family would think given their religious background and the impact it could have on Dewitt. However, despite their best efforts, some semblance of a relationship between the two became evident to others, and after repeated failed attempts by Hancock school administrators to get Dewitt to\n   distance herself from Foster, Dewitt was forced to resign. Foster and Dewitt remained in contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In January 2013, Foster returned home from college, struggling with depression and anxiety that she testified stemmed from her past relationship with Dewitt and the subsequent confusion it caused her. While home, Foster told her mother, Monique, about the sexual relationship between her and Dewitt for the first time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Monique then took Foster to the police station to report the misconduct. Monique testified at trial that she later decided to confront Dewitt about the accusations and record the conversation on her cell phone. After letting the police know of her intentions, the police asked if she would be willing to use their recording device, instead of her cell phone, to record the conversation. Monique agreed. The police provided Monique with a recording device and followed her to meet Dewitt and observe the encounter from a distance. The police did not offer Monique any advice for techniques to use during the conversation or assistance in carrying out the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Monique confronted Dewitt in the parking lot of Pearl River High School where Dewitt had just finished coaching a basketball game. While Monique did not physically force Dewitt into her car, Monique threatened to \"make a scene\" if Dewitt did not agree to get in the car and speak with her. Dewitt and Monique got into Dewitt's car and Monique recorded the conversation unbeknownst to Dewitt. In the recording, Dewitt made allegedly incriminating statements without instruction regarding\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the encounter, Monique returned the recording and recording device to the police. Later that night, Dewitt went to the police station on her own accord where she was informed of her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights before giving a statement. She was arrested about two months later in March 2013. Prior to trial, Dewitt filed a motion in limine to exclude the recording. The motion was denied, and the recording was played for the jury over Dewitt's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. After jury deliberations began, but before the jury reached a verdict, the circuit clerk discovered that one of the jurors, Simmons, was not a registered voter of Hancock County and had only lived in the county for two months prior to trial. As the trial judge stated, Simmons appeared in court because he was responding to a jury summons that was issued to his address in Hancock County. Although it is believed that the summons was meant for a prior occupant of the same address, Simmons received the summons, appeared in court, and went through all of the juror qualification process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Before trial, the trial judge, the State, and the defense counsel all agreed that to the best of their knowledge the trial court properly impaneled and swore in the jury, a complete and proper voir dire was conducted, and all of the jurors were accepted in accordance with the competent juror qualifications under Mississippi Code Annotated section 13-5-1 (Rev. 2012). The trial judge states in the record that he \"specifically ask[ed] the question, you must be either a qualified elector or resident freeholder of the [county] for more than one year.\" However, there is no evidence of this actual line of questioning of the jurors by the trial judge or the jurors' responses to the questions in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. While the information regarding how long Simmons had lived in the county\n   was available to each side's counsel prior to trial on the juror's information card, his voter registration status was not. Dewitt alleges that Simmons withheld information that would have allowed her to strike him for cause. Again, according to the record, the parties at trial seem to agree that the jury was properly questioned during voir dire, but there is no record of the actual questioning or responses from the jurors. Upon hearing of the clerk's discovery, and before a verdict was reached, Dewitt quickly moved for a mistrial based on Mississippi Code Annotated section 13-5-1. However, according to the trial judge, Simmons did not intentionally do anything wrong. He responded to a summons issued to his address, was subjected to voir dire by both sides, and was accepted by each. Accordingly, the motion was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. The jury rendered the verdict of guilty of Counts III and IV for touching of a child for lustful purposes. Dewitt was subsequently sentenced to the maximums of fifteen years for Count III and fifteen years for Count IV to run consecutively for a total of thirty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. The sentence is set to be served day-to-day without the possibility of pardon, parole, early release, or suspension. Dewitt was further ordered to register as a sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    I. Whether the trial court correctly denied Dewitt's Motion for New Trial despite the service of an unqualified juror.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. Dewitt argues that Juror 3-26, Simmons, was an incompetent juror because he was not a registered voter in Hancock County at the time of trial and had only lived in Hancock County for two months prior to trial. She alleges that Simmons withheld this information which would have supported a strike for cause. Because Simmons served on the jury despite being unqualified, Dewitt argues for a mistrial and that she should be granted a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. The \"standard of review for the denial of a motion for mistrial is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Spann v.

In order to be qualified as a competent juror, residency in the county for at least one year or voter registration in the county is required. Mississippi Code Annotated section 13-5-1 (Rev. 2012) provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Every citizen not under the age of twenty-one years, who is either a qualified elector, or a resident freeholder of the county for more than one year, is able to read and write, and has not been convicted of an infamous crime, or the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors within a period of five years and who is not a common gambler or habitual drunkard, is a competent juror. No person who is or has been within twelve months the overseer of a public road or road contractor shall, however, be competent to serve as a grand juror.\n   <em>\n    The lack of any\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    such qualifications on the part of one or more jurors shall not, however, vitiate any indictment or verdict.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis added). \"This Court is required to reverse the trial court when this Court clearly is of the opinion that a juror was not competent.\"\n   <em>\n    Langston v.

Ct. App. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16. As confirmed by both sides during oral argument, although there is no record of the actual section 13-5-1 questioning of the jurors by the trial judge, both the State's and the Appellant's counsel stipulated the questions were asked of the jury. When the trial court asked whether Simmons was to be accepted, both sides agreed, and neither side objected during the empaneling of the jury. Dewitt's attorney did not object to Simmons's participation until after the jury began deliberating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17. Typically, \"[i]f a party fails to object to a juror before the jury is empaneled, that party waives any right to complain of the jury's composition at a later time.\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497138\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/791/273/#p281\">\n    791 So.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 17). \"However, there are certain circumstances where a juror may be excused after he has already been accepted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497138\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/791/273/#p281\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18.

This is what Dewitt alleges happened. \"If information is withheld by a juror and the evidence shows that a fuller and more complete response or any response at all would have provided a legitimate basis for challenge, the trial court must grant a new trial and if it does not, this Court must reverse on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497138\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/791/273/#p281\">\n    791 So.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 18) (citing\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

Upon examination of a juror's competency, \"[i]t is the duty of the trial court to assess whether the question asked of the juror was '(1) relevant to the voir dire examination; (2) whether it was unambiguous; and (3) whether the juror had substantial knowledge of the information sought to be elicited.' \"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497138\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/791/273/#p281\">\n    791 So.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Odom v.

Ct. App. 2001). Since \"there is no firm rule guiding the courts in every given situation of voir dire examination, these matters must be determined on a case by case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497138\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/791/273/#p281\">\n    791 So.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20. We cannot today know how the trial judge would have conducted his voir dire if Dewitt had objected or raised these issues in a timely manner before the trial judge. According to accounts in the record by the trial judge, the State's attorney, and Dewitt's attorney, the trial judge clearly asked the necessary and relevant questions to the jury to satisfy Mississippi Code Annotated section 13-5-1 -even though the record is void of the actual questioning and juror responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21. Dewitt argues on appeal that Simmons's service on the jury prejudiced her because he had not been a resident of\n   Hancock County long enough to appreciate its close-knit community feel. However, Dewitt's attorney's actions stand in direct contradiction to her argument. Dewitt's attorney made no objection as to Simmons's admission despite his juror card plainly stating he had only lived in Hancock County for two months. Additionally, two other jurors did not even provide an answer to the term-of-residency question on their jury cards, one of whom served on the jury with Simmons. Dewitt's attorney also failed to ask any further questions regarding Simmons's voter registration status. When Dewitt and her attorney decided between challenging Simmons or another juror with their last challenge, Dewitt's attorney chose the other juror and made no request for additional challenges, despite knowing that Simmons had only lived in the County for two months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22. Dewitt states that Simmons actively withheld information from the court which would have supported a strike for cause, but there is no indication in the record of Simmons giving misleading or incomplete answers. There is no evidence of fault on Simmons's part. By all accounts he served as a fair and impartial juror. \"[A] party who fails to object to the jury's composition before it is empaneled waives any right to complain thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7530507\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/565/554/#p558\">\n    565 So.2d at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, \"any flaws in the judge's examination of the panel are mitigated by the leeway allowed defense counsel in his phase of the voir dire.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

Dewitt's attorney did not take advantage of the leeway allowed to him during the voir dire, so we cannot determine that any missing information on Simmons's part was \"unequivocally ... the fault of the juror,\" nor do we find there was adequate prejudice against the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Langston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497138\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/791/273/#p281\">\n    791 So.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23. Looking at the similar case of\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [h]aving said this, we have also examined the record of the voir dire by the trial court as to possible plain error, and although we cannot say that the manner of examining the jury panel was desirable, its defects do not rise to the level of fundamental constitutional error.

Words coming from the judge bear special weight with those citizens who are asked to try the facts of cases, both civil and criminal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11769711\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/725/836/#p844\">\n    725 So.2d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 11). While we acknowledge that Simmons's apparent status as a new resident who had not registered to vote in the county is in conflict with Mississippi Code Annotated section 13-5-1, \"we agree with the case law and find that this was not such an error as to require the verdict and sentence in this case to be overturned.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Dewitt next argues that the admission of the recorded conversation between Monique and Dewitt violated Dewitt's\n   constitutional rights. Dewitt alleges that Monique was acting as an agent of law enforcement interrogating Dewitt and her recorded statements, which were introduced at trial, were elicited without a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning. Dewitt further alleges that her Fourth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26. \"A trial judge enjoys a great deal of discretion as to the relevancy and admissibility of evidence.
