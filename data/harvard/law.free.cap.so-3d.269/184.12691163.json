R.D. and Nancy Collins (the Collinses) own land in Edwards, Mississippi, adjacent to land owned by the Moore Family Trust 1999 (the Moores). The Moores claimed title to a .62-acre parcel of land through adverse possession, and the Hinds County Chancery Court, Second Judicial District, entered a judgment granting the Moores title of the disputed parcel. On appeal, the Collinses argue the chancellor erred by finding the Moores satisfied their burden of proof for adverse possession. Finding no error, we affirm the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. As stated, the present dispute focuses on a .62-acre land parcel. The Collinses claim ownership of the land pursuant to a deed, and the Moores claim ownership pursuant to adverse possession. In 1911, the Moores purchased a tract of land adjacent to the contested parcel. After several ownership transfers throughout the years, Hezekiah Moore placed his family's land into a trust in 1999. The Collinses purchased\n   their land, including the subject parcel, in 1984 from the estate of Howard Gorden. Gorden was Nancy's great-grandfather, and he obtained his land, including the subject parcel, around the same time that the Moores purchased their tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In 2015, the Collinses and Hezekiah obtained land surveys. The Collinses obtained their survey in August 2015, and Hezekiah obtained his survey a few months later in December 2015. Both surveys showed the contested parcel was within the Collinses' deed description. However, the survey obtained by Hezekiah indicated the parcel might belong to the Moores by adverse possession. On January 29, 2016, Hezekiah filed a complaint asserting ownership of the disputed parcel and argued that his family had adversely possessed the land since 1911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. At a September 27, 2016 hearing, undisputed evidence showed a fence had existed on two of the three sides of the parcel since around 1911. The fence's placement resulted in the parcel being fenced in along with the Moores' property. However, both R.D. and Nancy testified that their predecessors had granted the Moores permission to use the land and that they had then extended this permission to the Moores after purchasing the land in 1984.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Both R.D. and Hezekiah testified at the hearing that R.D. asked Hezekiah about the fence placement after the Collinses purchased their land in 1984. However, the testimony differed as to the conversation's content and outcome. Hezekiah testified that he stated his grandfather and Nancy's great-grandfather had agreed on the property line and the fence's placement many years ago. According to Hezekiah, the fence's original placement predated his birth. However, he testified that his family's cattle had grazed on the land for as long as he could remember. He further stated that his family had allowed third parties to use the land for cattle grazing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. As stated, in December 2015, Hezekiah obtained the survey of his family's land indicating that the disputed parcel might belong to the Moores through adverse possession. After receiving the survey, Hezekiah replaced the old fence on the parcel with a new one and placed \"No Trespassing\" signs on the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. R.D. testified that he and Nancy bought their land, including the disputed parcel, in 1984. R.D. stated that they had paid taxes on the parcel each year. After their land purchase, R.D. asked Hezekiah about the fence's placement on the parcel. R.D. testified that Hezekiah said the Gordens agreed to let the Moores build the fence in its present location. R.D. further testified that Hezekiah told him they should let the fence stay in its present location. R.D. stated he agreed to the fence's placement because he benefitted by not having the upkeep on the parcel. Like R.D., Nancy testified that she was aware of the Moores' permissive use of the parcel and that she had agreed to the continuation of the permissive use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. According to the Collinses, they first learned the Moores were asserting an ownership claim over the parcel when they received service of the adverse-possession lawsuit. R.D. testified that Hezekiah had never previously claimed ownership of the parcel or indicated the Moores considered the parcel to be theirs. R.D. further testified that he never told the Moores or third parties to stay off the land because he had agreed to the land being used for cattle grazing and bushhogging. R.D. also stated that he never cut growth around the fence, posted \"No Trespassing\" signs, or took any other action regarding the parcel because the Moores' use of the land was agreed upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. The chancellor also heard testimony from Reggie Gordon, Leon Thurmond, and A.C. Peoples. Gordon worked on the Moores' property for Hezekiah's mother. Gordon testified a fence existed on two of the three sides of the parcel for as long as he could remember. He further stated that he had driven a four-wheeler around the parcel to check on the fence and had never been told to stay off the property. Although he had always thought the parcel belonged to the Moores, Gordon testified he knew nothing of the deed descriptions regarding the Collinses' and the Moores' property lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Thurmond bushhogged and tended cattle on the Moores' property, including the disputed parcel, from 1995 to 2006. Thurmond testified that the fence on two of the three sides of the parcel had existed during this time frame and that no one ever told him to stay off the parcel. Like Gordon, Thurmond testified he was unaware of the deed descriptions related to the property lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Finally, Peoples testified that, since 1995, he had tended other people's cattle and grazed his own cattle on the Moores' property. Peoples confirmed that a fence had existed on two of the three sides of the subject parcel during that time. Peoples further testified that no one told him to stay off the parcel and that he had thought it belonged to the Moores. However, Peoples stated that he was not familiar with the deed descriptions related to the parcel's ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. On January 10, 2017, the chancellor entered a memorandum opinion and order on the Moores' adverse-possession claim. The chancellor found the Moores established all the elements required for adverse possession. On February 1, 2017, the chancellor entered a final judgment granting ownership of the parcel to the Moores by adverse possession. Aggrieved, the Collinses appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13.

The Collinses claim the chancellor erred by finding the Moores satisfied their burden of proof for adverse possession. Mississippi Code Annotated section 15-1-13(1) (Rev. 2012) sets forth the following elements for adverse possession:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Ten (10) years' actual adverse possession by any person claiming to be the owner for that time of any land, uninterruptedly continued for ten (10) years by occupancy, descent, conveyance, or otherwise, in whatever way such occupancy may have commenced or continued, shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor of such land a full and complete title ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Otherwise stated, any claimant asserting adverse possession must prove by clear and convincing evidence that his possession was \"(1) under claim of ownership; (2) actual or hostile; (3) open, notorious, and visible; (4) continuous and uninterrupted for a period of ten years; (5) exclusive;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   and (6) peaceful.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364123\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/220/234/#p239\">\n    220 So.3d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 13) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Uncontested testimony presented at the hearing reflected that a fence had existed on two of the three sides of the disputed parcel since around the time the Moores bought their land in 1911. The fence's placement divided the parcel from the remaining property owned first by Gorden and then by the Collinses. As a result, the parcel was fenced in with the Moores' property. Our caselaw recognizes, however, that \"[t]he mere presence of a fence, without more, is not sufficient to sustain a claim of adverse possession.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6898988\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/154/910/#p916\">\n    154 So.3d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 15) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17. In an attempt to provide further proof of his family's ownership claim over the disputed land, Hezekiah testified that his family had enjoyed unrestricted use of the property for as long as he could remember. According to Hezekiah, his family had always maintained the disputed area, including the fence. He stated that his family bushhogged and grazed cattle on the land and had allowed third parties to do the same. To corroborate his family's possessory actions, Hezekiah offered the testimony of Gordon, Thurmond, and Peoples. The three men testified that the fence had existed for well over ten years and that they had always believed the property belonged to the Moores. Gordon stated that he worked on the Moores' property for Hezekiah's mother and that he drove a four-wheeler on the parcel to check the status of the fence. Thurmond corroborated that he had bushhogged the area for the Moores and tended cattle on it. Finally, Peoples testified that he had also tended cattle on the parcel and that the Moores had allowed him to graze his own cattle there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18. Based on the hearing testimony, the chancellor found the Moores established by clear and convincing evidence that they had used the parcel under a claim of ownership since 1911. Upon review, we find the record contains sufficient evidence to substantially support the chancellor's finding that the Moores staked an ownership claim to the property from 1911 to 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

After the Collinses purchased their property in 1984, R.D. asked Hezekiah about the fence placement on the parcel. Hezekiah testified he told R.D. that the Gordens and the Moores had agreed on both the property line and the fence's placement around 1911. Based on their conversation, Hezekiah testified he believed that he had clearly indicated to R.D. that his (Hezekiah's) grandfather had fenced the land in and that the land belonged to the Moores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21. Contrary to Hezekiah's assertions, the Collinses testified they remained unaware the Moores were asserting an ownership claim over the land until Hezekiah filed his adverse-possession lawsuit on January 29, 2016. R.D. testified that Hezekiah previously told him the Gordens agreed to let the Moores build the fence in its present location. R.D. further stated that Hezekiah had said they should leave the fence there. The Collinses testified that, like their predecessors, they granted the Moores permission to keep the fence in its present location and to use the land. The Collinses stated they benefitted from the arrangement since the Moores maintained the parcel and the fence line. In addition, the Collinses testified they never told anyone to get off the land because the Moores used the land as agreed for cattle grazing and bushhogging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22. In granting the Moores' adverse-possession claim, the chancellor found the Moores had maintained and used the parcel for over one-hundred years without permission. Upon review, we find such evidence sufficient to prove the element of hostile use by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Open, Notorious, and Visible\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23. With regard to this element, we have previously stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to the requirements that possession be under a claim of ownership and hostile, possession must also be open, notorious, and visible. Therefore, the possessor must unfurl his flag on the land, and keep it flying, so that the actual owner may see, and if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains, and planted the standard of conquest. A claim of adverse possession cannot begin unless the landowner has actual or constructive knowledge that there is an adverse claim against his property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    O'Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364123\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/220/234/#p239\">\n    220 So.3d at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 22) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24. As previously discussed, the chancellor found the hearing evidence established that the Moores enjoyed unrestricted use of the parcel from 1911 to 2016. The chancellor found the evidence further established that the Moores\n   farmed and raised cattle on the parcel and maintained both the fence and the fenced-in parcel. Thus, although the Moores failed to use the subject property on a daily basis, the chancellor held their regular use of the property for cattle grazing, farming, and bushhogging sufficed as open, notorious, and visible. We find substantial record evidence supports the chancellor's findings on this issue. We therefore find the Moores proved this element by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Continuous and Uninterrupted for a Period of Ten Years\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 25. Section 15-1-13 requires a claimant to exercise continuous and uninterrupted possession over the disputed property for at least ten years. \"Occasional use of someone else's property without an enclosure does not pass the test of adverse possession.
