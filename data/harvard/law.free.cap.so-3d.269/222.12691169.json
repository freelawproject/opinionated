Christopher Hayden Powell died intestate, and was survived by his father, mother, and sister. Stephanie Carlisle served as administrator and filed a final accounting and motion to close Powell's estate (\"Estate\"). Rush Foundation Hospital,\n   Medical Foundation, Inc., and Rush Medical Group (collectively \"Rush\") opposed the motion. The chancellor held a hearing and later entered a judgment denying Rush's claim as barred by the four-year statute of limitations, Mississippi Code Annotated section 15-1-25 (Rev. 2012). Rush sought interlocutory review, which was denied. The chancellor entered a judgment closing the Estate, from which Rush appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Powell died intestate on May 5, 2010. His father, mother, and sister survived him. On November 10, 2011, the Lauderdale County Chancery Court issued letters of administration to Powell's mother, Carlisle, to serve as administrator of Powell's estate. Notice to creditors was published on November 15, 22, and 29, 2011, in the Meridian Star newspaper, which is circulated throughout Lauderdale County. On December 27, 2011, three Rush entities probated a claim against the Estate for $10,413.39. Those entities and the amounts of their respective claims are: Rush Medical Group, $810; Medical Foundation, Inc., $450; and Rush Foundation Hospital, $9,153.39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On March 21, 2016, Carlisle filed her \"Final Account and Motion to Close Estate.\" In her filing, Carlisle claimed that Powell died leaving no certain personal property and no real property in Lauderdale County, and that, at his time of death, he had no assets. Carlisle also averred that Rush's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. On May 26, 2016, Rush filed a response opposing Carlisle's motion. In its response, Rush asserted its claim was not barred, and that Carlisle had yet to file an inventory\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or pleading to ascertain whether the Estate was solvent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rush additionally noted the court had approved a wrongful-death settlement in the amount of $100,000. On June 22, 2016, the chancery court heard arguments on Rush's response to Carlisle's \"Final Account and Motion to Close Estate.\" On June 23, 2016, the chancellor issued an opinion and judgment denying Rush's claim, finding it time-barred under section 15-1-25. The chancellor's judgment did not address the dispute over whether the Estate was solvent, nor did it address Carlisle's statutory requirement as an administrator to file an inventory. Rush sought interlocutory review on July 14, 2016, which the Mississippi Supreme Court denied on October 12, 2016. On October 20, 2016, the chancellor entered a \"Judgment Closing Estate and Discharging Administratrix.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Rush filed a notice of appeal from the chancellor's October 20 judgment on November 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether Rush timely appealed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5. Carlisle argues this Court lacks jurisdiction because Rush filed its notice of appeal more than thirty days after the June 23, 2016 judgment denying its claim. Rush argues the June 23 judgment was not final because it did not adjudicate all the claims, rights, and liabilities of all the parties; and the order was not certified as\n   a Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) final judgment. Rush states the October 20, 2016 judgment closing the Estate adjudicated all claims, rights, and liabilities, and it timely filed its notice of appeal within thirty days from this date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6. \"Generally, parties may only appeal from a final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

However,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Philyaw\n   </em>\n   considered a judgment that resolved all disputed issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n    at 1235-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition,\n   <em>\n    Estate of Philyaw\n   </em>\n   reviewed an issue from an estate filed in 1981, prior to the effective date of Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n    at 1233, 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. We find this case more analogous to\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Waters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n    40 So.3d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2010). In\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the chancellor entered a judgment following a contest to the executor's final accounting and petition to close the estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n    at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 1). In her final accounting, the executor requested that the chancellor order several pieces of property be conveyed to her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n    at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 6-9). However, the chancellor's judgment, entered prior to the closing of the estate, failed to address the executor's request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 9). We held that the failure to address the executor's request left open the proper distribution of the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, we found the chancellor failed to resolve an administration-expense issue and a disputed statutory-support matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 10). For those reasons, we concluded the chancellor did not adjudicate all claims involved, and we determined that the chancellor's order was interlocutory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. Similarly, the June 23, 2016 judgment denying Rush's claim did not adjudicate all claims, rights, and liabilities involved. No 54 (b) certification appears in the record; thus, the judgment was interlocutory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. Carlisle's motion to close the Estate contained two distinct issues. Carlisle argued that Rush's claim was barred by the four-year statute of limitations. Next, she claimed that the decedent had no assets at the time of his death. Rush contested\n   these assertions, noting: there had been a wrongful-death settlement; Carlisle had yet to return an inventory of the Estate, as required by Mississippi Code Annotated section 91-7-93 (Rev. 2013); and the chancellor had yet to determine whether the Estate was insolvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. The chancellor's June 23 judgment found Rush's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, but did not address the issue of whether the Estate was solvent, or whether Carlisle was required to file an inventory. Rush timely sought interlocutory review on July 14, 2016, which the Mississippi Supreme Court denied on October 12. On October 20, the chancellor issued a judgment closing the Estate, and Rush filed its instant appeal within thirty days from the date the judgment was entered. Under these circumstances, we find the timeliness of Rush's appeal is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. The dissent would have us find that Rush was obliged to appeal within thirty days after the chancellor's ruling on June 23. It is true that both the Mississippi Supreme Court and this Court have exercised jurisdiction over timely appeals from orders either allowing or disallowing claims against still-open estates.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Petrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478591\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/635/1389/\">\n    635 So.2d 1389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1994)\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Ladner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920207\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/911/673/\">\n    911 So.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2005). However, our appellate courts have not yet held that a creditor\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   file an appeal from the date a claim is denied. For us to do so now would limit the time for claimants to appeal when issues brought forth by the original pleadings remain undecided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. In contending Rush's time for appeal has expired, the dissent cites\n   <em>\n    In re Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n    188 So.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2015). There, a creditor filed a claim seeking payment for a series of personal checks advanced to the decedent for her nursing care.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n    at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 10). The executor moved to close the estate, and asserted the decedent lacked capacity to enter a contract, and that the creditor probated its claim too late.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 11). The creditor opposed both arguments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 12-13). After a hearing, the chancellor disallowed the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 14-15). In his judgment, the chancellor found that the creditor was unable to provide sufficient proof the checks represented loans and that the claim was time-barred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. In response to the creditor's appeal, the executor argued the chancellor's judgment denying the claim was not final because the estate remained open, and there was no final order closing the estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at n.3 This Court rejected the executor's argument and found the appeal timely because the judgment appealed from \"finally resolved the probate claim ... lodged against [the] estate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. Unlike\n   <em>\n    In re Holmes\n   </em>\n   , the chancellor's judgment in this case did not directly address all disputed issues. Further, this Court did not deny the appeal in\n   <em>\n    In re Holmes\n   </em>\n   , but exercised jurisdiction over the appeal. Therefore, to rule that a claimant\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   file an appeal at this juncture would effectively deny Rush the opportunity to appeal when caselaw does not make such an obligation apparent. We will thus review the merits of Rush's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the statute of limitations had run.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17. Rush argues the chancellor erred in applying the four-year statute of limitations found in section 15-1-25, which states: \"An action or scire facias may not be brought against any executor or administrator upon any judgment or other cause of action against his testator or intestate, except within four years after the qualification of such executor or administrator.\" The application of a statute of limitations is a question of law, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Sarris v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11111420\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/782/721/#p723\">\n    782 So.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 723 (\u00b6 6) (Miss. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18. Rush argues section 15-1-25 is preemptive; that no action to compel payment was brought, making section 15-1-25 inapplicable; and that Carlisle's statutory duty to pay the Estate's debts\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   entitles Rush to payment of its claims. This argument, however, is without merit. In\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Rosenstock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8824050\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/117/144/\">\n    117 Miss. 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8824050\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/117/144/\">\n    77 So. 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1918), the Mississippi Supreme Court considered the application of section 15-1-25 (then Section 3105, Code 1906), stating, \"[S]ection 3105 is clear and unambiguous, and under the strict language of this section[,] the owner of a probated claim must insist upon satisfaction or bring his action against the executor or administrator\" within the time provided by statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8824050\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/117/144/\">\n    117 Miss. at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8824050\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/117/144/\">\n    77 So. at 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   court explained, \"[the statute] declares that when the remedy is barred[,] the right also is barred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8824050\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/117/144/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8824050\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/117/144/\">\n    at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8824050\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/117/144/\">\n    77 So. at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Professor Robert Weems succinctly explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   One might conclude that if a creditor validly probates his or her claim, the creditor would not have to do anything else to protect it, but this is not always the case. The administrator may, through deliberation or procrastination, fail to pay the claim. If the administrator does not pay it, the creditor may have to take judicial action to compel payment. Administrators may not be sued for 90 days after taking office, and there is a four-year statute of limitations with regard to the action against administrators to recover claims against their decedent. [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2091-7-239\">\n    Miss.

Consequently, actions to compel payment of such claims must be brought within four years and 90 days of the qualification of the administrator, even though the claim may have been duly probated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Robert A. Weems,\n   <em>\n    Wills and Administration of Estates in Mississippi\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2.31 (3d ed. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19. Here, Carlisle was issued letters of administration on November 10, 2011, and the four-year statute of limitations began to run ninety days later, i.e., on February 8, 2012.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2091-7-239\">\n    Miss.

Rush did not do so until May 26, 2016, approximately three months and eighteen days after the statute of limitations ran.

As Chancellor Primeaux explains,\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   's holding follows logically from the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   , which \"directly answers the question\" of when to appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920207\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/911/673/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   deals with the time for an administrator or executor to appeal from a ruling adverse to the estate, but there is no logical reason why the same rationale should not apply to a creditor appealing from an adverse ruling.

Applying these precedents, it is clear that Rush should have filed a notice of appeal within thirty days of the June 23, 2016 judgment denying its probated claim. M.R.A.P. 4(a). That judgment \"finally resolved the probate claim\" that Rush\n   \"lodged against [the] estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819797\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/1229/\">\n    188 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1232 n.3. Therefore, the time to appeal ran from the entry of that judgment.\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n    514 So.2d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   subsequent activity in the chancery court was the entry, about four months later, of a two-page judgment closing the estate, discharging the administrator, and waiving a final accounting.\n   <em>\n    Those issues had nothing to do with Rush or its probated claim\n   </em>\n   . The judgment denying Rush's claim was\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   whether the estate was \"solvent\" or \"insolvent\" and regardless of any subsequent \"inventory.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 11-16). The majority's reasoning on this point is in direct conflict with\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   , which made clear that finality for purposes of appeal does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   require a \"decree finally closing the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n    514 So.2d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By the time Rush filed a notice of appeal-about five months after the entry of the judgment denying its probated claim-the time to appeal had \"long since expired.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n    at 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court is \"without jurisdiction\" to consider Rush's appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26.\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

App. 2010), which the majority cites, is simply inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , which we described as \"an unusual set of facts,\" the will left the executor/widow \"multiple specific legacies,\" including cattle, farm equipment, home furnishings, and appliances, and the executor/widow asked the court to grant her (1) authority to convey all of this property to herself, (2) a widow's allowance, and (3) administration expenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n    at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 6, 10). The chancellor partially denied her request to convey the cattle. However, the chancellor did not address her requests to convey the farm equipment, home furnishings, or appliances. Nor did the chancellor resolve her requests for a widow's allowance and expenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 7-10). Thus, although the claimant/appellant had advanced several different claims and requests for relief in the chancery court, the chancellor had adjudicated only one of them-the request to convey the cattle-while leaving all of the others unresolved. Because the chancellor's ruling did not resolve several disputed issues related to the appellant's requests for relief, this Court held that the chancellor's ruling was neither final nor appealable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042623\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/40/657/#p658\">\n    at 659-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 12) (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). In stark contrast, the judgment denying Rush's probated claim finally resolved\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Rush's claims and concluded Rush's involvement in the estate proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27. The majority also seems to say that Rush\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   appealed from the June 23, 2016 judgment denying its claim but was not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 13-16). That simply is not how our appellate jurisdiction works. If a judgment is final, the notice of appeal\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be filed within thirty days (unless the time for filing is tolled). M.R.A.P. 4. If the judgment is not final, it\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be appealed. A party does not get to decide\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   to appeal the judgment. The designated time for appealing the judgment is mandatory and \"jurisdictional.\"\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n    514 So.2d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is exactly the point of\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   's holding that an executor or administrator\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   appeal within the time allowed following a judgment allowing a contested claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The majority utterly fails to explain why we would have one rule for executors/administrators but a different rule for creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28. Finally, the majority seems to imply that we have jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    in this particular appeal\n   </em>\n   but only because prior precedent did not make Rush's obligation to appeal \"apparent.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 16). This is no basis for appellate jurisdiction. To begin with, because there is no material difference between this case and\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   , the\n   obligation was already \"apparent.\" Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction even though \"the specific jurisdictional question ...\n   <em>\n    ha[d] never been addressed by [the Supreme] Court\n   </em>\n   ,\" and courts in other states were divided on the issue.\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588566\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/1232/\">\n    514 So.2d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In short, this case does not involve any issue of first impression; and even if it did, there is no such thing as issue-of-first-impression appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29. My disagreement with the majority may seem academic. The majority affirms the judgment denying the probated claim, while I would dismiss the appeal, which would also leave the judgment in place. However, \"it is essential that the point at which a judgment is final be crystal clear because appellate rights depend upon it. The opportunity to appeal could be lost by a mistaken belief that the judgment is not final and a consequent failure to file timely a notice of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Huene v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"607819\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/743/703/#p704\">\n    743 F.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (9th Cir. 1984). Our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Philyaw\n   </em>\n   and our decision in\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   provide at least some degree of clarity as to when to appeal a judgment allowing or denying a probated claim. However, the majority's opinion undermines this clarity. It will require lawyers to guess as to whether such a judgment is final or non-final based on the pendency of\n   <em>\n    wholly unrelated\n   </em>\n   issues within the estate proceeding as a whole. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
