The plane was a total loss, and Precht died in the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Relators contend that the crash was caused by unmarked guy wires supporting a communications tower, LA-5136, owned by Global Tower, LLC; GTP Infrastructure I, LLC; and GTP Investments, LLC (collectively referred to as \"GTP\"), which was located adjacent to the field. Relators contend that GTP violated Jefferson Davis Parish Ordinance 5.5-107, which requires that all tower guy wires be marked with TANA markers\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to enable pilots to identify the location of the wires. GTP contends that the crash occurred because Precht was purposely flying very close to the tower wires in order to cover as much of the field as possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hanover Insurance Company (Hanover), as the subrogee of GTP, filed suit against Relators to recover the $ 125,830.00 it paid to GTP for damages to the tower caused by the crash. USAIG filed suit against GTP; Telcom Rentals, Inc.; American Tower Corporation; Hanover; and CNA Insurance Company to recover the $ 560,000.00 in property damages and $ 9,100.00 in expenses to clean up the debris that it paid to Riceland. The two suits were consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case has previously been before this court on Relators' writ application regarding the trial court's ruling that excluded the testimony of their expert in visibility studies, Paul Kayfetz, and his visibility study.\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins.

That writ application was denied. There are no other cases pending in this court that are related to the subject accident; however, there is a case filed by Precht's widow in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Lake Charles Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relators filed two motions in limine. The first motion sought the following pre-trial evidentiary determinations: (1) that Relators would be allowed to offer and introduce evidence of GTP's installation of TANA markers after this incident; (2) that any reference to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation's conclusion and its accident identification number would be excluded; (3) that any reference to Precht's knowledge or familiarity with the tower, guy wires, or the adjacent property would be excluded; and (4) that any reference to trees/vegetation that existed around the guy wire anchors on the date of the accident but are no longer in existence would be excluded. The second motion sought to exclude the testimonies of Colonel J.F. Joseph (Colonel Joseph), GTP's aviation expert, and Robert D. Bartlett (Bartlett), GTP's expert in accident reconstruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The motions came for hearing on October 10, 2018. The trial court denied the motion as to numbers (1), (3), and (4) above and denied the motion to exclude the testimony of Colonel Joseph. The motion was granted as to evidence regarding the NTSB's investigation. The argument and ruling on the motion to exclude the testimony of Bartlett was postponed, and this is not included in the writ application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A written judgment was signed on October 12, 2018. Written reasons for the rulings were issued on October 1, 2018, and October 23, 2018. Relators gave timely notice of their intent to apply for supervisory writs in open court when the rulings were issued and later in writing. The trial court set a return date of November 24, 2018. This writ application was timely filed in accordance with that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   GTP filed an opposition to the writ application, and Relators filed a reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Trial in this matter is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, June 25, 2019.

However, the correct standard of review is abuse of discretion. \"A trial court has great discretion in evidentiary matters, and its decisions regarding motions in limine are reviewed using the abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Sonnier v.

Colonel Joseph further stated that no number of colored spheres or wire sleeves would have prevented the accident because the failure to maintain sufficient clearance was due to Precht's loss of situational awareness and his failure to maintain a proper lookout. Important to Colonel Joseph's conclusion were the facts that Precht had been flying for over ten hours at the time of the crash and that Precht had successfully avoided the guy wires on several past occasions. GTP contends that Colonel Joseph used the same methodology as that employed by the NTSB. According to GTP, Colonel Joseph used the established investigation protocols followed by the NTSB, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the Texas Department of Transportation in formulating his opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Relators contend that the trial court erred in finding that Colonel Joseph is qualified to testify as an expert in the field of agriculture aviation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They concede that Colonel Joseph is an accomplished commercial airline pilot but assert that he \"lacks the requisite special training, work experience, or practical knowledge in\n   <em>\n    agriculture\n   </em>\n   aviation to opine as an expert on matters unique to agricultural pilots, such as Mr. Precht.\" (emphasis in original). They contend that Colonel Joseph \"has never instructed an agriculture pilot, never evaluated an agriculture pilot, never investigated an agriculture aviation accident,\n   and never made any safety recommendation related to agriculture aviation.\" Relators also contend that Colonel Joseph used no scientific methodology in reaching his conclusions and that his conclusions were based only on his subjective beliefs and unsupported speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Colonel Joseph reviewed reports issued by the NTSB in its investigation of the subject accident, the depositions of fact witnesses in this case, the reports of other experts rendered in this case, and regulations and maps relative to this case. An expert's opinion may be based upon data and facts not admissible in evidence if they are the type that are reasonably relied upon by experts in the subject field.

That case involved an accident where a helicopter carrying a meter technician to an offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico landed in the water. The plaintiff was unhurt in the landing but was pinned by the nose of the helicopter while he was attempting to board the rescue boat. In\n   <em>\n    Duhon\n   </em>\n   , this court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's recognition of the defendants' witness as an expert helicopter pilot and refusal to qualify him as an expert in helicopter operations and aircraft accident reconstruction. The witness had no experience as an air taxi operator and had never attended aircraft accident investigation school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Relators analogize the field of aviation to the fields of law and medicine which have many different disciplines. According to Relators, one cannot be an expert in all disciplines.

According to GTP, this \"case involves a professional pilot performing a repetitive duty and striking a known hazard at a low altitude, which fits squarely within the expertise\n   of Col[onel] Joseph.\" For example, GTP points out that Colonel Joseph was a Low Altitude Tactics Instructor (LATI) in the Marine Corps who specifically trained pilots in the procedures and strategies for safe operation of aircraft at low altitudes. Colonel Joseph also wrote the Low Level Tactics Manual-KC-130 for the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing. GTP argues that \"Colonel Joseph's experience in the round-the-clock pace of military flight operations gives him an excellent real world perspective on the dawn-to-dusk operations engaged in by Precht at the time of the accident[ ] and the techniques that can be utilized to mitigate the risks posed by fatigue and complacency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"A trial judge has wide discretion in determining whether to allow a witness to testify as an expert, and this includes the determination of how much and what kind of education and/or training adequately qualify an individual as an expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Tadlock v.

Relators want to introduce photographs of the tower since the markers were installed and a post-construction inspection report from Engineered Tower Solutions, PLLC (ETS), which is dated October 13, 2013, eight months after the accident. The report shows that the locations of guy line wire markers were changed per GTP's instructions. Relators contend that such evidence is admissible under La.Code Evid. art. 407 even though evidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally precluded to prove negligence or culpability. Relators contend that, as allowed by La.Code Evid. art. 407, they will use this evidence to: (1) prove feasibility of precautionary measures since GTP and its experts argue that it was not feasible to install the TANA markers; (2) impeach the credibility of GTP and its experts; and (3) prove that GTP had authority and control over the tower. Relators concede, however, that \"GTP's ownership and control of the tower is undisputed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Relators argue that in taking the position that the presence of the TANA markers on the guy wires would not have prevented the accident, GTP has put the feasibility of putting marker balls directly at issue. GTP, on the other hand, argues that: (1) it has never denied that it owns the tower or that it has custody and garde over it; and (2) it has never asserted that adding marker balls was not feasible in that they were impossible to implement or in that they were unreasonably expensive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, according to GTP, the only reason that Relators want to introduce this evidence is to imply fault to GTP. GTP's opposition does not discuss the use of the evidence to impeach the credibility of its expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In denying Relators' motion in limine with regard to subsequent remedial measures, the trial court found that none of the purposes for which such evidence could be admitted under La.Code Evid. art. 407 existed in this case. The trial court further found that such evidence would create \"an unavoidable and undue risk that the jury would imply culpability for the accident\" solely because of the addition of the TANA markers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Impeachment evidence on the issue of credibility is subject to a determination as to whether its probative value is \"substantially outweighed by the risks of undue consumption of time, confusion of the issues, or unfair prejudice.\" La.Code Evid. art. 607(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Relators contend that GTP violated Jefferson Davis Parish Ordinance 5.5-107 which requires that all tower guy wires be marked with TANA markers. After\n   the accident, GTP installed the TANA markers. Relators contend that GTP cannot have it both ways in arguing that it did not have to comply with the ordinance but add the marker balls in case it did have to comply. GTP argued that the federal regulations regarding the marking of obstructions to aviation preempted the parish ordinance.
