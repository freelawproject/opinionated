On March 30, 2014, Zacharias Blanchard was shot in the head on the grounds of Club Rock, located in Oktibbeha County just outside of Starkville, Mississippi. Blanchard was taken to the Oktibbeha County Hospital by Joanna Burchfield, who had found him lying next to her car and bleeding. Blanchard was transferred by helicopter to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson for treatment by a neurosurgeon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Upon returning to Starkville, Blanchard identified Tobias Coleman as the man who shot him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A grand jury charged Coleman with aggravated assault. Coleman was tried over two days in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Blanchard testified that on the night of March 30, 2014, he arrived at Club Rock under the influence of \"Molly,\" a drug described by Blanchard as a \"sexual enhancer,\" and alcohol. Blanchard was accompanied by his friend Stephen Thomas Jr. Once inside Club Rock, Blanchard's cousin told him that Coleman and a group of friends had trapped him in the bathroom. To take up for his cousin, Blanchard walked outside to confront Coleman. Blanchard yelled at Coleman \"from a distance,\" but he could not recall what he said. Blanchard also could not recall whether the area outside the club was well-lit or dark, although he remembered that Coleman was wearing a black t-shirt and black jeans. Upon seeing Coleman walking towards him, Blanchard testified that he did not protest or run because \"if it was [his] time, it was [his] time.\" Blanchard stated that Coleman had \"walked upon [him]\" from behind and shot him \"from the back.\" When asked why he would walk to a dark area and turn his back on a person that Blanchard alleged had previously tried to kill him, Blanchard responded that he \"respect[ed] all and fear[ed] not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Dr. Allen Butts was the State's second witness. He examined Blanchard at the Oktibbeha County Hospital. He determined that Blanchard had been injured by a gunshot wound that had entered through his forehead, and he stabilized Blanchard prior to his transfer to Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The State's last witness was Lieutenant Brett Watson, an investigator with the Oktibbeha County Sheriff's Office. He testified that between eight hundred to one thousand people were at Club Rock on March 30, 2014. Five people, including Blanchard, had been shot that night. Investigators found shell casings from three different calibers of guns-.380, .40, and .45 caliber. Lieutenant Watson testified that the different calibers of ammunition meant there likely had been multiple shooters that night. Shell casings were found in several different locations, but no DNA samples were recovered from the casings. The area where Blanchard was shot contained both .40 and .45 caliber shell casings, which, according to Lieutenant Watson, indicated that there had been more than one shooter. Lieutenant Watson and other investigators conducted interviews with the shooting victims, but most patrons had left the scene before law enforcement\n   arrived. Investigators received names, nicknames, and tips about potential shooters. None were ever confirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Lieutenant Watson interviewed Blanchard after he returned to Starkville from Jackson. Blanchard positively identified Coleman as the shooter, having picked him out of a photograph lineup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. After the State rested, the defense called Marcus Johnson. Johnson testified that he had been at Club Rock that night and had witnessed the shooting. According to Johnson, Blanchard and Thomas were involved in an altercation with another man. Johnson testified that both Blanchard and Thomas brandished their weapons and fired at a \"dude with dreads[.]\" But Johnson claimed that the man was not Coleman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. During cross-examination, the State asked Johnson how long he had known Coleman and if he had ever seen Coleman with a gun. Johnson testified he had known Coleman several years and had never seen him with a gun. The State then asked if Johnson had ever seen Coleman's Facebook page. Johnson answered that he had never seen Coleman's Facebook page because he had many \"Facebook friends.\" In response, the State sought to introduce photographs from Coleman's Facebook page. Coleman objected, and the jury was excluded. The trial court reviewed the photographs-one showed Coleman holding a handgun; the other showed him holding a rifle. While the trial court excluded the photograph showing Coleman holding a rifle, the trial court found the other photograph to be relevant because it showed Coleman holding a black, semiautomatic pistol \"in his life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Coleman testified on his own behalf. He stated that the Facebook picture proffered by the State had been taken four years before the crime when he was still in high school. Coleman also stated that he was not in possession of a pistol the night of the shooting. Coleman denied Blanchard's allegations that he was the shooter and claimed to have fled Club Rock upon hearing the gunshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. The jury found Coleman guilty of aggravated assault. The judge sentenced Coleman to twenty years in prison, with five years suspended. The trial court denied Coleman's motion for a new trial. Coleman now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. On appeal, Coleman argues that the photograph, introduced through a witness who had no knowledge of the pistol and used as impeachment evidence, was irrelevant, inflammatory, and prejudicial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. The photograph was proffered by the State to impeach the defense witness, Marcus Johnson, who testified that he had never seen Coleman with a gun before. The photograph was an undated, grainy image purportedly taken from Coleman's Facebook page. The following exchange took place between the State, the trial court, and defense counsel regarding whether photograph should be admitted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [The State]: My question to the witness was, had he ever been on Tobias Coleman's [F]acebook page. Those pictures were taken from his [F]acebook page. And I was going to ask him did he recognize Tobias from those photographs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   BY THE COURT: Okay\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [The State]: And also I was going to ask him has he ever seen him with a gun? That was going to be the first question. Ask [sic] the Court can see in both of those photographs, the defendant is holding a gun, both a handgun and a rifle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15. In response, defense counsel objected to the admission of the photograph on the basis of relevance. The following exchange occurred between defense counsel and the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Judge, if you will look at his hair on that picture, you can tell that picture is years and years old.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   BY THE COURT: Well, from today, sure. I mean -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: That should be relevant when he was carrying a pistol, too. Not that he's ever used it in his life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   BY THE COURT: What it shows is, him [Coleman] with a black-semiautomatic pistol\n   <em>\n    in his life\n   </em>\n   . And it's clearly him [Coleman].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16. We are troubled that the trial court did not apply the same logic when it refused to allow Coleman to impeach the victim, who tested positive for marijuana the night of the shooting. Coleman sought to cross-examine Blanchard regarding a toxicology screening conducted by the hospital that demonstrated that Blanchard, the only eyewitness to the shooting, tested positive for marijuana the night in question. The following exchange demonstrates inconsistent reasoning by the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: So, would the Court be satisfied if he says he smoked weed two days prior but not that day but it was in his system? Does he need to testify that he's never smoked weed in his life?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [The State]: No, sir. That's not relevant whether or not\n   <em>\n    he's ever smoked weed in his life\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   BY THE COURT: That's exactly right. What you're seeking to do is, you're seeking to show that he was inebriated. And I understand that. You're hoping to show that he was - his recollection of things would not be good because he was impaired somewhat. Fair enough. That's allowable. But you can't do it through that document with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: I understood that you should be able to impeach someone with anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   BY THE COURT: Then you understood wrong. Who taught you evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 17. Not only did Blanchard-the only eyewitness to the shooting-test positive for marijuana the night in question, but he also testified that he taken \"Molly\" and\n   had been drinking alcohol the entire day before arriving at Club Rock. We fail to see how the trial court could at one point make the determination that, because Coleman had wielded a gun \"in his life,\" a blurry, four-year-old photograph taken from Facebook was relevant, but that a drug test conducted on Blanchard the night of the shooting was not, because \"whether or not he's ever smoked weed in his life\" was immaterial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 18. The trial court allowed the State to continue questioning Johnson regarding the photograph, and Johnson testified that he had never seen Coleman's Facebook page. When shown the picture by the State, he identified Coleman but said he looked much younger than he had looked at the time of shooting. When the State asked Johnson what Coleman was holding, Johnson said that it \"might be a BB gun\" and that, if it was a gun, he could not determine what type it was. With respect to the color of the weapon, Johnson testified that it appeared to be silver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 19. The State contends that the issue of whether it was proper to impeach Johnson with the photograph was not preserved by Coleman during that portion of the trial. However, immediately after Johnson testified that the gun portrayed in the photograph appeared to be silver, the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [The State:] When was the last time you had your eyes checked?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Johnson:] I don't remember.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [The State:] Okay. Do you have any problem with color vision?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Johnson:] No sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [The State:] Okay. And you're telling this jury - you're telling them -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Johnson:] You're telling me that don't look silver?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [The State:] No, sir, it does not. Does that gun look silver to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Johnson:] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [The State]: Your Honor, now I believe that the photographs should go into evidence for two reasons. One, it should go into evidence to - because [Johnson] stated earlier, he had never seen him with a gun, to\n   <em>\n    impeach -\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    ...\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    ...\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I would object to the picture,\n   <em>\n    again\n   </em>\n   . There's\n   <em>\n    a lack of foundation\n   </em>\n   . There's a\n   <em>\n    lack of relevancy\n   </em>\n   . And it's inadmissible hearsay in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   My client tells me that he has a picture that's unblurred [sic] that would show that the actual gun is silver. And I asked that he be allowed to produce it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [The State]: Your client can take the stand and testify to whatever he wants to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   BY THE COURT: Okay. I will allow the picture to be introduced. I will at least allow you to inquire of the witness,\n   especially in light of the fact that Mr. Blanchard [the victim]\n   <em>\n    has testified that there was a black semi-automatic pistol that your client had on that particular night\n   </em>\n   . And there was an attempt to impeach him or he was impeached or allowed to -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   So I will allow this to come in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 20. Therefore, the objection by Coleman preserved the issue\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11817112\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/722/1258/#p1261\">\n    722 So.2d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1261 (Miss. 1998) (holding that a defense objection on the grounds of relevance, but not specifically on the grounds of Rule 404(b), was not procedurally barred since Rule 404(b) is an issue of relevance and the defense had objected on the grounds of relevance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 21. The trial transcript above also illustrates that the trial court based its evidentiary decision, in part, on Blanchard's testimony. Blanchard believed the handgun used by Coleman to be of a .40 or .45 caliber. However, when asked on cross-examination if he recalled giving a statement to the police in which he stated Coleman was carrying a .380 caliber weapon, Blanchard replied that he could not recall. Upon later taking the stand, Coleman testified that, while he was in the photograph, it had been taken four years prior to the shooting; he was holding a neighbor's weapon simply \"trying to look cool.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 22. In support of the admission of the Facebook photograph, the State relies on both\n   <em>\n    Grant v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n    762 So.2d 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000), and\n   <em>\n    Fraise v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051456\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/160/#p166\">\n    17 So.3d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009). In those cases, also cited by the concurrence, the Court of Appeals found that the probative value of photographs in which the defendants appeared holding guns had not been outweighed sufficiently by the prejudicial effect. The State contends that each case \"directly addressed\" the issue before this Court; however, both cases are distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 23. In\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was on trial for armed robbery and possession of a concealed weapon by a convicted felon.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n    762 So.2d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At trial, not only did two eyewitnesses testify that Grant had been holding the gun, but one eyewitness testified with particularity about the distinctive features of the gun in question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n    at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the witness described the gun as a \".357 [caliber] that had a black handle with molded hand grips and an emblem imprinted on the side of the handle.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n    at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the gun recovered from the crime scene appeared identical to the gun documented in the photograph.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n    at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the court found the admission of the photograph to have been more probative than prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220024\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/762/800/#p805\">\n    at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 24. Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Fraise\n   </em>\n   , the defendant also was on trial for armed robbery and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon.\n   <em>\n    Fraise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051456\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/160/#p166\">\n    17 So.3d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Three eyewitnesses to the armed robbery described the gun used by the assailant as \"black\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   silver in color.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051456\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/160/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051456\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/160/#p166\">\n    at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As in\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   , the gun in the photograph recovered from the defendant's home appeared identical to the distinctive features of the gun described in the three eyewitnesses' testimony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051456\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/160/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court found the photograph highly probative and held its admission had not been an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051456\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/160/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 25. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fraise\n   </em>\n   , here, no eyewitnesses other than the victim testified that Coleman had been the shooter. Neither the gun nor the caliber of the gun used in the shooting could be ascertained from the evidence. Additionally, the color of the weapon and the exact kind of weapon depicted in the picture were disputed. Most importantly, Coleman testified that\n   the photograph had been taken four years prior to the shooting. The holdings in\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fraise\n   </em>\n   are thus distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 26. The concurrence also cites\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

Here, we fail to understand the probative value of a blurry, undated photograph showing Coleman, years prior to the alleged crime, holding an unidentified weapon-the type and color of which were disputed.

I agree with the majority that this case should be reversed and remanded. But the problem here is not with the photograph itself-it is the manner in which the State introduced it. I find no fault with the judge's general discretionary call that the photograph of Coleman brandishing a pistol was of sufficient probative value. But I do find he erred in admitting it as impeachment evidence. I write separately to address that notion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The majority re-weighs the evidence-giving its own personal view of the photograph's evidentiary worth. I respectfully suggest this approach is inappropriate because it cuts against the broad discretion granted trial judges when making general evidentiary calls. \" Rule 401 is construed broadly in favor of admitting evidence with even\n   <em>\n    slight\n   </em>\n   probative value.\"\n   <em>\n    Ross v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337690\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/954/968/#p993\">\n    954 So.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 993 (Miss. 2007) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). And this Court has been consistent and clear that trial judges have \"sound discretion\" whether to admit potentially prejudicial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Baldwin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099012\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/784/148/#p158\">\n    784 So.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (Miss. 2001). Indeed, \"[u]nder Rule 403, the exclusion of prejudicial evidence is\n   <em>\n    permissive\n   </em>\n   \"-meaning exclusion of such evidence is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mandated by rule.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337690\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/954/968/#p993\">\n    954 So.2d at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, even in those instances in which \"a trial court determines that the\n   prejudicial effect of evidence substantially outweighs its probative value,\n   <em>\n    it is not obligated to exclude the evidence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    but may do so at its discretion\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337690\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/954/968/#p993\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 37. Blanchard testified that Coleman was the shooter. But the actual pistol was not recovered, and the bullet could not be removed safely from Coleman's head for comparison with the recovered shell casings. Blanchard had already described the pistol as a black pistol bearing semiautomatic characteristics. And the judge found Coleman's pistol in the photograph to have been similar enough to Blanchard's description to be relevant and admissible.

In\n   <em>\n    Grant v.

That this particular photograph may have been older perhaps tempered its weight some, but it did not, in the judge's view, impermissibly overshadow its probative value. Had the photograph been authenticated, introduced by, and admitted through a proper sponsoring witness during the State's case, or perhaps in rebuttal, I would have no concern with its admission. But it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Improper Impeachment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 40. Instead, the State tried to shoehorn the photograph in evidence after it rested. It waited until the defense's case-in-chief and tried to cast the photograph as impeachment evidence. This occurred after a defense witness testified he had never seen Coleman with a gun. The problem with admitting the photograph in this posture was the fact that the witness testified he had never visited Coleman's Facebook page-the site on which Coleman was alleged to have posted the photograph. And the witness had never previously seen the subject photograph. In other words, the witness did not testify about anything for which the photograph could be used to impeach him. So the photograph was not proper extrinsic impeachment evidence. The defendant lodged an objection to the photograph's admission as impeachment evidence, which should have been sustained. For this reason, under the facts of this particular case, I agree with the majority that reversal is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   RANDOLPH, P.J., JOINS THIS OPINION.
