For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This litigation arises from a February 8, 2016 theft involving a 2008 John Deere 4 X 4 Tractor, John Deere 521 Loader, and attachments (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"tractor\") which were located in a storage building at 4125 Fruge Street in Iowa, Louisiana. The tractor belonged to Nathan and Olivia Lopez (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Lopezes\"). At the time of the theft, the Lopezes had in effect a Dwelling/Builders Risk Policy (\"policy\") issued by Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (\"LCPIC\"). At issue in this matter is whether the policy provided coverage for the theft of the tractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record before us reveals that prior to the instant lawsuit, the Lopezes submitted two claims to LCPIC for the actual cash value of the tractor. Both claims were denied on February 11, 2016 and March 21, 2016, respectively. The reason asserted by LCPIC for those denials was that \"theft\" was not one of the named \"Perils Insured Against\" in the policy. On March 29, 2016, the Lopezes filed the instant Petition for Damages against LCPIC for the actual cash value of the tractor along with interest and all costs of the proceedings. They further sought penalties for LCPIC's alleged violation of La.R.S. 22:1973 and La.R.S. 22:1892 along with attorney's fees and costs. After LCPIC filed an answer, both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of coverage. A hearing on both motions occurred on December 6, 2016, after which the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Lopezes and denied the cross motion for summary judgment filed by LCPIC. The basis of the trial court's ruling was that the policy language was ambiguous. Thereafter, LCPIC filed a writ\n   with this court which was subsequently denied in the unpublished opinion entitled\n   <em>\n    Lopez v. Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17-336%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%206/2/17%29\">\n    17-336 (La.App. 3 Cir. 6/2/17)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The matter proceeded to trial on the merits on May 31, 2018, after which the trial court orally ruled in favor of the Lopezes. A written judgment in accordance with the trial court's ruling was issued on June 4, 2018. It is from this judgment that LCPIC appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, LCPIC asserts the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A. The District Court erred in its interpretation of the insurance policy and the applicable law by holding that \"Theft\" would be covered under the instant policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   B. The District Court erred in its ruling that the policy of insurance was ambiguous and that the phrase \"if not otherwise covered\" extended coverage for theft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The determination of whether a contract is clear or ambiguous is a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

They further assert that additional language in A(3), \"if not otherwise covered in this policy,\" extends coverage for the theft of their tractor since theft is not expressly stated under the \"Perils Insured Against\" section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its May 31, 2018 oral ruling, the trial court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court has reviewed this, and I do find there is some ambiguity and conflict within those two provisions that have been pointed out by the plaintiff and the defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   And further, the exact wording while not the witness' province to create that policy, is noted to be probably expanded as being a little more ambiguous than it was dealt with when the Court did it on motions for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I would adopt the rationale of December 6th, 2016, with regard to the denial of the summary judgment in favor of coverage and the granting of the summary judgment of ambiguity and putting coverage in place on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   LCPIC argues that the policy is not ambiguous despite the provision found in A(3), which the trial court relied upon in finding coverage. LCPIC asserts that reliance on A(3) to extend coverage for theft, which is not a peril insured against, is a misapplication of the law by the trial court. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On review, we keep in mind the following Louisiana jurisprudence: an insurance contract must be construed as a whole, each contractual provision should be interpreted in light of the other provisions, and one provision should not be construed separately at the expense of disregarding other provisions.\n   <em>\n    Calcasieu Par.Sch. Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021529\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/92/1200/#p1202\">\n    92 So.3d 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . LCPIC's argument on appeal runs contrary to the foregoing jurisprudence by construing the \"Perils Insured Against\" provision at the expense of disregarding the provision in A(3), i.e., \"if not otherwise covered in this policy[.]\" Moreover, a review of the additional language in A(3) does not expressly state that the loss of \"outdoor equipment used for the service of and located on the Described Location\" is subject only to the \"Perils Insured Against\" provision. As such, the\n   provision in A(3) must be given its plain, ordinary meaning. A plain and ordinary reading of the provision in A(3), according to witness testimony, can be interpreted as providing additional coverage for the loss of outdoor equipment which would be covered under other sections of the policy, but excluded for certain reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In that regard, LCPIC's sole witness, Allison Anjier, testified at trial. Anjier, a senior claim representative employed by LCPIC, acknowledged that the tractor could be considered outdoor equipment which would fall under the umbrella coverage of A(3). However, Anjier advised that theft is not listed as one of the \"Perils Insured Against\" such that coverage is not afforded to the Lopezes. Anjier then referenced the inclusion of the provision in A(3) and explained how it extends coverage to those items under A(3) which may be covered under other sections of the policy but excluded for certain reasons. She testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   And number 3, which is the relevant one in this case, (As Read) If not otherwise covered in this policy, building equipment and outdoor equipment used for the service of and located on described location.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   So this is taking items that may otherwise be considered coverage B, coverage C, or coverage D. If there is some limitation within those coverages, this allows for them to be considered part of the dwelling, and provides coverage for them under the limit of liability stated for coverage A, subject to the remainder of the contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Anjier's testimony on cross-examination, however, reveals the ambiguity in the provision in A(3). Specifically, she was asked why A(3) contains the provision \"if not otherwise covered in this policy[.]\" Anjier responded by reiterating her previous testimony on direct examination that outdoor equipment may be provided coverage under A(3) if it is otherwise excluded from coverage under other sections of the policy. She was then directed to A(2), which excludes the provision found in A(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q Okay. But you don't have this phrase \"if not otherwise covered in this policy\" with regard to number 2. Why not? Because it would be the same logical analysis that you just gave that maybe you'd reached your limits in C, or maybe they don't have C. Same thing with number 2, A-2 here, but that phrase is not in A-2. Agreed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q Okay. Do you know why it's not in A-2?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Anjier's testimony reveals that the same items that are provided coverage in A(2) and A(3) may also be covered under other sections of the policy. It further reveals that if coverage of those items is excluded under other sections for certain reasons, then coverage may be extended to those items under A(2) and A(3). Thus, the end result is the same for those items listed in A(2) and A(3), i.e., coverage. Moreover, LCPIC, through Anjier's testimony, cannot explain why it placed the provision \"if not otherwise covered in this policy\" in A(3), nor why it was left out of other provisions, like A(2). Such ambiguity must be construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage.\n   <em>\n    Calcasieu Par.Sch.
