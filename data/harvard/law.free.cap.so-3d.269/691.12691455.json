In my view, the trial court correctly concluded that the plaintiff failed to prove the elements of her claim under R.S. 9:2800.6, particularly insofar as the evidence established that only 11 seconds elapsed between the beverage spill and the plaintiff's fall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.
