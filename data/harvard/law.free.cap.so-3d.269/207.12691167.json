Gregory Gill pleaded guilty to two counts of touching a child for a lustful purpose in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-23(1) (Supp. 2017). The trial court sentenced Gill to fifteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) for each count, with the sentences to run consecutively, with fifteen years suspended and five years of postrelease supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Gill filed a motion for postconviction relief (PCR), which the trial court denied. Gill now appeals, asserting the following assignments of error: (1) his right against double jeopardy was violated; (2) the State failed to amend his indictment; (3) the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Gill's prior convictions; (4) his counsel was ineffective; and (5) his right to a speedy trial was violated. Finding no error, we affirm the Hancock County Circuit Court's denial of Gill's PCR motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On February 3, 2014, Gill pleaded guilty to two counts of touching a child for lustful purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court sentenced Gill to fifteen years in the custody of the MDOC for each count, with the sentences to run consecutively, with fifteen years suspended and five years of postrelease supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On July 29, 2016, Gill filed a petition to vacate his conviction and sentence, which the trial court treated as a PCR motion. In his PCR motion, Gill argued that: (1) his right to a speedy trial was violated; (2) his counsel was ineffective; and (3) his right against double jeopardy was violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. On September 21, 2016, the trial court entered an order denying Gill's PCR motion. Regarding Gill's speedy-trial claim, the trial court explained that a valid guilty plea operates as a waiver of the right to a speedy trial. The trial court found that since Gill entered a guilty plea and failed to show that his plea was not valid, his claim lacked merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. The trial court also found that Gill's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit because Gill \"failed to show that his counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for his counsel's alleged errors, he would not have pled guilty.\" The\n   trial court explained that Gill failed to present evidence to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Citing Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-35-101 (Rev. 2015), the trial court also provided that since Gill pleaded guilty to the charges against him, he had no right to directly appeal his sentence and no right to counsel for a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Finally, the trial court held that Gill was not subjected to double jeopardy because Gill \"pled guilty to two (2) separate acts of touching of a child for a lustful purpose, both of which took place on or between January 1, 2004[,] and December 31, 2007.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8.

On August 1, 2013, a Hancock County grand jury indicted Gill on the charges of sexual battery (Count I) and touching a child for a lustful purpose (Count II) in Cause No. B2301-13-0120. The record also contains a bill of information entered on February 3, 2014, charging Gill with one count of touching of a child for a lustful purpose in a separate cause number, Cause No. B2301-14-0017. Gill pleaded guilty to two counts of touching a child for lustful purposes pursuant to section 97-5-23(1) : one count of touching of a child for lustful purposes as charged in Count II of B2301-13-0120, and one count of touching of a child for lustful purposes as charged in B2301-14-0017. As a result of his guilty pleas, the trial court sentenced Gill to serve fifteen years for each count, with the two sentences to run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. The charge in Count II of Cause No. B2301-13-0120 alleged that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Gill,] being at the time in question over the age of eighteen years, for the purpose of gratifying his lust or indulging\n   his depraved licentious sexual desires,\n   <strong>\n    did unlawfully, willfully[,] and feloniously handle, touch[,] or rub with his hands, the vagina\n   </strong>\n   of the said G.A.G., a child who was at the time in question under the age of sixteen (16) years ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13.

The plea-hearing transcript reflects that the trial court informed Gill that he was pleading guilty to two separate charges of touching a child for a lustful purpose-one count in Cause No. B2301-13-0120 and one count in Cause No. B2301-14-0017. The trial court then told Gill that each of the charges carried a minimum sentence of two years and a maximum sentence of fifteen years and a minimum fine of $1,000 and a maximum fine of $5,000. The trial court also asked, \"Sir, do you understand if you plead guilty today, you could be sentenced to a maximum [of thirty] years in prison and imposed a maximum fine of $10,000?\" Gill confirmed that he understood, and he informed the trial court that he still intended to plead guilty. Additionally, during the plea hearing, the State set forth the facts surrounding Gill's charges as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [T]he juvenile victim brought out that she had experienced inappropriate sexual activity with the defendant between the years when she was between six and [eleven] years old, and she described the different things that occurred[,] which include[d] different types of touching all over her body, and it occurred multiple times in multiple locations both in Mississippi and outside Mississippi before and after Hurricane Katrina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15.

Byers appealed, claiming that he was subjected to double jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882651\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/157/98/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882651\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/157/98/#p104\">\n    at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 16).

The\n   <em>\n    Byers\n   </em>\n   Court thus held that \"Count III required 'proof of a fact' not found in Count I; namely, that [the victim] suffered serious bodily harm in the form of 'severe bruising, abrasions, and lacerations.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882651\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/157/98/#p104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17. In the present case, the record shows that Count II of Gill's indictment in Cause No. B2301-13-0120 charged Gill with \"unlawfully, willfully[,] and feloniously handl[ing], touch[ing,] or rub[bing] with his hands, the vagina\" of the victim. In contrast, the bill of information in Cause No. B2301-14-0017 charged Gill with \"unlawfully, wilfully[,] and feloniously handl[ing], touch[ing,] or rub[bing] with his hands the breasts\" of the victim. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Byers\n   </em>\n   , we find that each of the charges against Gill required \"proof of a fact\" not found in the other charge. Further, it is clear that Gill \"was not prosecuted for the same offense after acquittal; he was not subjected to a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and he did not receive multiple punishments for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Avery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7017935\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/1178/#p1181\">\n    102 So.3d at 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). The factual predicate for the pleas provided by the State reflects that Gill touched the victim inappropriately multiples times when she was between the ages of six and eleven years old, in violation of section 97-5-23(1), and Gill pleaded guilty to charges for two of those occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The record before us reflects that Gill was sufficiently aware of the charges against him. The plea-hearing transcript shows that the trial court read aloud each charge of touching a child for a lustful purpose. After reading each charge, the trial court asked Gill, \"Did you do that?\" Gill responded, \"Yes, sir.\" Gill then entered a guilty plea to each charge. The record further reflects that the trial court determined that Gill knowingly, voluntarily, and freely entered his guilty pleas. Gill bears the burden of showing that his pleas were not voluntary, and Gill does not claim his pleas were invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hannah v.

Gill next argues that the State induced the trial court to render the maximum sentence allowable, even though Gill was not charged as a habitual offender, by offering evidence of Gill's prior convictions. Gill claims that this caused the judge \"to have a prejudicial state of mind\" regarding Gill's character. Gill argues that his prior convictions were \"of a totally nonrelevant nature\" to the crime of touching a child for a lustful purpose. Gill further submits that Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1) states that past criminal convictions are not admissible in court if a period of more than ten years has passed since the date of release from that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23.

Procedural bar notwithstanding, the plea-hearing transcript reflects that after Gill admitted to having three prior convictions, the trial court advised Gill how these prior convictions would affect his decision to plead guilty in the context of any future crimes. The trial court informed Gill as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [I]f you were to be charged with an additional crime at some time in the future, the [S]tate could potentially proceed against you as what's commonly referred to as a life habitual.
