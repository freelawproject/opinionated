This is another case about an arbitration agreement between a nursing home and a resident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The arbitration agreement in this case was separate from the admission agreement between the resident and the facility. In addition, the arbitration agreement's cover page clearly stated that the agreement was \"voluntary and not a condition for admission\" to the facility and that the resident could withdraw her consent to arbitrate for any reason within thirty days of signing the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The resident, Carol Massey, and her husband, Greg Massey, both signed the arbitration agreement, and they did not\n   exercise their right to cancel the agreement. But after Mrs. Massey passed away, Mr. Massey filed a wrongful death lawsuit in the Yazoo County Circuit Court against the facility, Oasis Health &amp; Rehab of Yazoo City (Oasis), and its director of nursing, Coretta Carter. Oasis and Carter then filed a motion to compel arbitration. In response, Massey alleged that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and that the admission agreement superseded and nullified the arbitration agreement. The circuit court found that the arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable and granted the motion to compel arbitration. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Carol Massey was admitted to Oasis in March 2014. Around the time of her admission, she and her husband, Greg Massey, both signed an admission agreement and a separate arbitration agreement. In various places, the agreements or the parties' signatures are dated March 3, 4, 5, or 14, 2014. The record contains no explanatory affidavits, so it is unclear whether the agreements were signed on different days or in a particular order. The record also contains no information about the circumstances of Mrs. Massey's admission or the age or physical or mental condition of either Mr. or Mrs. Massey at the time of her admission. All we know is that both of the Masseys signed both agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The cover page of the arbitration agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    EXPLANATION\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    OF\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    PLEASE READ CAREFULLY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Under federal and most state laws, two or more parties may agree in writing for the settlement of any disputes through binding arbitration. Arbitration is a method for resolving disputes without involving the courts. This is often referred to as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism that may be more flexible than the court system, and may also be a less expensive and faster alternative for reaching a resolution of issues between parties. In using arbitration proceedings, the disputes are heard by private individuals called arbitrators. The arbitrators are selected by the Resident and/or the Resident's Legal Representative and the Facility. The decision of the arbitrators binds both parties and is final and nonappealable. By entering into this Binding Arbitration Agreement, the parties are giving up and waiving their right to have any claim decided in a court of law before a judge and/or jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Please read the attached Resident and Facility Binding Arbitration Agreement very carefully and ask any questions you may have. You may also feel free to consult with an attorney of your choice before signing the attached Agreement. Signing the Agreement is voluntary and not a condition for admission. The Resident may withdraw his or her consent to arbitrate the Resident's claim by notifying the Facility in writing within thirty days after the Resident's signing of the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The headings of the cover page were in large, bold font in all capital letters. Greg Massey initialed the cover page, indicating that he had read it or had it explained to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 5. The body of the arbitration agreement, which immediately follows the cover page, provides in relevant parts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    RESIDENT AND FACILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (\"Agreement\")\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I. The following is an agreement that any and all claims, disputes and/or controversies between the Undersigned and the Facility shall be resolved by binding arbitration.... The parties expressly agree and voluntarily enter into this Binding Arbitration Agreement (the \"Agreement\"). Further, the Undersigned and the Facility acknowledge and agree that the parties have entered into an Admissions Agreement. The Undersigned and the Facility further acknowledge that the Admissions Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce ....

The arbitration shall be conducted at a place agreed upon by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement, in the city in which the facility is located. The arbitration hearing and other proceedings relative to the arbitration of the dispute or controversy, including discovery, shall be conducted in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures that do not conflict with the FAA (unless otherwise modified herein) which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (b) The parties agree that damages awarded, if any, in arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the law of the state where this contract is entered applicable to a comparable civil action.

Expenses of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties to this Agreement. All matters relating to the arbitration, the arbitration proceedings and the arbitration award, shall remain confidential between the parties.

In the event that any portion of this Agreement will be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will be deemed to continue to be binding upon the parties hereto in the same matter as if the invalid or unenforceable provision were not a part of the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   II. The Undersigned, by signing this Agreement, also acknowledges that the Undersigned has been informed that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (a) Care, diagnosis or treatment will be provided whether or not the Undersigned signs the Agreement to arbitrate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (b) The execution of this Agreement is not a precondition to receiving medical treatment or for admission to the Facility;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (c) The Agreement shall not be submitted to the Resident for approval\n   when the Resident's condition prevents the Resident from making a rational decision whether or not to agree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (d) The decision whether or not to sign the Agreement is solely a matter for the Undersigned's determination without any influence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (e) The Agreement waives the Undersigned's right to a trial in court, before a judge and/or a jury, for all disputes including those at law or in equity, subject to binding arbitration under this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (f) The Undersigned has the right to seek legal counsel concerning execution of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (g) The Undersigned has received two (2) copies of this Agreement and acknowledges that the terms have been explained to him/her or his/her designee by a representative of the Facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (h) The Undersigned has had an opportunity to ask questions about this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (i) The undersigned has had an opportunity to review the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures made available to the undersigned before signing this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (j) No provision of this Agreement is intended to waive or extend applicable Statute of Limitations provided by state law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 6. Next, the resident's \"right to cancel\" the arbitration agreement is set out on a separate page within the agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    RESIDENT'S RIGHT TO CANCEL RESIDENT AND FACILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I. (a) The Undersigned have the right to cancel this Agreement by notifying the Facility in writing within thirty (30) days after the Undersigned's signing of the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (b) The Undersigned may cancel this Agreement by merely writing \"CANCELLED\" on the face of one of the Undersigned's copies of the Agreement, signing their name underneath, and mailing, by certified mail, return receipt requested, the copy to the Facility within the thirty-day period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 7. Greg Massey initialed each page of the arbitration agreement, including the notice of the \"right to cancel\" the agreement, to affirm that he had read the information and/or had it explained to him. Finally, Carol Massey and Greg Massey both signed on the signature page of the agreement. Immediately above their signatures, the agreement states in all capital letters: \"The Undersigned acknowledge that each of them has read this entire Agreement and understands that by signing this Agreement each has waived his/her right to a trial before a judge and/or a jury, and that each of them voluntarily consents to all of the terms of this Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 8. The Masseys also both signed a separate \"Admission Agreement\" that addressed payments to the facility, nursing and physician care, and other matters. As discussed below, Massey alleges that several provisions of the admission agreement are unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 9. Around the time the Masseys signed the arbitration agreement and the admission agreement, Mrs. Massey was admitted to the facility. The Masseys did not exercise the right to cancel the arbitration agreement within thirty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 10. Mrs. Massey passed away on August 31, 2014. Mr. Massey subsequently served Oasis and its director of nursing,\n   Coretta Carter, with a notice of claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-36\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012), and then filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Oasis and Carter in the Yazoo County Circuit Court. Mr. Massey's complaint alleged that Oasis's \"nursing staff negligently allowed Ms. Massey to endure multiple falls\" that resulted in injuries and pain and suffering and ultimately caused or contributed to her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 11. Oasis and Carter filed a motion to compel arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Massey opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and that the admission agreement superseded and nullified the arbitration agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court found that the arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable and granted Oasis's motion to compel arbitration. Massey then filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Miss. R. Civ. P. 59(e), which essentially asked the court to reconsider its ruling. Oasis filed a response, and the circuit court denied Massey's motion. Massey then filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 12. On appeal, Massey argues that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable and that the admission agreement superseded and nullified the arbitration agreement. We address these arguments below. However, we must first address a potential issue of this Court's appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Appellate Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 13. Before addressing the merits of the appeal, we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to decide the appeal. Specifically, we must determine whether Massey's notice of appeal was timely. \"A timely-filed notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to invoking this Court's review ....\"\n   <em>\n    Calvert v. Griggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206247\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/992/627/#p631\">\n    992 So.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (\u00b6 9) (Miss. 2008). Oasis has not challenged the timeliness of the appeal, but \"an appellate court must address issues of jurisdiction on its own motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v. Southwire Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811154\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/1275/#p1279\">\n    191 So.3d 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1279 (\u00b6 15) (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 14. Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) provides that, \"[e]xcept as provided in Rules 4(d) and 4(e), in a civil or criminal case in which an appeal ... is permitted by law as of right ... , the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 shall be filed with the clerk of the trial court within 30 days after the date of entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\" M.R.A.P. 4(a). An order compelling arbitration is appealable as of right.\n   <em>\n    Sawyers v. Herrin-Gear Chevrolet Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7052022\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/26/1026/#p1034\">\n    26 So.3d 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1034 (\u00b6 19) (Miss. 2010). In this case, the circuit court entered its order compelling arbitration on November 9, 2016. Therefore, Massey's notice of appeal originally was due on December 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 15. However, Rule 4(d) provides that the timely filing of certain motions will extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   If a party \"files a timely motion\" to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 59, the time for appeal runs from the date of the entry of the order disposing of the Rule 59 motion. M.R.A.P. 4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 16. As noted above, Massey did file a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment. However, Massey's motion was not \"timely.\" \"A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be filed not later than ten days after entry of the judgment.\" M.R.C.P. 59(e). Moreover, \"[t]he trial court has no authority or discretion to extend the 10-day time period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7052022\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/26/1026/#p1034\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , advisory committee note. The circuit court entered its order compelling arbitration on November 9, 2016, and the tenth day fell on Saturday, November 19, 2016, so any motion to alter or amend the judgment was due on Monday, November 21, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 6(a). Massey filed his motion to alter or amend the judgment on Tuesday, November 22, 2016-one day too late. Massey apparently mailed the motion to the clerk on Friday, November 18, 2016, but it was not\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   until November 22.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 5(e)(1) (\"The filing of pleadings and other papers with the court as required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court ....\");\n   <em>\n    Bolton v.

Ct. App. 2017) (explaining that a paper is not \"filed\" until the clerk actually receives it).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 17. The circuit court denied Massey's motion to alter or amend the judgment on December 15, 2016, and Massey filed his notice of appeal on January 11, 2017. Thus, Massey filed his appeal within thirty days of the circuit court's ruling on his (untimely) motion to alter or amend the judgment, but\n   <em>\n    sixty-three\n   </em>\n   days after entry of the order compelling arbitration. This raises a question as to our appellate jurisdiction because an untimely Rule 59 motion \"does not toll the thirty-day time period to file a notice of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Woods v. Victory Mktg. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013632\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/111/1234/#p1236\">\n    111 So.3d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1236 (\u00b6 8) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013). Therefore, Massey's attempt to appeal from the underlying order compelling arbitration also appears to be untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013632\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/111/1234/#p1236\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, our Supreme Court has held that Rule 59(e)'s ten-day deadline and the thirty-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal are \"absolute\" and \"inflexible\" and may not be extended in civil cases.\n   <em>\n    Wilburn v. Wilburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n    991 So.2d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 18. However, in a prior case involving materially identical circumstances, the Mississippi Supreme Court treated the appeal as timely and exercised jurisdiction. In\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   , the chancery court entered an appealable order on June 1, 2007, and the appellant (Chasity) filed a Rule 59(e)\"motion for reconsideration\" on June 12, 2007.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n    at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 12) &amp; n.11.

The chancery court denied Chasity's Rule 59 motion on July 19, 2007, and Chasity then filed a notice of appeal on August 9, 2007-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , within thirty days of the denial of her Rule 59 motion, but\n   <em>\n    sixty-eight\n   </em>\n   days after the entry of the underlying order that she sought to appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n    at 1190-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 8, 12). The appellee (William) argued that Chasity's Rule 59 motion and the appeal were both untimely, and the Supreme Court agreed that Chasity's Rule 59 motion \"was untimely.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n    at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 12-13). However, the Supreme Court also found that William failed to object to the Rule 59 motion as untimely when it was filed in the chancery court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court further held that William was \"procedurally barred from raising this issue for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210864\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1185/#p1191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 13).

In substance, it appears that the Supreme Court\n   <em>\n    deemed\n   </em>\n   Chasity's\n   Rule 59 motion timely because William failed to raise the issue in the chancery court, which meant that her appeal was also timely and that the Court had appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 19.

As in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , this Court is bound to follow the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, just as in\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   , Massey filed his Rule 59 motion one day too late, and Oasis responded to the motion on the merits-without objecting to the motion as untimely. After the circuit court denied Massey's Rule 59 motion, Massey filed a notice of appeal. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   , Massey filed his notice of appeal within thirty days of the order denying his Rule 59 motion, but more than sixty days after entry of the underlying order. As to the issue of appellate jurisdiction, there is no material difference between this case and\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   , we have jurisdiction to address the appeal and the merits of the underlying order compelling arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Unconscionability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 21. Massey's primary argument on appeal is that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable. Massey's unconscionability claim has two sub-arguments: (1) the arbitration agreement itself is unconscionable and (2) the arbitration agreement and admission agreement should be treated as if they were a single \"integrated\" contract, and certain provisions of the admission agreement are unconscionable, rendering the entire integrated contract unconscionable. We address these arguments in turn below. In doing so, we apply generally applicable principles of Mississippi contract law and the Federal Arbitration Act, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Rather, the Masseys' arbitration agreement expressly stated that it was \"voluntary and not a condition for admission.\" Moreover, the Masseys' arbitration agreement clearly stated they could cancel the agreement for any reason within thirty days of signing it. Had the Masseys exercised their unilateral right to cancel the arbitration agreement, Mrs. Massey still could have continued as a resident at the\n   facility, and the separate admission agreement would have remained in effect. Each agreement clearly was intended to operate as an independent, stand-alone agreement. Given the clear terms of the arbitration agreement, we cannot conclude that the parties intended for these two separate agreements to be treated as a single \"integrated\" contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 41. Because the arbitration agreement and the admission agreement are independent contracts, we cannot hold that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable based on terms contained only in the admission agreement.

However,\n   <em>\n    Moulds\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because the arbitration agreement in\n   <em>\n    Moulds\n   </em>\n   was part of the admission agreement, a condition of admission to the facility, and a \"contract of adhesion.\"\n   <em>\n    Moulds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7056669\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/14/695/#p699\">\n    14 So.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19) &amp; n.4. Here, in contrast, the arbitration agreement was a separate and voluntary agreement that was not a condition of Mrs. Massey's admission to the facility. Under generally applicable state contract law and federal arbitration law, unconscionable provisions of the admission agreement are not a basis for invalidating the parties' separate arbitration agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Admission Agreement's \"Entire Agreement\" Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 44. Massey also makes an alternative argument that the admission agreement's \"Entire Agreement\" or \"merger\" clause supersedes the parties' arbitration agreement. That clause states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Entire Agreement.\n   </strong>\n   This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter contained in it and supercedes all prior arrangements, representations and all understandings of the Parties. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless expressed as such and executed in writing by all the Parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Massey argues that the effect of this merger clause is to nullify the parties' \"prior\" arbitration agreement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 45. To begin with, the precise order in which the two agreements were signed is not clear. As discussed above, the record contains no affidavits or any evidence other than the agreements. In the arbitration agreement, the signatures of Mr. Massey and an Oasis representative are dated March 3, 2014, whereas Mrs. Massey's signature is dated March 5, 2014. The admission agreement states that Mrs. Massey was admitted to the facility on March 4, 2014, but it is dated March 14, 2014. At the hearing in the circuit court, Oasis's counsel conceded that the March 14 date could be an \"error\" because Mrs. Massey was admitted ten days earlier. On appeal, Massey goes a step further, asserting that the March 14 date \"is likely erroneous.\" Massey argues that the admission agreement likely was executed when Mrs. Massey was admitted on March 4. Massey then posits that the arbitration agreement was in effect\n   <em>\n    for only one day\n   </em>\n   . That is, he argues that the arbitration agreement was effective when he and an Oasis representative signed it on March 3, but then it was\n   <em>\n    nullified\n   </em>\n   when the admission agreement was (likely) signed on March 4. Mr. Massey does not address the effect of Mrs. Massey's signature on the arbitration agreement on March 5. Mr. Massey's theory appears to be that the agreement was already null and void by the time Mrs. Massey signed it. We also note that the arbitration agreement states that the parties had \"entered into\" the admission agreement, implying that the admission agreement was signed first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5 (section I of the arbitration agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 46. In any event, we conclude that the precise order and dates of the signatures are unimportant because the admission agreement's merger clause did not nullify the arbitration agreement regardless of the order in which the two agreements were signed. \"As interpreted in Mississippi (and elsewhere), standard merger clauses like this are a means to solidify the parol-evidence rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Rifenburg Constr.

In this case, there is nothing to suggest that the admission agreement was intended to void the separate arbitration agreement that the parties signed at or around the same time. The merger clause does not expressly void or supersede the arbitration agreement. Indeed, the admission agreement as a whole does not even mention arbitration or the arbitration agreement. The arbitration agreement, in contrast, does mention the admission agreement. It states that the parties had \"entered into\" a separate admission agreement, indicating an intent that both agreements would remain in effect. Moreover, as discussed, the arbitration agreement also gave the Masseys thirty days to withdraw their consent to arbitrate by delivering a cancelled copy of the agreement to Oasis. This also contradicts Massey's argument that an admission agreement, executed at the same time or maybe a day later, was intended to cancel the arbitration agreement sub silentio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 48. We must determine a contract's \"legal purpose and intent of the parties from an objective reading of the words employed in the contract,\" and we are \"not at liberty to infer intent contrary to ... the text at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Royer Homes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9085289\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/857/748/#p752\">\n    857 So.2d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). Based on an objective reading of the words of these contracts, it is clear that the parties intended that the separate arbitration agreement would remain in effect. Nothing in the entire admission agreement \"suggest[s] an intent to expand the merger clause beyond its well-recognized and routine purpose\" of solidifying the parol evidence rule and barring evidence of \"preliminary negotiations.\"\n   <em>\n    Rifenburg Constr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202381136\">\n    2015 WL 2381136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. That is, there is nothing to indicate that the admission agreement was intended to\n   <em>\n    void\n   </em>\n   the arbitration agreement that the parties signed at or near the same time. Accordingly, Massey's argument based on the merger clause is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 49.

It was not a condition of admission to the facility, and the Masseys could have rejected it, even after they signed it, without any loss of services or other consequences. Moreover, Massey offered no evidence of a lack of knowledge or a lack of voluntariness in the contracting process.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Massey also failed to meet his burden of proving that the arbitration agreement's fee-sharing provision is unconscionable. Nonetheless, pursuant to JAMS's policy, Massey will have to pay only a $250 filing fee, and Oasis must pay all other arbitration fees.\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , Massey cannot attack the arbitration clause based on provisions of the admission agreement. The arbitration agreement and the admission agreement are separate agreements and cannot be recharacterized as one \"integrated\" or \"global\" contract. Under both state and federal law, the agreements' status as separate contracts cannot be ignored.\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   , the admission agreement's merger clause did not void the arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 50.

The most important fact in this case is that the arbitration agreement was voluntary and was not a condition of admission or any other service. The agreement could have been rejected, or even cancelled later,\n   without consequence. The agreement is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a \"contract of adhesion,\" and Massey presented no evidence of any unfairness or lack of voluntariness in the contracting process.

As the state's appellate courts had-before\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   -routinely found that the time to file a Rule 59 motion was binding on our jurisdictional requirement of a timely-filed notice of appeal, the treatment provided in\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   is a departure from established precedent.
