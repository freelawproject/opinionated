The vehicle at issue was involved in a one car accident while being driven by Jairi Thibeaux, an excluded driver under the terms of policy number 88797-20 issued to Mrs. Thibeaux by GoAuto. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 11, 2016, while Ms. Thibeaux was not at home, Jairi Thibeaux, her seventeen-year-old son, took her Mustang without permission and was in a single vehicle collision a few hundred yards from their home causing extensive damage to the vehicle. The accident did not involve third party fault. The GoAuto Policy denied coverage for the accident based on the \"Named Driver Exclusion Endorsement\" which specifically excluded Jairi as a driver of the Mustang under the terms of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When GoAuto denied Mrs. Thibeaux's claim for damages to the Mustang, she filed suit and moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of collision coverage. The deposition testimony of Mrs. Thibeaux and Jairi Thibeaux, as well as Mrs. Thibeaux's affidavit filed in support of the motion for partial summary judgment, are clear that Jairi did not have permission to drive his mother's Mustang on the day of the accident or any other day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court, \"after considering the law, memoranda and argument of counsel and the insurance policy, affidavits and deposition testimony[,]\" found as follows in its December 29, 2017 judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that Summary Judgment is granted in favor of Shantanya Thibeaux, the Court finding that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Jairi Thibeaux did not have permission to operate the 2008 Mustang owned by Shantanya Thibeaux on the day of the collision, May 11, 2016, and there is property damage collision coverage afforded to Shantanya Thibeaux for the 2008 Mustang arising out of the collision of May 11, 2016[,] under the GoAuto Policy of Insurance policy no. 88797-20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   GoAuto now timely appeals the trial court's December 29, 2017 judgment on the basis that the insurance policy at issue excludes collision coverage when the vehicle\n   is being operated by Jairi Thibeaux, a named excluded driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   GoAuto appeals the trial court's ruling asserting one assignment of error as follows: \"The district court's granting of summary judgment on coverage in favor of Ms. Thibeaux was contrary to the terms of the Named Driver Exclusion Endorsement, was contrary to Louisiana statutes providing that such exclusion is enforceable, and was error.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An appellate court reviews a trial court's granting of a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

On May 11, 2016, while Mrs. Thibeaux was at work, her young son, Jairi Thibeaux (Jairi), took the car without permission and headed down the road to school. Mrs. Thibeaux and Jairi testified Jairi knew he was forbidden to drive the car. Both testified his mom did not know Jairi took the car without her permission on the morning of the accident. Jairi testified the accident occurred when he was forced onto the shoulder of the road by an oncoming vehicle veering into his lane of travel. Despite this uncontradicted testimony the majority says this was a one-car accident and concludes \"there is no third-party fault at issue.\" This is not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Following the accident Mrs. Thibeaux filed a claim with GoAuto for payment in accordance with the insurance policy's provision covering damage or loss resulting from a collision. GoAuto denied coverage and refused to pay any amount to Mrs. Thibeaux for the loss of her vehicle because it construed the provision listing Jairi as an excluded driver to be an all-inclusive proviso. Mrs. Thibeaux sued GoAuto and moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability for the loss of the vehicle. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Mrs. Thibeaux.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review the majority finds GoAuto has no liability to Mrs. Thibeaux for the loss of the Mustang because Jairi was an excluded driver at the time of the accident. It finds the excluded driver provision in this insurance contract is an all-inclusive provision which renders irrelevant any consideration of whether Jairi had implied or express permission or was driving without permission at the time of the accident.

Louisiana Revised Statute 32:865 provides criminal penalties for failure to carry compulsory liability insurance required under La.R.S. 32:861. Louisiana Revised Statute 32:866 places limitations on the amount a person may recover for personal injury and/or property damages when they have failed to comply with the compulsory liability insurance law. This statute did not include any language regarding authorized versus unauthorized users, whereas, La.R.S. 32:865(A) 3(b) expressly provides that the statutory criminal penalties do not apply: \"To the owner of a motor vehicle if at the time of the accident the vehicle was being operated without his permission, express or implied, or was parked by a person who had been operating such motor vehicle without such permission.\" It was therefore necessary for the supreme court to decide the issue in\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   regarding the applicability of the \"no pay, no play\" civil penalties to an unauthorized user. The reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   t and\n   <em>\n    Khaliq\n   </em>\n   making the civil penalties provided in La.R.S. 32:866\n   <em>\n    inapplicable to unauthorized users\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     even where that user is a named excluded driver\n    </strong>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   is consistent with the statutory scheme in La.R.S. 32:865 which expressly does not hold an owner culpable under the criminal statute for failure to carry compulsory liability insurance when the driver is\n   <em>\n    an unauthorized\n   </em>\n   user.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The import of the supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   was clear to this court in\n   <em>\n    Khaliq\n   </em>\n   and I believe the majority errs in ignoring this court's previous decision. Mr. Khaliq's son, like Jairi, was an excluded driver. Khaliq's son, like Jairi, took the vehicle without his parent's permission or knowledge. This, we said, was \"no different from a thief taking and wrecking the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Khaliq\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326565\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/933/\">\n    950 So.2d at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We further noted \"it has long been recognized that an insured may recover for property damage under the collision coverage when the damage is sustained\n   <em>\n    while the insured vehicle is in the possession of an\n    <strong>\n     unauthorized\n    </strong>\n    person.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326565\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/933/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326565\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/933/\">\n    at 936-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The majority finds that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   is \"distinguishable\" and was limited to the \"no pay,\n   no play\" situation. But a panel of this court rejected that assertion in\n   <em>\n    Khaliq\n   </em>\n   and it should be rejected here. As this court's panel said in\n   <em>\n    Khaliq\n   </em>\n   , it is a \"distinction[ ] without a difference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326565\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/933/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326565\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/950/933/\">\n    at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The distinction here, without a real difference, is that the unauthorized person, Jairi, was not a thief.

This provision in the insurance contract means that Mrs. Thibeaux\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      is\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    covered for loss by conversion (or theft) when she has\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     given permission\n    </em>\n    to such an individual\n   </strong>\n   .

Under any of the policy provisions regarding coverage for loss of the vehicle there is no coverage when the loss is caused either by theft, conversion, for criminal purposes, or by a named excluded driver, when such is done with the owner's permission or authorization.

The insurance policy clearly includes coverage for such conversion of Mrs. Thibeaux's property by an\n   <em>\n    unauthorized user\n   </em>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    only caveat to this coverage\n   </em>\n   provided in the policy is that this coverage is forfeited if the person who commits the tortious conversion was a\n   <em>\n    permissive\n   </em>\n   user. This provision in the policy\n   <em>\n    does not include\n   </em>\n   any language in the policy\n   <em>\n    excluding coverage\n   </em>\n   for conversion by a named excluded driver acting\n   <em>\n    without permission\n   </em>\n   . It would have been easy to include such a provision, but the contract is silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The provisions in this insurance contract are consistent with Louisiana law on conversion. \"Issues of fault, intent, negligence, knowledge or ignorance, and/or good faith are not involved in actions for tortious conversion.\"\n   <em>\n    Labbe v.

Because this insurer provided coverage for damages occasioned by unauthorized users in several circumstances, they have undoubtedly considered such loss in the calculation of premiums. Thus, it seems disingenuous for GoAuto to assert that if it is made to pay for Mrs. Thibeaux's car, she would be getting such coverage free. The majority implicitly accepts this argument stating: \"Under the provisions of La.R.S. 32:900(L), an individual and its insurer are free to contract for no coverage for certain named excluded drivers in exchange for a reduced premium.\"\n   <strong>\n    The supreme court expressly rejected this notion in\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The policy provisions for determining the amount of the insured's recovery for loss by conversion is also consistent with the jurisprudential determination of damages for conversion: \"The measure of damages for tortious conversion, when the property cannot be returned to the plaintiff[ ], is the value of the property at the time of conversion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dual Drilling\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Co. v.

This is precisely the recompense provided for in this insurance policy, and it is\n   exactly the measure of damages Mrs. Thibeaux seeks, and to which she is entitled, less the \"applicable deductible\" or \"depreciation\" as provided in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Likewise, had the damage to Mrs. Thibeaux's vehicle been caused by a thief the policy provides coverage for loss occasioned by such an unauthorized user.

That panel reasoned that \"to allow plaintiff to recover from the defendant, Safeway, in this case would make the terms of La.R.S. 32:900(L) meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050502,7050535\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/26/777/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050502,7050535\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/26/777/\">\n    at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statute deals with motor vehicle liability coverage and provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (B)(2) of this Section, an insurer and an insured may by written agreement exclude from coverage the named insured and the spouse of the named insured. The insurer and an insured may also exclude from coverage any other named person who is a resident of the same household as the named insured at the time that the written agreement is entered into, and the exclusion shall be effective, regardless of whether the excluded person continues to remain a resident of the same household subsequent to the execution of the written agreement...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   La.R.S. 32:900(L) 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The panel in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   said it \"did not disagree with the outcome in\n   <em>\n    Khaliq\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   . at 779, but found it was not applicable to that case. It also discussed the\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   decision but likewise found it inapplicable. The decision in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   is not inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Khaliq\n   </em>\n   nor with my position here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The insurance contract here provides coverage for the\n   <em>\n    damages caused by the tortious conversion\n   </em>\n   of Mrs. Thibeaux's property by an unauthorized user who was a named excluded driver. Mrs. Thibeaux is entitled to coverage for the loss of her Mustang as provided in the GoAuto insurance policy. For the reasons stated I believe there was no error in the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Furthermore, we must certainly all be aware that in today's world many households have any number of licensed drivers residing with their parent and/or grandparents. One can easily imagine a household of three, four and five individuals residing with their parent or grandparent and the extremely burdensome dilemma the majority decision will impose on many people. To interpret the insurance contract at issue and the cited jurisprudence as the majority has will mean that no one can take the risk that will now be included in failing to insure all persons of driving age living in the owner's residence at the time the policy is issued. The cost would be prohibitive for many. Because the decision of this panel is at odds with a decision by a\n   previous panel of this court and with the prior holdings of the Louisiana Supreme Court, I believe this case merits an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   hearing. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
