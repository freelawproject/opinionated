Kelvin Lebeau appeals the trial court's October 12, 2017 judgment granting the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendants Deutsche Bank and Trust Company Americas (\"Deutsche Bank\") and Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc. (\"Saxon\") (collectively, \"Appellees\"). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Mr. Lebeau was not wrongfully evicted from property located at 11631 West Barrington Drive in New Orleans, Louisiana (\"Property\"). Instead,\n   we find that Mr. Lebeau abandoned the Property secured by the mortgage. And under the terms of the mortgage, Appellees had the contractual right to physically secure and preserve the Property, while still giving Mr. Lebeau full access to Property. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 26, 2006, Mr. Lebeau entered into an adjustable rate note (\"Note\") in the amount of $ 117,000.00 plus interest, payable to Novastar Mortgage, Inc. (\"Novastar\"). The Note was secured by a mortgage (\"Mortgage\") executed on that date by Mr. Lebeau, which encumbered his Property. Deutsche Bank, as trustee for Novastar, was the holder and owner of the Note and Mortgage. Deutsche Bank retained Saxon to service Mr. Lebeau's Mortgage, which included the right to collect and apply payments received to Mr. Lebeau's mortgage loan, and take steps to secure the Property in the event of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 4, 2010, after Mr. Lebeau defaulted under the terms of the Mortgage and Note, Deutsche Bank filed a \"Petition for Suit on a Note and Enforcement of Mortgage on Real Estate\" in Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans. Saxon retained CoreLogic Field Services (\"CoreLogic\") to inspect and secure Mr. Lebeau's Property after he defaulted on the loan. CoreLogic contracted with Southern Customs of Louisiana (\"Southern Customs\") to perform the property inspection and preservation services for Saxon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his Petition for Damages, Mr. Lebeau alleged that on January 20, 2010, defendants or their agents broke into his Property and illegally resorted to \"self-help\" repossession by changing the locks, breaking into the doors, breaking locked gates, and posting signs on the Property. In his Amended Petition, Mr. Lebeau alleged that Deutsche Bank and its agents wrongfully evicted him and illegally took possession of his Property by breaking and entering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 2, 2012, Saxon filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that the Mr. Lebeau's Mortgage gave Deutsche Bank the right to take whatever steps were reasonable and appropriate to protect Deutsche Bank's interest in the Property, which included securing or repairing the Property. On January 8, 2013, the trial court denied Saxon's Motion for Summary Judgment. This judgment is not at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 16, 2017, after Mr. Lebeau's deposition was taken, Deutsche Bank filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, seeking dismissal of Mr. Lebeau's claims on the grounds that he had abandoned the Property, which was vacant when Southern Customs secured and winterized the Property on January 20, 2010. On June 22, 2017, Saxon joined in Deutsche Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment. After a hearing on August 31, 2017, the trial court signed a judgment dated October 12, 2017, granting the Appellees' Motion for Summary Judgment, and dismissing Mr. Lebeau's claims against them, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Lebeau timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review in examining a trial court's ruling on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Hare v.

Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, entering the property to make repairs, change locks, replace or board up doors and windows, drain water from pipes, eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and have utilities turned on or off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellees' Summary Judgment Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Appellees presented the following evidence in support of their Motion For Summary Judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 20, 2010, Jerry Jacques, acting on behalf of Southern Customs, inspected the Property and found the house was devoid of furniture, all major appliances were missing, and only a few personal objects remained. According to Southern Customs work orders, Mr. Jacques changed the lock only on the back door of the Property. Mr. Jacques also took photographs of the Property on January 20, 2010, which showed that it was vacant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellees submitted Orleans Parish Sheriff's service records showing that Sheriff's Deputy Robert Jordan found the Property to be \"vacant\" when he attempted to serve Mr. Lebeau with a foreclosure petition on January 13, 2010. Appellees also offered records provided by Entergy in response to a subpoena showing that in October 2009, electrical service to the Property was \"cut out for nonpayment.\" The records reflect that gas service to the property was shut off in November 2010, and that the electrical meter was removed entirely in April 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Lebeau's Summary Judgment Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Lebeau submitted two of his affidavits, the affidavit of his brother, Keith Lebeau; the affidavit of his neighbor and friend, Tyrone Roby; and the affidavit of his family friend, Patrick Williams. Mr. Lebeau attested that he was working in Baton Rouge on January 20, 2010, when he received a phone call from a neighbor that his home had been broken into. He stated in his affidavit that he drove to New Orleans and confronted two Southern Customs representatives inside his home. In his deposition, Mr. Lebeau was shown the photographs taken by Mr. Jacques and admitted that they accurately depicted the vacant condition of the house on January 20, 2010, even though he stated in his affidavit that the house was full of furniture and appliances. Mr. Lebeau stated in his affidavit that he and his friends removed all of his furniture and appliances on January 21, 2010. After being shown Mr. Jacques's photographs, Mr. Lebeau testified in his deposition that he may have removed the dishwasher and refrigerator from his house on January 18 or 19, 2010 (before the entry by Southern Customs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Contrary to the physical evidence, Mr. Williams attested that Southern Customs turned off the utilities and the water at the residence when it entered the Property. Keith Lebeau, Mr. Lebeau's brother, attested that he visited Mr. Lebeau several days prior to the entry, and Mr. Lebeau still lived there with full utilities. Keith Lebeau and Mr. Roby also attested that there was bedroom furniture, living room furniture, dining room furniture, kitchen appliances, and a pool table at the residence on January 20, 2010. Contrary to Mr. Lebeau's deposition, all four affiants stated that they moved all of Mr. Lebeau's furniture and appliances out of the house the day after January 20, 2010. All four affiants also declared that Mr. Lebeau was living in the Property on and before January 20, 2010, and that he did not abandon the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Wrongful Eviction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Lebeau contends that breaking, entering, changing some or all of the locks, and verbally ordering him off the Property constitute wrongful eviction by Appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Regency Motors of Metairie, L.L.C. v. Hibernia-Rosenthal Ins. Agency, L.L.C.,\n   </em>\n   03-1212, pp. 6-7 (La.

Louisiana jurisprudence interpreting this term consistently requires that the occupant be actually denied physical\n   entry to the premises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pelleteri v.Caspian Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 02-2141, 02-2142, p. 3 (La.

App. 4th Cir. 1978) (bank changed the locks and refused to let plaintiff to enter the property to retrieve his movables).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, Mr. Lebeau was not denied physical access to the Property. Mr. Jacques of Southern Customs testified that he only changed the back lock of the house, which allowed Mr. Lebeau to enter the house through the front door. A work order from Southern Customs confirms that only the back door lock was changed. Mr. Lebeau admitted that the front door lock had not been changed and that he could freely enter the house, which he did. He offered no evidence to show that he was ever prevented from accessing, entering, or residing at the Property. In fact, Mr. Lebeau never made any effort to move back into the Property, and he testified that he did not want the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Lebeau also contends that he was wrongfully evicted because Deutsche Bank instituted a wrongful foreclosure proceeding. Mr. Lebeau's Property, however, has never been foreclosed upon, wrongfully or otherwise. The January 4, 2010 foreclosure proceeding remains pending today. Mr. Lebeau admitted that Appellees have never obtained a foreclosure judgment and never taken title to the Property. Because this is not a foreclosure suit, the trial court properly did not address Mr. Lebeau's contentions regarding self-help in violation of Louisiana law. As the trial court did find, Deutsche Bank and Saxon had the contractual right under the Mortgage to protect and secure the Property if it was abandoned and, as discussed below, Mr. Lebeau had in fact abandoned the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Abandonment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With respect to the issue of abandonment, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [T]he evidence provided by [Appellees] undisputedly shows that the property was abandoned when Southern Customs entered the property in order to determine that it was abandoned and in order to secure the property..... [Mr. Lebeau's] conflicting affidavits are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We agree. The summary judgment record shows that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 The electricity to the house had been turned off in October 2009 because of non-payment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 The photographs taken by Mr. Jacques show that the furniture and major appliances had been removed as of January 20, 2010;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 The Orleans Parish Sheriff's records show that the house was vacant when the Sheriff's Deputy tried to serve Mr. Lebeau with a foreclosure petition on January 13, 2010;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 The gas service to the house was turned off in November 10, 2010;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 The electrical meter was removed in April 2011 because the property was vacant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A genuine issue is one as to which reasonable persons could disagree; if reasonable persons could reach only one conclusion, no need for trial on that issue exists and summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Chatelain v.

Based on the overwhelming physical evidence produced by Appellees -- and the conclusory, conflicting testimony offered by Mr. Lebeau -- reasonable minds must inevitably conclude that Mr. Lebeau will not be able to satisfy his evidentiary burden of proof at trial and, therefore, Appellees are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Admissibility of Appellees' Affidavits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Mr. Lebeau contends that the affidavits of William R.

Saxon introduced Mr. Ferguson's affidavit in support of its November 2, 2012 motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied and which is not at issue on this appeal. Mr. Ferguson's affidavit, thus, need not be addressed by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mr. Crane's affidavit was introduced in support of the appellees' summary judgment at issue to authenticate business records-the work order forms prepared by a Southern Customs' employee and the photographs submitted with the work order.
