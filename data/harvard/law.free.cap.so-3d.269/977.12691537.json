Finding that Alliance met its burden of proving the absence of any genuine issues of material fact such that it was entitled to judgment in its favor as a matter of law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mitchell filed a Form 1008 Disputed Claim for Compensation (1008) against Alliance on January 9, 2017, alleging that she sustained a workplace injury on December 5, 2016, when her right hand got caught in a machine. In the 1008, Mitchell listed the following items as being in \"BONA-FIDE DISPUTE:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   a.

Legal interest on all awards from appropriate date\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After prior trial dates had been continued six times, without opposition, by both Mitchell and Alliance, the matter was refixed for an August 9, 2018 trial. In advance of the trial, Alliance filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on June 5, 2018, seeking to have Mitchell's claims against it dismissed. The workers' compensation judge (WCJ) scheduled Alliance's motion for a July 5, 2018 hearing. On July 3, 2018, a flurry of motions was filed. Mitchell filed a Motion to Continue or, Alternatively, Motion to Refer to the Merits, which sought to require Alliance to show cause on July 5, 2018, why Mitchell's motion to continue should not be granted; the WCJ signed the order submitted by Mitchell which resulted in her motion to continue being set on the same day as the summary judgment hearing. Mitchell also\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   to file a pleading titled Opposition to Motion Fo [sic] Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Alliance filed a memorandum in opposition to Mitchell's motion to continue, as well as a response to Mitchell's substantive opposition to its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Neither Mitchell nor her counsel appeared at the July 5, 2018 hearing. The WCJ orally denied Mitchell's motion to continue or refer to the merits, and granted summary judgment in favor of Alliance, dismissing Mitchell's claims against it with prejudice. The WCJ signed a written judgment in conformity with its oral reasons on July 13, 2018. Mitchell timely filed a motion for new trial which the WCJ, following a hearing, denied by judgment dated August 23, 2018. Mitchell appealed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and is now before this court asserting that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1 The WCJ abused his discretion in refusing to refer the summary judgment motion to a trial on the merits that was only 35 days away when the motion to refer clearly delineated significant factual material issues, which defendant did not dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2 The WCJ erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment, failing to thoroughly review\n   the documentary evidence and dismissing plaintiff's claim in its entirety.

In finding no error in the trial court's denial of the plaintiff's motion, we explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 1601 provides that \"[a] continuance may be granted in any case if there is good ground therefor.\" Under La.Code Civ.P. art. 1602, a continuance must be granted if \"the party applying for the continuance shows that he has been unable, with the exercise of due diligence, to obtain evidence material to his case; or that a material witness has absented himself without the contrivance of the party applying for the continuance.\" The court in\n   <em>\n    Suarez v. Acosta\n   </em>\n   , 15-750, pp. 9-10 (La.App. 5 Cir. 3/16/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793303\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/626/#p632\">\n    194 So.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632 (citations omitted) discussed the trial court's discretion in granting or denying a continuance and stated in pertinent part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In determining whether to grant a continuance, the trial court must consider the particular facts in each case. Some factors to consider are diligence, good faith, and reasonable grounds. The trial court may also weigh the condition of the court docket, fairness to the parties and other litigants before the court, and the need for orderly and prompt administration of justice. A trial court has great discretion in granting or denying a motion for a continuance under La. C.C.P. art. 1601, and that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of\n   <strong>\n    clear abuse of discretion\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 475-76 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In her appellant brief, Mitchell asserts that the \"WCJ was itching to grant defendant's motion for summary judgment [, a]nd, in doing so, he deprived plaintiff of her day in court, which was only 35 days away.\" Citing this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marpco, Inc. v.

It directs this court's attention to the transcript of the July 5, 2018 hearing wherein the WCJ referenced a conference it had conducted with both parties' counsel of record on July 2, 2018, wherein the WCJ stated that it would not grant Mitchell's \"late request\" for a continuance. According to the transcript, the WCJ explained that, after being presented with an order filed by Mitchell's counsel setting a hearing on the motion to continue or refer to the merits to July 5,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   he signed the requested order, and his office faxed a copy of the signed order to Mitchell's counsel's office. Pointing to La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(C)(1)(a) (emphasis added), which provides that \"[u]nless otherwise agreed by all of the parties and the court [a] contradictory hearing on the motion for summary judgment\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   be set not less than thirty days after the filing and\n   <strong>\n    not less than thirty days prior to the trial date\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" Alliance asserts that Louisiana law does not permit motions for summary judgment to be \"referred to the merits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Initially, we note that neither Alliance nor the WCJ agreed to continue the summary judgment hearing. Given the fact that the hearing on Alliance's motion for summary judgment had been set since June 5, 2018, we cannot say that the WCJ abused its great discretion in denying a motion to continue that was filed just two days before the scheduled hearing. Moreover, even had Mitchell's request for a continuance been filed earlier, it was within the sound discretion of the WCJ to deny the request as Mitchell \"did not allege any peremptory grounds for a continuance.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673950\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/469/\">\n    248 So.3d at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dr. Kautz released plaintiff to work without restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   4. Plaintiff asked to see another doctor on December 12, 2016. Plaintiff saw Dr. William Luster, a family medicine physician, on December 16, 2016. Dr. Luster did not make any treatment recommendations, and referred plaintiff to Dr. Bryan Picou. Dr. Luster did not issue any work restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   5. Plaintiff reportedly saw Dr. Bryan Picou on or about December 22, 2016. Dr. Picou instructed plaintiff to care for her wound by soaking it in warm water, and reportedly suggested that plaintiff see a specialist. Dr. Picou did not issue any work restrictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   6. Between December 6, 2016 and January 5, 2017, plaintiff was released to work\n   <em>\n    without restrictions\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   7. Even though plaintiff was released to work without restrictions between December 6, 2016 and January 5, 2017, defendant accommodated plaintiff by allowing her the opportunity to work a light duty position, cleaning machines using only her non-injured left hand. Plaintiff is left handed; thus, this accommodation allowed Plaintiff to work exclusively with her dominant hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   8. Between plaintiff's accident and the filing of suit, plaintiff worked her usual pre-accident hours, earning her same pre-accident hourly wage rate of $ 14.09 per hour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   9. On Thursday, January 5, 2017, Bridges met with plaintiff and explained to her that she would have to return to her usual job duties on Monday, January 9, 2017, as no medical provider had restricted plaintiff from work in any way. Bridges explained to plaintiff that Friday, January 6, 2017 was an overtime day and her attendance that day would be optional. Plaintiff chose to take Friday, January 6th off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   10. After plaintiff was told that she would have to return to her regular job duties, on account of no medical provider having restricted her from work, she sought legal counsel and filed suit against defendant on January 9, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   11. Defendant took plaintiff's deposition on March 6, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   12. On January 13, 2017, defendant propounded its First Set of Requests for Admissions of Fact, Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents to plaintiff. After plaintiff failed to respond to defendant's written discovery requests, defendant conducted a Rule 10.1 conference. Plaintiff did not provide responses to the requests by the agreed-upon date. Accordingly, defendant filed a Motion to Compel responses. That matter was set for hearing before this Court\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   on April 10, 2017. Prior to the hearing on defendant's Motion to Compel, the parties entered into a consent\n   judgment, which ordered plaintiff to provide responses to defendant's discovery requests within 10 days of the signing of the judgment; this Court signed the judgment on April 3, 2017. As of September 6, 2017, plaintiff still had not responded to defendant's written discovery requests. Defendant, therefore, moved to have its First Set of Requests for Admissions of Fact deemed admitted. This Court signed an Order granting defendant's requested relief, and deeming plaintiff's Requests for Admissions of Fact admitted on or about September 6, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   13. Request for Admission Number 1, which asked: \"Do you admit that, as of January 9, 2017, you had received no work restrictions from any medical provider for any injury you sustained on December 5, 2016?\" has been deemed admitted by this Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   14. Request for Admission Number 2, which asked, \"Do you admit that, as of January 9, 2017, Alliance had provided transportation for you to any and all medical appointments you had as a result of the December 5, 2016 accident?\" has been deemed admitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   15. Request for Admission Number 3, which asked, \"Do you admit that January 9, 2017 was the first time that you or anyone acting on your behalf requested copies of medical reports of physicians selected by defendant?\" has been deemed admitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   16. Request for Admission Number 4, which asked, \"Do you admit you are still employed by defendant at the same or greater hourly wage that you received in the four full pay periods before December 5, 2016?\" has been deemed admitted by this Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   17. When suit was filed on January 9, 2017, 60 days had not yet passed from the December 5, 2016 accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   18. Plaintiff requested to see Dr. Michelle Ritter, for the first time on January 4, 2017. Plaintiff saw Dr. Ritter for an initial evaluation on January 23, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   19. As of the date suit was filed, plaintiff had not submitted any written mileage reimbursement requests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   20. Plaintiff first made a request for the written reports of any employer-selected physicians on January 9, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   21. At the time the written request for the reports of employer-selected physicians was submitted on January 9, 2017, no such reports were in defendant's possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   22. Plaintiff has never requested vocational rehabilitation benefits since the date of her accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In her motion to continue or refer to the merits, Mitchell made the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Multiple significant factual issues remain unresolved, e.g., nature and extent of disability resulting from plaintiff's crushing right hand injury[;] non-reimbursement of medical travel to Dr. Luster and the physical therapist, Dr. Wheat[;] non-reimbursement of medications from the NPH-ER, Dr. Ritter and Dr. Luster[;] nonpayment of indemnity benefits[;] untimely payments of work-related medical expenses[;] plaintiff's AWW[;] penalties and attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In her appellant brief, Mitchell goes even further, asserting that Alliance \"did not argue that the factual issues set forth in her motion were, indeed, disputed[,]\" nor did Alliance \"oppose the recitation of the disputed factual issues in the motion to refer to the merits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As mentioned previously, Mitchell's opposition was filed on July 3, 2018, just two days before the scheduled hearing date for Alliance's motion for summary judgment. That same afternoon, Alliance filed a\n   pleading titled Response to Plaintiff's Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment in which it pointed out the untimeliness of Mitchell's opposition and requested that the trial court not consider the opposition given the mandate in La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(B)(2) that \"Any opposition to the motion [for summary judgment] and all documents in support of the opposition\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be filed and served in accordance with Article 1313 not less than fifteen days prior to the hearing on the motion.\" (Emphasis added by Mitchell). At the start of the July 5, 2018 hearing, at which neither Mitchell nor her attorney was present, the WCJ stated on the record that because Mitchell's opposition was \"clearly untimely,\" it would \"not consider any opposition attempted to be filed\" on her behalf. In light of the preceding circumstances, we again find it extremely disingenuous for Mitchell to assert that Alliance \"did not oppose the recitation of the disputed factual issues in the motion to refer to the merits\" and that the \"WCJ was itching to grant defendant's motion for summary judgment.\" Suffice it to say that we, too, conclude that Mitchell's opposition to Alliance's motion for summary judgment was untimely and should not be considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   After having conducted a de novo review of the \"motion, memorandum, and supporting documents\" that Alliance filed in support of its motion for summary judgment, we find that Alliance overwhelmingly met its burden of proving \"the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to [Mitchell's] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(D)(1). Accordingly, the burden shifted to Mitchell \"to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that [Alliance] was not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673950\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/469/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She failed to do so. Thus, the record summary judgment evidence indicates that Mitchell was released to work without restrictions since the day after her December 5, 2016 injury; and that, between then and the January 9, 2017 filing of her 1008, Mitchell worked her usual pre-accident hours, earning her same pre-accident hourly wage, during which time Alliance accommodated Mitchell by allowing her to work at light duty. Accordingly, we conclude that Alliance showed the absence of any \"genuine issue as to material fact,\" regarding Mitchell's entitlement to workers' compensation benefits, such that it was \"entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(3). Hence, we find that summary judgment was properly rendered in Alliance's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment rendered by the WCJ in favor of Alliance Compressors and against Elaine Mitchell is affirmed. Costs of this appeal are assessed against Elaine Mitchell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    As we will later explain, the WCJ refused to consider Mitchell's opposition and, apparently, did not allow it to be filed into the record. We note, however, that the first page of the opposition appears in the record as Exhibit 5 to Alliance's later filed Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for New Trial, wherein Alliance describes Mitchell's opposition as being one and one-half pages in length and without any accompanying exhibits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Mitchell devolutively appealed from the judgment of July 13, 2018, dismissing her claims and the judgment of August 23, 2018, denying her motion for new trial.
