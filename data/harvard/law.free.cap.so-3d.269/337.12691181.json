Following a jury trial in the Lowndes County Circuit Court, Lori Griffin was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to twenty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) with four years suspended and four years of post-release supervision. Through appointed appellate counsel, Griffin challenges two of the trial court's evidentiary rulings and argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the conviction or, alternatively, that the jury's verdict was against the weight of the evidence. In a pro se brief, Griffin raises additional evidentiary issues, alleges ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, and argues that her sentence violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We find no error and affirm Griffin's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Lori Griffin rented an apartment in Columbus in July 2009. Dean Loftis, a local realtor, managed the property for Griffin's landlord. In December 2009, the heat went out in Griffin's apartment, and Loftis loaned Griffin a space heater to use until the heat could be repaired. Griffin also tried to use her kitchen oven to heat the apartment, but she forgot that she had left a pizza box in the oven. The pizza box caught fire and damaged the oven. Between 5:30 and 6 p.m. on Friday, December 11, 2009, Griffin told Loftis that the pilot light on her water heater had been out since Tuesday, although she had not reported the problem to Loftis previously. Loftis told Griffin that her maintenance man was out of town but that she would send him to the apartment as soon as he returned after lunch the following day. As promised, the maintenance man went to Griffin's apartment on Saturday, but when he arrived, Griffin told him that a friend had already fixed the issue for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. When Loftis went to her office on Sunday, December 13, 2009, there was a message from Griffin on her answering machine. Griffin had left the message on Saturday morning and \"seemed to be very angry\" that the maintenance man had not arrived yet. Loftis decided that she would go see Griffin on Monday to retrieve her space heater and check on the damage to the stove in the apartment. Loftis also wanted to discuss Griffin's voicemail and to try \"[t]o have a better rapport with her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. When Loftis arrived at Griffin's apartment on Monday, she knocked on the door, and Griffin came out onto the porch. Loftis told Griffin that she wanted to retrieve her heater and discuss Griffin's voicemail. They talked briefly on the porch, and then Griffin started to walk back into the apartment. Loftis started to follow\n   Griffin inside and had \"just put [her] foot on the threshold\" when Griffin turned around and said, \"Wait, I didn't invite you into my house. You don't come into my house without an invitation.\" Loftis told Griffin that she also wanted to take a look at the stove, and she said again that she wanted to discuss Griffin's voicemail and why she had left it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. When Loftis questioned Griffin about the voicemail, Griffin \"went into a fit of rage.\" Griffin \"ran out onto the porch and grabbed [Loftis] by her head.\" Griffin cursed Loftis and told her that she was \"going to regret coming here today.\" Loftis said that she was going to call the police, and Griffin responded that she would not be able to call the police. While Griffin was cursing and threatening Loftis, she was also pulling chunks of hair out of Loftis's head until Loftis's scalp began to bleed. Then Griffin began hitting Loftis and threw her against the wall. Loftis's head hit the wall, and her eyeglasses fell off. Loftis became dizzy, and Griffin threw her down onto the porch. Then Griffin got on top of Loftis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Loftis testified, \"I was face down on the [porch]. She was on top of me. And she was ... beating me in the head and telling me what she was going to do to me and how I was going to regret coming there and how many times she had done this before.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Loftis saw her shoe lying on the porch to her side, and she managed to pick it up and strike Griffin with it. Loftis testified, \"I [thought] I would try to hit her with my shoe and get her off me long enough for me to run to [my] car.\" After Loftis hit Griffin with her shoe, she noticed that Griffin's two- or three-year-old son had walked out onto the porch and was holding a phone. Loftis got the phone and tried to call 911, but Griffin knocked the phone out of her hand. Griffin was cut and bleeding where Loftis's shoe had hit her, and her little boy saw the blood and began to cry. Loftis said, \"Lori, your little son doesn't need to see this.\" Griffin responded, \"Yes, he does. Yes, he does. He needs to know how to do this.\" Griffin then told her son, \"She's a mean lady. She's a mean lady. Hit her. Hit her.\" The little boy obeyed and hit Loftis, and Griffin \"started laughing [a] wicked laugh because [the little boy] was hitting [Loftis].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Griffin then grabbed Loftis by her hair, pulled her back, and made her look at the blood on Griffin's face. Griffin said, \"You see now what you've done? ... I've got to kill you.\" And then Griffin hit Loftis in the eye with a closed fist, and she said again, \"I'm going to have to kill you.\" According to Loftis, Griffin was on top of her and continued to beat her with her fists, while telling her \"that she definitely was going to kill [her]\" and that \"[s]he had done this before and she knew how to do it and ... get [away] with it.\" Loftis begged Griffin to stop; she told her that she had osteoporosis and that her ribs were going to break. Griffin responded, \"Good. Good.\" Griffin said again that she was going to kill Loftis and began bouncing up and down on Loftis's back until Loftis felt one of her ribs break.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Loftis saw her car keys lying on the porch, and she was able to reach them and cause her car horn to honk several times. At this point, a friend of Griffin's, \"Matt,\" walked up onto the porch. Griffin said to him, \"Hi, Matt. I'm going to kill this woman.\" Matt did not do anything to stop Griffin, and Griffin \"started choking [Loftis] so hard that [Loftis] thought [her] eyes\n   were going to pop out.\" Loftis begged Matt to make Griffin stop, and Matt finally said, \"Lori, don't kill her.\" But Griffin responded, \"I don't have an option. I've got to kill her. She'll go to the cops and I'll go to jail and my kid will go back to the reservation.\" Matt eventually persuaded Griffin that Loftis would not \"go to the cops\" because he would \"take care of her\" if she tried to do so. Griffin eventually agreed to allow Loftis to leave after Loftis promised that she would not go to the police. Griffin told Matt that she was \"making a mistake by not killing [Loftis].\" Griffin also stomped on Loftis's eyeglasses and threw them into the street. Matt retrieved Loftis's broken eyeglasses and car keys and gave them to her so that she could leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Loftis drove home, and her husband called the police. A police officer came to her house and then called the paramedics. The paramedics responded, insisted that Loftis needed to go to the hospital, and took her to the hospital in an ambulance. Doctors ordered an MRI to check for head injuries ; examined her neck, which was red and bruised; and x-rayed her ribs. Loftis had in fact broken a rib. Loftis also had bruises on her arms and shoulders and bruises, cuts, and blood on her face and scalp, and a black eye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Griffin testified to a very different version of events. She said that there were many problems with her apartment and that Loftis did not respond promptly to her calls. She testified that Loftis came to her apartment at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, December 14, 2009, and began \"banging on the front door,\" \"screaming at the top her lungs,\" and demanding to talk to Griffin \"about that nasty message.\" Griffin testified that she was making her son breakfast at the time and was wearing only a sports bra and blue jeans. According to Griffin, after she opened the door, Loftis followed her back into her kitchen without her permission. Griffin claimed that when she asked Loftis to leave, Loftis said, \"I'll come in whenever I like .... This is how we do it in the south.\" Griffin testified that she then tried to call 911, but Loftis grabbed her hand and knocked the phone away from her. Griffin testified that when she bent down to pick up the phone, Loftis \"took off her shoe and started hitting [Griffin] in the head with it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Griffin testified that her \"fight and flight responses just kicked in\" and she was \"in survival mode.\" She \"sprang up and got [Loftis] by her shoulders,\" she pushed Loftis back to the door, and both women tripped and fell out onto the front porch. Griffin testified that she sat on top of Loftis on the front porch, but she claimed that Loftis tried to hit her again with the shoe and tried to stab her with car keys. Griffin testified that her son was crying, and she tried to tell him to go back inside the apartment. Griffin testified that Loftis next tried to \"grab [her] son\"-although Griffin acknowledged that she was still sitting on top of Loftis at this point. Griffin claimed that Loftis actually managed to grab her son by his shirt, and Griffin responded by hitting Loftis in the face and head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Griffin testified that her neighbor and acquaintance, Matthew Evans, heard her screaming for help. She testified that Evans took her son inside the apartment and then came back outside. Griffin testified that she let Loftis get up, and Loftis said she \"just want[ed] to go and forget [the] day ever happened.\" According to Griffin, Loftis continued to demand her space heater, so Griffin brought the heater outside and left it next to Loftis's car. Loftis then departed. Griffin called 911, and the police responded. She told the police that she did not want to press charges unless Loftis did. Griffin then\n   went to the hospital. She had a single cut on her head, which was about half an inch in length. A doctor closed the cut with two medical staples. The doctor noticed a bruise on one of Griffin's fingers but no other injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. Griffin was indicted in May 2010 and released on bond. She subsequently absconded to North Carolina. In December 2011, a bench warrant was issued for her arrest after she failed to appear for trial. She remained on the lam until she was apprehended in Alabama and returned to Mississippi to stand trial. Her case proceeded to trial in March 2013. Her first trial ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. At her second trial, the jury found her guilty of aggravated assault. The circuit court sentenced her to twenty years in MDOC custody, with four years suspended and four years of post-release supervision, and ordered her to pay a $1,000 fine, restitution, and court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. After Griffin was sentenced, her trial counsel filed a motion for a \"directed verdict\" or a new trial, which the circuit court denied. Griffin then informed her trial counsel that she did not want to appeal. On March 28, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing and questioned Griffin to ensure that she understood that she had a right to appeal and a right to appointed counsel on appeal. Griffin confirmed that she understood this, that she had consulted with trial counsel, and that she did not want to appeal. The circuit court found that Griffin had knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived her right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. Almost six months later, on September 17, 2013, Griffin filed a pro se, fill-in-the-blank \"Motion for Appointment of Appellate Counsel and for Other Relief\" in which she requested permission to file an out-of-time appeal pursuant to Rule 4 of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. The circuit court denied her request. The court noted that it had \"no issues with, or objections to, [Griffin] seeking an out-of-time appeal,\" but the court no longer had jurisdiction to grant her request under Rule 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.A.P. 4(g). The court instructed Griffin that \"the proper remedy\" would be for her \"to seek leave to file an out-of-time appeal from the Supreme Court of Mississippi under Rule 2(c) of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16. Griffin followed the circuit court's instructions and filed a motion in the Supreme Court requesting leave under Rule 2(c) to file an out-of-time appeal. A panel of the Supreme Court found that Griffin's \"motion should be dismissed without prejudice to [her] right to seek an out-of-time appeal by filing a petition for post-conviction collateral relief in the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2014-M-00688 (Miss. June 20, 2014) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-5\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(i) (Rev. 2015) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17. Griffin then returned to the circuit court and filed a pro se, fill-in-the-blank \"Post-Conviction Petition for Out of Time Appeal, Appointment of Appellate Counsel, and for Other Relief.\" Griffin's petition was filed in a separate case with a civil cause number. Griffin's certificate of service shows that she served the district attorney. On September 4, 2014, without requesting a response from the State, the circuit court granted Griffin's motion for an out-of-time appeal and directed her to file a notice of appeal within twenty days. The court directed the circuit clerk to send a copy of its order \"to all parties,\" and the circuit clerk's records show that a copy was sent to the district attorney. Griffin then filed a notice of appeal in her criminal case on September 16, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18. The Office of State Public Defender, Indigent Appeals Division, was appointed to represent Griffin on appeal. Griffin's appointed counsel argues that (1) the State\n   improperly introduced evidence of Loftis's reputation for having a character for truthfulness, (2) the trial court erred by allowing the State to cross-examine Griffin about having put her child up for adoption and by not allowing Griffin to explain her reason for doing so, (3) the evidence was insufficient to convict Griffin of aggravated assault, and (4) the jury's verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Parts II-IV,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   In a pro se supplemental brief, Griffin argues that (1) a prior written statement by Loftis should have been admitted into evidence, (2) the trial court erred by admitting \"distorted\" black-and-white photos into evidence, (3) her trial counsel should have demanded a speedy trial, and (4) her sentence is cruel and unusual punishment and violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Parts V-VIII,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   We address these issues in turn below, find no reversible error, and affirm Griffin's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. This Court has jurisdiction to consider Griffin's appeal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19. After the parties filed their briefs on appeal, this Court ordered supplemental briefing on the questions whether the circuit court properly granted Griffin's motion for an out-of-time appeal and whether this Court has jurisdiction to consider the appeal. The State argues that the circuit court erred by granting Griffin's motion-and that this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction-because Griffin did not show that she failed to perfect a timely appeal \"through no fault of her own.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20. The State's argument would have been a valid basis for opposing Griffin's motion for post-conviction relief. The Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act permits a prisoner to file \"a motion for an out-of-time appeal if the person claims ... [t]hat he is entitled to an out-of-time appeal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-5\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(i). However, \"[t]hat remedy is able to protect inmates who\n   <em>\n    through no fault of their own\n   </em>\n   have not had an appeal of their underlying conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    DeLoach v.

Ct. App. 2004) (emphasis added; quotation marks omitted). \"[A] defendant seeking an out-of-time appeal must, by a preponderance of the evidence, demonstrate that he asked his attorney to appeal within the time allowed but that the attorney failed to appeal,\n   <em>\n    and such failure was not the defendant's fault\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Arnold v.

Ct. App. 2012) (emphasis added). Thus, a prisoner generally is not entitled to an out-of-time appeal when, as in this case, she knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7047599\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/36/456/#p457\">\n    36 So.3d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457-58, 460-61 (\u00b6\u00b6 3, 12-15) (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21. However, the circuit court granted Griffin an out-of-time appeal in a final judgment entered in a separate civil, post-conviction action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-23\">\n    Miss.

However, the State did not appeal, so the judgment in the post-conviction case became final. Moreover, the State does not argue that the judgment in the post-conviction case is void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, there is no basis for this Court to look behind that judgment. The final judgment in the post-conviction case gives this Court jurisdiction to consider Griffin's out-of-time appeal from her criminal conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Griffin waived any objection to testimony about Loftis's reputation for having a character for truthfulness.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22. Griffin argues that the circuit court erred by permitting six witnesses to testify in rebuttal that Loftis had a reputation for having a truthful character. Griffin argues that it was error to admit this testimony because Loftis's character for truthfulness was never attacked. The State responds that this testimony was properly admitted in response to Griffin's accusation that the police \"coached\" Loftis by telling her that Griffin previously had been charged with aggravated assault. Griffin further accused Loftis of tailoring and fabricating parts of her statement to police based on their \"coaching.\" Griffin leveled these accusations in a pretrial letter to one of the circuit judges, and the State cross-examined Griffin about the letter and introduced it into evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23. Mississippi Rule of Evidence 608(a) provides that \"[a] witness's credibility may be attacked or supported by testimony about the witness's reputation for having a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by testimony in the form of an opinion about that character.\" M.R.E. 608(a). However, \"evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the witness's character for truthfulness has been attacked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brent v.

Having reviewed the testimony of the six witnesses at issue, we find that Griffin never objected to the introduction of evidence that Loftis had a reputation for having a character for truthfulness. Griffin did not object when the prosecution asked the first of the six witnesses, Tina Dodd, about Loftis's reputation for\n   having a character for truthfulness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Griffin did object when the next witness, Valeria Anthony, began to testify about her specific interactions with Loftis. However, when the prosecutor rephrased the question, and Anthony confined her answer to Loftis's reputation for having a character for truthfulness, Griffin made no objection. Next, Griffin did not object to Rhonda Sanders's testimony about Loftis's reputation for having a character for truthfulness. Griffin did object when the fourth of these witnesses, Joe Hollowell, testified simply that Loftis is \"very truthful\"; however, following an off-the-record bench conference, the prosecutor rephrased her question, and Hollowell testified without objection that Griffin had a good reputation for having a character for truthfulness. The final two witnesses, Geri Holliman and Edward Wallington, offered similar testimony without any objection from Griffin. Thus, during the relevant testimony of these six witnesses, Griffin made only two objections to the form of the prosecutor's question or the witness's answer.

On direct examination, in the course of explaining why she had jumped bond, Griffin specifically testified that in 2012 she had moved to Cullman, Alabama, with both of her \"children,\" including her younger son. Griffin told the jury that she moved to Cullman in part because \"Bloomberg Business Week\" had listed that city \"as the number one place to raise children.\" In point of fact, Griffin did not move to Cullman with both of her children or her younger son. She put the younger son up for adoption in 2011,\n   <em>\n    before she moved to Cullman\n   </em>\n   . On cross-examination, the State attempted to impeach Griffin by questioning her about the fact of her younger son's adoption. Griffin objected on grounds of relevance and prejudice, but the trial judge overruled the objection. The trial judge found that Griffin had \"opened the door to this line of questioning\" through her testimony on direct. The trial judge also found, under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 403, that Griffin's \"credibility\" was of \"paramount\" importance to the case and that \"any prejudicial effect [was] outweighed\n   substantially by the probative value\" of the evidence.

Griffin interjected the issue into the case through her self-serving-and at least partially false-testimony about her reasons for moving to Alabama. Griffin did not have to testify about moving to Alabama, but once she did, she opened the door to cross-examination about her truthfulness on that subject. Nor can we say that the trial judge abused his discretion in applying Rule 403. As the trial judge found, Griffin's \"credibility\" was a \"paramount\" issue at trial, and the probative value of this impeachment was not substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. Griffin's argument on this issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 31. Griffin also argues that the trial judge abused his discretion by precluding her from testifying that she put her son up for adoption because she was facing a lengthy prison sentence if convicted. After the trial judge ruled that the State could cross-examine Griffin regarding the adoption, Griffin testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q.

The judge then excused the jury from the courtroom and admonished Griffin, outside the presence of the jury, not to testify about her potential sentence.

As an initial matter, Griffin failed to preserve the issue for appellate review.

We begin by noting that Griffin failed to raise this issue in the trial court. After the State rested its case-in-chief, Griffin moved for a directed verdict, but she simply asserted, without elaboration, that \"the State hasn't met its burden by beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The trial judge denied Griffin's motion, and Griffin did not renew the motion at the close of the evidence. Nor did Griffin request a jury instruction defining \"serious bodily injury\" or a lesser-included-offense instruction on simple assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In closing argument, the assistant district attorney argued that this issue-whether Loftis suffered a serious bodily injury-was \"not in dispute,\" and Griffin's counsel did not address the issue at all.

An investigator with the Columbus Police Department interviewed Loftis the day after the assault and drafted a statement based on the interview, which Loftis reviewed and signed. Griffin's attorney briefly used the statement to cross-examine Loftis, asking her whether she recalled telling the investigator that \"blood was pouring from Ms. Griffin's head.\" However, Griffin's lawyer did not attempt to introduce the statement into evidence. In her pro se supplemental appellate brief, Griffin argues that the trial judge should have admitted the statement into evidence sua sponte.

In addition, trial counsel's decisions as to whether to seek to introduce certain evidence generally and presumptively fall within the scope of reasonable trial strategy-and, therefore, are not a basis for an ineffective assistance claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Havard v.

In this case, defense counsel's decision not to attempt to introduce the victim's written statement-which incriminated Griffin-surely was reasonable trial strategy.

Griffin's pro se supplemental brief next advances an argument about some black-and-white photographs of her, Loftis, and the crime scene that were admitted into evidence at trial. The nature of the argument is not entirely clear. On appeal, Griffin argues that the photos were misleading. However, Griffin, not the State, offered these photos into evidence. The State offered only color photos. Griffin's claim is procedurally barred and without merit because she did not raise this issue in the trial court. In fact, she introduced the evidence about which she now complains.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8183522\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/290/#p295\">\n    986 So.2d at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 13) (\"This Court cannot find that a trial judge committed reversible error on a matter not brought before him or her to consider.\");\n   <em>\n    Graves v.

We may address such claims on direct appeal only if the issues are based on facts fully apparent from the record. If the record is not sufficient to address the claims on direct appeal, the Court should dismiss the claims without prejudice, preserving the defendant's right to raise the claims later in a properly filed motion for post-conviction relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Part of the delay in bringing this case to trial clearly cannot be blamed on Griffin's lawyer. As discussed above, Griffin jumped bail, failed to appear for trial in December 2011, and absconded to North Carolina and later Alabama. She was returned to Mississippi in November 2012 and tried in March 2013. Any delay caused by Griffin's flight and failure to appear is her fault alone and cannot give rise to a speedy trial or ineffective assistance claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

However, the record is unclear as to why the trial was delayed prior to Griffin's flight. Griffin was indicted in May 2010, and the court initially set the case for trial in August 2010. The case was then continued five times by agreement, with the last agreed order setting trial for December 2011. The agreed orders are not in the record on appeal, nor is there any specific explanation for the continuances. In addition, there is no evidence to support Griffin's claim that Evans might have offered helpful testimony had the case proceeded to trial sooner. On this record, the usual reasons for not addressing ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal apply. Accordingly, we dismiss this claim without prejudice to Griffin's right to assert the claim in a properly filed motion for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , 191 So.3d at 736 (\u00b6 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.

Griffin discusses several reported aggravated assault cases in which lesser sentences were imposed, and she argues that those cases involved \"more heinous\" crimes than hers. Griffin also attempts to minimize her culpability, claiming that she had \"no intention to do bodily harm\" and that Loftis \"was the initial aggressor.\" Obviously, these claims are in direct conflict with Loftis's testimony about the assault, which the jury apparently found credible. Finally, Griffin alleges that the trial judge has a \"personal vendetta\" against her, citing another aggravated assault case in which the judge imposed a lesser sentence; however, the record contains nothing to support Griffin's allegations about the other case with the lesser sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 53.

There is sufficient evidence to support the conviction, the jury's verdict is not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, and Griffin has not identified any error in the admission or exclusion of evidence. In addition, Griffin's sentence is constitutional and within the limits set by statute. The ineffective assistance claim discussed in Part VII,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , is dismissed without prejudice. Griffin may raise that issue in a properly filed motion for post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 57.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   LEE, C.J., GRIFFIS, P.J., AND FAIR, J., CONCUR.

I agree with the majority's affirmation of Griffin's conviction and sentence and its well-reasoned determination of the jurisdictional, constitutional, and evidentiary issues. I also agree with the majority's opinion that because Griffin failed to address the serious bodily injury element in her motion for a directed verdict and her post-trial motions, the issue is now procedurally barred. However, unlike the majority, it is my opinion that a reasonable juror, given the appropriate definition of the term \"serious bodily injury\" as an element of aggravated assault, could rationally say the State did not prove \"serious bodily injury\" to Loftis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 59. \"Serious bodily injury\" as defined by Mississippi law means \"bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\"\n   <em>\n    Rickman v.

There is no medical evidence to support the idea that a broken rib, whether treated or left untreated, causes a substantial risk of death. There is no medical evidence that a broken rib causes a loss or impairment of any bodily member, organ, or function. There is no evidence, medical or otherwise, regarding any serious or impairing effect on Loftis from her broken rib.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 60. There certainly exist circumstances in which a broken bone alone would not automatically warrant enhancing a charge of simple assault to the more serious felonious charge of aggravated assault. When the State attempts to pursue an aggravated-assault conviction in circumstances such as presented in this case, it is my opinion that such enhancement requires the jury be properly instructed and that the State should offer at least some medical proof that the injuries are consistent with the legal definition of \"serious bodily injury.\" I, otherwise, concur in part and in the result with the majority's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   WESTBROOKS, J., JOINS THIS OPINION IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Loftis was sixty-two years old, 5'3\", and 115 pounds at the time.

I also disagree with the majority's implicit finding that this Court lacks the authority to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, as this Court always has jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction and to dismiss an appeal if we find that we lack jurisdiction.

Griffin filed a motion for a directed verdict or, alternatively, a new trial, which the circuit court denied on March 27, 2013.

In fact, as shown by the colloquy with the circuit court on March 28, 2013, Griffin specifically stated that\n   <em>\n    she did not want to appeal her conviction\n   </em>\n   . The circuit court advised her at that time that she had a right to appeal and that an attorney could be appointed to represent her on appeal.

Yet, she chose not to pursue an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 72. It is clear from this record that Griffin failed to timely file her notice of appeal because she voluntarily decided not to appeal. After she missed the deadline, she could obtain relief only through the post-conviction-relief process, and only then, if she could prove that her failure to timely appeal was not her fault. Yet, the circuit court granted her relief knowing it was her fault because, at the time the circuit court granted Griffin the right to appeal, it had previously found that she had voluntarily given up her right to appeal. How could her failure to timely appeal not be her fault? Then, in her sworn PCR petition, Griffin lied when she alleged that she had done nothing to delay her\n   appeal. It seems abundantly clear to me that Griffin was judicially estopped from alleging in her PCR petition that she had done nothing to delay or prevent the timely filing of her notice of appeal, and since she was estopped, she did not, and could not, meet the requirements for obtaining permission through the post-conviction-relief process for an out-of-time appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6 73. The majority's finding that the State cannot, in this appeal, assert that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to grant the out-of-time appeal because it did not appeal the judgment of the circuit court is untenable for at least four reasons, one of which I have already discussed: Griffin was judicially estopped from attempting to prove entitlement to such relief. The second reason is the circuit court did not give notice to the State, as it was required by law to do if it were not going to summarily dismiss Griffin's PCR petition, which is what the circuit court should have done.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-11\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 74. The third reason is that the doctrine of res judicata precluded a finding that Griffin was entitled to an out-of-time appeal. Therefore, Griffin did not, and could not, meet her burden in the post-conviction-relief proceeding that she initiated when she filed her PCR petition, seeking permission to file an out-of-time appeal. She was required to prove entitlement to an out-of-time appeal. However, in prior proceedings in her case, the court had found that she had knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived her right to appeal her conviction. On April 27, 2013, Griffin's right and entitlement to appeal her conviction expired. She could not thereafter establish-during a post-conviction-relief proceeding-that she was entitled to an out-of-time appeal because in order to establish entitlement, she had to prove that the reason she had failed to timely appeal was the fault of someone else. The circuit court had found in its March 28, 2013 order that the reason no appeal was being taken was because Griffin did not want to appeal, not because her attorney was unwilling to file an appeal for her. Since the court's March 28, 2013 order was not appealed, the court's finding in that order had become res judicata by the time Griffin filed her PCR petition on July 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6 75. The fourth reason the majority's position is untenable is because predicating this Court's jurisdiction on the failure of the State to appeal an order that the circuit court issued without judicial underpinning is tantamount to saying this Court is obligated to salute the extrajudicial action of the circuit court, notwithstanding a plethora of precedent that an appellate court is required to note its own lack of jurisdiction even if not raised by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey v. Chamblee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6805362\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/192/1078/#p1081\">\n    192 So.3d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1081-82 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 76. I want to be clear. I am not contending that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to entertain Griffin's PCR petition. It did. My contention is that the circuit court did not have the authority to grant the relief that it did because no facts or evidence was presented warranting\n   such relief. Trial courts are not authorized to grant relief in post-conviction-relief proceedings simply because they want to, as we follow the rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 77. If the evidence in the post-conviction-relief proceeding had been in dispute as to whether Griffin's failure to appeal was due to her fault or the fault of someone else and the circuit court had ruled in her favor and allowed the out-of-time appeal, I would agree with the majority. But that is not the case. Moreover, based on the record before us, had the circuit court ordered the State to file an answer or other pleading, as it was required by section 99-39-11(3) to do, before ruling on Griffin's PCR petition, we probably would not be considering Griffin's appeal, for I cannot imagine that the State would not have filed the same response as it did in this appeal when we requested supplemental briefing on the question whether the trial court properly granted an out-of-time-appeal. I cannot fathom how the circuit court could have found that Griffin's failure to timely appeal her conviction was not solely her fault. Any review of an order to the contrary would require reversal because Griffin presented nothing to bring into question her previous waiver of her right to appeal, leaving only a question of law as to her entitlement to an out-of-time appeal in the face of her waiver. An appellate court's review of questions of law presented in post-conviction-relief matters is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Rowland v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7043906\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/42/503/#p506\">\n    42 So.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506 (\u00b6 8) (Miss. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 78. I know of no law that precludes us-as part of our quest to determine our own jurisdiction-from taking judicial notice of the companion post-conviction-relief proceedings in the trial court. It is clear that the circuit court's order permitting Griffin to file an out-of-time appeal was entered in contravention of section 99-39-11(3), setting forth the process that must be undertaken by the trial court if it does not summarily dismiss a PCR motion, and Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-39-23(7) (Rev. 2015), providing that \"[n]o relief shall be granted under [the UPCCRA] unless the petitioner proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the relief.\" It is interesting, puzzling, and noteworthy that the circuit court, in its September 4, 2014 order granting Griffin an out-of-time appeal, \"took judicial notice\" that Griffin sought permission to file an out-of-time appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 79. Our case law, just as our statutory law, is clear as to the burden a movant must meet before being granted permission to file an out-of-time appeal. In\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   , 986 So.2d at 1083 (\u00b6 10), we held: \"A trial court has the authority to grant a criminal defendant's motion for an out-of-time appeal if grounds exist and the request is brought under the [UPCCRA].\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Moreover, the movant must show that the attorney failed to perfect the appeal and that such failure was through no fault of the movant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <em>\n    Dickey v.

Our supreme court has also stated: \"[I]t is settled that a defendant desiring an out-of-time appeal must, at the very least, show that the failure timely to perfect an appeal was through no fault of his own.\"\n   <em>\n    Fair v.

There is not a scintilla of evidence in this record-and Griffin does not allege in her PCR petition-that after the March 28, 2013 hearing and prior to the April 27,\n   2013 deadline for filing an appeal, she changed her mind and asked her attorney to pursue the appeal, but the attorney refused. Therefore, there was nothing on which the circuit court could have predicated relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6 81. This Court always has the authority to determine its jurisdiction, and to suggest, as does the majority, that Griffin's appeal is timely because the State did not appeal from a prior post-conviction-relief order granting Griffin the right to appeal when the circuit court had no authority to grant that right is beyond my ability to discern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 82. Appellate courts have the authority pursuant to Rule 2(c) of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure to suspend the rules for good cause shown and allow out-of-time appeals to proceed. However, based on this record, I cannot find any good cause for suspending the rules and allowing this appeal to proceed, as I cannot find that Griffin's failure to timely perfect her appeal was through no fault of her own or that justice demands that we hear it. As noted, on March 28, 2013, the circuit court conducted a hearing in which the judge clearly explained to Griffin that she had a right to appeal. Griffin voluntarily abandoned her right to appeal and has not established that her failure to timely appeal was through no fault of her own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 83. For the reasons discussed, I dissent. If any appeal should be dismissed, this is one. I am afraid that the bench, bar, and public generally will view today's decision as a wink at the rule of law. I hope I am wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   CARLTON, GREENLEE AND WESTBROOKS, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Ms. Smith was Griffin's trial counsel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Ms. Clemons represented the State at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Section 99-39-11 provides in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n    (2) If it plainly appears from the face of the motion, any annexed exhibits and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to any relief, the judge may make an order for its dismissal and cause the petitioner to be notified.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n    (3) If the motion is not dismissed under subsection (2) of this section,\n    <em>\n     the judge shall order the state to file an answer or other pleading\n    </em>\n    within the period of time fixed by the court or to take such other action as the judge deems appropriate ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    (Emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
