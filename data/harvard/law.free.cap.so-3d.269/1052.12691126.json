The confrontation culminated in the defendant running the victim over with his Mercedes Benz SUV and dragging him several yards. Believing the defendant was backing up to run over him again, the victim began shooting at the defendant's car. The victim survived the incident and was taken to the hospital where he subsequently underwent surgery for his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On October 13, 2017, the defendant was charged by bill of information with one count of attempted second degree murder, a violation of La.R.S. 14:27 and 14:30.1, and one count of aggravated battery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:34(A). After a three-day trial that concluded on February 22, 2018, a unanimous jury found the defendant guilty as charged on both counts. On March 26, 2018, the defendant filed a Motion for New Trial and a Motion for Post Verdict Judgment of Acquittal. Both motions were denied by the trial court on that same date without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Subsequently, on March 29, 2018, the trial court sentenced the defendant for attempted second degree murder to fifteen years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, and for aggravated battery to ten years at hard labor, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for attempted second degree murder. The trial court also ordered the defendant to pay a $ 5,000.00 fine, court costs, and $ 75,000.00 in restitution to the victim. On April 11, 2018, the defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence, which was denied by the trial court on that same date without a hearing. Pursuant to a Motion for Appeal, the defendant is now before this court alleging five assignments of error as to his convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed by this court for errors patent on the face of the record.

The defendant's argument focuses on the lack of evidence that he had specific intent to kill the victim. Additionally, the defendant asserts the evidence proved that his actions were justified under the circumstances. He argues both his convictions for attempted second degree murder and aggravated battery should be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

On the day in question, Officer Bruce responded to a call regarding a white male shooting at oncoming vehicles. Less than five minutes later, Officer Bruce reached the scene, where he saw a white male lying in the roadway. Several bystanders and a white sedan were parked in the intersection. When Officer Bruce asked about a weapon, he was told a firearm had been given to a Creola Police Officer. Officer Bruce identified several photographs taken of the scene. In one photograph, Officer Bruce identified what he believed was the defendant's vehicle with the back glass shattered and with an apparent bullet hole on the left side of the glass. In another photograph, Officer Bruce noticed fresh tire marks through the median just north of glass located on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    According to Officer Bruce, the defendant was not at the scene when Officer Bruce first arrived but that he approached the officers at some point:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    A. I - - he approached us uh, at that time I did not know who it was approaching uh, but he had approached us from the north uh, from the Bentley direction and he was traveling through the median towards us and he stopped uh, just inside the grass, inside the turn around.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    Q.

No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The next witness to testify was Detective Ryan James of the Grant Parish Sheriff's Office. Detective James arrived at the scene about twenty minutes after receiving the call. Someone had drawn a black box where the victim had been located. Detective James was informed by another officer of the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    A. .... Mr. Ross's vehicle ran over Mr. Gillette, dragging him out into the roadway where he drew the black box. Went. Stopped. Shots were fired, and then proceeded through the median going north.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Detective James determined the damage to the defendant's back glass was caused by bullets. In a photograph shown by the state, Detective James identified foam that had been knocked out of a headrest by a bullet. According to Detective James, the bullet entered the headrest from the rear and exited it from the front. In another photograph, Detective James identified an area on the glass of the \"passenger's side rear\" where a bullet entered the vehicle. Detective James identified another bullet hole in the roof of the defendant's vehicle. In the detective's opinion, the bullet hole in the roof was caused by the same bullet that went through the rear headrest and deflected off the driver's headrest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Detective James also identified photographs taken of the victim while at the hospital. In one photograph, Detective James identified injuries to the victim's leg, and in another photograph, the detective identified injuries the victim suffered from being thrown into the windshield. According to Detective James, the victim's right leg was broken in two places. Detective James testified that the victim was in a lot of pain. Based on statements from witnesses and his interview of the victim, Detective James made the determination to charge the defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    When asked on cross-examination if the defendant had a gun in his vehicle, Detective James responded, \"Not that I'm aware of.\" Detective James testified that a knife was recovered from the victim's person. The detective described the knife as having a long shank with a handle and stated that it is primarily used for self-defense. According to Detective James, the firearm used during the incident at issue was carried by the victim. Additionally, the cartridges used in the firearm were designed for self-defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The next witness to testify, Byron Thomas, gave a voluntary statement about the incident in question. Mr. Thomas remembered that it was evening when he was traveling south on Highway 167 near Pineville and noticed a Mercedes SUV passing him and slowing down several times. According to Mr. Thomas, the SUV was not aggressive. Mr. Thomas noticed the same SUV pulled over in relation to the incident in question. When asked to describe what he saw regarding the incident in question, Mr. Thomas testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    A.

Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    A. ... and uh, got ahead of him, but I noticed there was uh, somebody in the - - the faster lane and they we - - I noticed they were slowing down and I guess they were trying to turn, I don't know why they were slowing down, but they had started slowing down, so I did look for the Mercedes and I noticed he was coming up on me very fastly.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    A. Uh, when he got to where he thought he was going to get in front of me, I never changed speeds, like I said I had my cruise control set, and uh, he had to slam on his brakes pretty hard to keep from rear ending this truck because he was trying to get between us but he ran out of slack.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    A. And I did notice - - as soon as I went past the truck that was trying to turn, uh, the Mercedes got behind me very fast, he darted over and then he darted back in front of the uh, the other SUV and come to a screeching halt.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    Q.

Uh, I did not, like I said, uh, we were - - they were slowing down, and everything that I seen past that was kind of in rear view, so I can't be positive about what I seen. Uh, I did watch the S - - the Mercedes change lanes very fastly and then change lanes again very fastly, and the last thing I seen were both vehicles, had both came to a complete stop.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    Q. So he changed lanes behind you, is that co - - is that accurate?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    A. Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    Q. All right.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    A. He was in the left lane and when I passed this vehicle, he changed lanes very fast, got behind me and then changed lanes again very fastly, and then he stopped and the, I guess in the middle of the road.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    A. By this time, they were pretty much in this intersection.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    Q.

Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    Q. Um, did - - were they in the same lane when you noticed that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    A.

Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    A. ... but last thing I seen was both the vehicles were completely stopped.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    According to Mr. Thomas, the other vehicle was behind the defendant when the defendant came to a complete stop. Mr. Thomas returned to the same area about twenty to thirty minutes later, saw the police, and stopped to offer a statement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    On cross-examination, Mr. Thomas explained that the Mercedes stopped in front of the Nissan, forcing the Nissan to stop. On re-direct, Mr. Thomas further explained that his vantage point was through his rearview mirror, but he could tell that the Mercedes had gotten in front of the Nissan. When asked on re-cross if the Nissan had already stopped before the Mercedes got in front of it, Mr. Thomas replied, \"I have no idea. That - - that was while I was passing them and that was rear view, I - - I can't tell you what happened right there exactly.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The next witness, Courtney Perrine, was traveling southbound on Highway 167 on the day in question with her mother, who was driving, and Ms. Perrine's boyfriend, Willis White. Ms. Perrine noticed two cars that appeared to be stopped in the median. As Ms. Perrine got closer, she saw one man standing in front of the other vehicle with both arms stretched out. Ms. Perrine described the events that ensued as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    A. As - - as we were still driving, we got actually directly across to the intersection, and the vehicle the man was standing in front of, um, backed up a little bit and then slammed into drive and ran him over.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    Q. Okay, uh, at the time you could see that, could you - - literally see the man that was standing outside of the vehicle and you - - you said he had his hands uh, outstretched in some way at first, did he appear to be talking to the person in the - - in the vehicle or could you tell?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    A. It - - it appeared that he was.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    Q. Okay, did he appear to be upset that you could tell?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    A. No, no, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    Q. Okay, could you tell uh, were you able to see him clearly from your vantage point?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    When asked if she noticed anything in the man's outstretched hands, Ms. Perrine replied:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    A. No, sir, his hands were empty.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    Q. And - - are you sure of that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    A. I'm positive.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    Q. Okay, and - - if he would have anything in his hands, would you have been in a position to see that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    A. Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    Q. Okay, can you tell me approximately what kind of distance uh, if - - if you know, from the first time you saw the man with his hands out til the time you saw run [sic] over, what kind of distance are we talking about?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    A. Maybe ten (10) yards.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    According to Ms. Perrine, the man appeared to be \"drug under the vehicle\" after he was hit. The vehicle that struck the pedestrian drove forward and immediately stopped. Ms. Perrine then saw the vehicle's \"reverse lights kick on\" and saw the vehicle back up a \"little bit.\" Ms. Perrine opined that the person driving the vehicle realized that people were stopping and decided to drive forward.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    As for gunshots, Ms. Perrine testified that she heard gunshots after she saw the reverse lights come on. According to Ms. Perrine, the man in the vehicle immediately drove forward, cut through the median, drove about a foot on the road, and then veered back into the median and stopped.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    When asked if she ever saw the pedestrian try to gain entry into the vehicle, Ms. Perrine responded, \"No, sir.\" Ms. Perrine could see that the pedestrian was armed with a knife in a sheath on his side. Although Ms. Perrine stated she could not see any other weapon on the pedestrian, she stated that she would have been in a position to see a gun in the pedestrian's hands. Ms. Perrine testified again that she did not see any type of firearm in the pedestrian's hands:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    Q. Okay, and did you see any type of firearm in his hand?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    A. No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    Q. Okay, and I'm talking about, specifically, from the time you saw the man standing outside the car until the time when you - - uh, when the gentlemen drove away, or drove up in the median, you never saw anything in his hands in terms of a firearm or anything in his hands, is that correct?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    A. No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Ms. Perrine pointed to a person in the courtroom as the driver of the vehicle that ran over the pedestrian.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Ms. Perrine explained that when she saw the defendant strike the pedestrian, she yelled at her mother, who then slammed on the brakes. Ms. Perrine was standing on the side of the road calling the sheriff's department when she heard the gunshots.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    On cross-examination, Ms. Perrine testified that she was about \"a quarter a mile\" behind the vehicles when she first saw the incident. When she got a little closer, she saw the pedestrian standing outside the vehicle. Ms. Perrine explained what she saw:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    Q. Okay, and um, the gentlemen, did he appear to be - - he was standing like this?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    A. Um.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    Q. Or like this?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    A. No, he had - - he had both arms stretched to his side, kind of like, what are you doing?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    Q. Okay, and - - did - - did - - did he appear to be excited?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n    A. I couldn't tell.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n    Q. Okay, could you tell if they were talking or ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n    A. The man was - - was um, he was speaking towards the man in the vehicle but - -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    Q. Okay, and he had approached the driver's side of the - - the other vehicle?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n    A. No, sir, he was still standing in front of the vehicle.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    Q. In front of the vehicle?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    Q. On the driver's side or the passenger's side?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    A. Closer towards the driver's side.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Ms. Perrine acknowledged that she could have missed something when she looked down at the floorboard to get her phone. Finally, Ms. Perrine admitted she said nothing in her written statement about seeing the pedestrian's hands.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    On re-direct, the following colloquy took place:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n    Q. Okay. If I were to tell you that - - that uh, that - - that Mr. Beck's allegation is, is that at the time the pedestrian was struck with the car, that he had a gun drawn and he was pointing it at the vehicle, were you in a position to clearly see whether or not that was the case?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n    A. Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n    Q. Okay, did you see uh, a gun drawn at any time, from the time you observed the - - the pedestrian standing outside the vehicle, from the time you stopped\n    and saw him, after he had been run over, and hear the gun shots?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n    A. No, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n    Q. Okay, and you're sure of that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n    A. Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Ms. Perrine's mother, Tamatha Desadier, testified next for the state. As Ms. Desadier approached the scene, she saw the \"younger of the two gentlemen\" outside of \"the vehicle.\" According to Ms. Desadier, the younger man had his hands up, and she could tell they were arguing. Ms. Desadier saw the man in the vehicle run over the man standing outside of the vehicle. Ms. Desadier slammed on her brakes, pulled to the side of the road, told her daughter to call 911, jumped out of the vehicle, started to run to the victim to give him aid, and then heard gunshots. Ms. Desadier hollered at a friend (Joey Dubea) to secure the firearm and then went over to help the victim. According to Ms. Desadier, the pedestrian \"was more or less rolled over by the car.\" Ms. Desadier described the pedestrian's position as \"by the driver's window.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    When asked if she was able to see the pedestrian pretty clearly, Ms. Desadier answered, \"Yes, sir.\" Ms. Desadier stated that she saw the pedestrian's hands and did not see anything in them. When asked if she would have been in a position to see a gun or anything in the pedestrian's hands, Ms. Desadier replied, \"Oh, yes, sir.\" Ms. Desadier did see a knife in a sheath on the pedestrian's side. As for the gunshots, Ms. Desadier could see that they were coming from the victim, who was on the ground and who had just been struck by the vehicle. Ms. Desadier further clarified the sequence of events as follows, \"He was struck, and as he was going down, that's when the shots went off.\" When asked if she knew whether the gunshots hit anything, Ms. Desadier testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    A. The - - the whole reason I knew he hit something is because when the gentlemen fled the scene ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n    Q. Right.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    A. ... whenever the shots went off, you saw him ditch into the side uh, into the median.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n    A. And I actually sent someone to make sure he wasn't dead.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n    Q. Okay. Did he come back up to the scene at some point, while you were there?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n    A. After the police finally arrived. We were on scene for 30 to 45 minutes ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n    A. ... before the police actually got there.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    On cross-examination, Ms. Desadier testified that the victim actually hit the defendant's windshield before he rolled off the hood. When asked if the victim acted in a threatening manner, Ms. Desadier answered, \"All I saw was the hands up, and - - and the men arguing.\" Ms. Desadier further testified that the victim had a gun in one sheath and a knife in the other. When asked if she saw the white Mercedes go in reverse after the victim was struck, Ms. Desadier replied, \"No.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    On re-direct, the state questioned Ms. Desadier about whether the vehicle backed up:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n    Q. Ma'am, you had indicated uh, when the gun shots happened, you - - you had not seen uh, the vehicle backing up towards ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    A. No, sir, but like I said, I did cowered [sic] down under our vehicle for a second ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n    A. ... til the shots - - til the shots stopped, and then I got up.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n    Q. Um, so I guess, my - - my question would be, from the time the pedestrian was hit by the car, and that's when you immediately starting [sic] your braking maneuver, is it fair to say your attention[ ] was probably for - - for a short while, directly towards getting your vehicle stopped, and on the side of the road?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n    A. Yes, sir ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    On re-cross examination, defense counsel asked Ms. Desadier:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n    Q. So when the shots were fired, it looked like Mr. Ross's vehicle was headed a - - way?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n    A. Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Benjamin Nettles was taking his daughter to dance on the day in question, when he noticed two vehicles stopped in the \"crossover.\" As he got closer, Mr. Nettles noticed \"the first one was standing outside the vehicle and one was still in the vehicle.\" In Mr. Nettles's opinion, the person standing outside of the vehicle was hunched over with his arms out to his side, looking aggravated and obviously upset about something. When asked if he noticed whether this person had anything in his hands, Mr. Nettles answered, \"Uh, I'm pretty sure there was something in his hand, now what it was, I - - I have no idea.\" The state then asked Mr. Nettles if he would have been able to tell if the item was a firearm, and Mr. Nettles responded, \"I don't think so, no, sir, not going at that .... that - - that speed ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    According to Mr. Nettles, the pedestrian was standing in front of the other vehicle. Mr. Nettles did not stop since he had his daughter with him. After he passed the intersection, Mr. Nettles looked in his rearview mirror and saw the pedestrian get hit and pushed three or four feet. After his daughter's dance class ended, Mr. Nettles drove back to the same area and saw police. Mr. Nettles stopped and told the police what he saw.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Mr. Nettles testified that he could not tell whether the pedestrian was armed. Then Mr. Nettles testified, \"... if - - if he was armed, I - - I - - I couldn't - - I didn't notice it.\" Mr. Nettles did not see anything on the pedestrian's belt or waist.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    On cross-examination, Mr. Nettles described the pedestrian's hands as being down when the pedestrian was standing in front of the vehicle. Mr. Nettles reiterated that he believed the pedestrian had an object in his hand but could not tell what it was. On re-direct, Mr. Nettles stated that he was eighty to ninety percent sure the pedestrian had something in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The victim's wife, Carolyn Gillette, was the next witness to testify. According to Mrs. Gillette, she and her husband (the victim) were about to turn when they noticed a vehicle approaching very quickly from behind. Believing it was unsafe to turn, the victim went across the median and pulled over. The vehicle, a white Mercedes, passed and then came back. According to Mrs. Gillette, the Mercedes returned by putting his vehicle in reverse. Mrs. Gillette testified that the person in the Mercedes backed up directly next to her on the passenger's side:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    Q. Okay. And - - and what happened at that point when he got window to window?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n    A. He was screaming and hollering that we didn't know how to drive, and driving to [sic] slowly in the left hand lane, just being, I mean, just ironic, just angry, he was mad, you know, and - - and I kind of got scared a little bit because I wasn't for sure what he was going to do, he was right there, you know, and uh, that's when Billy stepped out of the car.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Mrs. Gillette testified that the defendant was yelling obscenities and was very upset with them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    According to Mrs. Gillette, the victim was not \"really upset\" with the defendant but was confused as to why the defendant was so upset. Mrs. Gillette testified that the victim got out of the car when she said the defendant was scaring her. The victim walked to the back of the car the victim was driving, and the defendant backed up. Mrs. Gillette could hear what was being said and could see what was happening through her rear-view mirror. Mrs. Gillette described the ensuing events as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n    Q. Okay. Do you recall any of the - - the verbal exchange, were you able to hear the conversation?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n    A. Well, uh, he was telling Billy again, no, no, that - - that lane is - - is 65 and, you know, he was going 40 and - - and that was crazy, and he was - - he was ranting and raving, the same stuff over and over, the - - the foul words, and Billy just told him, he said man, none of this is worth this, just - - just go on. Just go on home, go on about your business, you know, and he again- - he - - you're here threatening me, Billy is like what? No, I'm not threatening you.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    A. You know, he says, well you're packing a gun, he said so.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Mrs. Gillette described the victim's voice as raised when the victim told the defendant to leave. According to Mrs. Gillette, the defendant could have simply pulled forward to leave.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Mrs. Gillette testified that she never saw the victim try to get in the defendant's car, make a step toward the defendant's car, or threaten the defendant. Mrs. Gillette did, however, hear the defendant threaten the victim by stating, \"I will kill you if you threaten me.\" When asked if the victim was armed, Mrs. Gillette replied the victim always open carried a .357 Revolver. Mrs. Gillette testified that during the time the victim was out of the vehicle, she never saw a weapon in his hand. According to Mrs. Gillette, the victim had a gun that was holstered, the victim had one hand hanging, and the victim had one hand pointing north when the victim spoke to the defendant. When asked what happened next, Mrs. Gillette testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n    A. Well, all of sudden, I mean, just, I never - - I - - Billy told him to leave and Mr. Ross, I could see through my side mirror, was backing up, I - - I assumed, maybe he was getting our license plate number for whatever reason, he wanted it, I don't know, but, there was no reason for him to back up.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    A. And when I realized why he was backing up, it was like, - - it was too late.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n    A. Billy tried to get out of the way but, he couldn't get out of the way fast enough, and then Billy just disappeared on me.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n    A. Just completely out of my view.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n    A. ... And I thought he was under the car, I didn't know that he was being drug on the other side of the car.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n    A. Um, I thought that he was under the car, and I kept looking for him to come out from underneath the car, and then the - - the next thing I saw was, Billy was laying across the media [sic] on the other side of the highway, in the uh, little white ring thing right there.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n    A. And he was laying there, he wasn't moving, and it was uh, almost - - it was just like a tunnel vision for me, all I can do was see him laying there, and then I heard the guns go off - - the gun go off, and it was just like - - it - - it woke me up, and he was alive.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n    Q. Okay, did - - did you notice him drawing the gun or does - - is that something you - - he described to you, ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n    A. No, ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n    Q. .... since then?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n    A. ... I - - I didn't - - I didn't see it, ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n    A. ... I'm - - even though I was looking straight at him, it was just like - - it took that gun shot to - - to ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n    A. ... pull me out of that um, - - all I could - - all I was imaging was, he - - he was gone.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    When asked what she did after she heard the gunshots, Mrs. Gillette replied that she got out of the car, and the defendant was speeding off down the median. Mrs. Gillette estimated the defendant traveled about fifty to sixty yards before stopping. Describing the victim's injuries, Mrs. Gillette stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n    A. I knew right off the bat, that he had a concussion, he had a huge knot on his head, some uh, lacerations on both arms, uh, his clothes were just all drug to pieces, and his foot, his leg was tangled, just it - - it was - - you could tell it was broken.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    At the conclusion of her direct examination, Mrs. Gillette testified that even though the victim did not threaten the defendant, she assumed the defendant saw the victim's holstered gun as a threat. Mrs. Gillette reiterated that the victim's gun remained holstered the entire time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    On cross-examination, Mrs. Gillette explained that the victim did not go into the turning lane to turn but remained in the left lane. When the victim saw the defendant's car quickly approaching, the victim tapped on his brakes to let the defendant know to pull over. The victim pulled over, and the defendant continued to travel a couple of car lengths before he backed up to the passenger's side of the victim's car. When the victim got out to speak to the defendant, the defendant backed up his car to speak to the victim. According to Mrs. Gillette, the victim and the defendant were communicating right behind the victim's car. On re-direct examination, Mrs. Gillette reiterated that just before he was struck by the defendant's car, the victim had no gun in his hand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    The final witness to testify for the state was the victim, Billy Gillette. The victim testified that on the day in question, his wife picked him up from work, they stopped to get \"a six pack,\" and they were approaching an intersection to make a turn to go home when he noticed a vehicle approaching him \"very fast.\" Instead of trying to make the turn, the victim got off the road and stopped. The victim described the vehicle approaching him as a silver or white Mercedes Benz SUV. The Mercedes passed the victim and then backed up to confront the victim. When asked what happened next, the victim testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n    A. He was raising all kind of cain, fussing at us, uh, I heard him say, I'll kill you, you SOB, dah, dah, dah, you don't need to be f-ing driving, this, that, and another. At that point, that's when I realized, I'm sitting here, my wife is between me and him.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n    A. All right? The only reason I got out of the vehicle was to get his - - his attention off her, I moved around back here.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n    Q. Okay, did he stay beside the vehicle?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n    A. No, sir, no. Soon as I came around here, he backed up.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n    A. Yes, sir, but - - but when uh, when I got out of my car to go around the back,\n    he apparently saw me because he - - he - - he backed up right here, and that's where we had our confrontation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The victim stated that he felt his wife was threatened and had no idea what the defendant was capable of. The victim stated that he did not know whether the defendant was armed and heard the words, \"I'll kill you.\" The victim continued testifying as to the incident as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n    Q. All right, and so after you got out of the vehicle, and he backed up to where you last indicated his car was, uh, where did you go - - what - - how - - how - - where did you go from there?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n    A. I got out of my vehicle, because he was still here, I got out of my vehicle and started walking this way, around the back, like I said getting his attention away from my wife, get her out of danger. He backed up at the same time and stopped right here, and I was probably six (6) feet from his vehicle.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n    Q. Okay, and he had his window down, I'm assuming?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n    A. Yes, he did.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n    Q. Uh, in relation to the front of the side uh, where - - where in relation did his vehicle did you - - did you end up?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n    A. I ended up about six (6) feet away from - - five (5) or six (6) feet away from his window, ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n    Q.

Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n    A.

Yes, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n    A. ... and at that point, I said the man is trying - - he's making me good on his threat, he's going to try to back over me. He did the back up, and that's when I unholstered my weapon, and I fired three (3) shots in the back of his vehicle to change his mind, and he did. He then proceeded up in this way, he went down the road, it seemed a little bit further, he stopped right about up here.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n    Q.

The victim reiterated that he never threatened to hurt the defendant and never drew his firearm. When asked how he knew this vehicle dragged him, the victim stated that he was relying on the police report, the fact that he ended up about thirty feet from where first hit him, and the fact that he had abrasions on his arm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    When shown photograph numbered S-2, the victim identified the broken windshield of the defendant's car. The victim testified that he saw the glass shatter when the round hit. According to the victim, the glass fell out when the defendant's car was coming toward him. When asked if he could tell how fast the vehicle was traveling toward him, the victim testified, \"Uh, all I knew, he was coming back.\" The victim further testified that the reverse lights indicated the vehicle was coming back.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    As for the injuries, the victim testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n    A.

The victim described the knife as a four-inch fixed blade used for cleaning his fingernails, cutting strap ties, and opening packages. The victim also agreed that the knife is sharp on both sides and could be used to stab someone, although it is not designed for that purpose. When asked if he normally carried his gun on his person, the victim replied, \"Yes, sir, all the time.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    When asked if it was fair to say he was mad when he exited his vehicle, the victim replied, \"I was upset, yes, I was.\" The victim agreed that it was an animated argument with cursing. When defense counsel asked him if he put his hands on his weapon at any time, the victim replied, \"Never.\" According to the victim, the defendant hit him with the front driver's side of his vehicle. The victim was standing \"no closer than six (6) feet\" from the driver's side of the defendant's car and never touched the defendant's car. After being hit, the victim was disoriented for a few seconds. Defense counsel asked the victim how soon he fired his weapon after \"waking up,\" and the victim replied:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n    A. It's hard to say uh, I was laying on the side, kind of realized what was happening and I looked down, and I saw Mr. Ross's vehicle, brake lights and reverse lights on.

That's when I pulled my weapon and began fire, yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    On re-direct, the state asked the victim why he did not shoot the front of the vehicle when the defendant first hit him, and the victim replied, \"Because my weapon was still holstered on my right hand .... on my left-hand side.\" When asked if he had time to get his weapon out, the victim replied, \"No way.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Defendant's Testimony\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    The defendant testified on his own behalf. On the day in question, the defendant received a shot for his back at Rapides General and was going to pick up a prescription when he was driving north on Highway 167. Defense counsel asked the defendant when he first saw the victim, and the following colloquy took place:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n    A.

Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n    A. And by then, I mean, Mr. Gillette was about stopped, and he come up there and turned in right here, right - - right - - at an angle, right in here.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n    Q.

And didn't ever have his blinker on either.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-278\">\n    According to the defendant, he backed up because the victim and his wife were looking at him. The defendant testified that when he stopped in the median, the victim exited his vehicle with a pistol in his hand and walked up to the defendant's car door. The defendant further testified that his car was still in reverse when the victim walked up to it. When asked if he had a chance to say anything to the victim, the defendant answered:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n    A. No, sir, I didn't.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-280\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n    A.

He told me he was going to blow my mother f-ing brains out.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-290\">\n    The defendant testified that he backed up enough to where he could turn and hit the victim to get away from him, then put his car in drive, and ducked so the car would take the bullets. The defendant then testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n    A. And uh, I gassed it, and laid down, and I turned the wheel to hit him, and when I hit him, he come up on the car.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-292\">\n    Q. Uh-huh (affirmative response).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-293\">\n    A. I drove across the median, he was up on the car, and a woman hollered, there goes the windshield. I made a hard right, laying in the seat, I made a hard right, he fell off the car, right in here.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n    Q. Uh-huh (affirmative response).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-295\">\n    A. And I turned and went down the median, well when I - - when he rolled off, I stopped just for a second, raised up and looked at him, he was laying on his chest and his belly, laying down, his head was looking back toward the road.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-296\">\n    Q. Okay, and - - and - - and why - - why did you look at him?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-297\">\n    A. I wanted to see if he was all right, I didn't - - I didn't want to hurt the man, I was trying to get away from the gun, and uh, when I took off, I run over his back leg, I mean, his legs with my back tire on the car - - I felt it boom, boom, when I run over him.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-298\">\n    Q. Uh-huh (affirmative response). And when - - when did you start getting shots fired at you?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-299\">\n    A. As soon as I left the road, as soon as I left right here - - because I turn and went - - I turned and went down the shoulder of the road all the way - - I went a pretty good ways down there, because he was shooting. I looked in my mirror, I was laying down, I looked in my mirror, he was sitting up in the road shooting at me.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-300\">\n    Q.

The defendant answered, \"No, sir, I backed up - - I backed up to tell him that there's a turning lane right here, and that's what it's for in that 65 miles an hour zone ...\" The defendant denied telling Officer Ryan James that he backed up to give the victim a piece of his mind. The defendant also denied telling Mrs. Gillette anything when he backed up to her window. The defendant also stated that Mrs. Gillette got out of the car. Although the victim never attempted to get in his car, the defendant testified that the victim had a gun on him and stated that he was going to kill the defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-305\">\n    The state and the defendant then had the following colloquy about the defendant's ability to move while the victim allegedly had a gun pointed at him:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n    Q. Right, and so, my point is, when you said you couldn't move because you had a gun at your head - - a foot from your face, you moved at least twice after that. You went into reverse, you backed up your car. You pointed your car at him, and then you shifted gears, ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-307\">\n    A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-308\">\n    Q. ... you said you undid your seatbelt, ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n    A. Uh-huh (affirmative response).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-310\">\n    Q. ... and then you floored it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-311\">\n    A. I laid it down, I laid it down and punched it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-312\">\n    Q. And then ran over him.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-313\">\n    A. I hit him with my car.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n    Q. Okay. So my - - my point is, you could move?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-315\">\n    A. Yeah, to get him - - to get him out of my way, yeah.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-316\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-317\">\n    A. To get the gun out, yeah.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n    Q. And are - - I guess, what would have been the difference between doing that and - - and driving down the road?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-319\">\n    A. Pulling out in front of traffic.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-320\">\n    Q. So there was traffic coming?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n    A. Well it could have been, I couldn't look.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-322\">\n    The defendant admitted he committed an aggravated battery against the victim but claimed it was committed in self-defense. After the defendant hit the victim initially, the defendant stopped to make sure the victim was okay, and then took off without knowing the victim's legs were still under his car.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      State's Rebuttal Witness\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-324\">\n    The state called Detective Ryan James on rebuttal. According to Detective James, when he spoke with the defendant at the scene, the defendant said he backed up to give the victim a piece of his mind. The defendant also told Detective James that the victim had his gun drawn and that the defendant would have gotten shot if he had not taken action. According to Detective James, the defendant did not tell him that the victim threatened to shoot him. Detective James recounted that the defendant told him he ran over the victim because he was afraid the victim was going to kill him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Argument\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    The defendant argues the evidence was insufficient to prove he had the specific intent to kill the victim and argues his actions were justified. The defendant cites the testimony of Byron Thomas, the witness who saw the defendant making his way through traffic before the incident in a non-aggressive manner. The defendant also cites Mr. Nettles's testimony that he saw something in the victim's hand and Ms. Desadier's testimony that shots were fired as the victim was going down. The defendant claims both of these testimonies support his testimony that the victim was armed before the defendant ran him over. Additionally, the victim and his wife both admitted the victim was carrying a firearm and a knife, and the victim's wife assumed the defendant was threatened by the weapons the victim was carrying. The defendant argues that even if the victim did not take his gun out of the holster, the defendant was still reasonable in fearing for his safety as he was approached by a man armed with a firearm. Furthermore, since the victim approached the defendant, the defendant argues the victim was the aggressor. The defendant claimed he argues these facts prove his actions were justified for both offenses and, at the very least, prove he did not have specific intent to kill the victim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-327\">\n    The state argues the evidence was sufficient to prove the defendant specifically intended to kill the victim. The state refers to the fact that the victim testified the defendant backed up his vehicle so that he could run over the victim rather than simply leave the scene. Even the defendant's own testimony supports the fact that he accelerated rapidly toward the victim. Furthermore, both the victim and Ms. Perrine testified that the defendant began backing up after he hit the victim the first time. These facts, the state argues, indicate the\n    defendant's desire to run over the victim again. The only reason the defendant did not run over the victim again, the state argues, was because the victim fired shots at the defendant's vehicle. Considering the above evidence, along with the fact that both the victim and the victim's wife testified the defendant threatened to kill the victim, the state contends the evidence was sufficient for a rational juror to infer the defendant specifically intended to kill the victim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-328\">\n    As for the lack of evidence that the defendant's actions were justified, the state argues:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-329\">\n    Defendant's Counsel in brief also suggest that Mr. Ross' actions were justified and reasonable. This suggestion is just not accurate given the testimony of the witnesses in the case. No other witness testified that the victim threatened the defendant by un-holstering the firearm prior to Mr. Ross deciding to run the victim over. The physical evidence at the scene also corroborates the testimony of each of the witnesses (except that of the defendant). The bullet holes in Mr. Ross' car are all in the rear of his Mercedes. If the victim had been threatening Mr. Ross with his drawn sidearm, the bullet holes would have much more likely to have been found in the front or driver window of the defendant's Mercedes, instead of the defendant's back windshield. Additionally, if the victim had his gun drawn, threatening the defendant as he testified, it would have been nearly impossible for the victim to have maintained possession of the firearm while being run down and dragged by the defendant's vehicle. The only reason the victim was able to maintain possession and control of the weapon was because it was in his holster as the other witnesses testified. Mr. Ross was clearly the aggressor during this incident of road rage. Although he could have driven on past after running the victim off the road, he chose to block the victim's vehicle then back up to aggressively confront the victim. He then decided to run over the victim with his Mercedes, instead of going on down the highway. Evidence of specific intent was plentiful, and the defendant's actions were in no way justified.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-330\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Discussion\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-331\">\n    This court has stated the following regarding the proof of specific intent for attempted second degree murder:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n    With regard to the defendant's convictions for attempted second degree murder, La.R.S. 14:30.1 provides, in relevant part, that \"[s]econd degree murder is the killing of a human being: (1) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm[.]\" Further, attempt is defined in La.R.S. 14:27(A), which provides that:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-333\">\n    Any person who, having a specific intent to commit a crime, does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended; and it shall be immaterial whether, under the circumstances, he would have actually accomplished his purpose.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n    Thus, although La.R.S. 14:30.1 provides that second degree murder requires \"specific intent to kill\"\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    \"to inflict great bodily harm,\" in order to be convicted of attempted second degree murder, the State must prove that the defendant had the specific intent to kill.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     v.\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10-269%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%2010/6/10%29\">\n     10-269 (La.App. 3 Cir. 10/6/10)\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050026\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/48/1210/\">\n     48 So.3d 1210\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     writ denied\n    </em>\n    , 10-2527 (La. 4/1/11),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7039520,7039410,7039480,7039444\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/1248/\">\n     60 So.3d 1248\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     cert. denied\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12208389,12208269,12208525,12208287,12208419,12442410,12442411,12442412,12442413,12442414,12442415,12442416,12442417,12442418,12208307,12442419,12442421,12442420,12442422,12208312,12442423,12208442,12442424,12208319,12208329,12208467,12208341,12208355,12208494,12208371\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/859/\">\n     565 U.S. 859\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12442420,12442421,12442422,12442423,12442424,12442425\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/132/196/\">\n     132 S.Ct. 196\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12442415,12442416,12442417,12442418,12442419,12442420,12442421,12442422\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/181/102/\">\n     181 L.Ed.2d 102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011).

The victim approached the defendant carrying a gun on his side, but not holding the gun in his hand, and told the defendant to leave the scene. Instead of simply leaving the scene, the defendant accelerated forward and intentionally ran over the victim with his car. Even if the defendant felt threatened by the holstered gun, the defendant's choice to run over the victim instead of leaving the scene was not reasonable.

Finally, the state asserts that even if this court decides to change the law, a harmless-error analysis should be applied since there was no credible evidence of self-defense presented.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-353\">\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Discussion\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-354\">\n    The second circuit case cited by the trial court set forth a good summary of the history and current state of the law regarding the burden of proving self-defense in a non-homicide case:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-355\">\n    Self-defense in a\n    <em>\n     homicide\n    </em>\n    case is governed by La. R.S. 14:20. Self-defense in a\n    <em>\n     non-homicide\n    </em>\n    case, such as the present matter, is governed by a separate statute, La. R.S. 14:19, set forth above. In Louisiana, the burden of proving self-defense in a non-homicide case has been the matter of some discussion. In\n    <em>\n     State v. Freeman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9560006\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/427/1161/\">\n     427 So.2d 1161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (La. 1983), the Louisiana Supreme Court noted that different statutory standards exist to justify the use of force or violence under La. R.S. 14:19 and 20, depending on whether a homicide results. In a non-homicide case, a claim of self-defense requires a dual inquiry: first, an objective inquiry into whether the force used was reasonable under the circumstances; and, second, a subjective inquiry into whether the force used was apparently necessary. The court in\n    <em>\n     Freeman\n    </em>\n    observed that the burden of persuasion in proving self-defense in a non-homicide situation, which entails a subjective as well as an objective inquiry, could arguably\n    be on the defendant since a subjective inquiry is involved. However, in disposing of the issues before it, the court in\n    <em>\n     Freeman\n    </em>\n    found it unnecessary to decide definitively whether the state or the defendant had the burden of proof in a non-homicide case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-356\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     State v.

In\n    <em>\n     Cheatwood\n    </em>\n    , the court observed that defenses such as justification are truly \"affirmative\" defenses because they do not negate any element of the offense, and it is logical to conclude that the legislature intended the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the exculpatory circumstances constituting the affirmative defense.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-357\">\n    This circuit has repeatedly held that the burden of proving self-defense in a non-homicide case rests with the defendant to prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

As we discussed in that assignment of error, we find the trial court did not err in instructing the jury. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for new trial reasserting the same issue. As for the verdict being contrary to the law and evidence and the ends of justice being served by the granting of a new trial, the defendant contends the trial court erroneously concluded the evidence was sufficient to sustain both convictions.

We have determined there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the defendant had the specific intent to kill the victim and tried to do that by running over the victim with his vehicle.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-376\">\n    Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:33 defines a battery as \"the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another.\" Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:34 defines aggravated battery as \"a battery committed with a dangerous weapon.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-377\">\n    In order to convict the defendant of the offense of aggravated battery, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used force or violence upon the victim with a dangerous weapon. There is clearly sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant used force or violence against the victim with a dangerous weapon. In this case the dangerous weapon was the vehicle he used to run over the victim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-378\">\n    Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 814(A)(4) specifies that aggravated battery is a responsive verdict to the charge of attempted second degree murder. While Article 814(C) requires the court to exclude a responsive verdict if the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, will not reasonably permit a finding of guilt of the responsive verdict, the evidence in the matter before us does support including aggravated battery as a responsive verdict. Under the facts of this case, aggravated battery is a lesser and included offense to the crime of attempted second degree murder. Proof of the offense of attempted second degree murder also constituted full proof of the offense of aggravated battery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-379\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

Ms. Beason testified that she had never known the defendant to hurt anyone.

When asked what caused the defendant to become disabled, Ms. Painter testified that she believed it was a mental disability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-396\">\n    On cross-examination, the state asked Ms. Painter if she heard the defendant threaten people on a routine basis.

Ms. Painter further testified that the defendant had been violent with his wife. As for his access to weapons, Ms. Painter testified that the defendant had several guns. As for an incident involving the defendant and a doctor in Alexandria, the following colloquy took place:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-399\">\n    Q. ....

According to Roy, this happened about a year after the defendant hurt his back in an accident. The defendant checked himself into a hospital and was eventually prescribed several medications - Xanax, Oxycodone, and sleeping pills. Roy testified that the defendant is unable to sleep or sit for long periods of time because of his back. When asked if the defendant suffered from any other medical problems, Roy replied that the defendant takes medication and sees a counselor for his temper. Finally, Roy stated the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-404\">\n    A. I'm sorry I wasn't here for your trial and I feel that I failed you as a son because I should have been here.

Finally, Roy affirmed that he was aware of the incident wherein the defendant threatened to pull a gun on his doctor because his doctor would not give him a shot in his back. Roy acquiesced in the state's indication that the incident with the doctor occurred shortly before the incident in question.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-408\">\n    After hearing the above evidence, the trial court asked the parties if restitution was being addressed in some way, for example by a civil proceeding. The state informed the court that there may be an issue with the defendant's insurance company contesting liability since it was an intentional act. The state did not know if the victim had recovered anything.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-409\">\n    The trial court stated the following in imposing the sentences:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-410\">\n    BY THE COURT: Okay.

I travel down that highway in the left hand lane at sixty-five (65) miles an hour and you can't do it, sir. You can't safely pull into that turning lane and make a safe crossing of that highway at sixty-five (65) miles a hour.

The defendant also notes his trial counsel was denied a continuance of the sentencing hearing to obtain medical records of the defendant's illness. Although the defendant\n    acknowledges there was a prior incident involving the defendant and a doctor's office, the defendant asserts there was no evidence that the defendant committed any act in furtherance of the threat nor was there any evidence the incident occurred on the same day as the incident at issue. The defendant further notes that his son testified at the sentencing hearing that the defendant has sought help for his issues. Even though the jury rejected his claim of self-defense, the defendant contends his belief that he was in danger still amounted to an \"imperfect defense\" that should have been considered as a mitigating factor.

The trial court allowed the defendant to introduce mitigating evidence and weighed that evidence against the evidence presented at trial. Although appellate counsel notes in brief that the trial court denied the defendant's request for a continuance of the sentencing hearing, appellate counsel does not assign any error as to the denial of the continuance. After hearing the defendant's mitigating evidence and setting forth the factors it considered, the trial court imposed a sentence of fifteen years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for attempted second degree murder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-435\">\n    For attempted second degree murder, the defendant was exposed to a sentence of ten to fifty years at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. La.R.S. 14:27 and 14:30.1. Thus, the defendant's fifteen-year sentence for attempted second degree murder was near the minimum. We find no error in the sentence imposed for the attempted second-degree murder conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-436\">\n    The defendant argues that the record fails to support the restitution award of $ 75,000.00. We agree. The trial court stated the amount was based on the description of the victim's injuries at trial. The amount was set with absolutely no evidence in the record to support it. There were no medical bills presented, no evidence of lost wages, and no testimony regarding damages of any nature. The court agreed to an arbitrary amount suggested by the state. We find the court erred by ordering restitution with no evidence to support the amount ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-437\">\n    Considering the nature of the crimes in the present case, the possible sentences that could have been imposed, and the restriction of this review to a bare excessiveness\n    review, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence for second degree murder in the present case. Additionally, we note the supreme court's repeated admonition \"that sentence review under the Louisiana constitution does not provide an appellate court with a vehicle for substituting its judgment for that of a trial judge as to what punishment is more appropriate in a given case.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

Additionally, under the specific facts of this case, the jury could have reasonably found that two distinct acts occurred here: the initial attempt to run over the victim, an aggravated battery, and the reversing to run over him again, attempted second degree murder. Accordingly, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-486\">\n     Although the record reflects Ms. Perrine pointed to someone in the courtroom, the record does not state whether that person was the defendant.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-487\">\n     The trial court ordered Defendant to be given credit for any amount paid through a civil proceeding or through insurance.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n   <author id=\"p-454\">\n    Conery, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-455\">\n    I join the majority in maintaining the defendant's conviction for attempted second\n    degree murder and in vacating both the conviction for aggravated battery and the related sentence. I further concur in the reversal of the order of restitution. I dissent in part, however, as I find legal error as to the sentencing hearing. As explained below, I would also vacate the defendant's sentence for attempted second degree murder given due process considerations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-456\">\n    Following consideration of the entire transcript in this case, one has to ask, \"Was defense counsel sufficiently diligent in his representation to insure his client's right to a fair sentencing hearing?\" Or, \"Was there a reason for the State to proceed with sentencing so quickly when there were many unanswered questions about the defendant's mental health?\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-457\">\n    The majority opinion explains that the underlying incident happened on September 19, 2017. The trial, however, was held on February 20, 2018, only six months later, and the sentencing hearing was conducted on March 29, 2018, just 35 days after the trial. Even if the defendant's medical condition and mental health issues may not have been sufficient to excuse his crime, those medical records and expert medical testimony were not made available for sentencing purposes. Defense counsel did move to continue the sentencing as, apparently, he had not obtained any doctor's reports or mental health records by the day of sentencing. After the trial judge denied the Motion to Continue, the attorney was not in a position to proffer the evidence or give a meaningful explanation of how those records may have been relevant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-458\">\n    When the defendant's son and sister testified at the sentencing, each gave information about their non-medical knowledge of the defendant's long-standing mental health issues. The prosecutor then cross examined each of them, but not about his mental health issues, instead eliciting harmful hearsay testimony about their father's temper and anger problems, with no medical testimony, medical records or other expert testimony to explain or mitigate his past behavior. No objection was lodged.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-459\">\n    Further, during cross examination of the defendant's son and sister, the prosecutor elicited extremely prejudicial other crimes evidence about alleged threats by the defendant against individuals whom he allegedly said he would \"get even with\" or words to that effect. Again, no objections were lodged.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-460\">\n    It is significant that the trial judge used these very hearsay statements in his reasons for sentencing as one of the main factors for his sentence on the attempted second degree murder charge. The trial judge specifically noted that Mr. Ross showed \"no remorse\" and had threatened others with bodily harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-461\">\n    Our jurisprudence would seem to preclude us from considering these issues on appeal as to Mr. Ross's conviction, as such issues are usually relegated to \"post conviction proceedings\" where a full record can be made as to the defense counsel's strategy, and evidence and expert testimony can be introduced.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    La.Code Crim.P. art. 930 ;\n    <em>\n     State v.

Specifically, the defendant was never given an opportunity by the trial judge to speak before sentencing. While the defendant was properly admonished by the trial judge not to speak while other witnesses were testifying, the defendant was never afforded an opportunity to speak after those witnesses testified. While it may be true that his attorney didn't call the defendant as a witness at the sentencing\n    hearing, the defendant was not given an\n    <strong>\n     opportunity to speak by the trial court\n    </strong>\n    , as happens in almost every case before sentencing. The words \"Do you have anything to say before sentencing?\" were never pronounced. To the contrary, when the defendant tried to speak, the trial judge stopped him as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-463\">\n    BY MR.

On cross examination, the State questioned Ms. Painter on her knowledge of any statements or lists allegedly made by the defendant threatening others, and whether he expressed disappointment for not killing the victim. Ms. Painter testified, \"yes, uh, I - - he may have, I don't...

Rankin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7515074\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/563/420/#p424\">\n     563 So.2d 420\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 424 (La.App. 1 Cir.1990). Yet, the issue in this case is not whether the letter containing allegations of similar conduct is admissible or could be relied upon by the sentencing judge. It is whether J.P.F. had an opportunity to deny the allegations. Thus, J.P.F., because he had no notice of these allegations, was not given a chance to even assert mistake or falsehood.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-481\">\n    J.P.F. did not offer any specific refutation of the allegations. Yet, it may have been not because they were true but because J.P.F. had no notice of those allegations, no knowledge of the details of those allegations, and, thus, no opportunity to deny, explain, rebut, or show that they were false. Based on this, not only did J.P.F. not have an opportunity to deny, explain, or rebut these allegations, he also did not have an opportunity to object to their admissibility based on mistake or falsehood. Therefore, the trial court's failure to allow J.P.F. an opportunity to deny, explain, or rebut the allegations of prior similar conduct also constitutes a violation of J.P.F.'s due process rights.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-482\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1019-20.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Telsee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9587036\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/388/747/\">\n     388 So.2d 747\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (La.1980) ;\n    <em>\n     State v. Bosworth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9703304\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/360/173/\">\n     360 So.2d 173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (La.1978).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-483\">\n    In light of the arguably improper hearsay evidence that was admitted during sentencing, albeit without his attorney's objection, and especially in light of the fact that the trial judge used that evidence as the major justification for his sentence and specifically prevented the defendant from speaking or otherwise contradicting that evidence, I find that there was a constitutional violation of the defendant's due process right to a fair sentencing hearing. I would reverse the defendant's sentence for attempted second degree murder and remand for resentencing in accordance with the law and this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
