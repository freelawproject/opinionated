For the reasons set forth herein, we reverse the decision of the trial court and remand for proceedings consistent herewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION OF THE RECORD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant, Damon Broussard, was indicted by a grand jury on one count of indecent behavior with a juvenile, in violation of La.R.S. 14:81, and one count of molestation of a juvenile, in violation of La.R.S. 14:81.2. The indictment was filed on February 19, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 27, 2014, the defendant filed a single pleading containing multiple motions therein, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Motion for a Preliminary Hearing; Motion for Discovery of Material Discoverable Under the Authority of\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kyles v. Whitley\n   </em>\n   ; Motion for Discovery of Records of Criminal Arrests and Convictions of State's Witnesses; Motion for Oyer of Warrants of Arrest, Search, and Seizure and Affidavits; Motion for Production of \"Initial Reports\" R.S. 44:3A(4); Motion for Discovery Pursuant to Code of Criminal Procedure Articles 716, et seq. ; Motion for State to Disclose to Defendant Grants of Immunity, Plea Bargain, Agreement or Consideration Granted to Any Witness or Prospective Witness of the State; Motion to Suppress Evidence; and a Request for Notice Under La. C.E. 404(b) and 412.2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 28, 2014, the trial court signed an order setting a hearing date of May 5, 2014, for six of the eight discovery motions filed by the defendant. The order for hearing did not include the motion for a preliminary examination or the motion to suppress. The minutes of the trial court for May 5, 2014, reflect that the hearing on the discovery motions was continued to June 18, 2014. On June 18, 2014, the minutes of the trial court and the transcript of the hearing reflect that counsel for the defendant advised the trial court that the discovery motions set for hearing that date had been satisfied by the State and that he reserved the right to file additional\n   motions after reviewing the provided discovery material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court minutes for June 18, 2014, further reflect that a pre-trial conference set for that day was passed, and it was later set for July 23, 2014, but was again passed and reset for October 15, 2014. On October 15, the pre-trial conference was again passed and reset for November 19, 2014. On November 19, it was passed and reset for March 23, 2015. On March 23, 2015, the pre-trial conference was passed and reset for September 21, 2015. The trial court minutes for November 16, 2015, reflect that the trial of the matter was set for that day, but was continued on motion of the State and reset for a status hearing on December 17, 2015, and trial was set for January 25, 2016. Thereafter, neither the trial court minutes nor the transcript of the proceedings reflect any hearings, appearances, or motions being filed until April 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant filed a motion to quash on April 5, 2017, alleging that he had not been brought to trial within the two-year time limit from the institution of prosecution. The minutes of court for May 1, 2017, reflect that the trial of the case, scheduled for that day was continued on motion of the State. It further reflected the filing of the defendant's motion to quash and that the State was ordered to submit a reply brief within two weeks. On August 31, 2017, the hearing on the motion to quash was reset to September 25, 2017. Following the September 25 hearing, the trial court denied the motion to quash, finding that the defendant's Motion for Preliminary Hearing and Motion to Suppress had never been disposed of, and thus, continued to suspend the time limitation for commencing trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant applied for writs to this court, and on February 16, 2018, we issued the following writ ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     WRIT GRANTED AND MADE PEREMPTORY\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n   The Defendant seeks review of the trial court's September 25, 2017 determination that his Motion for Preliminary Hearing and Motion to Suppress were unresolved preliminary pleas that suspended the running of prescription under La.Code Crim.P. art. 580. The motions either became moot on June 18, 2014, when defense counsel said the Defendant's discovery motions were satisfied and reserved his right to file additional motions or were abandoned when defense counsel made no effort to have them set for hearing for approximately three and a half years.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

At a hearing held that date, the trial court granted the motion to quash, relying on the writ decision of this court, from which the State sought review by writ application to this court. On June 12, 2018, this court granted the State's writ application and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to treat the State's notice of intent to file a writ application as a motion to appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

During\n   the hearing, the State asserted that suppression was still a viable issue in the present case and would likely be re-urged by the defendant. Additionally, it asserted that in order for a motion to be considered abandoned, defense counsel had to specifically state that it was abandoned. The State further argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   MR. HAMILTON: Your Honor, but if defense counsel can just file the motion and just let it go and, you know, say it's abandoned, and that's what we choose to do, then they're going to file motions, and then they'll pick and choose when they're going to serve it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   So three and-a-half years pass, and let's say it's for trial, and we set it for trial, and he finally says, \"Hold on, I've got this motion to suppress.

As a further rationale for its holding, the court commented that the motion was rendered moot by the defendant's receipt of the statements from the State. However, it is clear that the motion in that case was based upon the State's failure to produce the statements prior to trial; thus, it was not a true motion to suppress evidence. That is an entirely different issue\n   from the Motion to Suppress evidence in the case at hand, and there is no evidence in this record showing otherwise.

The fifth circuit, in rejecting defendant's argument on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to consider his motion to suppress, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We believe that defendant waived his right to have the motion to suppress considered. First, defendant did not allege facts in his motion to suppress as required by La.C.Cr.P. art. 703 E.

In\n   <em>\n    Vernon\n   </em>\n   , the State argued before the trial court that the time limit for institution of trial was interrupted per the provision of La.Code.Crim.P. art. 579. It was only on appeal that the State attempted to argue the suspension of the time limitations for trial, as per the provisions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 580. The fourth circuit held that the State abandoned that claim by its failure to argue such in the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The State failed to assert, as a basis for its objection to the motion to quash, that the preliminary pleas suspended the time limitations period. In that the State failed to raise the issue of suspension, this Court concludes that the State intended to argue its objections based solely on La. C.Cr.P. art. 579. We find no reason to remand the case to allow the State a \"second bite at the apple\" to argue new grounds for denial of the motion to quash based on evidence which the State had available to it prior to the trial court hearing. Under these circumstances and in light of the trial court's discretion when ruling on a motion to quash, this Court will not consider the State's suspension argument as it is raised for the first time on appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Vernon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180318\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/525/\">\n    207 So.3d at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Thus, the cases cited are not controlling in this particular case.

In\n   <em>\n    Wagster\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court reviewed a claim by the defendant on appeal concerning the denial of a hearing on his motion to quash the jury venire filed prior to trial. Without a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant's motion to quash the petit jury venire. While not questioning the ruling on the merits of the motion, the defendant argued on appeal that he was denied a constitutional and statutory right when he was refused the right to present evidence at a hearing on his motion. In rejecting the argument, the supreme court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The defense motion was filed ten days before trial and no subpoenas were requested on behalf of the defense. On the morning of the trial defense counsel stated that subpoenas were not issued for defense witnesses because he was unaware that the motion was set for hearing on the day of trial. It should be observed parenthetically that it is ordinarily\n   incumbent upon the proponent of a motion to move for a hearing date on that motion. Otherwise it may be considered that the motion has been abandoned. The record does not show that an effort was made to have a date set for a hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Nevertheless, rather than delay the trial, the judge allowed defense counsel to outline the evidence he intended to introduce.

It remained suspended as it was neither withdrawn by the defendant nor ruled upon by the court before the trial commenced. Even if defense counsel's arguments at the September 17, 2009 hearing amount to a waiver or withdrawal of the Motion to Recuse the District Attorney, the suspension of prescription from February 2005 until September 2009 makes the November 2009 trial date timely. There is no violation of the defendant's right to a speedy trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 760.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The case at hand does not involve any overt pre-trial act or declaration of the defendant to waive either his Motion to Suppress or Motion for Preliminary Hearing prior to the hearing on September 25, 2017. It further does not involve the abandonment of the motion by proceeding to trial, as this case has not yet been tried. While the defendant may have waived his previously filed motions for discovery, he never formally waived on the record his Motion to Suppress or his Motion for Preliminary Hearing. Indeed, the transcript of\n   the June 18, 2014 hearing reflects no mention of either motion. The order of March 28, 2014, setting the particular discovery motions for this hearing, ultimately held on June 18, 2014, specifically included only the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"Motion for Discovery of Material Discoverable under Authority of Brady v. Maryland and Whitley; Motion for Discovery of Records of Criminal Arrests and Convictions of State's Witnesses under Authority of\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ; Motion for Oyer of Warrants of Arrest, Search and Seizure and Affidavits; Motion for Discovery Pursuant to Code of Criminal Procedure Articles 716, et seq. ; Motion for State to Disclose to Defendant Grants of Immunity, Plea Bargain, Agreement or Consideration Granted to any Witness or Prospective Witness of this State; Motion for Production of 'Initial Reports' R.S. 44:3A(4).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   There is no mention of the Motion to Suppress or the Motion for Preliminary Hearing in this order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court minutes for June 18, 2014, state that counsel for the defendant informed the trial court during the hearing that \"the\n   <strong>\n    discovery motions\n   </strong>\n   have been satisfied with the remainder being passed.\" (Emphasis added.) The transcript for the same date is consistent with the trial court minutes that it was in fact the discovery motions that were being addressed exclusively, where defendant's counsel stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   We had filed various motions. I've spoken with Ms. Boustany, and she has made a copy of the discovery for us. So I just wanted to indicate for the record that it looks like our discovery motions are satisfied, however, I'd like to reserve my right to file any additional motions based on our review of the discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Thus, we find that that neither the Motion to Suppress nor the Motion for Preliminary Hearing were formally waived or withdrawn in open court by the defendant until the initial hearing on the Motion to Quash. According to the plain language of La.Code Crim.P. art. 580, a formal waiver does not occur unless the request is made to the trial court and a ruling recognizing the dismissal thereof is rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, any pending motion has not been abandoned as the case is still pending trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Our jurisprudence is clear that a defendant can waive any pending motions during the proceedings themselves by acquiescence, such as by failing to object in open court, after the State announces, prior to trial, that no motions are pending and then proceeds to trial. This was the case in\n   <em>\n    State v. Lambert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98-730%20%28La.App.%204%20Cir.%2011/17/99%29\">\n    98-730 (La.App. 4 Cir. 11/17/99)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11495669\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/739/\">\n    749 So.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 00-1346 (La. 1/26/01),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11123076,11123051,11123108,11123028\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/781/1258/\">\n    781 So.2d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in the case sub judice, this matter has not yet proceeded to trial. More importantly,\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the State is under no duty whatsoever to ensure that any defense motion is heard.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   As previously discussed, defendant effectively waived his right to a hearing on his motion to suppress. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the statement on\n   18 February 1997. On 21 March 1997, when the case was called for hearing on the motions, the State represented that no motions were pending. Defense counsel assented to this statement by his silence, and the trial court moved on with the case. There is no indication that defendant ever raised the motion to suppress the statements again. Accordingly, defendant abandoned his motion to suppress the statement. There was no error by the trial court in failing to conduct a hearing on the motion to suppress under these circumstances, and the State was under no duty to ensure that defendant's motion was heard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 756.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is ordinarily incumbent upon the proponent of a motion to move for a hearing date on that motion. Otherwise, it may be considered that the motion has been abandoned.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wagster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9723645\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/361/849/\">\n    361 So.2d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 (La.1978) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

To allow such would be to arm every defendant in a criminal proceeding with an arsenal of land mines in the form of multiple unresolved motions, frivolous or not, to gain the dismissal of charges on technical grounds, and thus, thwarting the justice process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It further begs the question of when abandonment actually occurs if the mere lapse of time, absent a ruling on the pre-trial motion, constitutes legal abandonment or waiver of the motion or other preliminary plea. Do we set some arbitrary \"reasonable time\" within which to resolve a pending motion, and thereafter, declare that the defendant waived the motion, even if the trial has not yet commenced? We think not. As the caselaw clearly reflects, it is only the commencement of trial, prior to either the trial court's ruling on the motion on its merits or the trial court's ruling accepting a declaration of abandonment, waiver, or withdrawal of the motion by the defendant, that triggers recommencement of the running of the time limitations set forth in La.Code Crim.P. art. 580.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   What is controlling here is the clear language of La.Code Crim.P. art. 580. The plain letter of the law provides for the suspension of the period in which to commence trial until the trial court\n   <em>\n    rules\n   </em>\n   on the motions in question. In this case, there was no ruling on the Motion to Suppress evidence and no hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Hearing, both of which were filed by the defendant on March 27, 2014. These motions were still pending, at least up to the time of the original hearing on the Motion to Quash on September 25, 2017. But for the erroneous granting of the motion to quash at the March 1, 2018 hearing, the suspension of the two-year trial limitation continues until the motions, including this Motion to Quash, are disposed of by a final ruling of the trial court or former withdrawal by the\n   defendant and dismissal by ruling of the trial court, at which time the time period for trial shall recommence. To the extent that our writ ruling reflects otherwise, such was in error. Accordingly, the granting of the motion to quash is reversed, and the matter remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the order of the trial court granting the motion to quash the indictment of the defendant, Damon Broussard, is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent herewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The defendant was separately indicted on another count of molestation of a juvenile that was prosecuted simultaneously with common pleadings and hearings, although the cases were not officially consolidated or joined.
