Adam Isaac Lewis alleges that his obligation to pay alimony to his ex-wife Karen Conway Lewis should be terminated because Karen is cohabiting or in a de facto marriage with her longtime boyfriend. Adam's complaint to terminate alimony proceeded to trial, and after Adam rested his case, the chancellor found that he had not met his burden of proof and dismissed his complaint pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). The chancellor also awarded Karen half of the attorney's fees that she incurred defending the case. Adam challenges both the dismissal of his complaint and the award of attorney's fees to Karen. We affirm the dismissal of Adam's complaint because the chancellor did not clearly or manifestly err by finding that Adam failed to meet his burden of proof. However, we reverse and render the award of attorney's fees because it is clear that Karen is financially able to pay her own attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Adam and Karen were married in 1989 and were granted an irreconcilable differences divorce in 2002. The final judgment of divorce incorporated the parties' child custody and property settlement agreement, which granted Karen physical custody of the couple's four minor children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement provided that Adam would pay Karen $15,000 per month as \"permanent periodic alimony.\" The agreement stipulated that alimony was \"modifiable\" and would terminate upon Karen's remarriage or death or upon Adam's death. The agreement further stated that alimony was based on Adam's \"projected business net income of $700,000 per year.\" In 2012, an agreed judgment was entered modifying Adam's child support obligations and requiring Adam to disclose his tax returns to Karen each year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In 2015, Adam filed a complaint alleging that his obligation to pay alimony\n   should be terminated because \"[Karen] has substantial savings and/or other investments, is well educated and fully capable of supporting herself, but refuses to do so.\" The complaint further alleged that Adam's alimony permitted Karen to \"enjoy[ ] a life of leisure without gainful employment, while being romantically involved and living with another man all at [Adam's] expense.\" Karen answered, denied Adam's allegations, requested attorney's fees, and filed a counterclaim alleging that Adam was in contempt because he had failed to disclose his tax returns as required by the 2012 agreed judgment. Karen later withdrew her counterclaim for contempt after Adam disclosed his tax returns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Adam's complaint for modification was tried on June 30, 2016. Adam testified that he originally agreed to pay Karen alimony of $15,000 per month because he wanted her to be able to stay in the marital home, which carried a substantial mortgage payment. However, Karen subsequently moved out of the marital home and into a smaller house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Adam testified that shortly after their divorce in 2002, Karen began dating Steven Dobel. According to Adam, Karen and Dobel had vacationed together on many occasions and even bought a vacation home together in Maine in 2010 or 2011; however, Karen sold her interest in the home after Adam confronted her about it. Adam also testified that Dobel gave Karen a diamond ring that she once wore on her ring finger; however, it had been \"several years\" since Adam had seen Karen wear the ring. Adam acknowledged that Karen and Dobel own and live in their own homes and do not spend nights at each other's houses; however, he alleged that they spend their days together and even \"take ... nap[s] in the same bed.\" Adam acknowledged that his testimony was based primarily on what others had told him. Adam also admitted that he had no evidence that Dobel financially supported Karen or vice versa. Nonetheless, Adam claimed that Karen and Dobel were in a \"de facto marriage\" because they had held \"themselves out as a couple for the last fifteen years,\" went on \"trips with each other,\" and did not \"date other people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Adam testified that since his divorce from Karen, he had married and divorced the same woman three times. He was paying her alimony of $10,000 per month for forty-eight months and child support of $1,000 per month for one child. He also had a child by another woman, whom he paid child support of $1,200 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Adam is a neurosurgeon. He acknowledged that he has earned at least $700,000 every year since he divorced Karen. He reported income of $2,209,451 in 2012, $2,514,479 in 2013, and $1,848,930 in 2014, and he testified that his income in 2015 was approximately $5,000,000. However, he testified that only about $1,000,000 of his 2015 income was from his medical practice, and the rest was from a sale of a medical device company. Adam testified that he expects his income to decrease in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Karen has not worked outside the home since her first child was born in 1990. Alimony is her only material source of income. She owns a home valued at approximately $600,000 with no mortgage. She also has a twenty-five percent interest in three family vacation homes. She has checking and savings accounts with a combined balance of $152,277, investment accounts with a combined balance of $24,851, and a retirement account with a balance of $54,819.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Adam rested his case without presenting any testimony other than his own. Karen then moved to dismiss his complaint pursuant to\n   Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), arguing that Adam had failed to meet his burden of proving a de facto marriage or cohabitation. The chancellor agreed that Adam had failed to meet his burden of proof, commenting that his evidence consisted of \"assumptions and/or ... hearsay.\" Therefore, the chancellor granted Karen's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Karen then proceeded on her request for attorney's fees. She offered her attorney's affidavit and invoices showing that she had incurred total attorney's fees of $27,870.99, she had paid her attorney $15,698.49 of that amount, and her current balance due was $12,172.50. The chancellor found that Karen \"is of a financial standing in the court system that is not often seen and is capable of providing some of her own defense costs,\" so the chancellor denied her request for the full amount of her attorney's fees. However, the chancellor found that Karen was \"entitled to receive compensation for the requirement that she come in and defend herself.\" Therefore, the chancellor awarded Karen half of the attorney's fees that she requested ($13,935.50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Adam filed a timely motion for reconsideration on all issues, and Karen filed a timely motion for reconsideration of the denial of half of her attorney's fees. The chancellor denied both motions, and Adam filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. On appeal, Adam argues that the chancellor erred by granting Karen's motion to dismiss because he met his burden of proving cohabitation, a de facto marriage, or some other material change in circumstances. Adam also argues that the chancellor erred by awarding attorney's fees. We address these issues in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Rule 41(b) Dismissal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13. In a bench trial, after the plaintiff \"has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant ... may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\" M.R.C.P. 41(b).

We reach the same conclusion in the present case. Karen and Dobel obviously are in a long-term, serious relationship. However, unlike\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , there is no outright admission or any other clear or direct evidence that Karen is avoiding remarriage just to continue receiving alimony. Adam testified that\n   <em>\n    he believes\n   </em>\n   that is what Karen is doing. However, Adam did not call Karen or Dobel as an adverse witness. In addition, although Adam apparently deposed Karen prior to trial, he did not seek to introduce any part of her deposition into evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 32(a)(2) (\"The deposition of a party ... may be used [at trial] by an adverse party for any purpose.\");\n   <em>\n    Fred's Stores of Tenn.

Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , Karen and Dobel maintain separate residences and separate finances. As noted above, Adam admitted that he had found no evidence that Dobel supports Karen financially or vice versa. Therefore, as in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , we cannot say that the chancellor manifestly or clearly erred by finding that Adam failed to prove a de facto marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 25.

Thus, to the extent that Adam offered circumstantial evidence that could have\n   <em>\n    permitted\n   </em>\n   an inference of a de facto marriage, the chancellor was \"not required to look at the evidence in the light most favorable to [Adam],\" nor was she required to give him \"the benefit of all favorable inferences.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Material Change in Circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26. Adam also makes a brief argument that other material changes in circumstances warrant a reduction in alimony. Karen argues that Adam failed to preserve this issue because he asked the chancery court to\n   <em>\n    terminate\n   </em>\n   alimony based on allegations of cohabitation and de facto marriage and failed to request a\n   <em>\n    modification\n   </em>\n   of alimony based on some other change in circumstances.

McCraw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7554773\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/759/519/#p521\">\n    759 So.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 28. In this case, Adam failed to meet his burden of proof. The changed circumstances on which he relies were entirely foreseeable. Adam argues that Karen reduced her expenses when she moved out of the marital home; however, the parties' original property settlement agreement expressly anticipated and provided for a subsequent sale of the marital home. Adam also argues that Karen's expenses were reduced when their children grew up and moved out of her home; however, this too was to be expected and hardly can be considered an\n   <em>\n    unanticipated\n   </em>\n   change in circumstances. Adam also points out that Karen's finances are sound and that she has some savings and interests in family vacation homes; however, there is no showing of a material and unanticipated improvement in her financial situation since the time of the divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 29. Finally, Adam emphasizes that since he divorced Karen, he has incurred obligations to pay alimony and child support to a second wife and child support for another child born out of wedlock. \"Suffice it to say that generally one cannot relieve himself from the payment of alimony according to the provisions of a divorce decree by the obligations imposed upon him by a second marriage.\"\n   <em>\n    De Marco v.

Ct. App. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 30. In summary, Adam's income is more than sufficient to permit him to pay the permanent periodic alimony that he agreed to at the time of his divorce, and he failed to prove any material and unanticipated change of circumstances since the time of his divorce. Accordingly, he is not entitled to a reduction of alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 31. As discussed above, the chancellor found that Karen \"is of a financial standing in the court system that is not often seen and is capable of providing some of her own defense costs,\" so she denied Karen's request for attorney's fees in part. However, the chancellor awarded Karen half of her fees ($13,935.50) because she found that Karen was \"entitled to receive compensation for the requirement that she come in and defend herself.\" Adam argues that this award was an abuse of discretion and should be reversed and rendered, and we are compelled to agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 32. Adam's complaint to terminate alimony was not frivolous or subject to sanctions under the Litigation Accountability Act or Rule 11, nor was he found to be in contempt of court. Therefore, the only possible basis for an award was Karen's own inability to pay the fees. Karen is not entitled to an award of attorney's fees just because Adam \"is more capable of paying her attorney's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Rhodes v.

Karen failed to show that she is unable to pay her attorney's fees. Karen continues to receive alimony of $15,000 per month from Adam, and she has substantial assets. At the time of trial, Karen already had paid more than half of the fees that she requested, and she only testified vaguely that she thought her mother \"might have helped\" her make one payment because \"that particular month\" she could not pay the entire bill. It is clear that Karen is financially able to pay her own\n   attorney's fees. Therefore, we hold that the chancellor abused her discretion by ordering Adam to pay Karen's attorney for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 34. The chancellor did not clearly or manifestly err by finding that Adam did not meet his burden of proof on his complaint to terminate alimony. Therefore, we affirm the chancellor's decision granting Karen's Rule 41(b) motion to dismiss. However, Karen is financially able to pay her own attorney, so Adam should not have been ordered to pay her attorney's fees for her. Therefore, we reverse and render the award of attorney's fees to Karen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 35.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND RENDERED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   GRIFFIS, P.J., BARNES, FAIR, GREENLEE AND WESTBROOKS, JJ., CONCUR.

The majority finds that the chancellor did not clearly or manifestly err by dismissing Adam's petition to terminate his periodic-alimony obligation to Karen after determining that Adam failed to meet his burden of proof. I disagree, and I respectfully dissent. I find that the record shows that the chancellor erred in dismissing Adam's petition under Rule 41(b) and awarding Karen attorney's fees; accordingly, I would reverse the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 37. The record reflects that Adam filed a petition in chancery court to terminate his periodic-alimony obligation to his ex-wife Karen. After Adam presented his evidence and testimony at the hearing, Karen moved to dismiss his petition under Rule 41(b) for failure to establish a prima facie case. The chancellor granted the dismissal, and Adam appealed. On appeal, Adam argued the chancellor erred (1) by denying his request to terminate his periodic-alimony obligation, and (2) by ordering him to pay one-half of Karen's attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 38. Adam and Karen divorced in 2002. At the time of their divorce, the parties had four minor children. Pursuant to their property-settlement agreement, Adam agreed to pay Karen $15,000 a month in periodic alimony. He also agreed to pay monthly child support and to meet certain other financial needs for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 39. On August 25, 2015, Adam filed a \"Petition for Modification,\" which expressly sought the termination of his periodic-alimony payments to Karen. At the time Adam filed his petition, the parties' four children all had reached the age of majority. In his petition, Adam argued the chancellor should terminate his periodic-alimony obligation because the parties had experienced a material change in circumstances. Adam alleged that the parties' children all had reached the age of majority and that he had continued to pay a substantial amount of alimony to Karen each month although Karen (1) now possessed substantial savings and investments; (2) was well educated and capable of supporting herself; (3) enjoyed a life of leisure without gainful employment; and (4) was in a de facto marriage. Karen filed a response and counterclaim to Adam's petition. In addition to her other requested relief, Karen asked the chancellor to dismiss Adam's petition and to award her reasonable attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 40. At a hearing on June 30, 2016, Adam testified that at the time of the parties' divorce, they lived in a home with a $10,000 monthly mortgage payment. In the divorce proceedings, Karen received\n   the marital home and the accompanying mortgage payment. Adam testified he wanted his children to remain in their home. As a result, he said he agreed to give Karen $15,000 a month in alimony so she could pay the mortgage and still have funds for the rest of the month. However, Adam stated that Karen decided to downsize to a smaller home six months after the divorce. As a result, Adam paid Karen $170,000 of equity for her share of the marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 41. According to Adam, at the time of the hearing Karen lived in a paid-for $600,000 home and owned a twenty-five percent interest in homes located in Delaware, South Carolina, and Puerto Rico. Adam also testified that, since their divorce, Karen exclusively had dated Steven Dobel, who owned a house about a mile from her in the same neighborhood. Adam stated that he and Karen had gone on double dates with Dobel and his wife before both couples divorced in 2002. Although Adam testified that Karen and Dobel did not spend their nights together, he stated that he had learned they spent most of their days together and took naps in the same bed before separating at night. Adam further testified that Dobel had given Karen a diamond ring several years before, which Karen had worn on her ring finger, and that Karen and Dobel saw each other on a daily basis and often vacationed together. Adam also stated that Karen and Dobel bought a home together in Maine but that, after Adam confronted Karen about the purchase, Karen sold her interest in the home to Dobel. According to Adam, Karen had obtained a college degree, was in good health, and was capable of gainful employment. However, Adam testified that Karen had not worked since before the parties had their children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 42. On cross-examination, Adam admitted that he possessed no firsthand knowledge regarding his claims that Karen and Dobel cohabited and were in a de facto marriage. Instead, Adam conceded his testimony was based on his assumptions, Karen's deposition testimony, and what his children, his private investigator, and Dobel's ex-wife had told him. Adam further admitted that, although he had subpoenaed Karen's financial records, he had no actual proof that she and Dobel financially supported one another. Adam also admitted that Karen and Dobel each owned their own homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 43. Adam presented no other witnesses to support his claims. At the close of Adam's case-in-chief, Karen moved to dismiss his petition under Rule 41(b). Karen argued that Adam's testimony alone, which was based solely upon hearsay and assumptions rather than personal knowledge, failed to constitute sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of a de facto marriage, cohabitation, or mutual financial support between her and Dobel. In a bench ruling, the chancellor granted Karen's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 44. On July 11, 2016, the chancellor entered a final judgment that incorporated the factual findings and legal conclusions from her bench opinion. In dismissing Adam's petition with prejudice under Rule 41(b), the chancellor determined that Adam provided only assumptions and hearsay to support his claims, and she found such evidence insufficient to meet his burden of proof to show a material change in circumstances. The chancellor concluded that Adam failed to show Karen structured her relationship with Dobel so that they were committed to one another like a married couple, while remaining legally unmarried, to receive the benefit of alimony. The chancellor further found that Adam failed to show Karen deliberately had avoided remarriage merely to continue to receive alimony. However, the chancellor\n   issued no findings as to whether Adam met his burden of proof to show a material change in circumstances as a result of Karen no longer owing $10,000 a month in mortgage payments and the children all reaching the age of majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 45. The chancellor also found that, although Karen could pay a portion of her attorney's fees, she presented sufficient evidence to entitle her to recover some of the money she expended in defending against Adam's petition. As a result, the chancellor ordered Adam to pay Karen $13,935.50, which amounted to one-half of her attorney's fees and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 46. Rule 41(b) provides that \"[a]fter the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant ... may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\" When considering a dismissal based on the plaintiff's failure to show a right to relief, \"the judge must consider the evidence fairly, rather than in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Pittman v.

Adam asserts that the chancellor erred by denying his request to terminate his periodic-alimony payments because the parties experienced a material change in circumstances that justifies the termination of periodic alimony. In support of his argument, Adam claims that Karen engaged in a de facto marriage and cohabited with Dobel. Adam further claims that Karen possessed substantial savings and investments, was well educated and capable of supporting herself, enjoyed a life of leisure without gainful employment, and the parties' children all had reached the age of majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 48.

In evaluating these factors when deciding whether to modify periodic alimony, chancellors should compare the relative positions of the parties at the time of the request for modification in relation to their positions at the time of the divorce decree.
