The instant case addresses whether the claims of the Appellant, Marilyn Newsome, survive summary judgment against Appellees, People's Bank and Chris Dunn. The claims address the issuance of cashier's checks by People's Bank and Chris Dunn without the signature or approval of the conservatorship account holder, Marilyn Newsome. For the reasons expounded upon below on the direct appeal, the Court affirms the judgment of the trial court in part and reverses and remands in part. On the cross appeal, under different reasoning, the Court affirms the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On February 9, 2015, Marilyn Newsome filed suit against Chancellor David Shoemake, former Chancellor Joe Dale Walker, Keely McNulty, People's Bank (the Bank), and Chris Dunn (Dunn). The instant appeal focuses only on the liability of the Bank and Dunn, if any. Therefore, the alleged liability and/or wrongdoing of the additional parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not at issue and is neither addressed in the facts provided below nor in the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In 2010, Charles Merkel of Merkel &amp; Cocke hired Keely McNulty (McNulty), an attorney, to set up the conservatorship for his client, Victoria Newsome. Victoria Newsome had settled a medical malpractice case, but she was unable to manage her affairs. The trial court appointed Marilyn Newsome (Newsome), Victoria Newsome's mother, as the conservator for Victoria Newsome. The trial court then denied the request to purchase a home for Victoria Newsome, and instead, the trial court ordered that a house be built for her. In the interim, the trial court ordered a mobile home to be purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. With the help of Dunn, a Bank employee, Newsome opened a checking account for the conservatorship with the Bank. When Newsome opened the conservatorship account, she signed a Deposit Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Deposit Agreement, Newsome was the sole authorized signor on the account. Newsome testified that she did not have any discussions with the Bank about who would be authorized to sign on the account. The Deposit Agreement also provided that Newsome had thirty days to review her statements for errors or unauthorized activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. With the conservatorship account opened, McNulty began coordinating the process of building the house, which included hiring a contractor, paying subcontractors, and generally, supervising the building of the residence. In order to pay the subcontractors and herself, McNulty drafted court orders\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that provided for the release of funds from the conservatorship account. After the trial court signed the orders, McNulty then sent or delivered the court orders to the Bank for release of the funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court orders did not provide any guidance on how disbursements should occur. Specifically, the court orders did not provide for the issuance of cashier's checks to disburse the money. In her affidavit, McNulty testified that she instructed the Bank to issue cashier's checks for the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. To issue the cashier's checks, the Bank withdrew money from Newsome's conservatorship account, placed it in the Bank's account and with a bank employee's signature, issued official Bank checks to McNulty and various subcontractors. Usually, the checks were signed by Dunn. Newsome's signature did not appear on any of the cashier's checks. The withdrawals were shown on Newsome's statements as \"Miscellaneous Debit.\" No further information was provided on the statements, and if more than one cashier's check was issued at one time, the \"Miscellaneous Debit\" on the statement would lump the entire sum of a number of checks together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The process continued from March 2011 to October 2011, as the residence was built. Through the process, over $400,000 was transferred out of the conservatorship account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Dunn testified that while the residence was being built and the cashier's checks were being issued, Newsome frequently visited the Bank, and sometimes she would bring Victoria Newsome to visit as well. Dunn claims that Newsome never mentioned that she was not receiving her monthly statement and that she never communicated that McNulty \"did not have the right to direct payment orders.\" On the other hand, although she cannot remember the date, Newsome claims that she asked Dunn about why she was not receiving her monthly statement and about the account. She states that Dunn only told her to consult McNulty and the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. On February 9, 2015, Newsome filed suit against the Bank and Dunn alleging common-law claims: conspiracy, fraud, breach of contract, negligence, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, negligence per se, gross negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Further, falling under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Newsome alleged that the Bank and Dunn were liable for failing to require Marilyn's signature on any of the checks negotiated on the conservatorship account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. The parties filed competing motions for summary judgment. The Bank and Dunn argued that Newsome's claims were barred by the statute of repose in Mississippi Code Section 75-4A-505 and that the Bank and Dunn were not at fault because McNulty had the authority to act on Newsome's behalf. Newsome argued that she was entitled to summary judgement as to liability and actual damages. The trial court denied Newsome's motion for summary judgment on liability and actual damages, and it denied the Bank and\n   Dunn's motion for summary judgment on the statute of repose issue. However, the trial court granted the Bank and Dunn's motion for summary judgment as to McNulty's authority, dismissing the Bank and Dunn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Newsome appealed the dismissal of the Bank and Dunn, and the Bank and Dunn cross-appealed the statute of repose issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11.

The Bank and Dunn argue that the statute of repose, codified in Chapter 4A of the UCC, applies and bars Newsome's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075\">\n    Miss.

On the other hand, Newsome claims that Article 4A only applies\n   to wire transfers, and here, the Bank and Dunn improperly commingled conservatorship funds with the Bank's funds. Although not binding under the de novo standard of review, the trial court denied summary judgment on the instant issue, finding a question of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 14. Before delving into the merits of the statute-of-repose claim, the Court considers the Bank and Dunn's argument that the issue is barred. As argued by the Bank and Dunn, the Court need not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Flagstar Bank, FSB v. Danos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7039274\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/46/298/#p311\">\n    46 So.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (Miss. 2010). However, here, Newsome clearly argued before the trial court that the statute of repose does not apply. Specifically, during the hearing on the competing motions for summary judgment, Newsome argued that because the Bank itself signed the cashier's checks, the statute of repose does not apply. Thus, the issue was considered and is not barred. Accordingly, the Court proceeds to the merits of the cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 15.

Here, the transactions in question are the Bank's and Dunn's removal of funds from the conservatorship account to an account for the Bank and the issuance of cashier's checks to beneficiaries, which were McNulty and various subcontractors. The cashier's checks were signed by bank employees. The Bank and Dunn never dealt with a beneficiary bank, as the checks were issued directly to beneficiaries. Therefore, the instant facts do not fit under the definition of a funds transfer. Further, the comment to Section 75-4A-104 offers guidance on whether a check is considered a funds transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20. The comment states that checks usually are not funds transfers because the instruction is delivered by the debtor to the creditor who then presents it to the bank.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075\">\n    Miss.

The instruction to Beneficiary's Bank to credit Beneficiary's account is a\n   <em>\n    payment order\n   </em>\n   .

Here, as stated above, the cashier's checks at issue were issued to the beneficiaries-McNulty and various subcontractors-in the court orders, not to a beneficiary bank. Therefore, no payment order existed, and the instant limited exception does not apply. \u00b6 21. Thus, for the reasons detailed above, the cashier's checks at issue do not qualify as payment orders, and without qualifying as a payment order, they are also not funds transfers as contemplated under Chapter 4A. Therefore, Chapter 4A's statute of repose does not apply, and we need not address the trial court's finding. The trial court's denial of summary judgment for the Bank and Dunn on this issue is affirmed, although on other grounds. Further, as we have reached this affirmance as a matter of law and not fact, the instant issue need not be submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    DIRECT APPEAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Whether People's Bank and Chris Dunn are entitled to summary judgment due to Keely McNulty's actual, implied, and/or apparent authority.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 22.

Actual Authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 23. The Bank and Dunn argue that McNulty had actual authority to manage and direct payment orders because Newsome's conservatorship account was a court-administered and court-supervised account requiring court orders and directions from the judge. Further, the Bank and Dunn point out that Newsome knew McNulty was managing the account. On the other hand, Newsome argues that no record evidence exists of written or oral terms by which Newsome had granted any authority to McNulty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 24. Actual authority, also termed express or direct authority, is the authority\n   <em>\n    actually conferred\n   </em>\n   by the principal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McFarland v.

Although both parties cite the wrong cases for the point that actual authority is determined from the standpoint of the agent, the parties are correct in their assertion. The Restatement states that actual authority arises as \"reasonably understood by the agent.\" Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3.01 (2006). The Restatement further provides that a manifestation by the principal must occur.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8998466\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/919/894/#p902\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A manifestation is defined as expressive conduct. Restatement (Third) Of Agency \u00a7 3.01 cmt. b (2006). Specifically, \"[a] principal's unexpressed willingness that another act as agent does not create actual authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8998466\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/919/894/#p902\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 25. Newsome denies that she gave McNulty any authority. Upon review of the record, we agree, and we find no expressive conduct by Newsome. If anything, unexpressed willingness exists, which is not enough to overcome summary judgment. Notably, the Bank and Dunn, as stated above, base their actual-authority argument on the court-administered status of the account and on Newsome's alleged knowledge. However, without showing expressive conduct by Newsome, the law simply does not contemplate these two facts as sufficient to establish actual authority.

Thus, given the inconsistencies in application of all three types of agency, we look to the definitions of implied authority and apparent authority. \"Implied agency [or authority] requires that the principal give the agent\n   <em>\n    actual authorization to perform acts\n   </em>\n   which reasonably lead third parties to believe that an agency relationship exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Forest Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8198898\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/995/775/\">\n    995 So.2d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Apparent authority, as will be explained in more detail below, requires\n   <em>\n    acts or conduct\n   </em>\n   by the principal\n   <em>\n    indicating\n   </em>\n   the agent's authority, and it requires reasonable reliance by a third party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Cappaert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8211075\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1209/#p1211\">\n    991 So.2d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, implied authority requires actual authorization for the agent to act; whereas, apparent authority looks to the principal's acts or conduct for an indication of the agent's authority. Thus, although similar, implied authority does differ from apparent authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 30. Here, even considering McNulty's affidavit and Judge Walker's appointment of McNulty to coordinate building the house, as concluded above, no proof exists in the record illustrating that Newsome exercised expressive conduct creating\n   <em>\n    actual authorization\n   </em>\n   for McNulty to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forest Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8198898\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/995/775/\">\n    995 So.2d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, without even considering the second part of the implied authority definition, implied authority has not been shown, and summary judgment for the Bank and Dunn is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Bank and Dunn argue that McNulty's affidavit establishes the first element of the three-prong test. McNulty's affidavit states that Newsome was aware that funds were being used to cover living expenses, attorneys' fees, and construction expenses. The Bank and Dunn maintain that Newsome did not communicate that McNulty was not authorized to withdraw funds from the conservatorship account, despite Newsome's knowledge that McNulty was withdrawing conservatorship account funds. The Bank and Dunn state that Newsome's actions indicated that McNulty had apparent authority to manage and direct payment orders from the conservatorship account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 33. Newsome argues that the Bank has not met the summary-judgment standard. Newsome states that McNulty's affidavit only contains conclusory allegations regarding McNulty's authority, despite the fact that the record is saturated with factual issues regarding McNulty's authority. Further, Newsome maintains that the record does not show that Newsome gave McNulty any authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 34. Mississippi caselaw provides: \"[T]he principal is bound\n   <em>\n    if the conduct of the principal\n   </em>\n   is such that persons of reasonable prudence, ordinarily familiar with business practices, dealing with the agent might rightfully believe the agent to have the power he assumes to have.\"\n   <em>\n    Steen\n   </em>\n   , 78 So.2d at 883 (emphasis added). The evidence presented by the Bank establishes McNulty's knowledge, not the Bank's knowledge\n   <em>\n    at the time\n   </em>\n   McNulty was managing the conservatorship. In other words, McNulty's affidavit does not establish what the Bank knew, which is key to the first element of apparent authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 35. To understand what the Bank knew, Dunn's affidavit is crucial. Dunn's affidavit states: \"It was my understanding that this was to be a court-administrated account and that no funds were to be transferred into or out of the account without a court order.\" Dunn's affidavit also states that \"McNulty routinely instructed [him] by electronic or other means to issue cashier's checks.\" Further, Dunn's affidavit states that Newsome visited the Bank to request disbursements from the account, and Dunn repeatedly explained the need for a court order and for Newsome to consult with her attorney. Finally, Dunn states that Newsome never objected to the \"payment orders directed by McNulty, [and] never communicated ... that McNulty did not have the right to direct payment orders from the conservatorship account ....\" On the other hand, Newsome testified in her deposition that she spoke to Dunn about the account because she did not know anything about the conservatorship account and was not receiving a statement. Newsome further testified that Dunn would not tell her or show her anything about the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 36. Dunn's affidavit illustrates the Bank's knowledge and does constitute evidence establishing the first element of apparent authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Cappaert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8211075\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1209/#p1211\">\n    991 So.2d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"acts or conduct by the principal indicating the agent's authority\"). However, Newsome's deposition testimony calls into question Dunn's testimony regarding her acts or conduct indicating\n   McNulty's authority, if any. \"Summary judgment is proper 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178966\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/187/#p192\">\n    202 So.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Newsome's and Dunn's testimonies create a disputed issue of material fact as to whether Newsome's conduct and actions indicated that McNulty had authority to disburse conservatorship funds; therefore, the establishment of the instant prong is best left up to a jury.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7540501\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/566/1172/#p1181\">\n    566 So.2d at 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Whether the evidence sufficiently meets the three-prong test of apparent authority is an issue for the fact-finder.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 37. However, before concluding the instant issue, the Court analyzes subsidiary arguments addressed by the Bank and Dunn. The Bank and Dunn argue that because Newsome failed to stop McNulty, estoppel applies. Newsome does not make an estoppel argument but maintains that her lack of action did not ratify McNulty's actions because it was not a conscious decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 38. Apparent authority is based in the doctrine of estoppel. \"A principal, having clothed his agent with the semblance of authority, will not be permitted, after others have been led to act in reliance of the appearances thus produced, to deny, to the prejudice of such others, what he has theretofore tacitly affirmed as to the agent's powers.\"\n   <em>\n    Steen\n   </em>\n   , 78 So.2d at 883 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McPherson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9785395\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/221/75/\">\n    221 So.2d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in order for an estoppel argument to succeed, the principal must have clothed the agent with authority, and as stated above, here, this is a question of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 39. The Bank and Dunn also argue that a presumption arises that an attorney who represents a party is authorized to take all action necessary. Newsome argues that there is no court order appointing McNulty as counsel of record. Thus, according to Newsome, McNulty was not her attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 40. The Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   It is always presumed that an attorney who has represented a party is authorized to do all acts necessary to properly conduct the litigation, and the party denying such authority has the burden of showing his want of authority, and is bound, as to the opposite party, by any act which the attorney does in the regular course of practice, however improper the act may be, if done without fraud or collusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Great Atl. &amp; Pac.

Thus, no evidence of a written or oral\n   agreement between Newsome and McNulty is in the record. Further, in January 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court appointed McNulty guardian ad litem for Victoria Newsome. Therefore, McNulty's interests potentially were adverse to Newsome's interests as the conservator. However, on the other hand, the record provides that McNulty showed Newsome the progress of the house on at least one occasion, and McNulty took fees through the court orders for her work coordinating the building of the house. Thus, due to the conflicting material facts, a jury question exists regarding whether McNulty represented Marilyn Newsome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 42. In sum, we reverse and remand on the instant issue. Under the first prong of apparent authority, summary judgment is not warranted. We decline to address the remaining prongs of apparent authority because the existence of acts or conduct indicating McNulty's authority clearly falls within the jury's purview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Whether the duty to review statements contained in the Deposit Agreement warrants summary judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 43. The Deposit Agreement for Newsome's conservator account states that Newsome must report any unauthorized transaction to the Bank within thirty days of the statement being sent or made available to her. The Bank and Dunn presented the affidavit of Julie Harris, Senior Vice President of the Bank, to establish that the statements had been mailed. They argue that, under the Mailbox Rule, a presumption arose that Newsome received the statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 44. The Bank and Dunn are correct that \"[t]here is a presumption that mail deposited, postage prepaid and properly addressed is timely delivered to the person addressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Thames v.

We cannot stop here, however. Regardless of whether Newsome properly rebutted the presumption, the \"Duty to Review Statements\" under the Deposit Agreement requires the Court to consider whether the Deposit Agreement is properly interpreted and properly applied under Chapter 4 of the UCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 45. Newsome argues that, although Chapter 4A does not apply, Chapter 4 does apply. Citing Mississippi Code Section 75-4-103, Newsome argues that the Bank and Dunn cannot disclaim their own responsibility for a lack of good faith and a failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages. Although the Bank and Dunn argue that Chapter 4A applies, they do not argue that Chapter 4 does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply. In fact, the Bank and Dunn cite Chapter 4, specifically Section 75-4-103, to argue that the thirty-day deadline in the Deposit Agreement is valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 46.

Thus, the Bank and Dunn are correct that they had the authority and the right to create a Deposit Agreement and to implement a thirty-day deadline to review statements. However, as stated in Section 75-4-103, the Deposit Agreement cannot be used to disclaim the Bank's own responsibility for good faith or ordinary care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 48.

Under Section 75-4-103, this is not allowed. Further, \"Duty to Review Statements\" does not contemplate or address the Bank's own action of removing money from an account as miscellaneous debits and issuing cashier's checks that did not require the account holder's signature. Therefore, under the specific and unique facts of the instant case, the \"Duty to Review Statements\" does not save the Bank and Dunn from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Whether the Uniform Commercial Code displaces Marilyn Newsome's common-law claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 49.
