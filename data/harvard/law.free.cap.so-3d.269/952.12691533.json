Perret, Judges.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   EZELL, Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In October of 2016, the Rapides Parish District Attorney's Office charged Defendant Marcus Dwayne Piper with attempted second degree murder, a violation of La.R.S. 14:27 and La.R.S. 14:30.1, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a violation of La.R.S. 14:95.1. On April 24, 2018, the court heard Defendant's motion to recuse via a judge ad hoc and denied it. The parties selected a jury on June 5, and 6. Said jury began hearing evidence on the latter date and found Defendant guilty of a lesser-included offense, aggravated battery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:34, and guilty as charged for the possession of a firearm offense. On June 25, the court sentenced him to ten years at hard labor for aggravated battery and twenty years for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant now seeks review by this court, assigning two errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Keyon Stanley was walking out of a store and talking on her cell phone when Defendant ran up to her and put a gun to her head. He wanted information on the whereabouts of her boyfriend. Defendant's brother Charles approached and hit the top of her head, then Defendant hit her in the face with a gun. Defendant's brother stepped back and fired his weapon, but no shots hit the victim. The brothers got in a car and left the scene. Defendant had prior felony convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find there is one error patent and the court minutes of sentencing require correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, the sentencing judge imposed both sentences without the benefit of parole, which is required for Defendant's conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, but this restriction may only be imposed for aggravated battery if the offender knew or should have known that the victim is an active member of the United States Armed Forces or is a disabled veteran and the aggravated battery was committed because of that status. Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:34(B) requires at least one year of the sentence be imposed without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence if the above \"status\" requirement applies. There was no reference by the sentencing judge to this provision, nor indication in the record that this \"status\" provision was applicable to Defendant's case. Accordingly, we find Defendant's aggravated battery sentence should be amended to delete the denial of parole eligibility. The trial court is instructed to make an entry in the court minutes reflecting this amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Next, the sentencing minutes indicate Defendant was ordered to pay court costs of $ 495.00 due June 25, 2018, and in default thereof, he was to serve ninety days in the parish jail. However, the sentencing transcript does not indicate the court imposed the payment of court costs or default time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[W]hen the minutes and the transcript conflict, the transcript prevails.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He was first on the docket. He's charged with felon with a firearm and attempted murder. An offer of, uh, fifteen years had been tendered by the District Attorney. At some point during the day, he indicated that he wanted to go to trial and not take the plea. Um, I'm, I'm assuming the part y'all are talking about. I went into the courtroom, I said, uh, I may have told Ms. Carter we need to bind him over for trial, um, I recall the Judge saying, um, that's good or that'll -- tell your client that'll make our, my day. Something of that -- I don't know verbatim -- but something of that nature. Uh (interrupted)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q.

I think I may have just said we need to bind him over which would have indicated yes, that the plea offer was rejected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. Okay. And specifically what was her response to that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. I thought she said tell your client he'll -- that will make our day or that will make my day. That's what I thought. It may have (interrupted)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q. Can you recall specifically at this time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A.

Whatever statements, um, that were made at that time -- whatever her response was what did you do after she made that response?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. I probably said, you know, um, that's scary or maybe that -- I don't know what -- I may have said that may be grounds for recusal right at that moment. I don't know. I -- the, the tape is -- well, the tape is the tape. Um, I, I -- my recollection was -- it and I'm not -- I can't - it'd be - I'd speculate if I -- what her thought was -- I don't know. Okay. I can't - I'm not gonna speculate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q. What, whatever your -- her statements were, um, was it the grounds for your motion for recusal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Yes. Yes, but I'm not gonna speculate as to what she meant or thought. I'm just gonna tell you that's what I heard and that's what I, I felt like it -- that I could, um, ask for a recusal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q. Um, did you make an oral motion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. Um, it, it, yeah, it was a -- I announced in open Court that I was going to file a recusal, uh, be seeking a recusal and, in fact, within thirty minutes fil [sic] -- it was late in the day.

Um, we may have briefly spoken about his criminal history. Uh, the exposure component of, of the, the, uh, the plea. In other words, customarily when someone comes forth to bind a trial -- to say I'm going to trial, the Judge will explain their exposure, and she did say this -- you're, you know, you have this many prior felonies. This would be your exposure on this, these, these particular crimes. Armed -- uh, felon with a firearm and attempted murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. And she did that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. She did do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. Prior to her advising Mr. Piper of his exposure, did she make any statements concerning whether or not she would advise him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. Um, not that I -- I mean, she may have said I'm tempted not to - - I don't know. I don't, I don't recall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. Do you recall if there was a statement made at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. She may have said I'm tempted not to advise him of, of his exposure but when he got up there she advised him of his exposure and believe, I believe she said I don't know anything about your case, but here's -- this is your situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   BY MS.

SMITH:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Well, my memory is so -- I, I don't , I, I mean, I don't know what was said off the rec -- I don't -- I'm not comfortable saying something that was said off the record because it may not be verbatim of what we said or it may have been something that I assumed that -- in other words, the stuff on the record you can hear what was said and, and whatever it is, it is but off the record -- I'm just not comfortable saying because I, I may be inaccurate. My, my memory is not -- I don't want to say something from the perspective that I took that may not -- you understand? It's not verbatim and I don't, I don't -- I'm not comfortable saying that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   As Defendant observes, La.Code Crim.P. art 671 states, in pertinent part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A. In a criminal case a judge of any court, trial or appellate, shall be recused when he:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (1) Is biased, prejudiced, or personally interested in the cause to such an extent that he would be unable to conduct a fair and impartial trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (6) Would be unable, for any other reason, to conduct a fair and impartial trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The ad hoc judge heard testimony from several other witnesses. Although their recollections of the trial judge's statement varied somewhat, all recalled that the judge expressed some pleasure that the case was going to trial. The judge ad hoc listened to the relevant audio recording. We note the remarks at issue do not appear in the transcript designated Piper-1,\n   as they were not originally part of the record. Apparently, the court reporter had continued to record even though the discussion was off the record. The recording reflected that, upon learning that Defendant's case would go to trial, the trial judge stated, \"I'm thrilled ... Tell him I appreciate it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the close of the recusal hearing the ad hoc judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The testimony, uh, today reflected several comments, uh, made on and off the record, uh, some of which were, uh, in the presence of the defendant and may be some that were made, um, outside the presence of the defendant but nevertheless, uh, were made, uh, in regards to Mr. Marcus Piper and, uh, the matter that was pending before the Court. Judge Doggett made comments such as, um, tell your client you've made my day. The Court listened to the audio recording. Ms. Hale testified that, uh, her general practice is to leave the recorder on, um, whether on the record or off except in those instances in which, um, there are explicit instructions from the Court, um, not to record and, and that, uh, they're off the record or in off the record situations that, uh, go on for some period, clearly trying to, um, conserve, uh, what, what's, uh, what's on the audio. But what was clearly heard is, uh, Judge Doggett making a comment about I'm thrilled. I appreciate it. The Court also heard her make a comment which, um, must have been in connection with other testimony, uh, that she said I'm not going to bring it up, um, which I understood was, uh, to advise Mr. Piper when he declined the plea about what his exposure was. The Court also heard, um, her statements then advising Mr. Piper as to, um, what the sentencing ranges were for, uh, the two counts that, uh, have been brought against him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Based upon, um, the comments of tell your client or something to the effect that that makes my day, that I'm thrilled, I appreciate it, those remarks I rather suspect had Judge Doggett been called to testify she would say that, um, she now, um, would not make those kind of comments that, uh, they were regrettable. But in the view of this Court, the guilt or innocence of Mr. Piper was not going to be determined by Judge Doggett but by the jury. Um, the defendant had exercised his constitutional right, uh, to a, uh, trial by, uh, his peers, uh, from this community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Cases, uh, of similar fact scenarios for recusal in which, uh, the trial judge has made some comments, uh, regarding, um, either guilt or innocence or, um, things of that nature, um, case law simply says that they're just kind of reactions of a judge but they don't really rise to the level of, uh, substantial in nature that, uh, triggers, um, 671A(1), um, and merits the recusal of a judge and so based upon, uh, the jurisprudence that, uh, I've, uh, have been able to find and considering, um, the comment, while best not said, um, I do not find that they are of a substantial nature that rise to the level, um, to form the basis of bias and prejudice and would, uh, result in the recusal of, uh, Judge Doggett. Those are the, uh, reasons of the Court in this matter. Ms. Ratliff?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   BY MS. RATLIFF:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Judge, I'm sorry. I -- did you say denied the motion (interrupted)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Yes, I was just giving you the opportunity to, um, make any objections\n   to the ruling of the Court for the benefit of the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant acknowledges that the trial judge's remarks were made outside the presence of the jury and \"no adverse rulings can be found in the record.\" Thus, both Defendant and the State cite\n   <em>\n    State v.

Similarly, as indicated in\n   <strong>\n    Caperton,\n   </strong>\n   circumstances that run afoul of state law or judicial canons do not necessarily violate federal due process, which is the issue currently before this court.

When confronted with the initial oral motion to recuse, the trial judge indicated she simply wanted to conduct a jury trial. Defendant briefly suggests the trial court may have had a problem with his criminal history. However, this assertion does not appear to be supported by trial counsel's testimony at the recusal hearing. In the absence of any showing of bias or potential for bias, the assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER TWO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In his second assignment of error, Defendant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to make several objections or motions during trial. Both parties agree that the test for ineffective assistance of counsel consists of two steps: first, whether counsel's performance was deficient, and second, did said deficiency prejudice the defendant asserting the claim.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

There is no merit to this argument; in a prosecution for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a defendant's stipulation on this issue will not prevent the State from introducing such evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ball\n   </em>\n   , 99-428 (La. 11/30/99),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11519043\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/756/275/\">\n    756 So.2d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendant's next argument is that trial counsel should have requested a mistrial when a police officer, Wade Bourgeois, testified that Defendant stated, \"This is why we fucking hate cops. That is why you cops keep getting shot.\" As the State points out, trial counsel objected. We note that defense counsel objected before the officer actually quoted Defendant, thus, if the objection had been upheld, the statement at issue would not have been quoted in open court. However, the current brief contains no challenge to the court's ruling on the objection. Further, Defendant cites no law and makes no argument regarding why trial counsel should have moved for a mistrial rather than, or in addition to, attempt to keep the evidence out via objection. We determine this argument should be deferred to the post-conviction process, where Defendant can more fully develop his argument and the record, if necessary. The State implies that Defendant's tirade was admissible under exceptions to the hearsay rule; however, the issue raised by Defendant's trial counsel was whether the evidence at issue was relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that trial counsel \"opened up the door to\" testimony by another police officer regarding testimony that Defendant was involved in other shootings or at least gun-related incidents on the day of the offense. The testimony at issue indicated that Defendant and an accomplice had shot at the victim's car while her boyfriend was using it before the offense at issue, that they had held guns to the boyfriend's head in a separate incident, and that they had fired shots in the neighborhood\n   immediately after the instant offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The State claims the trial court made an earlier ruling that the incident of holding guns to the boyfriend's head would be admissible during an officer's testimony. However, the State does not cite to a record page number. We find the evidence of the surrounding gun-related incidents would have been admissible for the State to present a comprehensive narrative to the jury. The supreme court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Generally, courts may not admit evidence of other crimes to show defendant is a man of bad character who has acted in conformity with his bad character. However, under La. C.E. art. 404(B)(1) evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts may be introduced when it relates to conduct, formerly referred to as\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   , that \"constitutes an integral part of the act or transaction that is the subject of the present proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Res gestae\n   </em>\n   events constituting other crimes are deemed admissible because they are so nearly connected to the charged offense that the state could not accurately present its case without reference to them. A close proximity in time and location is required between the charged offense and the other crimes evidence \"to insure that 'the purpose served by admission of other crimes evidence is not to depict defendant as a bad man, but rather to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context of happenings near in time and place' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   doctrine in Louisiana is broad and includes not only spontaneous utterances and declarations made before or after the commission of the crime, but also testimony of witnesses and police officers pertaining to what they heard or observed during or after the commission of the crime if a continuous chain of events is evident under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition, as this court recently observed, integral act (\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   ) evidence in Louisiana incorporates a rule of narrative completeness without which the state's case would lose its \"narrative momentum and cohesiveness, 'with power not only to support conclusions but to sustain the willingness of jurors to draw the inferences, whatever they may be, necessary to reach an honest verdict.' \"\n   <em>\n    Colomb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11511378\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/747/1074/#p1076\">\n    747 So.2d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Old Chief v.

Therefore, the evidence relating to other incidents involving the boyfriend was admissible pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   . The testimony that Defendant and his brother discharged firearms in the neighborhood was also admissible under\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , since it happened so close in time to the offense against the victim and may have been intended to intimidate the boyfriend or his friends. Since this evidence was admissible, deficient performance should not be ascribed to trial counsel. Thus, this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the reasons discussed, we find the bulk of this assignment of error lacks merit.
