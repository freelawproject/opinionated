After a twelve-person jury unanimously found him guilty of the offense, he was sentenced to twenty years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, with credit for time served. On appeal, Defendant asserts that his defense counsel's failure to object to the impaneling of a twelve-person jury in the trial of a six-person-jury offense constitutes a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, and thus requires a reversal of his conviction. He additionally\n   argues that the trial court erred in denying his challenges for cause. Finally, Defendant challenges his sentence as unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the following reasons, we affirm Defendant's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We must decide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) whether the erroneous trial by a jury of twelve instead of a properly-constituted jury of six is reversible error;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) whether the trial court erred in denying Defendant's challenges for cause; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) whether the sentence imposed by the trial court was unconstitutionally excessive, in violation of La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2009, Defendant was arrested and pleaded guilty to stalking M.S.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a violation of La.R.S. 14:40.2. He was initially ordered to pay a $ 1,000 fine and serve a one-year sentence in Rapides Parish jail. However, the sentence was suspended, and Defendant was thereafter placed on supervised probation for two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The matter giving rise to the instant appeal occurred in 2016, when Defendant was charged by Bill of Information with stalking, second offense, a violation of La.R.S. 14:40.2(4), alleging that he did willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follow and/or harass and threaten M.S. again with the intent to place her in reasonable fear of serious bodily harm. He entered a plea of not guilty to the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A jury trial was held thereafter. Before conducting\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that it was going \"to select a twelve-person jury for a criminal case.\" After a panel of twelve jurors had been accepted and sworn, defense counsel then objected to the composition of the jury by noting that under La.Code Crim.P. art. 782, a twelve-person jury is only appropriate when the punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor, whereas a six-person jury is appropriate when the punishment may be confinement at hard labor instead. Because stalking, second offense, is punishable \"with or without hard labor\" under La.RS. 14:40.2(4), defense counsel argued that Defendant's case ought to be heard by a six-person jury. The trial court, however, denied the defense's request for a six-person jury, and twelve jurors were accepted and sworn to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , each side was granted twelve peremptory challenges. Defense counsel raised several challenges for cause with respect to prospective jurors, and they were denied by the trial court. The case was then decided before a panel of twelve jurors, which unanimously found Defendant guilty of the offense charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In analyzing the sentencing factors of La.Code Crim.P. art. 894.1, the trial court concluded from the evidence that Defendant was a most egregious offender and thus sentenced him to serve a maximum term of twenty years imprisonment, without the benefit of parole, probation, or\n   suspension of sentence, with credit for time served. A Motion to Reconsider Sentence was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, Defendant now argues that defense counsel's failure to object to the twelve-person jury prior to the jury's swearing constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel such that Defendant's conviction should be reversed. Further, he asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his challenges for cause. Finally, Defendant challenges his sentence as unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant asserts a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. He contends that his defense counsel's failure to object to the impaneling of a twelve-person jury for a six-person offense constituted deficient performance of such a serious nature that prejudice must be presumed. As a result, Defendant argues that his conviction should be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the outset, the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel is more appropriately addressed in an application for post-conviction relief filed before the trial court, where a full evidentiary hearing can be conducted.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis, Defendant must first demonstrate that his trial counsel's performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by the deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Counsel's performance is ineffective when it can be shown that he made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \"counsel\" guaranteed to the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel's deficient performance will have prejudiced the defendant if he shows that the errors were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial. To carry his burden, the defendant \"must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the results of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 782(A) states that \"[c]ases in which punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor shall be tried by a jury composed of twelve jurors, ten of whom must concur to render a verdict.\" La.Code Crim.P. art. 782(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, \"[c]ases in which the punishment\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be confinement at hard labor\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be tried by a jury composed of six jurors, all of whom must concur to render a verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9363883\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The crime of stalking, second offense is punishable \"with or without hard labor[.]\" La.R.S. 14:40.2(B)(4). Notwithstanding any deference accorded to trial counsel's strategy, we submit that the case should have been tried before a jury of six, rather than twelve, veniremen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While there is no doubt that an error occurred with respect to the size of the selected jury in this case, our supreme court has held that \"the error in trying a six-person jury offense in a 12-person jury forum no longer constitutes a non-waivable structural defect in the proceedings, but 'falls within the vast category of trial errors which are subject to harmless error analysis and which warrant reversal only where the defendant is actually prejudiced.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   , 11-1044, p. 3 (La. 3/13/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7008489\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/85/52/#p53\">\n    85 So.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

But for counsel's failure to object to the composition of the jury, any six of the twelve jurors in this case would nevertheless have rendered a guilty verdict because all twelve jurors found Defendant guilty. In fact, Defendant received six additional factfinders than constitutionally mandated, and was thus afforded greater protection than required by law. Therefore, because the result of the proceeding\n   would not have been any different had defense counsel objected prior to the acceptance of the jury, we find that the error of impaneling a twelve-person jury in the trial of a six-person offense was harmless. Accordingly, we find that Defendant was not actually prejudiced due to the errors of both defense counsel and the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Challenge for Cause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his challenges for cause regarding juror, Ms. Humphries; second alternate juror, Ms. Trotter; and three potential jurors, Ms. Jordan, Ms. Ryder, and Ms. Mier. As a result, Defendant alleges that the erroneous denials caused him to exhaust all of his peremptory challenges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The grounds for which a juror may be challenged for cause are set forth in La.Code Crim.P. art. 797. The defense may challenge a juror for cause if \"[t]he juror is not impartial, whatever the cause of his partiality.\" La.Code Crim.P. art. 797(2). A juror may additionally be challenged for cause on the ground that \"[t]he relationship, whether by blood, marriage, employment, friendship, or enmity between the juror and the defendant, the person injured by the offense, the district attorney, or defense counsel, is such that it is reasonable to conclude that it would influence the juror in arriving at a verdict[.]\" La.Code Crim.P. art. 797(3). The defense may also challenge a juror for cause on the basis that he or she \"will not accept the law as given to him by the court[.]\" La.Code Crim.P. art. 797(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court has set forth the following standard for reviewing a trial court's denial of challenges for cause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A trial court is vested with broad discretion in ruling on challenges for cause, and its rulings will be reversed only when a review of the voir dire record as a whole reveals an abuse of discretion. Prejudice is presumed when a challenge for cause is denied erroneously by a trial court and the defendant ultimately exhausts his peremptory challenges. An erroneous ruling depriving an accused of a peremptory challenge is a substantial violation of his constitutional and statutory rights and constitutes reversible error. \"A challenge for cause should be granted, even when a prospective juror declares his ability to remain impartial, if the juror's responses as a whole reveal facts from which bias, prejudice, or inability to render judgment according to law may be reasonably implied.\" However, a trial court does not abuse its discretion when it refuses to excuse a prospective juror on the ground he is not impartial where, after further inquiry or instruction, the potential juror has demonstrated a willingness and ability to decide the case impartially according to law and evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State pointed out that the defense could have questioned her about the possibility of such a conversation had it suspected one. The State also noted that at the time of the barbecue, Ms. Ryder had no way of knowing she would be a possible juror in this case in which Mr. Bruner was a witness.

The burglars were never caught, and Ms. Mier believed that law enforcement did not properly investigate the matter. However, she stated that this would not affect her ability to digest the facts and make a fair and impartial decision in this case. Further, Ms. Mier raised her hand when the defense questioned if any of the jurors simply did not want to be there.

While the trial court in that case found no aggravating or mitigating factors under La.Code Crim.P. art. 894.1, it did note the defendant's criminal history of more than thirty arrests and convictions spanning over three decades, some of which were for crimes of violence. The defendant had violated four protective orders and had \"subjected the victim to years of abuse and threats of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7020819\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/81/691/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7020819\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/81/691/\">\n    at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The victim in that case was the defendant's former wife with whom he had a child, and the defendant had previously been convicted of stalking another victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In reviewing the record in this case, the trial court stated the following in imposing Defendant's sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Reviewing the victim impact statements and reviewing prior cases, and also what transpired over the course of a\n   four[-]day trial. [Sic] The matter started in August of two thousand nine with an arrest. It's been going on for over eighteen years of stalking. Protective orders in oh-nine did not work. [M.S.] was a victim of a matter where she was performing her occupation as a professional person trying to render help to [Defendant's] mother. To the point to where [M.S.] had to stop that in order for her own being [sic]. Whatever reasons [Defendant] had by being infatuated with [M.S.], I do not know. However[,] they have directly affected her family. It came to the point of being more aggressive. And [M.S.] was not comfortable with it to where she terminated her employment. Continuing on to where uninvited presence with weapons causing [M.S.] to feel like she is scared to death [sic]. On another night to where at the house uninvited of where physical contact was made of hands around the neck to where [M.S.] thought she was going to die [sic]. [Defendant] continued with the phone calls, gifts and candy of a signature to the point to where [M.S.]'s family had to take matters of property, phone unlisting even to the point to where it was finally after her repeated requests from law enforcement something was done about the matter with the second arrest. The pattern continued even after the arrest all the way up until trial. The passing on the highway, the driving in the driveway, being around the home, all matters taken into this court. All matters I see where [M.S.] was emotionally distressed and feared bodily harm or her death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The testimony of M.S., a registered nurse, confirmed the trial court's findings. She testified she had no personal relationship with Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   She first met Defendant when she began working as a home health nurse for his mother sometime in 1998. From the beginning, M.S. described Defendant as \"a very forward person .... Sometimes intrusive.\" He began bringing her unwanted gifts such as flowers and candy, which she never accepted, and found that his behavior became \"unusual\" once he became \"more and more aggressive.\" In an effort to minimize her contact with Defendant, M.S. reported the situation to her direct supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Beginning in either late 1998 or early 1999, M.S. testified that Defendant would repeatedly drive by her home. One night, she and her husband heard the dog barking and saw a flash of light coming from Defendant's red Ford Ranger pickup truck. Defendant then walked up to her vehicle and put a beer can box under her windshield wipers. As she and her husband stood in the doorway, they watched Defendant walking and noticed that he had a pistol in his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   M.S. eventually reported Defendant to the police after he continued driving by her home, honking his horn. She testified that she \"was scared to death\" after an incident where Defendant spray painted his phone number on her mailbox and on the road in front of her home. However, Defendant's behavior continued after M.S. reported him to the police. She recalled that late one night, while visiting with a friend, she heard the dog barking and saw headlights pull into her driveway. She opened the door to see that Defendant was swiftly approaching her doorway. At that point, M.S. told Defendant that if he didn't leave, she would call the police. Defendant then pushed his way through her door, grabbed her by the neck, and put\n   her up against the wall. M.S.'s friend then threatened Defendant that she would call the police if he did not stop, when Defendant jerked the phone out of M.S.'s hand and the wall, grabbed her friend, and then left with the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Finding Defendant's behavior \"too aggressive\" and \"inappropriate\" M.S. quit her position as a home health nurse and went back to the hospital. At this point, however, Defendant began to initiate further contact with M.S. She testified that Defendant would call her multiple times a day to the extent that she had to get an unlisted phone number. She would find candy on the hood of her car at work, and sometimes find Defendant sitting in the parking garage. M.S. recalled an incident at the grocery store where she noticed Defendant staring at her from the next line over, only to go out to her car and find a card addressed to her left by Defendant in her driver door handle. While M.S. called the police numerous times, either the police were unable to find Defendant, or they would go to his house, but in neither case was Defendant arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In 2009, Defendant was finally arrested after driving past M.S.'s home and throwing beer in her face while she was outside at her mailbox. Because of Defendant's actions, M.S. put up a gate, installed a security system, hired a security guard to sit outside her home when her husband worked at night, and left her house to stay with family members when left alone. She took a concealed weapons class and carried a weapon at all times thereafter. M.S. also obtained multiple protective orders against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Defendant's behavior never changed after his arrest in 2009, however. Although sometimes the activity was less frequent, it never stopped; in fact, it continued until a few days before the trial was held in this case. Defendant continued to leave beer cans and candy in M.S.'s mailbox and drive slowly by her home, honking the horn, sometimes more than five or ten times throughout a single day. She estimated that she reported Defendant's behavior to the police between ten and twenty times. One evening, M.S. went outside and smelled cigarette smoke. The next morning, she found \"a Bud Light can sitting on the porch rail.\" Sometime in 2017, Defendant's vehicle met M.S. and her husband on the road as their vehicle was pulling a trailer full of lumber. Defendant crossed the center line and \"threw his hand out of the window\" toward them, which pushed them off the road and into the ditch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   M.S. testified she did not feel safe, \"live[d] in a prison with no bars[,]\" and \"enjoy[ed] nothing by [her]self anymore.\" Being stalked by Defendant had changed her life. In 2016, she testified that Defendant was again arrested for \"[d]riving by [her] house repeatedly. Honking the horn. Crossing the center line. Throwing [a] beer can at [her], cursing [her], screaming at [her].\" While the incident where Defendant threw a beer can was similar to the episode in 2009, M.S. also testified that on another occasion, Defendant stopped his vehicle and threw whiskey in her face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As established by M.S.'s testimony, we find that the record supports the sentence imposed by the trial court. Moreover, we agree with the trial court's conclusion that Defendant was a most egregious offender. Defendant was convicted twice for stalking the same victim over a period spanning eighteen years, with the evidence demonstrating no change in behavior following the first conviction. The trial court properly considered Defendant's repeated behavior over a period of time. We find that the imposition of the maximum sentence in this case is not so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime that it either shocks the sense of justice or inflicts any\n   needless pain and suffering. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Defendant to twenty years imprisonment at hard labor, without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, this court affirms the judgment of the trial court in all respects. Accordingly, we affirm Defendant Edwin Albert Miller's conviction for stalking, second offense, a violation of La.R.S. 14:40.2(4), as well as his sentence to twenty years imprisonment without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, with credit for time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    In accordance with La.R.S. 46:1844(W), initials are used to preserve the confidentiality of crime victims who are minors, victims of sex offenses, and victims of human trafficking-related offenses. The perpetration of stalking under La.R.S. 14:40.2 is classified as a \"sex offense\" under the statute, we shall thus keep confidential the victim's name.

The ballots were then to be placed into an envelope and sealed in the court record. The trial court in fact found \"a sufficient requirement number for the verdict to be proper and good\" and counsel for both parties concurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The ballots were not included in the record on appeal. This court issued an order on December 13, 2018, to the Clerk of Court for the Ninth Judicial District to send the written jury ballots filed under seal. The clerk then filed a supplemental record enclosing a copy of the jury ballots. The supplemental record shows all twelve members of the jury found Defendant guilty of stalking, second offense. Therefore, we find that the information supplied by the supplemental record is sufficient to allow this court to address the issue of ineffectiveness of counsel in this appeal without relegating it to post-conviction relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 782(A) was recently revised to require a twelve-person jury to render a unanimous verdict in cases in which punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor. It now provides that \"[a] case for an offense committed on or after January 1, 2019, in which the punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor shall be tried before a jury of twelve persons,\n    <em>\n     all of whom must concur to render a verdict\n    </em>\n    .\" La.Code Crim.P. art. 782(A) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    We note, however, that the amendment applies to crimes committed on or after January 1, 2019.

While we find that either side should have only been granted six peremptory challenges given the instant trial for an offense not necessarily punishable by imprisonment at hard labor pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 799, this error of the trial court was nevertheless harmless. As stated in the discussion of the preceding assignment of error, Defendant was afforded a greater number of challenges than required by law, and thus, we do not find that his case was prejudiced from such additional protections.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    On appeal, Defendant incorrectly states that Ms. Jordan's brother is currently suing the Department of Corrections.
