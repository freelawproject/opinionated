On May 29, 2015, Defendant entered a plea of not guilty to all the charges. On March 29, 2016, the State amended the indictment to charge one count of attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a violation of La.R.S. 40:979 and La.R.S. 40:966(A)(1) ; and one count of attempted cultivation of marijuana, a violation of La.R.S. 40:979 and La.R.S. 40:989.1. Defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to the amended charges. Sentencing was deferred under La.Code Crim.P. art. 893, and Defendant was placed on supervised probation for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 17, 2017, a probation violation hearing was held where Defendant admitted to violating his probation; however, the trial court refused to accept Defendant's admission without a formal hearing. A formal probation violation hearing was held on November 29, 2017, where the trial court found that Defendant admitted to inappropriately touching a minor child, in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation. Defendant's probation was revoked, and the trial court set a sentencing hearing for December 1, 2017. At that sentencing hearing, Defendant was sentenced to serve eight years with the department of corrections for attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and four years with the department of corrections for attempted cultivation of marijuana, to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence on January 5, 2018, which was denied by the trial court on January 4, 2018. On February 2, 2018, Defendant filed, and the trial court granted, a Motion for Appeal of Sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 3, 2014, Combined Anti-Drug Task Force detectives were alerted to illegal drug activity at 6670 Lloyd Arabie Road, Lake Charles. The detectives made contact with Defendant and informed him of the complaint, and, during this contact, detectives smelled marijuana. Defendant then consented to a search of the residence, and detectives found five marijuana plants, 67.93 grams of marijuana, an assault rifle, a grinder with marijuana residue, and other paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant admitted he possessed the 67.93 grams of marijuana, possessed the assault rifle found during the search, possessed the paraphernalia found in the search, sold some marijuana about a week prior, and told the detectives that he had\n   been growing the marijuana plants for about three months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed by this court for errors patent on the face of the record.

In his second assignment of error, Defendant argued that the trial court failed to comply with the requirements set forth in La.Code Crim.P. art. 894.1 because the factors in sentencing did not justify the sentences that were imposed and did not support the disparate treatment between Defendant and his co-defendant. We find no merit to the first assignment of error and that the second assignment of error was waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant asserts that he accepted responsibility by pleading guilty to attempted cultivation of marijuana and attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana. However, according to Defendant, the sentences imposed were excessive and were cruel and unusual because of his intellectual disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Louisiana courts have laid out the following guidelines with regard to constitutionally excessive sentence review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Sentences within the statutory sentencing range can be reviewed for constitutional excessiveness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The pertinent penalty provision of La.R.S. 40:966(B)(3) in 2014 stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A substance classified in Schedule I which is marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinols, or chemical derivatives of tetrahydrocannabinols, or synthetic cannabinoids shall upon conviction be sentenced to a term of imprisonment at hard labor for not less than five nor more than thirty years, and pay a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, La.R.S. 40:989.1(A)(2) states, \"Whoever violates the provisions of this Subsection shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with or without hard labor for not less than two years nor more than ten years and may, in addition, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than twenty thousand dollars.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant's guilty plea to La.R.S. 40:979 reduced the sentencing range of those statutes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. Except as otherwise provided herein, any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense denounced and/or made unlawful by the provisions of this Part shall, upon conviction, be fined or imprisoned in the same manner as for the offense planned or attempted, but such fine or imprisonment shall not exceed one-half of the longest term of imprisonment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thus, the sentencing range for attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was zero to fifteen years, and the sentencing range for attempted cultivation of marijuana was zero to five years. At the December 1, 2017 sentencing hearing following the probation violation hearing, Defendant was sentenced to eight years with the department of corrections for attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and four years with the department of corrections for attempted cultivation of marijuana, to run concurrently. The trial court gave no reasons for the sentences that were imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant stated in his motion to reconsider that although he and his co-defendant were charged as a result of the same offenses, he received a much harsher sentence than his co-defendant, who was not intellectually disabled or illiterate. The co-defendant was charged with misdemeanors and was only convicted of possession of drug paraphernalia resulting in a disparity that shows that Defendant's sentences were excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As noted by the State, although Defendant faced jail time, he was initially given the benefit of probation pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. art. 893 rather than serving jail time for his convictions. The State points out that had he completed probation successfully, he would have been eligible for an expungement of his record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   La.Code Crim.P. art. 893(E) ; La.Code Crim.P. art. 978. The record indicates that Defendant had no prior record, with this being his first time offending. At the guilty plea hearing, Defendant told the court that he could not read and write and received supplemental security income (SSI) because he could not read. Despite these circumstances, Defendant told the detectives that he had sold marijuana a week prior to the arrest for the matter at hand, while his co-defendant did not, which resulted in felony charges for Defendant while the co-defendant was charged with misdemeanors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Further, the sentence for attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is in line with other sentences for the same crime. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=02-1382%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%204/2/03%29\">\n    02-1382 (La.App. 3 Cir. 4/2/03)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9335060\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/1181/\">\n    842 So.2d 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 03-1224 (La. 11/7/03),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9081883,9081850,9081827\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/857/491/\">\n    857 So.2d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court determined that a five-year sentence at hard labor for attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana was not excessive. In that case, the defendant, a paraplegic first-offender, benefited from a plea bargain, and the State amended the charge from the original charge of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and the defendant's sentence exposure decreased from a potential thirty years at hard labor to fifteen years at hard labor. Here, Defendant also benefited from a plea deal where he was originally charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana, but the charge was subsequently amended to attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen\n   </em>\n   , 28,988 (La.App. 2 Cir. 10/30/96),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7437214\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/682/864/\">\n    682 So.2d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the second circuit held that a five-year sentence for attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was not constitutionally excessive where the defendant, a first-time felony offender, obtained a substantial benefit from her plea bargain, the sentence was one third of the maximum range, and she was not sentenced to pay a fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There is no case law discussing the excessiveness of a sentence under La.R.S. 40:989.1 ; however, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Insley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=04-1006%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%202/2/05%29\">\n    04-1006 (La.App. 3 Cir. 2/2/05)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9178118\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/893/209/\">\n    893 So.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court determined that four years for attempted cultivation of marijuana under La.R.S. 40:966 was not excessive where the defendant benefited from a plea deal where the original charge of cultivation of marijuana was amended to attempted cultivation of marijuana, thus, significantly minimizing the defendant's sentence exposure. The maximum sentence under La.R.S. 40:966 for attempted cultivation of marijuana was fifteen years, and the maximum Defendant here faced under La.R.S. 40:989.1 was five years, but Defendant's four-year sentence for this charge was to run concurrently with the eight-year sentence for his conviction of attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Furthermore, his sentence exposure was reduced by his plea. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when sentencing Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In his motion to reconsider, Defendant failed to raise the claim he presents in his second assignment of error that the trial court failed to comply with the requirements of La.Code Crim.P. art. 894.1. Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 881.1 sets forth this requirement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. (1) In felony cases, within thirty days following the imposition of sentence or within such longer period as the trial court may set at sentence, the state or the defendant may make or file a motion to reconsider sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   E. Failure to make or file a motion to reconsider sentence or to include a specific ground upon which a motion to reconsider sentence may be based, including\n   a claim of excessiveness, shall preclude the state or the defendant from raising an objection to the sentence or from urging any ground not raised in the motion on appeal or review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Since Defendant did not raise this claim in his motion to reconsider, this claim is precluded from review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER THREE\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant argues in his third assignment of error that although the sentence of eight years for attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana is not illegal since the maximum sentence at the time of the crime was fifteen years, a reduction in his sentence is warranted because the maximum at the time of sentencing was five years.
