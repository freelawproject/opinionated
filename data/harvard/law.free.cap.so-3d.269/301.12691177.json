Dennis Thompson appeals his conviction for murder; finding no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On December 8, 2009, Thompson was indicted for one count of conspiracy to commit robbery and one count of capital murder. On February 24, 2014, a jury trial commenced in the Circuit Court of Coahoma County. During trial, Thompson requested that the jury be instructed to consider simple murder in the event they found him not guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery. On the morning of February 27, 2014, the jury retired to deliberate. Following deliberations, the jury unanimously found Thompson not guilty for conspiracy to commit robbery. However, the jury was unable to reach a verdict regarding capital murder. While the jury was unanimous that Thompson was not guilty of the underlying felony of robbery, the jury was deadlocked on the lesser-included offense of murder, for which it was instructed to consider per Thompson's request. After ascertaining that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked, the trial court ordered a mistrial on count two and held that Thompson's retrial be limited to the lesser-included offense of murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Thompson's retrial commenced on July 29, 2014. After deliberating, the jury unanimously found Thompson guilty of murder. Thompson now appeals, asserting the weight and sufficiency of the evidence do not support his conviction; the trial court erred by admitting unreliable witness testimony; his retrial violated his protection against double jeopardy; and his indictment for capital murder was insufficient for the purpose of retrying him for murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On December 8, 2009, a Coahoma grand jury indicted Thompson for count one, conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-73 (Rev. 2006), and count two, capital murder in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-19(2)(e) (Rev. 2006). During his first trial, Thompson requested that, \"if the [c]ourt rules on behalf of [Thompson] that conspiracy has not been established by the State, then [he] would move that Count II, as far as capital murder, be downgraded to simple murder. Because the underlying felony is conspiracy to commit robbery.\" The jury was accordingly instructed that in the event they found Thompson not guilty of capital murder, they were to consider simple murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The jury found Thompson not guilty on count one, conspiracy to conspiracy to commit robbery. However, the jury was unable to reach an agreement on count two, capital murder. Although the jury was unanimous that Thompson was not guilty of the underlying felony of robbery, the jury was deadlocked on the lesser-included offense of murder. The trial court ordered a mistrial and held that the State \"not be permitted to retry the [D]efendant on a charge of capital murder, but will be limited to the charge of murder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. On July 29, 2014, Thompson's retrial for the lesser-included offense of murder commenced. Shemeka Palmer was the State's first witness. Palmer testified that on November 30, 2008, she was visiting Clarksdale for work and had reserved a hotel room at the Comfort Inn. She stated that on that evening, Carlos Buford, with whom she was a childhood friend, was driving to meet her at the hotel. Palmer said Buford called her at approximately 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. from a Double Quick store in Clarksdale to ask her for directions to the hotel, but he never arrived at the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Next, Stephen Poer, a former Clarksdale Police Department patrolmen testified. Poer testified that while he was on duty on November 30, 2008, he was called to investigate a person sitting in a parked car near the Hicks Motel. Poer said that he arrived at the scene sometime between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. and that upon his arrival, he found the body of a deceased man, later identified as Buford, sitting in the driver's seat. Buford's head was against the headrest of the seat, and blood was coming from the back of his head. The driver's door was open, and the engine was still running. Poer testified he secured the scene without disturbing any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Captain Ulyda Johnson of the Clarksdale Police Department was the next State's witness to testify. Captain Johnson stated that in November 2008, she was a detective with the Clarksdale Police Department and was the chief investigator in Buford's case. She said that on November 30, 2008, at approximately 9:20 p.m., she responded to a dispatcher call in the area near the Hicks Motel. When she arrived, Captain Johnson said she saw Buford's body in the driver's seat of a parked vehicle. She photographed the scene and accompanied the Coahoma County Coroner to the morgue to photograph Buford's body. While at the morgue, the coroner gave Captain Johnson a phone number collected off Buford's body. Captain Johnson called the number and discovered it belonged to Palmer. She then met Palmer at the Comfort Inn, where Palmer was staying. Captain Johnson obtained a statement from Palmer and was headed back to the office when she received a call from an informant. The informant provided the names of several people: Isaiah Johnson, Eddie Johnson, and Cheesy Hollins. Isaiah, Eddie, and Cheesy gave Captain Johnson\n   statements and information about a person of interest, Danny Starks. Cheesy provided a recorded phone call, from which Captain Johnson developed two suspects: David McLymont and Thompson. Captain Johnson also brought Starks in for questioning and asked him to look at two photo lineups she had prepared. Starks viewed the lineups and identified McLymont and Thompson as people he recognized. Under McLymont's photo, Starks wrote \"front seat,\" and under Thompson's, he wrote \"this is the guy I saw with the gun.\" As a result, warrants were issued for both McLymont and Thompson. Both men were arrested, and their fingerprints were sent to the crime lab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Several experts testified for the State. Dr. Feng Li, an expert physician in the field of anatomical, clinical, and forensic pathology, testified that he performed Buford's autopsy and recovered a bullet from Buford's head. Dr. Li stated that Buford died of a penetrative gunshot wound to the head. Kristopher Wingert, an expert crime scene analyst with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, processed the finger prints and contents of the vehicle. Wingert stated that a copper jacket\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was found on the floorboards of Buford's car. Starks Hathcock, an expert forensic scientist specializing in firearms identification and examination, identified the copper jacket as bearing similar characteristics to a .40-caliber bullet. Hathcock also analyzed the bullet recovered from Buford's brain and determined it bore similar characteristics to a .38-caliber bullet. Mike Hood, an expert forensic scientist specializing in latent fingerprints, testified that McLymont's fingerprints were found on the front passenger's door of Buford's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Derrick Noah, a Coahoma County Jail inmate, also testified for the State. Noah testified that he was acquainted with Thompson prior to his imprisonment and had the opportunity to speak to Thompson while they were both housed in the Coahoma County Jail. Noah stated that in one conversation, Thompson told him he was in jail because of a gun he bought from a mutual acquaintance. Noah recalled that the gun Thompson bought from the acquaintance was a .38-caliber revolver. Noah said that in another conversation, Thompson told him that he, McLymont, and Starks were at a Double Quick and came across a man wearing a chain-link necklace with a medallion. Thompson told Noah he wanted the medallion and started talking to the man, who allegedly asked about purchasing some marijuana. Thompson responded that they could get the marijuana, but they needed a ride from the Hicks Motel to get it. Thompson, McLymont, and Starks got into the man's car. Thompson sat in the rear passenger seat, McLymont was in the front passenger seat, and Starks was seated behind the man. According to Thompson, as McLymont got out of the car, he reached for the man's necklace, and the man shot McLymont in the leg with a .40-caliber gun. Thompson told Noah that after the man shot McLymont, he shot the man in the back of the head. Thompson also told Noah that he was wearing gloves so as to not leave fingerprints at the scene. Thompson said that he hid in the bushes behind the Hicks Motel \"until the coast was clear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Following these conversations with Thompson, Noah wrote the district attorney's office. Noah said he decided to share the information with the State because\n   Thompson had threatened him and his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Starks was the State's last witness. Starks testified that he met Thompson and McLymont (Thompson's cousin), while he was living in Clarksdale. He stated that on the evening of November 30, 2008, McLymont and Thompson met him at his house, and the three of them left to walk to a club together. On the way to the club, they came across a Double Quick. Thompson went into the store while Starks and McLymont waited outside. Thompson engaged in a conversation with another man (later determined to be Buford) inside the store. Starks said he heard Thompson ask Buford about a ride. Starks testified that he, Thompson, and McLymont got in Buford's car, and that as they were driving by the Hicks Motel, McLymont, who was seated in the front passenger seat, began wrestling with Buford. Starks said he was seated in the backseat, behind Buford, and Thompson was seated next to him. Starks stated that a shot rang off, and then he saw Thompson reach for his leg, pull out a gun, and shoot Buford in the back of the head. Starks confirmed he later spoke to law enforcement and that he identified McLymont as the front seat passenger, and Thompson as the man with the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. After Starks's testimony, the State rested, and Thompson moved for a directed verdict of acquittal, which the court denied. Next, Thompson's first witness, Andrinis Foster (Thompson's cousin), testified. Foster testified that in November 2008, she was in a romantic relationship with Starks, and that on the evening of November 30, 2008, Starks visited her home and told her he had \"somebody else's blood\" on him. Foster said she did not ask whose blood it was. Thompson's second witness was his sister, Denetria Thompson. Denetria testified that on the night of November 30, 2008, Thompson was with her and their father all night and therefore did not commit the charged crime. Thompson's final witness, Raechele Scott, was a jail administrator at the Coahoma County Sheriff's Department. Scott testified that Thompson and Noah were housed in separate parts of the jail. However, she also stated that during certain times, inmates are able to move around within their shared pod and speak with other inmates and that it was possible for an inmate assigned to a specific cell to visit another cell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. After Thompson presented his witnesses, he renewed his motion for a directed verdict, which the trial court denied. Following closing arguments, the jury deliberated and unanimously found Thompson guilty of murder in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-19(1)(a) (Rev. 2006). Thompson was sentenced to life imprisonment in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Thompson timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Denial of Thompson's Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict, or in the Alternative, Motion for a New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. On appeal, Thompson argues that the jury's verdict should not have been allowed to stand and that the trial judge should have granted either Thompson's judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or his motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. The denial of a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence, while the denial of a motion for a new trial challenges the weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

On appeal, Thompson argues he shot Buford in order to protect McLymont and that \"at best[,] [he] should have been charged with manslaughter.\" Thompson did not raise these theories at trial and did not request a manslaughter instruction. Therefore, he cannot raise these issues on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Ealey v.

Starks stated that at the time of the shooting, Buford was sitting in the driver's seat, and Thompson was sitting in the back-right passenger seat. Experts for the State testified that Buford died of a penetrative gunshot wound to the right side of the back of his head, and that the bullet recovered from Buford's head was a .38-caliber bullet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22.

Thompson argues that allowing his conviction to stand would be an unconscionable injustice because he was retried for simple murder on a capital murder indictment. As this argument challenges the sufficiency of Thompson's indictment, we address it below, under Thompson's third assignment of error. For the same reasons we found the evidence in this case to be sufficient, we also find that allowing Thompson's murder conviction to stand does not sanction an unconscionable injustice.

Thompson alleges the trial court erred by allowing Starks and Noah to testify because their testimonies were unreliable. To support his argument, Thompson cites a string of authority regarding the inherent unreliability of testimony given by accomplices and jailhouse snitches. In doing so, Thompson suggests a cautionary instruction should have been given to warn jurors that accomplice or snitch testimony should be viewed with suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27. We note, after thorough review of the record, that there is no evidence indicating that Starks was charged as an accomplice, nor is there any evidence suggesting Starks made any deals with law enforcement or prosecutors in exchange for his testimony. Further, Thompson did not request a cautionary instruction as to Starks's testimony, and his failure to do so serves as a bar to raising the point on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Carr v.

Thompson thus had statutory notice that his indictment for capital murder could result in a conviction for the lesser-included offense of murder.

Because a request for a lesser offense instruction applies to retrial, it logically follows that a request for a lesser-included offense should also apply to this retrial on the lesser-included offense of murder.

Taken as a whole, the jury instructions fairly announced the applicable law and sufficiently cautioned the jury. Any unreliability in Starks's or Noah's testimonies was brought out on cross-examination, and the jury was instructed to carefully weigh the credibility of all of the witnesses. Thompson's retrial for murder following a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury did not violate double jeopardy. Thompson's request for a lesser-included offense instruction during his first trial waived any inadequacy or notice in his indictment.

In Thompson's first trial, a jury found him not guilty of Count I, conspiracy to commit robbery, but deadlocked on Count II, capital murder (felony murder). The circuit court declared a mistrial as to the capital-murder charge.

The instant appeal addresses Thompson's subsequent trial, wherein Thompson was tried for the offense of deliberate-design murder but not prosecuted or retried on the indicted offense. During the second trial, where the State prosecuted only deliberate-design murder and not the offenses charged in Thompson's indictment, a jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree (deliberate-design) murder in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-19(1)(a) (Rev. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 48.

On appeal, he asserts the following issues: (1) the circuit court erred by denying his motion for a JNOV or, in the alternative, a new trial; (2) the circuit court erred by admitting into evidence threatening pretrial statements he made; and (3) the circuit court erred by allowing the State to retry him on the charge of simple murder without a new indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 49. I find dispositive Thompson's third assignment of error. The circuit court erred by allowing the State to prosecute Thompson for first-degree, or deliberate-design, murder in violation of section 97-3-19(1)(a) without also prosecuting Thompson on the indicted offense of capital murder (felony murder) in violation of section 97-3-19(2)(e). I would therefore reverse Thompson's conviction and vacate his sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously addressed, pursuant to a multicount indictment, a grand jury indicted Thompson on December 8, 2009, for Count I, conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of section 97-3-73, and Count II, murder during the commission of a robbery, in violation of section 97-3-19(2)(e) (felony murder). At the conclusion of Thompson's first trial, the circuit court entered an order declaring a mistrial as to Count II. However, the circuit court prohibited the State from retrying Thompson on Count II of the indictment and provided that the State could only prosecute Thompson for a lesser-included offense of Count II. The State thereafter prosecuted Thompson for a lesser-included offense rather than for the offense in Count II of the indictment. The circuit court's order is contained in the record before us on our review of Thompson's second trial. I now turn to the relevant facts set forth in the record before us, including the circuit court's order declaring a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 50. At Thompson's first trial in February 2014, the circuit court instructed the jury on the indicted offenses of conspiracy and capital murder as well as the lesser-included offense of murder. The record reflects that, during its deliberations, the jury reported to the bailiff that it was unable to reach a decision. The court called the jury back into the courtroom to ask about the jury's numerical division. In response, the jury stated it was split 9-2, with one juror undecided. However, the record indicates that the jury did not specify\n   whether the split applied to one or both counts charged in the indictment. After finding the jury's \"split was not so divisive as to suggest that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked,\" the circuit court administered a\n   <em>\n    Sharplin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   charge and instructed the jury to continue deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 51. The record establishes that the jury once again reported that it remained unable to agree. The circuit court recalled the jury to the courtroom a second time and, through questioning, determined that the jury had reached a unanimous verdict of \"not guilty\" as to Count I, conspiracy to commit robbery. The foreperson informed the circuit court that the split within the jury as to Count II now totaled 10-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 52. The record shows that the jury once more returned to its deliberations as to Count II. For the third time, however, the jury reported that it remained unable to reach an agreement. Although the jury did not report a verdict as to Count II, the circuit court surmised from its colloquy with the jury that the jury's finding as to the capital-murder charge was adverse to the State. The circuit court also surmised that the jury was divided as to the lesser-included offense of murder. The circuit court directed the jury to continue its deliberations regarding Count II. After further deliberations, the jury yet again reported to the bailiff that it remained unable to reach agreement. The circuit court then declared a mistrial as to Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 53. The circuit court's order declaring a mistrial provided that, although the jury did not actually report a verdict as to Count II, based on the court's conversation with the jury and the difficulty the jury experienced in reaching a determination regarding the lesser-included offense of murder, the circuit court concluded that the jury's finding as to the capital-murder charge was adverse to the State. The circuit court's order declaring a mistrial provided the following directive: \"As such, while the State will be permitted to retry the [D]efendant, such retrial will be limited to the charge of 'murder[,]' and the State will not be permitted to retry the [D]efendant on a charge of 'capital murder.' \" Thus, as the record reflects, the circuit court declared a mistrial as to the indicted offense of Count II, capital murder, and the circuit court directed that the State could retry Thompson only on the lesser-included offense of murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 54. The record further shows that, upon Thompson's subsequent trial in July 2014, in accordance with the circuit court's prior instruction, the State prosecuted Thompson only for the lesser-included offense of first-degree (deliberate-design) murder in violation of section 97-3-19(1)(a) and not for the actual indicted charge of felony murder in violation of section 97-3-19(2)(e). Thus, the record shows that, in the subsequent trial, Thompson was not prosecuted for the offenses charged in the indictment. After the jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder, the circuit court sentenced him to life imprisonment in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, with the sentence to run consecutively to any and all sentences previously imposed. Thompson filed an unsuccessful motion for a JNOV or, in the alternative, a new trial. Aggrieved by his conviction and sentence, Thompson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 55. In his recent concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Ashwell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366171\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/69/#p73\">\n    226 So.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77 (\u00b6 27) (Miss. 2017), Justice Kitchens explicitly stated that an indictment is essential to show a prosecution is carried out in the State of Mississippi's name and authority.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Miss. Const. art. 6, \u00a7 169 (\"[A]ll prosecutions shall be carried on in the name and by authority of the 'State of Mississippi[.]' \"). Justice Kitchens further explained that \"[t]he charging document in a criminal case establishes that the prosecution is brought in the name of the State, an indispensable prerequisite\" to a felony prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Ashwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366171\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/69/#p73\">\n    226 So.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 27) (Kitchens, J., concurring). In the present case, as in\n   <em>\n    Ashwell\n   </em>\n   , without a prosecution on the indictment, the record on appeal lacks evidence in Thompson's second trial and resulting conviction to show that the prosecution was brought in the State of Mississippi's name and authority. In the subsequent trial, the State failed to prosecute Thompson for the crime charged in Count II of the indictment. Instead, the State prosecuted Thompson only for a lesser-included offense. As Justice Kitchens acknowledged in\n   <em>\n    Ashwell\n   </em>\n   , the indictment's absence leaves a defendant unable to plead double jeopardy in a future prosecution for the same or similar offenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366171\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/69/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Justice Kitchens also explained that an indictment constitutes a prerequisite to the State's ability to prosecute a felony unless the defendant waives the indictment and consents to proceeding by information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366171\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/69/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366171\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/69/#p73\">\n    at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 56. With regard to the present case, no dispute exists that deliberate-design murder constitutes a lesser-included offense of capital murder. However, prosecution on the indictment is a prerequisite to obtaining a conviction for a lesser-included offense. Of course, the jury may be instructed upon all lesser-included offenses of that indicted offense that are supported by the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority relies on\n   <em>\n    Gangl v.

However,\n   <em>\n    Gangl\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to the facts of the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Gangl\n   </em>\n   , the State prosecuted the defendant on the charged indictment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544328\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/539/132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544328\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/539/132/\">\n    at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The circuit court instructed the jury during Thompson's subsequent trial on the lesser-included offense without an instruction or prosecution on Count II of the indictment.
