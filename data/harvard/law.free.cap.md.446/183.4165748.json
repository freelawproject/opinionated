He had become acquainted with T.R. over a phone chat line some weeks earlier, during which conversation Yonga told T.R. that his name was Mohammad.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Yonga and T.R. decided to meet on a day that T.R. would pretend to be ill, in order to stay home from school. After they met at the apartment, the two began kissing, and Yonga, at times, touched T.R.\u2019s breasts. Eventually, the pair moved to T.R.\u2019s mother\u2019s bedroom; T.R. removed her clothing while Yonga took off his pants and underwear. After Yonga and T.R. moved to the bed, they began to have sexual intercourse when they were interrupted by the unexpected return of T.R.\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Yonga quickly left the apartment, and dropped his cell phone, which was retrieved by T.R.\u2019s mother, who called police and reported the incident, after having learned Yonga\u2019s name and address from his mother whose phone number was in the cell phone. T.R.\u2019s mother then took her daughter to a local clinic for an examination and for a shot of Depo-Provera, a birth control implant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Yonga initially denied knowing T.R. and denied having initiated sexual intercourse, but admitted to \u201ckissing and touching\u201d her on a porch outside the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Yonga was arrested and charged with second degree rape<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a third degree sexual offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He pled guilty to the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>degree sexual offense during a colloquy conducted by Judge Dana Levitz, then an active judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. During the colloquy, Judge Levitz assured that Yonga\u2019s plea was given freely, voluntarily and knowingly and that Yonga understood that the plea had been negotiated as one binding upon the Judge in terms of sentencing:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">THE COURT: Now, I\u2019m going to ask you a series of questions. My purpose in asking you the questions is not to get you to do anything. I\u2019m not trying to get you to enter a guilty plea or not, but the law says I can\u2019t let you enter a guilty plea unless you\u2019re doing it freely, voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. I\u2019m asking you the questions to satisfy myself that you are entering it under these conditions, so if I ask anything you don\u2019t understand, stop me. Say, Judge, I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re asking me, and I\u2019ll try to explain it to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">YONGA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">THE COURT: Now, the State\u2019s Attorney and your lawyer have told me that you\u2019re entering a guilty plea in Case Number 07-K-324 to the third count which \u2014 excuse me, the second count, which charges you with third-degree sex offense which occurred on or about November the 3rd, 2006, and the third-degree sex offense was upon [T.R.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">In exchange for your plea to that charge the State will dismiss the more serious second-degree sex offense. In addition, the State and the Defense have agreed that the sentence that I will impose is 364 days. I\u2019m going to suspend all but six months of the sentence and that six months will be served at the Baltimore County Detention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Center. They\u2019ve agreed that the sentencing will happen on the June the 4th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">That\u2019s what I understand to be the total plea agreement in this case. Is that your understanding of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">YONGA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">THE COURT: Has anyone made you any other promises, threats, inducements to get you to enter this plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">YONGA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">THE COURT: How far did you go in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">YONGA: Um, college level, university level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">THE COURT: All right. Are you now under the influence of alcohol, drugs or any other substance that\u2019s affecting your thinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">YONGA: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">THE COURT: Have you ever been treated for a mental disease or a mental disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">YONGA: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">THE COURT: Are you now on probation or parole? YONGA: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">THE COURT: As I understand it, you are a, um, a citizen of \u2014 is it Sierra Leone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-17\">YONGA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">Judge Levitz also advised Yonga of possible implications of the guilty plea on his immigration status:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahn\">THE COURT: Okay, You understand that this guilty plea could have immigration consequences and if you are concerned about that then I urge you to talk to an immigration lawyer because I can\u2019t advise you about that. I have nothing to do with that. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-19\">YONGA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Judge Levitz then explained to Yonga that, by pleading guilty, he was waiving various rights to which he would have been entitled during a trial and his right to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">THE COURT: Okay. All right, so by proceeding in this way we don\u2019t have a trial where witnesses are called. You\u2019re giving up the right to have your lawyer cross examine the witnesses. You\u2019re giving up the right to produce witnesses on your own behalf. You\u2019re giving up the right to testify or remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">If this were a trial you could sit next to Mr. Fatemi and you wouldn\u2019t have to say a word. You could just sit next to him. Nobody could make you get on the stand and admit you did anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">You\u2019re giving up the right to appeal by proceeding in this way, you\u2019re giving up the right to complain that anything the police may have done that you think violated your rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Judge Levitz then reinforced his commitment to be bound by the disposition agreed upon by the State and Yonga\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">THE COURT: The sentence that the law would allow for this crime is ten years in prison but I\u2019ve already told you the sentence that I\u2019m going to impose in this case, so while that\u2019s what the law would allow I\u2019ve already made you a promise that the sentence is going to be 364 days, suspend all but six months. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">YONGA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">THE COURT: Do you understand everything that I\u2019ve said so far?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">YONGA: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Judge Levitz also inquired whether Yonga had \u201cany additions, corrections or modifications to those facts?\u201d to which Yonga\u2019s counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">MR. FATEMI: Uh, I think Madame State has, uh, properly went over, uh, what hap \u2014 allegedly happened, just the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>that he never went in the house and in the statement he stated that he did not have sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Judge Levitz accepted Yonga\u2019s guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">THE COURT: Okay. All right. I\u2019ve had occasion to speak with the Defendant and based on my opportunity I\u2019m convinced that his plea is free, voluntary, knowing, informed and with factual basis, and accordingly I accept his guilty plea to third-degree sex offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">During the sentencing hearing approximately one month later, at which Yonga\u2019s family allocuted regarding Yonga\u2019s mistake, Yonga expressed his remorse to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">Yes, sir. I\u2019m very sorry. Really, really, really sorry. I made a mistake and I\u2019ve learned a lot from it. I\u2019m really, really, really \u2014 I\u2019m so, I\u2019m so deeply, really sorry. It bothers me every day but, um, it\u2019s a mistake I made. I\u2019m going through it, you know, I\u2019m very, very, very sorry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Pursuant to the plea agreement, Judge Levitz sentenced Yonga to 364 days in the Baltimore County Detention Center, with all but six months suspended. Yonga also was required to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Six years later, in 2013, after allegedly reconnecting with T.R. through social media, Yonga petitioned for a Writ of Actual Innocence, under Section 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in which he alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>T.R. \u201crecanted\u201d her original statements given to police. Judge Sherrie Bailey of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County denied Yonga\u2019s petition on the merits, after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Yonga appealed the denial, arguing that Judge Bailey, in finding Yonga did not sufficiently establish newly discovered evidence as required under Section 8-301, erred. The State countered that the Writ of Actual Innocence was not applicable to a person who had pled guilty and, in the alternative, that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial on the merits was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Our intermediate appellate court affirmed in a reported opinion. <em>Yonga v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 45, 108 A.3d 448 (2015). Judge Charles E. Moylan, writing for the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Appeals, explained the history of Section 8-301 and its affinity to the motion for a new trial under Rule 4-331, determining, primarily, that \u201ca non-reversed guilty plea is invulnerable to a Writ of Actual Innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 108 A.3d at 467. The Court of Special Appeals also determined that Judge Bailey did not clearly err in her credibility determinations, and, therefore, did not abuse her discretion in denying Yonga\u2019s petition, although it emphasized that, \u201cFirst and foremost is our primary holding that the Writ of Actual Innocence does not apply to a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 108 A.3d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We granted Yonga\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Yonga v. State, </em>442 Md. 515,113 A.3d 624 (2015), which presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">I. DOES THE STATUTORY WRIT OF ACTUAL INNOCENCE UNDER \u00a7 8-301 OF THE [CRIMINAL PROCEDURE] ARTICLE OF THE ANNOTATED CODE OF MARYLAND APPLY TO GUILTY PLEA CASES?[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">II. IF SO, IS IT CLEAR ERROR AND/OR AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION FOR A TRIAL JUDGE TO DENY A REQUEST FOR A NEW TRIAL BY THE PETITIONING PARTY WHERE THE ALLEGED VICTIM AND THE ONLY WITNESS DESCRIBED IN THE STATEMENT OF FACTS BOTH TESTIFIED THAT THE ALLEGED EVENTS NEVER HAPPENED WHEN THE TRIAL JUDGE HAD HEARD TESTIMONY AT A HEARING UNDER \u00a7 8-301? [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In addressing the issue of whether an individual who pled guilty can later file a Petition for a Writ of Actual Innocence under Section 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article, we initially acknowledge that the statute is silent on the issue. The history of the legislation, our implementation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>through our Rules as well as our understanding of what \u201cactual innocence\u201d means, juxtaposed against what a guilty plea involves, however, inform our conclusion that a person who has pled guilty may not later avail himself or herself of the relief afforded by the Petition for a Writ of Actual Innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Section 8-301(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article provides that \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence is the foundation for a Writ of Actual Innocence, such evidence that would have created a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility\u201d of a different result and which could not have been discovered within the time period required for a motion for a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">(a) A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that crime may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed <em>if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence </em>that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Md.Code Ann., Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 (emphasis added). Section 8-301 was enacted in 2009 by the Maryland General Assembly through the enactments of Senate Bill 486 (\u201cS.B. 486\u201d) and House Bill 366 (\u201cH.B. 366\u201d) and reconciliation in conference.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 2009 Maryland Laws, Chapter 744. Section 8-301 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">Claims of newly discovered evidence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>(a) A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that crime may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined;

In each of the cases cited we, as well as the Court of Special Appeals, emphasized the importance of having the judge who considered the newly discovered evidence evaluate its significance against that which had been developed at trial: \u201c[t]he trial judge in the present matter weighed the newly discovered evidence and <em>considered its significance in relation to the evidence already presented at trial.\u201d Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 670, 821 A.2d 1, 20 (2003) (emphasis added). <em>See also State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 234, 896 A.2d 973, 996 (2006). Ms. Drouet also cited the following cases: <em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 333, 352, 768 A.2d 675, 685 (2001) (concluding that the newly discovered evidence was material, because \u201chad the evidence been disclosed, there is a substantial possibility that the verdict in the Petitioner\u2019s case would have been different\u201d); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 430-31, 578 A.2d 734, 741 (1990) (the relevant inquiry is whether \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d, had evidence been admitted, exists such that \u201cthe outcome might well have been different.\u201d); <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. 578, 590, 556 A.2d 230, 235 (1989)(\u201c[T]he judge found that the newly discovered evidence, weighed with the evidence before the jury at the trial on the merits, did not affect the verdict to the extent that the outcome of the trial would be different.\u201d); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 713, 884 A.2d 694, 714 (2005) (a trial judge\u2019s discretion requires his assessing the weight and credibility of the new evidence, as he is \u201cthe only judicial figure who had his thumb on the pulse of the trial,\u201d and, therefore, \u201c[his] exercise of discretion in evaluating credibility is indispensable.\u201d); <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>420, 438, 621 A.2d 910, 917 (1993) (identifying the applicable standard as whether the new evidence created a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility that the verdict of the trier of fact would have been affected\u201d by its absence). The remaining documents contained in the bill file for S.B. 486, including its Floor Report, also echo the relationship between the \u201csubstantial probability\u201d standards under Section 8-301 and Rule 4-331(c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">With respect to this legislative history, Yonga argues had the Legislature intended Section 8-301 to apply only to persons who had been convicted after trial that it would have placed such language directly in the statute.

The rule traces its origin to two Rules, 759 and 764. Rule 759(a) provided for a motion for new trial \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d in a criminal setting, but looked to Rule 567 which applied to civil cases for its procedural requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">A motion for a new trial shall be made pursuant to Rule 567 (New Trial).

Rule 764(b)(3) provided a vehicle for a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence \u201cwhich by due diligence could not have been discovered in time\u201d to comply with Rule 759:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">The court may, pursuant to a motion filed within the time set forth in subsection 1 of this section, grant a new trial or other appropriate relief on the ground of newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under section a of Rule 759 (Motions After Verdict).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Rule 764(b)(3) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In 1978, Rule 759(a) was merged with Rule 764(b)(3) to create a new rule, Rule 770, requiring that a motion for new trial be filed within three days of the verdict or within 90 days if based on newly discovered evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">a. <em>Motion by Defendant</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">Upon motion of the defendant filed within three days after a verdict the court, in the interest of justice, may order a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">b. <em>Newly Discovered Evidence</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">Upon motion filed within 90 days after the imposition of sentence or within 90 days after receipt by the court of a mandate issued by the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals, whichever is later, a court may grant a new trial or other appropriate relief on the ground of newly discovered evidence, which, by due diligence, could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>been discovered in time to move for a new trial pursuant to section a of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Rule 770 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">When the rules were subsequently renumbered in 1984, Rule 4-331 replaced Rule 770, and the motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence was shifted to paragraph (c), which permitted the filing of the motion when the evidence was not discoverable by due diligence in time to file within the time limitation specified under paragraph (a).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Rule 4-331 (1985). Rule 4-331(c)(l), in its current form, provides for filing a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence within one year from the date of the sentence or mandate. Rule 4-331(c)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">(c) Newly Discovered Evidence.

In affirming Campbell\u2019s conviction, we recognized that, \u201cThe trial judge in the present matter weighed the newly discovered evidence and <em>considered its significance in relation to the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>evidence already presented at trial.\u201d Id. </em>at 670, 821 A.2d at 20 (emphasis added).

Matthews, </em>415 Md. 286, 999 A.2d 1050 (2010), undermines the conclusion that to invoke Section 8-301 one must have been convicted after trial. In the case, Matthews had pled guilty to second degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence. Following a string of unsuccessful motions and petitions for post-conviction relief that consumed six years, Matthews filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, which was denied without a hearing. Matthews appealed, arguing that under Rule 4-331(c)(l) he was entitled to a hearing on his motion. Our intermediate appellate court agreed with Matthews, and we granted certiorari to address whether a hearing was required under 4-331(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">We held that because Section 8-301 had been enacted while the case was pending and there was a dearth of \u201crules of procedure to guide the process\u201d Matthews\u2019s motion for a new trial, untimely under Rule 4-331(e)(l), could be treated as a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence and we left the issue of whether the petition met the requirements of the statute for the circuit court to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">Consequently, we shall vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, with instructions to vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court and to remand, so that the Circuit Court may consider Matthews\u2019s motion as a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence. Whether the alleged newly discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>evidence \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331,\u201d Section 8-301(a)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article, whether Matthews\u2019s motion satisfies the requirements of Section 8-301(b), whether a hearing is required under Section 8-301(e), and whether counsel should be appointed, we leave for the Circuit Court to address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><em>Id., </em>415 Md. at 298, 999 A.2d at 1057. We, therefore, did not decide, as Yonga suggests, that Matthews was <em>entitled </em>to proceed on a Writ of Actual Innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Why, though, is a trial the appropriate vehicle against which we measure the \u201csubstantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different\u201d? Judge Moylan, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, eloquently described the reasons why trials present the essential paradigm in the weighing process against which the \u201csubstantial or significant possibility\u201d standard manifest in Rule 4-331(c)(l) and a bedrock of 8-301 is measured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">There is, however, no way to compare the trial that was with the trial that might have been when there was no trial that was. Where there was no trial, it would be utter speculation to attempt to construct what the imaginary trial might have consisted of. We may not hypothesize a mythical trial. The statement of facts offered in support of the guilty plea is only minimalist. A State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office going before a jury would almost certainly opt for a more maximal case of guilt. We do not know, therefore, what witnesses would have been called or what, under direct and cross-examination, they might have said. We do not know whether the appellant would or would not have testified and, if he did testify, how his testimony would have held up. We do not know what medical reports might have been submitted. There would be self-evidently no way to make the prescribed comparison. Newly discovered evidence simply cannot be measured in the case of a conviction based on a guilty plea. With what cast of characters, moreover, would we people our hypothetical testing? Do we ask whether the hypothetical jury that might have rendered a guilty verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>after a hypothetical trial would probably have rendered a different verdict? Or do we ask, as in this case, whether Judge Levitz would still have accepted the guilty plea? These are very different questions. The criteria for rendering a trial verdict and the criteria for accepting a guilty plea are not remotely the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Yonga, </em>221 Md.App. at 68-69, 108 A.8d at 462. As a result of the different criteria utilized at trial and a guilty plea, the test of the persuasive weight of the newly discovered evidence contained in 8-301(a)(l), with its foundation in 4 \u2014 331(c)(1), would not be applicable where the defendant had pled guilty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab-\">The acid test is to ask whether, if that jury had had the benefit of the newly discovered evidence as well as the evidence that was before them, would there be \u201ca substantial or significant possibility that the result would have been different?\u201d There is no way that such a test can be applied, however, to a conviction based on a guilty plea rather than upon a trial. The minimalist statement of facts offered in factual support of a guilty plea is no equivalent of or substitute for an actual trial. It was never intended to be. Generally speaking, we have no firm idea what the proof of guilt might have been that the jury might have heard because there was no jury and there was no trial. Would the State have mounted an \u201call out\u201d strong prosecution or simply have put on an adequate prosecution? That could make a big difference. The answer might, of course, depend not simply on the availability of the evidence but upon such other imponderables as the adequacy of the staffing of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office at a given moment, the depth of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s budget at a given moment, or upon how busy or unbusy the Office was with other cases on its agenda at a given moment. Might the State, in a case such as this, have mounted a full-scale effort and hired expert computer technicians to retrieve the text of the chatting between Yonga and his victim? Such a text may not have been critical to the <em>actus reus </em>of rape, which may have been interrupted in the nick of time by the victim\u2019s mother. It could have been both revealing and devastating, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>other hand, as to Yonga\u2019s <em>mens rea. </em>It is not unheard of, moreover, where the <em>actus reus </em>is ambiguous enough that it could reasonably tilt in either direction, that a damning <em>mens rea </em>could nudge an unsympathetic jury in a given direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">At such a purely hypothetical trial, moreover, might Yonga have invoked his right to silence? Under the facts of this case, such silence could have been fatal, whatever the Fifth Amendment instruction might be about not using his silence against him. Or if Yonga had taken the stand, how might he have stood up against rigorous and sustained cross-examination? We cannot know any of this and that is why the newly discovered evidence cannot possibly be measured against an unknown antecedent. Guilty pleas simply do not lend themselves to newly discovered evidence analysis. We would have no standard to measure the newly discovered evidence against. Q.E.D.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 108 A.3d at 462-63. Thus, the weighing mechanism required by the \u201csubstantial <em>or </em>significant possibility\u201d standard adopted in Section 8 \u2014 301(a)(1), and judicially determined through Rule 4 \u2014 331(c)(1), can only be utilized after a jury or bench trial resulting in conviction has occurred. <em>See Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 600, 709 A.2d 1194, 1200 (1998) (\u201cIt may be said that the breadth of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a new trial is not fixed and immutable, it will expand or contract depending upon the nature of the factors being considered, and the extent to which its exercise depends upon the opportunity the trial judge had to feel the pulse of the trial, and to rely on his or her own impressions in determining questions of fairness and justice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> In contrast, a guilty plea contains none of the facets of a trial, evidence production and credibility determinations, for example, that informs the court when evaluating whether the proffered newly discovered evidence had a substantial or significant possibility that a different result would have occurred. When an individual pleads guilty, credibility determinations are not tested, reliability and validity are not challenged, and relevance is not an issue. The gravamen of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>guilty plea is whether it was undertaken by the accused \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Stumpf, </em>545 U.S. 175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 2405, 162 L.Ed.2d 143, 153 (2005) (internal quotation omitted). A trial judge, in accepting a guilty plea, is primarily concerned with insuring its validity, not with the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We agree, then, with our brethren on the Court of Special Appeals that only a conviction garnered after a bench or jury trial can provide the fodder against which the standard in Section 8-301(a)(l) can be measured. Our conclusion has been well articulated by one of our former members, Judge Alan Wilner, now retired, who as chair of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure presented to this Court Rule 4-332 to implement Section 8-301.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> During a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>discussion on all fours with the issue before us, Judge Wilner, responding directly to whether a guilty plea was an appropriate vehicle against which an 8-301 petition could be measured, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">Either version is appropriate for adoption by the Court.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] Alternative B is the easier one, it simply tracks the statutory language____At some point, or points, this Court will need to resolve them. The Court certainly can, if it wishes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>adopt Alternative B and deal with those issues in the judicial context when they arise.... And the second [issue] is in what circumstances if any, <em>if any, </em>would it be legally possible for a court to find that the new evidence creates a significant possibility that the result would have been different if the conviction is based on a straight out guilty plea that was found to be knowing and voluntary and supported by a statement of facts that was sufficient to establish <em>prima facie </em>guilt.... Can a court legally conclude that the defendant did not commit the crime if, often under oath, the defendant knowingly and voluntarily told the judge taking a guilty plea that he did commit the crime. That he was pleading guilty because he was guilty. When we took this back and looked at that, one thought is there is just no way. It\u2019s a direct contradiction. But, that there might be a basis for relief if one could imagine that the new evidence was such that it would not have allowed the statement of facts to be presented in the way that it was. But frankly, we couldn\u2019t think of any other circumstance in which the court could say, well, I\u2019m now convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that you didn\u2019t commit the crime when you pled guilty and told the judge you were guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">As to whether newly discovered evidence might suggest the defendant would not have pled guilty, had the evidence been known at the time and its relation to actual innocence, Judge Wilner responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">Now obviously the defendant would know whether he committed the crime or not, so, but I wouldn\u2019t have pled guilty because I could have a better shot at being acquitted. The only problem with that is how do you prove or disprove it? It\u2019s, you either believe the defendant when he says I wouldn\u2019t have pled guilty if I had known about this evidence and how does one test that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We agree, as we did when we adopted Alternative B.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In conclusion, the history of the legislation, our implementation through our Rules as well as our understanding of what \u201cactual innocence\u201d means, juxtaposed against what a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>plea involves, support our conclusion that a person who has pled guilty may not later avail himself or herself of the relief afforded by the Petition for a Writ of Actual Innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-14\">.

It's a chat line where you dial in the number and you\u2019re connected with different people. In those connections she connected with the Defendant. He advised her that his name was Mohammad. Um, in the course of those discussions, um, it was decided that they would meet. [T.R.] would advise that the plan to meet was on this day when she feigned illness so she could stay home from school, um, and, in fact, the Defendant came to the home. [T.R.] would advise when he came into the home they spoke briefly and there were times when they, uh, kissed. There were also times when he touched her breasts. Um, the Defendant, I would note for the record, is 25 \u2014 or was 25 years old at the time of this offense. Ultimately [T.R.] would advise that they went into her mother\u2019s bedroom, they got on to the bed, uh, she had removed all of the clothes and the Defendant had removed his pants and underpants. Um, she would advise that the Defendant, uh, with his hand touched her in the vaginal area, um, also would advise that there was an attempt for penile penetration, it was very slight, and it was at this time that her mother came home unexpectedly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">Um, [T.R.] heard her mother coming in the house. Both of the individuals jumped up out of the bed, uh, [E.R.] went into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>bedroom, observed the two to jump out of bed. She observed her daughter to grab clothing and sort of hide behind a dresser. She observed the Defendant to grab his pair of pants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">[E.R.] would advise that at this point she began screaming and said she was going to get a knife and cut off the Defendant's penis. Uh, the Defendant grabbed his pants and ran from the apartment without putting on his pants. In that fleeing of the apartment the Defendant had a cell phone in his pants pocket and the cell phone dropped. Um, after the Defendant fled from the apartment [E.R.], uh, took the cell phone and scrolled through it, found what was listed as the Defendant's mother\u2019s phone number on the cell phone. Uh, [E.R.] dialed that number, told the Defendant's mother what had taken place. At that time, uh, the woman who identified herself as the Defendant\u2019s mother on the phone provided [E.R.] with the Defendant's name, a phone number, as well as an address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">[E.R.] then took [T.R.] to a local clinic advising what had happened, asking for, um, an examination and determination with regard to, um, STDs as well as at that point she had a Depo-Provera shot which would be a, uh, birth control implant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Um, after that took place the police were called. Uh, I would also advise that [E.R.] after the phone call with the Defendant's mother she then destroyed that cell phone. She smashed it. However, she provided to the officer who responded all of that information. The case was then turned over to, um, the Sex Offense Unit for investigation. That phone number, um, was given to Detective Hummel. She made contact again with the woman who purported to be the Defendant's mother. She advised what she was investigating and that she needed to speak with the Defendant. Uh, she then advised the woman that, um, she would give the Defendant 48 hours to make contact so they could discuss this offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">Uh, one call was received by Detective Hummel which was a hang-up call. A second call was made, still within the 48-hour period, where the Defendant identified himself by name. He stated that he had no idea why the detective was calling and that he had never been to Baltimore County. When the detective, um, further made inquiry about discussions \u2014 the particulars, the Defendant hung up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">Uh, based upon all of this information and conduct an arrest warrant was obtained. The Defendant\u2019s address was in, um, P.G. County. A request was made of Career Criminal to assist in the arrest. They got information regarding the Defendant's vehicle. They went to the initial address and, Your Honor, they noted, um, it was a new community and the address was wrong so they could not make entiy based upon their arrest warrant because they had the wrong house number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">Um, they knocked on the door, got no response, asked Detective Hummel, who was still in Baltimore County, to make phone contact. Someone answered in the house and advised that yes, this was the house where the Defendant lived, but indicated he was not home. The Career Criminal Squad would advise that they could see pretty clearly from the windows that, in fact, the Defendant was inside. This was on December 6 of 2006. Um, ultimately, uh, a number of people arrived. They wouldn\u2019t let people in. There was an attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>to get a search warrant now based upon the belief that the Defendant was inside. Before the search warrant was actually signed the Defendant, after three hours, came outside and submitted to being arrested. He was then transported to Baltimore County. He met with Detective Hummel in the Lansdowne, uh, precinct. She advised him of his rights per the Miranda decision. He elected to waive those rights and make a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">He, um, initially again denied ever being in Baltimore County, having any knowledge of this young girl. As the interview progressed he said that yes, he met a girl on a chat line. He advised that the young girl told him, uh, that she was 19 years of age. He went on to say that when he ultimately met her she appeared to be younger than what he claimed to be her stated age of 19 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">Uh, he said they initially met in the city, that they made a stop where he purchased her a, um, heart-shaped pillow, that they then went to her, um, home. He went on to say that they never went into the house, that, at most, they kissed and touched and that he was leaning between her legs out on the porch when a woman came out screaming and, uh, he ran fr \u2014 fled from the location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">Your Honor, um, all events did occur in Baltimore County and that would be the statement to support the plea.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\">.
