(1977, 2012 Repl.Vol., 2015 Supp.) (\u201cTR\u201d) \u00a7 16-205.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commonly known as the \u201cimplied consent, administrative per se law,\u201d which provides a basis for the automatic suspension of the licenses of drivers who refuse to submit to testing for alcohol and drugs. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Deering, </em>438 Md. 611, 615, 92 A.3d 495, 498 (2014). In <em>Deering, id. </em>at 612-13, 92 A.3d at 496-97, this Court explained the labels \u201cimplied consent\u201d and \u201cadministrative per se\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">[TR \u00a7 16-205.1] incorporates \u201cimplied consent\u201d in that [TR \u00a7 16-205.1] provides that any individual who drives a vehicle in Maryland is deemed to have consented to take a chemical test \u2014 usually, a breath test \u2014 to measure [ ] alcohol concentration, if stopped by a [law enforcement] officer with reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving under the influence of alcohol. Despite [TR \u00a7 16-205.1]\u2019s declaration of implied consent by all drivers, [TR \u00a7 16-205.1] recognizes that a driver detained by a[ law enforcement] officer may refuse to take the [ ] test. But the time for making that decision is limited \u2014 [ ] alcohol concentration is transient[,] and any test must be conducted within two hours of the stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">The phrase \u201cadministrative per se\u201d refers to the administrative consequences of a refusal to take the [ ] test, or of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>test results that reveal that the driver has a[n] alcohol concentration above certain levels (regardless of whether the driver otherwise appears to be impaired). In both cases, [TR \u00a7 16-205.1] provides for an automatic suspension of the driver\u2019s license for specified periods. The license suspension is an administrative sanction that is distinct from any criminal prosecution of the driver that might also ensue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">Under [TR \u00a7 16-205.1], a detained driver thus has a choice to make \u2014 a choice with legal consequences. On the one hand, refusing the test carries a sure suspension; on the other, taking the test may result in no sanction at all[,] or in a significant suspension plus an increased potential for criminal prosecution, depending on the test result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Here, we decide the following question: Under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), is a driver subject to an automatic license suspension for a refusal to take a drug test where the driver has taken an alcohol concentration test and a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was driving while impaired by drugs? TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s plain language, purpose, and legislative history lead us to the inescapable conclusion that the answer to this question is \u201cyes\u201d; under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), a law enforcement officer with reasonable grounds to suspect impairment may request that a driver take both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test, and the driver is subject to an automatic license suspension for a refusal to take the second test.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">On June 29, 2014, Trooper G. Stambaugh (\u201cTrooper Stambaugh\u201d) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Maryland State Police issued to Jeffrey Thomas Gonce (\u201cGonce\u201d), Respondent, an \u201cOfficer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension\u201d that contained the following facts, which we summarize. At 5:00 p.m. on June 29, 2014, Gonce was driving west on U.S. Route 50 near the intersection with Castle Marina Road in Queen Anne\u2019s County. Trooper Stambaugh stopped Gonce for failure to securely fasten a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>registration plate. Upon seeing Gonce, Trooper Stambaugh observed what he believed to be indications of impairment, and, thus, administered the three-part Standardized Field Sobriety Test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201chorizontal gaze nystagmus\u201d test indicated zero out of a possible six clues of impairment. The \u201cwalk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>turn\u201d test indicated seven out of a possible eight clues of impairment. The \u201cone-leg stand\u201d test indicated three out of a possible four clues of impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Trooper Stambaugh did not detect any odor of alcohol on Gonce\u2019s breath. Trooper Stambaugh asked to perform a preliminary breath test, to which Gonce consented. The preliminary breath test indicated a breath alcohol concentration of 0.003 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Trooper Stambaugh arrested Gonce and provided him with an Advice of Rights form, seeking permission pursuant to TR \u00a7 16-205.1 to perform an alcohol concentration test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Gonce agreed to take an alcohol concentration test. Specifically, at 5:30 p.m., Gonce checked a box next to the words \u2018Tes \u2014 Agree to submit to an alcohol concentration test\u201d and signed the Advice of Rights form. According to a \u201cState of Maryland Notification to Defendant of Result of Test for Alcohol Concentration\u201d (bolding and some capitalization omitted) and a printout from the equipment that tested breath alcohol concentration, between 6:07 p.m. and 6:13 p.m., Gonce took a breath alcohol concentration test, which indicated a breath alcohol concentration of 0.000 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. In other words, Gonce passed the alcohol concentration test.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Knowing that Gonce had passed the breath alcohol concentration test, but having observed indications of Gonce\u2019s impairment, Trooper Stambaugh referred Gonce to Trooper First Class M. Miller (\u201cTrooper Miller\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a drug recognition expert. Trooper Miller completed a \u201cDrug Recognition Expert\u2019s Certification Form.\u201d At 7:05 p.m., Trooper Miller evaluated Gonce. In the Drug Recognition Expert\u2019s Certification Form, Trooper Miller stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">I had reasonable grounds, which I have set forth below on this form, to believe that [Gonce] was driving ... a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>vehicle while so far under the influence of any drug, any combination of drugs[,] or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, that [Gonce] could not drive a vehicle safely, or while under the influence of a Controlled Dangerous Substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">REASONABLE GROUNDS: [Horizontal gaze nystagmus], [Lack of convergence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>], Droopy eyelids on the nod, Low raspy slow speech, Facial itching, Little reaction to light[, P]sychophysical impairment,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] 0.00[0 Breath alcohol concentration], Slurred speech[,] Dry mouth, [C]onfused[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Trooper Miller asked Gonce to take a blood test for drugs or controlled dangerous substances, and Gonce refused to take the drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Specifically, at 8:15 p.m., Gonce signed a second Advice of Rights form, on which he checked a box next to the words \u201cNo-Drug or [Controlled Dangerous Substances] test refused ([Drug Recognition Expert] must complete &amp; submit [Drug Recognition Expert] Certification Form)[.]\u201d Afterward, Trooper Stambaugh confiscated Gonce\u2019s driver\u2019s license, served an order of suspension on Gonce, and issued him a temporary driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Gonce requested an administrative hearing to show cause why the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cthe MVA\u201d), Petitioner, should not suspend his driver\u2019s license. On September 23, 2014, an administrative law judge (\u201cthe ALJ\u201d) of the Office of Administrative Hearings conducted an administrative hearing. The ALJ admitted into evidence the Officer\u2019s Certification and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Order of Suspension, the State of Maryland Notification to Defendant of Result of Test for Alcohol Concentration, the Drug Recognition Expert\u2019s Certification Form, the printout from the equipment that tested breath alcohol concentration, and both Advice of Rights forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">At the administrative hearing, Gonce did not dispute the accuracy of any facts in any document, including Trooper Stambaugh\u2019s observations, Trooper Miller\u2019s observations, or the results of the three-part Standardized Field Sobriety Test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor did Gonce dispute that Trooper Stambaugh had reasonable grounds to believe that he had been driving while under the influence of a drug or controlled dangerous substance. Instead, at the administrative hearing, Gonce asserted that, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1, he was not subject to an automatic license suspension for his refusal to take a drug test because he had taken and passed the alcohol concentration test. More broadly, Gonce argued that, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1, a driver is subject to an automatic license suspension for a refusal to take either an alcohol concentration test or a drug test, but not for a refusal to take a second test after the driver took one test. The ALJ rejected Gonce\u2019s contention, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">The way [that TR \u00a7 16-205.1] is written, it\u2019s a test for alcohol concentration and/or a test for drug detection^ or] for [controlled dangerous substances]. Here, [Trooper Stambaugh] would not have had reasonable grounds to request [Gonce] to take a [controlled dangerous substances] test until after he was seen by [Trooper Miller].[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcC\">(Emphasis added). The ALJ determined that Trooper Stambaugh had reasonable grounds to believe that Gonce had been driving while under the influence of a controlled dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>substance; concluded that Gonce violated TR \u00a7 16-205.1 by refusing to take the drug test; and ordered that Gonce\u2019s driver\u2019s license be suspended for one hundred and twenty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Gonce petitioned for judicial review. On March 17, 2015, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) conducted a hearing. In an oral ruling, the circuit court reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and concluded that, after Gonce passed the alcohol concentration test, Gonce \u201cwas not required ... to submit to a blood test in order to avoid suspension.\u201d In an order dated April 14, 2015, the circuit court reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On April 24, 2015, the MVA filed in this Court a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>raising the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">Was a drunken or drugged driving suspect, who agreed to take an alcohol concentration test, which produced a test result of 0.00[0], subject to suspension under [TR] \u00a7 16-205.1, when he thereafter refused to submit to a [law enforcement] officer\u2019s request, based on reasonable grounds, to submit to a blood test for drugs or controlled dangerous substances?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">On June 17, 2015, this Court granted the petition. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Gonce, </em>443 Md. 234, 116 A.3d 474 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The MVA\u2019s position is straightforward; it contends that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3) authorize law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>officers with reasonable suspicion of impaired driving to request both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test. The MVA argues that, as used in TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d means both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test. The MVA notes that TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(a)(l)(iii)(3) defines the word \u201ctest\u201d as \u201c[b]oth: A. A test of a person\u2019s breath or a test of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood, to determine alcohol concentration; and B. A test or tests of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood to determine the drug or controlled dangerous substance content of the person\u2019s blood.\u201d (Paragraph breaks omitted). The MVA maintains that TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that the General Assembly did not intend to limit the meaning of the word \u201ctest\u201d to only one test.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Gonce responds that the ALJ erred in concluding that he was subject to an automatic license suspension for refusing to take the drug test. Gonce contends that, as used in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d means a single test. Under Gonce\u2019s interpretation of TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2) and (3), a driver is subject to an automatic license suspension for a refusal to take either an alcohol concentration test or a drug test, but not for a refusal to take a second test after the driver has already taken one test. In support of this interpretation, Gonce relies on the circumstance that, in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d is singular, not plural.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">A court defers to an administrative law judge\u2019s finding of fact where the record supports that finding of fact. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 14, 997 A.2d 768, 775-76 (2010) (\u201cA reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record.\u201d (Citation omitted)). A court reviews with some deference an administrative law judge\u2019s interpretation of a statute that the relevant administrative agency administers. <em>See Deering, </em>438 Md. at 622, 92 A.3d at 502 (\u201cA reviewing court \u2018... determined if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>this standard accords less deference to an agency\u2019s legal conclusions than to its fact findings, a reviewing court should give weight to the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute that the agency administers.\u201d (Quoting <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 14-15, 997 A.2d at 775-76)).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">In interpreting a statute, a court first considers the statute\u2019s language, which the court applies where the statute\u2019s language \u201cis unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose[.]\u201d <em>Lark v.

A test of a person\u2019s breath or of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood to determine alcohol concentration; 2. A test or tests of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood to determine the drug or controlled dangerous substance content of the person\u2019s blood; or 3. Both: A. A test of a person\u2019s breath or a test of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood, to determine alcohol concentration; and B. A test or tests of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood to determine the drug or controlled dangerous substance content of the person\u2019s blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">(Emphasis added) (paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The facts of this matter are undisputed. We must resolve a legal question of first impression \u2014 namely, whether, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), a driver is subject to an automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>license suspension for a refusal to take a drug test where the driver has taken (and passed) an alcohol concentration test and a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was driving while impaired by drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Based on TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s plain language, we conclude that a driver may be asked to submit to both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test, and the driver cannot have an automatic license suspension overturned on the basis that TR \u00a7 16-205.1 permits a law enforcement officer to request only one test. By its plain language, TR \u00a7 16-205.1 gives law enforcement officers the authority to request that a person submit to a blood test for drugs or controlled dangerous substances and an alcohol concentration test, whether through breath or blood. TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s plain language does not expressly limit law enforcement officers to only one test; <em>ie., </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1 does not state that law enforcement officers must elect which test to request or that only one test is to be permitted. Stated otherwise, TR \u00a7 16-205.1 authorizes law enforcement officers to request an alcohol concentration test and a drug test, without any explicit language indicating that the tests are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">To the contrary, as used in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d includes the plural of the <em>word </em>\u2014 ie. \u201ctests\u201d \u2014 and means both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test. TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii)(3) specifically defines the word \u201ctest\u201d as \u201c[b]oth: A. A test of a person\u2019s breath or a test of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood, to determine alcohol concentration; and B. A test or tests of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood to determine the drug or controlled dangerous substance content of the person\u2019s blood.\u201d (Emphasis added). TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(a)(l)(iii)(3) unambiguously establishes that, as used in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d does not mean only one test. Thus, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), a law enforcement officer with reasonable grounds to suspect impairment may request that a driver take both an alcohol concentration test and a drug <em>test </em>\u2014 ie., the law enforcement officer is not limited to requesting either an alcohol concentra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>tion test or a drug test \u2014 and the driver is subject to an automatic license suspension for a refusal to take both tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Our conclusion is based not only on TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii)(3)\u2019s plain language, but also on Md.Code Ann., Gen. Prov. (2014) (\u201cGP\u201d) \u00a7 1-202, which is part of the subtitle \u201cInterpretation of Code Provisions.\u201d GP \u00a7 1-202 states in its entirety: \u201cThe singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">This Court has previously used GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s predecessors for the purpose of statutory interpretation. In <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 618, 224 A.2d 677, 683 (1966), in determining whether the singular version of a word also included its plural, this Court relied on GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s immediate predecessor, Md.Code Ann., Art. I (\u201cArt. I\u201d), \u00a7 8, which stated: \u201cThe singular always includes the plural, and vice versa, except where such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d In <em>Gate-wood, id. </em>at 616, 224 A.2d at 682, a defendant was convicted of a lottery-related crime for the third time; one statute provided that the maximum sentence for a person\u2019s first conviction for a lottery-related crime was one year, and another statute stated: \u201cIf any person shall be a second time convicted of [a lottery-related crime], he [or she] shall on conviction be confined in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years[.]\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A trial court sentenced the defendant to four years of imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>at 616-17, 224 A.2d at 682. On appeal, the defendant contended that he could not be sentenced to more than one year of imprisonment because the statute that included the phrase \u201ca second time convicted\u201d did not apply to a person\u2019s third conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 617, 224 A.2d at 682. This Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention, stating: \u201cUnder [Art. I, \u00a7 8], the word \u2018time\u2019 may properly be taken as meaning \u2018time or times.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 224 A.2d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Similarly, in <em>Wheeler v. Rhoten, </em>144 Md. 10, 12, 123 A. 572, 573 (1923), this Court relied on Art. I, \u00a7 8\u2019s identical predecessor, Art. I, \u00a7 7. In <em>Wheeler, id. </em>at 11, 123 A. at 573, an employee was injured and awarded worker\u2019s compensation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>which the employer was obligated to pay. The relevant worker\u2019s compensation statute defined the word \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201ca person ... employing workmen in extrahazardous employments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 123 A. at 573 (emphasis omitted). The employer, who had only the one employee, contended that the worker\u2019s compensation statute did not apply because the phrase \u201ca person ... employing workmen\u201d did not include a person who employed only one workman. <em>See id. </em>at 12,123 A. at 573. This Court rejected the employer\u2019s contention, stating: \u201cThis question ... is ... fully answered by\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 7. <em>Id. </em>at 12,123 A. at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Although <em>Gatewood </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>involved GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s predecessors \u2014 which were not completely identical to GP \u00a7 <em>1-202 </em>\u2014 Gatewood and <em>Wheeler </em>are controlling with respect to GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s application, as GP \u00a7 1-202 is substantively identical to its predecessors. Both of GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s predecessors, Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, stated: \u201cThe singular always includes the plural, and vice versa, except where such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d In 2014, the General Assembly recodified Art. I, \u00a7 8 as GP \u00a7 1-202, which states: \u201cThe singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.\u201d <em>See </em>2014 Md. Laws 407, 423-24 (Vol. I, Ch. 94, H.B. 270). In other words, in 2014, the General Assembly made only three changes: deleting the word \u201calways,\u201d replacing the phrase \u201cvice versa\u201d with the phrase \u201cthe plural includes the singular,\u201d and deleting the phrase \u201cexcept where such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">None of these three changes was substantive, however. The Revisor\u2019s Note to GP \u00a7 1-202 states in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">[GP \u00a7 1-202] is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 1, \u00a7 8. The phrase \u201cthe plural includes the singular\u201d is substituted for the former phrase \u201cvice versa\u201d for clarity. The former phrase \u201cexcept where such construction would be unreasonable\u201d is deleted as a standard rule of statutory construction. <em>See </em>General Re-visor\u2019s Note to title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>(Emphasis added) (paragraph breaks omitted). <em>See also </em>2014 Md. Laws 424 (Vol. I, Ch. 94, H.B. 270). In turn, the General Revisor\u2019s Note to Title 1 (Rules of Interpretation) of the General Provisions Article states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFA\">Throughout this subtitle,[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] former language indicating that a definition applies unless such a construction would be \u201cunreasonable\u201d is deleted. The General Provisions Article Review Committee believes such a caveat is unnecessary because Maryland case law already factors the unreasonableness of a particular construction into a determination of legislative intent. <em>See Board of Trustees v. </em>Hughes, 340 Md. 1, 7[, 664 A.2d 1250, 1253] (1995) (\u201c[W]e seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d [ (Citation omitted) ]); <em>Wagner v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>263 Md. 560, 568[, 284 A.2d 5, 9] (1971) (\u201c[W]e should prefer a construction which leads to a reasonable, rather than an unreasonable and absurd[,] result.\u201d); [] <em>Doswell v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 647, 653[, 455 A.2d 995, 999] (1983) (\u201c[T]he statute should be read in a commonsense manner to avoid an unreasonable or absurd result.\u201d [ (Citation omitted) ]). No substantive change is intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">(Emphasis added) (some alterations in original). <em>See also </em>2014 Md. Laws 436 (Vol. I, Ch. 94, H.B. 270).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In short, the General Assembly\u2019s express purpose in deleting the phrase \u201cexcept where such construction would be unreasonable\u201d was simply to ensure that GP \u00a7 1-202 did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>include any \u201cunnecessary\u201d language. Likewise, the General Assembly did not substantively change GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s predecessors by deleting the word \u201calways\u201d when enacting GP \u00a7 1-202. There is no difference between \u201cThe singular always includes the plural\u201d and \u201cThe singular includes the plural.\u201d Finally, the General Assembly did not substantively change GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s predecessors by replacing the phrase \u201cvice versa\u201d with \u201cthe plural includes the singular\u201d when enacting GP \u00a7 1-202. According to the Revisor\u2019s Note to GP \u00a7 1-202, the change was simply \u201cfor clarity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">As demonstrated above, GP \u00a7 1-202 is substantively identical to its predecessors, and <em>Gatewood </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>endure as good law with respect to GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s application. The lesson of GP \u00a7 1-202, <em>Gatewood, </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>is that a singular word in a statute is not necessarily limited to only one subject, and a plural word in a statute is not necessarily limited to multiple subjects. Just as the word \u201ctime\u201d meant \u201ctime or times\u201d in the statute that was at issue in <em>Gatewood, </em>244 Md. at 618, 224 A.2d at 683 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), the word \u201ctest\u201d means \u201ctest or tests\u201d in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3). The \u201cquestion ... is ... fully answered by\u201d GP \u00a7 1-202, <em>Wheeler, </em>144 Md. at 12, 123 A. at 573; applying GP \u00a7 1-202 conclusively demonstrates that, as used in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d includes both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Because TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii)(3)\u2019s plain language and GP \u00a7 1-202\u2019s application alone establish that, as used in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d may properly be taken as meaning \u201ctests\u201d \u2014 i.e., both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test \u2014 we could end our inquiry into TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s interpretation without further discussion. Nonetheless, \u201ceven when we believe that the language of [a] statute renders [the General Assembly\u2019s] intent clear, [we may] examine the legislative history as a confirmatory process.\u201d <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 160, 46 A.3d 443, 462 (2012) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we examine TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s legislative history.

Notably, TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s predecessor did not provide for drug testing, as TR \u00a7 16-205.1 does, and did not direct law enforcement officers to confiscate a driver\u2019s license and serve an order of suspension on the MVA\u2019s behalf upon a refusal to take a test, as TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(3)(i) does.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In 1988, the General Assembly established a Task Force on Drunk and Drugged Driving (\u201cthe Task Force\u201d) because \u201c[d]runk and drugged drivers kill[ed] and injure[d] many people on the highways every year[,] and ...

(1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1 \u2014 in particular, in defining the word \u201ctest\u201d to include \u201c[b]oth\u201d an alcohol concentration test and a drug test \u2014 the General Assembly made clear that the word \u201ctest\u201d was intended to include both tests. TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s legislative history makes evident that the statute was amended over time to include testing for drugs as well as alcohol, and that its purpose is to protect the public by deterring both drunk driving and drugged driving. <em>See Janes v. State, </em>350 Md. 284, 288, 287, 711 A.2d 1319, 1321, 1320 (1998) (This Court referred to one of TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s predecessors as one of the \u201cstatutes bearing on Maryland\u2019s effort to keep drunk and drugged drivers off the State\u2019s roads[.]\u201d (Emphasis added)). This makes perfect sense, as any impaired driver is dangerous, regardless of whether the driver is impaired because of alcohol, drugs, or both. It would be both illogical and inconsistent with TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s legislative history and purpose to conclude that a law enforcement officer must choose whether to request an alcohol concentration test or a drug <em>test </em>\u2014 i.e., that a law enforcement officer cannot request both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test to protect the public from an apparently impaired driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Contrary to the plain language and legislative history of the statute, Gonce contends that TR \u00a7 16-205.1 authorizes multiple tests only where a person is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in death or a life-threatening injury. In arguing that, as used in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3), the word \u201ctest\u201d means only one test, Gonce notes that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cTest\u201d means, unless the context requires otherwise ... [b]oth: A. A test of a person\u2019s breath or a test of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood, to determine alcohol concentration; and B. A test or tests of [one] specimen of a person\u2019s blood to determine the drug or controlled dangerous substance content of the person\u2019s blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">(Emphasis added) (paragraph breaks omitted). Gonce points out that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>If a person is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in the death of, or a life[-]threatening injury to, another person and the person is detained by a [law enforcement] officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, or in violation of [TR] \u00a7 16-813 [ (Driving Commercial Motor Vehicle with Alcohol Concentration in Blood or Breath Prohibited) ], the person shall be required to submit, as directed by the [law enforcement] officer, to a test of: (i) The person\u2019s breath to determine alcohol concentration; (ii) One specimen of the person\u2019s blood, to determine alcohol concentration or to determine the drug or controlled dangerous substance content of the person\u2019s blood; or (iii) Both the person\u2019s breath under item (i) of this paragraph and one specimen of the person\u2019s blood under item (ii) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">(Emphasis added) (paragraph breaks omitted). Gonce, therefore, contends that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise\u201d and TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l)\u2019s reference to multiple tests establish that the word \u201ctest\u201d means both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test only where TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l) is <em>implicated </em>\u2014 ie., only where \u201ca person is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in the death of, or a life[-]threatening injury to, another person[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Gonce is mistaken. TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(a)(l)(iii)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise\u201d and TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l)\u2019s reference to multiple tests do not result in the interpretation that Gonce urges. The word \u201ctest\u201d means both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test where, as here, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3) are <em>implicated </em>\u2014 ie., where no person is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the death of, or a life-threatening injury to, another person. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Although we would normally begin with a plain language analysis of the two sections, the legislative history definitively demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(1) and TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l) independently authorize multiple tests. A review of TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s legislative history reveals that Md.Code Ann., Transp. (2002 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)\u2019s definition of the word \u201ctest\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> lacked the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise.\u201d Without referring to multiple tests, Md.Code Ann., Transp. (2002 RepLVol., 2003 Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l) stated that, under certain circumstances, a \u201cperson [was] required to submit to a test, as directed by [a law enforcement] officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In 2004, by passing Senate Bill 592, the General Assembly amended Md.Code Ann., Transp. (2002 Repl.Vol, 2003 Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)\u2019s definition of the word \u201ctest\u201d to add the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise\u201d after the phrase \u201c \u2018Test means\u2019 the definition still provided for multiple tests. <em>See </em>2004 Md. Laws. 2189, 2190, 2191 (Vol. Ill, Ch. 468, S.B. 592). Notably, in passing Senate Bill 592, the General Assembly also amended Md.Code Ann., Transp. (2002 Repl. Vol., 2003 Supp.) \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l) so that it read as TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(1) <em>reads </em>\u2014 i.e., so that it referred to multiple tests. <em>See </em>2004 Md. Laws 2190, 2191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">By adding to TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l) the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise\u201d at the same time that it added TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l)\u2019s reference to multiple tests, the General Assembly indicated an intent that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)\u2019s definition of multiple tests applied unless TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l) applied or was <em>implicated </em>\u2014 i.e., that the context required other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>wise.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A key difference in the application of TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii)\u2019s definition of multiple tests and TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l)\u2019s reference to multiple tests is whether a person is required to submit to the tests (TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l)) or a person may be requested to take the tests (TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)). Under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l), a person shall be required to submit to multiple tests, whereas, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2), a law enforcement officer may only request that a person submit to multiple tests. TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">If a person is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in the death of, or a life[-]threatening injury to, another person[,] and the person is detained by a [law enforcement] officer ... the person shall be required to submit, as directed by the [law enforcement] officer, to a test of: (i) The person\u2019s breath to determine alcohol concentration; (ii) One specimen of the person\u2019s blood, to determine alcohol concentration or to determine the drug or controlled dangerous substance content of the person\u2019s blood; or (iii) Both the person\u2019s breath under item (i) of this paragraph and one specimen of the person\u2019s blood under item (ii) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">(Emphasis added). In contrast, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Except as provided in [TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c) ], if a [law enforcement] officer stops or detains any person who the [law enforcement] officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>... and who is not unconscious or otherwise incapable of refusing to take a test, the [law enforcement] officer shall[, among other things]: (i) Detain the person; [and] (ii) Request that the person permit a test to be taken[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">(Emphasis added). As explained above, at the same time that the General Assembly amended TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l) to add the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise\u201d after the phrase \u201c \u2018Test\u2019 means[,]\u201d the General Assembly amended TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c) to refer to multiple tests. The legislative history of the statute is in accord with the plain language. Under the plain language of the statute, the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise\u201d in the amended version of TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l) simply pertains to the amended version of TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l)\u2019s reference to multiple tests being required, as opposed to TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)\u2019s definition of multiple tests that can be requested under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2). The legislative history setting forth the simultaneous nature of the amendments to TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l) and TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(c)(1) decisively establishes this conclusion. As such, the phrase \u201cunless the context requires otherwise\u201d in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii) does not affect our conclusion that the word \u201ctest\u201d may be taken to mean both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test where, as here, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3) are implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Gonce fails to heed the rules of statutory interpretation in contending that the word \u201ctest\u201d means both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test only where TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(1) is implicated. Under Gonce\u2019s interpretation, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii)(3)\u2019s definition of the word \u201ctest\u201d as both an alcohol concentration test and a drug test would be meaningless because the definition would not apply to any part of TR \u00a7 16-205.1 \u2014 not even TR \u00a7 16-205.1(e)(l), which independently provides for multiple tests. Gonce\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the rule that, \u201c[w]henever possible, a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered ... nugatory.\u201d <em>Lark, </em>414 Md. at 224, 994 A.2d at 973 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>As a final matter, we dispose of Gonce\u2019s contention that, assuming that we agree with the MVA (as we do), our interpretation of TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2) and (3) is unconstitution<em>al </em>\u2014 i.e., inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Search and Seizure) and Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Warrants for Search and Seizure):<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The constitutional issues that Gonce raises are not before us for several reasons. Significantly, the issues were neither raised before nor decided by the ALJ. <em>See Brodie v. Motor Vehicle Admin. of Md., </em>367 Md. 1, <em>3-4, </em>785 A.2d 747, 749 (2001) (\u201c[I]n an action for judicial review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency, a reviewing court ordinarily may not pass upon issues presented to it for the first time on judicial review and that are not encompassed in the final decision of the administrative agency. Stated differently, a court will review an adjudicatory agency decision solely on the grounds relied upon by the [administrative] agency.\u201d (Citation, ellipsis, paragraph break, and internal quotation marks omitted)). The issues were neither raised in nor decided even by the circuit court. Further, the MVA did not raise the issues in the petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>and Gonce did not cross-petition for a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The sole issue before this Court is TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s interpretation. In his brief, Gonce simply alleges constitutional violations without making any particularized argument whatsoever. <em>See Anne Arundel Cnty. v. Harwood Civic Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>442 Md. 595, 614, 113 A.3d 672, 684 (2015) (\u201cArguments ... not presented with particularity will not be considered[.]\u201d (Brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)). In any event, this Court will not decide constitutional issues unnecessarily. <em>See, e.g., VNA Hospice of Md. v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>406 Md. 584, 606, 961 A.2d 557, 570 (2008) (\u201c[T]his Court will avoid deciding the constitutional issues and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>decide the case on a non-constitutional ground if reasonably possible.\u201d); <em>Prof'l Staff Nurses Ass\u2019n v. Dimensions Health Corp., </em>346 Md. 132, 138, 695 A.2d 158, 161 (1997) (\u201cThis Court has regularly adhered to the principle that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u201d (Citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">To the extent that Gonce contends that TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s authorization of multiple tests \u201cpierce[s]\u201d his rights, such a contention ignores the purpose of the statute. TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s purpose is not to provide procedural protections to drivers who are suspected to be impaired by alcohol, drugs, or both; instead, TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s purpose is to protect the public by deterring drunk and/or drugged driving. <em>See Janes, </em>350 Md. at 288, 287, 711 A.2d at 1321, 1320 (This Court referred to one of TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s predecessors as one of the \u201cstatutes bearing on Maryland\u2019s effort to keep drunk and drugged drivers off the State\u2019s roads[.]\u201d); <em>Najafi v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>418 Md. 164, 181, 12 A.3d 1255, 1266 (2011) (TR 16-205.1\u2019s \u201cpurpose ... [i]s to protect the public rather than the accused[.]\u201d (Citation omitted)). In sum, the need to fulfill TR \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s purpose to protect the public and honor its plain language leads us to conclude that, under TR \u00a7 1G \u2014 205.1(b)(2) and (3), a driver is subject to an automatic license suspension for a refusal to take a drug test where the driver has taken an alcohol concentration test and a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was driving while impaired by drugs or a combination of drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.

The events that gave rise to this case occurred on June 29, 2014. Since then, three amendments to Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 16-205.1 have become effective.

Thus, for clarity, we refer to TR \u00a7 16-205.1 \u2014 the statute's current version \u2014 in connection with the issue of statutory interpretation in this case.
