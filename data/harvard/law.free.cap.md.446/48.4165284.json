HARRELL, JR., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af2\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This tragic case arose out of a motor vehicle collision between a Baltimore City police cruiser and a privately-owned motorcycle, resulting in the death of the motorcyclist. Respondent Connie Holloway-Johnson, on her own behalf and as the personal representative of the estate of her deceased son, Haines E. Holloway-Lilliston, initiated a wrongful death suit against, among others, Petitioner, Timothy Everett Beall, a Baltimore City police officer. The complaint, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, alleged negligence, gross negligence, battery, and a violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Compensatory and punitive damages were sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">At trial, Petitioner made a Motion for Judgment at the close of the Plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief. The Circuit Court (Hon. Marcus Z. Shar, presiding) granted the motion in part, allowing to go to the jury only the question of whether Officer Beall was negligent and, if so, what amount of compensatory damages should be awarded. The jury returned a substantial verdict for compensatory damages for Respondent, which amount was reduced subsequently by the trial judge, on Petitioner\u2019s motion, to $200,000 to comply with the damages \u201ccap\u201d of the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d), Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cCJP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Respondent appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the judgment in a reported opinion and remanded the case for a new trial. We granted Petitioner\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to consider multiple questions regarding the partial grant of the Motion for Judgment, the availability for the jury to consider an award of punitive damages, and the applicability of the LGTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>THE EVIDENCE ADMITTED DURING PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CASE-IN-CHIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">On 25 July 2010, Officer Timothy Beall was on duty in a marked police car in Baltimore City working the midnight patrol shift in the Northern District. He overheard a call on his radio from an off-duty officer about a Mercedes convertible and a motorcycle \u201cchasing each other or racing each other\u201d at about 100 miles per hour (m.p.h.) on Interstate 88 North (also known as the Jones Falls Expressway) in Baltimore City. A second transmission related that other officers were able to stop the car<footnotemark>1</footnotemark><em>, </em>but not the motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Officer Beall, who was near the 1-83 interchange with Cold Spring Lane at the time of the second transmission, turned onto 1-83 North to see if he could \u201cobserve the motorcycle.\u201d As he was merging onto the Interstate, he noticed a motorcycle on 1-83 northbound that was traveling at the time about 35 m.p.h. in a 50 m.p.h. zone. Unable to determine whether this was the same motorcycle as the one involved in the reported chase/race, Officer Beall followed the motorcycle in an attempt to ascertain license plate information. At approximately 1-83 North\u2019s interchange \"with the Northern Parkway, the motorcycle sped-up to about 75 m.p.h., a speed in excess of the posted limit. Officer Beall noted that \u201c[initially I didn\u2019t have much reason to suspect that [the motorcycle] was stolen. But once the motorcyclist fled, that heightened my suspicion based on the extremely high rate of stolen motorcycles in the City of Baltimore that the bike may be stolen.\u201d After the operator of the motorcycle \u201cpopped a wheelie,\u201d Officer Beall turned on his siren and lights to pursue the motorcycle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The pursuit continued, at speeds of 75 m.p.h., onto the inner loop of Interstate 695 East (the Baltimore Beltway) in the direction of Towson. At the Charles Street interchange, the speed of the motorcycle reduced to the posted speed limit of 50 m.p.h.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Officer Beall trailed the motorcycle, he received intermittent messages over his car\u2019s police radio. The messages were intermittent due to reception problems along portions of the route. Officer Beall denied hearing an initial direct radio order from his Shift Commander to discontinue pursuit of the motorcycle; he acknowledged, however, that he was advised indirectly thereafter to disengage from the pursuit after he was on 1-695 East into Baltimore County. His Shift Commander stated over the radio \u201cYeah, have the officer disregard and come back, notify the state police of [the motorcyclist\u2019s] location, the radio is going to die out soon, if there are repeaters out there, so just come on back.\u201d Officer Beall responded to this by stating \u201c10-4\u201d (meaning \u201cacknowledged\u201d), turning off his lights and his siren, and planning to turn back to Baltimore City. At this time, Officer Beall called the State Police from his cell phone to inform them of his position and that he had followed a motorcycle from Baltimore City onto 1-695 East.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Officer Beall followed the motorcycle onto the exit ramp for Dulaney Valley Road. He explained that he chose this exit, rather than the closer Lutherville/Timonium exit, because \u201c[t]he next exit [he] was familiar with was Dulaney Valley Road to go south, which [would take him] right down to Northern Parkway from York Road.\u201d On the exit ramp, the motorcyclist reduced his speed to between 31 and 33 m.p.h. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Officer Beall was traveling at about 40 m.p.h. The police cruiser made contact with the motorcycle. The motorcyclist, later identified as Holloway-Lilliston, was ejected from the bike.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His body made contact with the hood of Officer Beall\u2019s car. He died upon hitting the pavement. State Police Sergeant Jon McGee, an expert witness in accident reconstruction, offered his opinion about how the collision occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">So based off all the evidence, it\u2019s my opinion that there was contact between the two vehicles, and at that time Mr. Holloway[-Lilliston], based on that contact, the bike would have went out from Mr. Holloway[-Lilliston]. When he came down, he came down on the hood of the police car. My initial assessment on the scene was that the speeds of both vehicles were low. I estimated probably the police maybe 40. And I knew the speed differential between the two vehicles, because there was no inward crush damage to the bumper, was significantly low, maybe 5 to 10, 15 mile an hour speed difference, with the police car obviously going slightly faster than the motorcycle. Based off of where the initial tire marks and scratch marks of where the motorcycle went down and the location of where Mr. Holloway[Lilliston] fell to the road and slid to final rest, and the damage associated with the front hood of the police car, it\u2019s my opinion that there was contact. Mr. Holloway[-Lilliston] fell onto the top of the police car, rolled off the left side. Based on the helmet damage, the circumference of the helmet, there were scratches pretty much the entire circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ference of the helmet, landed head first as he rolled off the hood and slid to final rest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Sergeant McGee concluded that \u201cOfficer Beall failed to maintain a safe and proper following distance when he collided into the rear of the motorcycle driven by Mr. [Holloway-JLilliston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2J\">On 6 April 2011, Holloway-Lilliston\u2019s mother, Connie Holloway-Johnson, filed a complaint against Officer Timothy Beall and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The complaint alleged counts of negligence, gross negligence, battery, and a violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Ms. Holloway-Johnson sought compensatory and punitive damages in the sum of $20 million. Prior to trial, she dismissed voluntarily her claims against the City and proceeded to a jury trial against Officer Beall.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The case was tried between 24 July 2012 and 3 August 2012. At the close of the Plaintiffs\u2019 case, Officer Beall made a Motion for Judgment on the basis that insufficient evidence was presented as to each of the claims. Judge Shar granted Officer Beall\u2019s motion as to the battery, gross negligence, and Article 24 claims, as well as the prayer for punitive damages. The only claims that were allowed to go to the jury were the negligence claim and the prayer for compensatory damages. On 3 August 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Holloway-Johnson and the estate of her son for $3,505,000. On 20 August 2012, Officer Beall filed a Motion for a New Trial or to Revise the Judgment by reducing the verdict to conform to the damages \u201ccap\u201d in the Local Government Tort Claims Act (LGTCA). The Circuit Court reduced the judgment to $200,000, in accordance with the LGTCA. Ms. Holloway-Johnson appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held, in a reported opinion, that there was sufficient evidence for each of Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s claims to have been submitted to the jury and that it was error for the Circuit Court to have granted Officer Beall\u2019s Motion for Judgment. Additionally, the intermediate appellate court determined that, although the evidence ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>duced would not justify under the gross negligence count an award of punitive damages, the battery and Article 24 counts could qualify as \u201cpredicates for punitive damages\u201d under a theory of \u201cmalice implicit\u201d in the elements of each cause of action. <em>Holloway-Johnson v. Beall, </em>220 Md.App. 195, 227, 103 A.3d 720, 739 (2014). The Court held that the applicability of the LGTCA (which was not raised until Officer Beall\u2019s post-verdict motion) and its cap on damages was a \u201cfuriously contested moot question,\u201d concluding that, under the provisions of the LGTCA, any potential cap on damages could not be waived by Officer Beall as to his local government employer, who would be liable for the judgment (up to the limit of the LGTCA \u201ccap\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">On 27 March 2015, we granted a writ of certiorari, <em>Holloway-Johnson v. Beall, </em>442 Md. 194, 112 A.3d 373 (2015), to consider five questions (posed by the parties in their respective petitions), which we reorganize and condense as follows<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">1) Did the Court of Special Appeals modify improperly established standards to conclude that there was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>evidence to support the counts for gross negligence, battery, and a violation of Article 24?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">2) Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that Respondent\u2019s counts could support an award of punitive damages, contrary to the long-established law that actual, not implied, malice was necessary and remanding the case for further proceedings which might result also in the award of duplicative compensatory damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">3) Did Officer Beall waive the damages cap and judgment avoidance afforded by the Local Government Tort Claims Act, having failed to raise the defense until after trial and entry of judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Although we agree with the Court of Special Appeals as to the sufficiency of the evidence as to the counts for which the trial court gave judgment in favor of Officer Beall at the close of Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s case-in-chief and on the LGTCA question, we reverse nonetheless the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals for reasons we shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">a. Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Officer Beall contends that the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of his Motion for Judgment as to the Respondent\u2019s claims for battery, gross negligence, violation of Article 24, and punitive damages was correct because there was insufficient evidence admitted during the Plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief to support submitting them to the jury. Proceeding from that premise, he asserts further that the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing this judgment and remanding the case for a new trial when the admitted evidence amounted to no more than speculation about his intent at the time of the collision. Ms. Holloway-Johnson responds that she adduced enough evidence at trial to have all of her claims submitted to the jury and that the Court of Special Appeals was correct to reverse the grant of judgment in favor of Officer Beall. Additionally, she maintains that the Court of Special Appeals applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>correctly the malice requirement for consideration of awarding punitive damages to conclude that her battery and Article 24 claims could support implicitly such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">b. Standard of Appellate Review</p>\n<p id=\"AeQ\">We \u201creview, without deference, the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment in a civil case.\u201d <em>District of Columbia v. Singleton, </em>425 Md. 398, 406, 41 A.3d 717, 721 (2012) (citing <em>Thomas v. Panco Mgmt. of Md., LLC, </em>423 Md. 387, 393-94, 31 A.3d 583, 587-88 (2011)). Because \u201c[w]e conduct the same analysis that a trial court should make when considering the motion for judgment,\u201d we determine whether the evidence presented to the Circuit Court was sufficient to allow permissible inferences of the proof of the elements of the relevant claims. <em>Singleton, </em>425 Md. at 406-07, 41 A.3d at 721-22. The appellate court considers \u201cthe evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>423 Md. at 393, 31 A.3d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">c. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As stated earlier, Judge Shar allowed the jury to consider only the negligence count and the compensatory damages claim because he deemed all of Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s other claims to be lacking sufficient evidentiary support. The Court of Special Appeals disagreed, finding that there was sufficient evidence for all of Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s counts to reach the jury, as well as her request for punitive damages. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party (including reasonable inferences drawable therefrom), we agree in the abstract with the Court of Special Appeals as to the counts, but, as we shall explain, reversal and remand for a new trial to consider those claims and possibly punitive damages is unwarranted in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">A motor tort negligence claim presents ordinarily a relatively low bar for a plaintiff to overcome and avoid the grant of a motion for judgment. Negligence is defined as \u201cany conduct, except conduct recklessly disregardful of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>interest of others, which falls below the standard established by law for protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 187, 935 A.2d 699, 717 (2007) (citation omitted). A claim for gross negligence, however, sets the evidentiary hurdle at a higher elevation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">[G]ross negligence is an intentional failure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of the consequences as affecting the life or property of another, and also implies a thoughtless disregard of the consequences without the exertion of any effort to avoid them. Stated conversely, a wrongdoer is guilty of gross negligence or acts wantonly and willfully only when he inflicts injury intentionally or is so utterly indifferent to the rights of others that he acts as if such rights did not exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The distinction between negligence and gross negligence, however, can be a difficult one to establish in practice, as explained by the Court of Special Appeals in this case \u2014 \u201c[a] legally sufficient case of ordinary negligence will frequently be enough to create a jury question of whether such negligence was or was not gross.\u201d <em>Holloway-Johnson, </em>220 Md.App. at 221, 103 A.3d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\"><em>Boyer v. State, </em>323 Md. 558, 594 A.2d 121 (1991), involved a state trooper\u2019s high-speed pursuit of a suspected drunk driver, which resulted in the death of other motorists. The plaintiffs claimed that the trooper was grossly negligent because he pursued recklessly a suspect \u201cat an excessively high rate of speed through a heavy traffic area.\u201d <em>Boyer, </em>323 Md. at 579, 594 A.2d at 132 (quotation marks omitted). We explained that, \u201c[i]n order to charge [the trooper] with gross negligence, the plaintiffs must have pled <em>facts </em>showing that [the trooper] acted with a wanton and reckless disregard for others in pursuing [the suspect].\u201d <em>Boyer, </em>323 Md. at 579, 594 A.2d at 132 (emphasis in original). We held that the facts advanced by the plaintiffs were too vague to demonstrate adequately that the trooper acted in a grossly negligent manner because a rational fact-finder could not conclude that the trooper acted with \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for the safety of others in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>pursuing [the suspect].\u201d <em>Boyer, </em>323 Md. at 580-81, 594 A.2d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">In <em>Barbre, </em>we held that, when a police officer \u201cordered [the suspect], who was unarmed, to raise his hands, and that after [the suspect] complied with the request, [the police officer] approached with his gun drawn and shot him in the neck, [those facts] could support an inference that [the police officer] acted grossly negligent.\u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 190, 935 A.2d at 719. Comparing and contrasting <em>Boyer </em>and <em>Barbre, </em>it is apparent that determining if a plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence of gross negligence to get to a jury can be a complex question due to the sometimes close relationship between ordinary negligence and gross negligence. <em>See Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 187, 935 A.2d at 717 (\u201cIssues involving gross negligence are often more troublesome than those involving malice because a fine line exists between allegations of negligence and gross negligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Here, Officer Beall argues that the evidence (viewed in a light most favorable to the Plaintiffs) did not show he was grossly negligent (or permit a reasonable inference of such) in acting \u201cwantonly and willfully [by inflicting the] injury intentionally.\u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 187, 935 A.2d at 717. To be sure, the evidence presented at trial by the Plaintiffs revealed contradictory accounts by Officer Beall about how the incident unfolded. With only one surviving eyewitness, other direct evidence of what occurred was minimal. Although Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s complaint alleged that Officer Beall \u201cintended to harm Haines,\u201d Officer Beall notes that Sergeant McGee \u201cdid not offer any testimony that this accident was the result of intentional conduct by Officer Beall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The evidence presented by Ms. Holloway-Johnson strikes us as stronger than the conclusory record in <em>Boyer. </em>In <em>Boyer, </em>the plaintiff offered general allegations that the behavior of the trooper was reckless and in violation of police procedures. Ms. Holloway-Johnson relied specifically, however, on the actions of Officer Beall prior to the collision to show that he was acting recklessly. Officer Beall commenced trailing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>motorcycle surreptitiously and started active pursuit only after Holloway-Lilliston \u201cpopped a wheelie\u201d and sped away. Officer Beall\u2019s conduct concededly was in violation of BCPD General Order 11-90 <em>(see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>fn. 2) as he was acting without exigent circumstances in his pursuit of Holloway-Lilliston, who committed only traffic offenses and posed no articulated immediate harm to others. Additionally, evidence was presented to show that Holloway-Lilliston reduced his speed upon entering the construction zone on 1-695 East; yet, Officer Beall continued to follow him in contravention of a directive from his Shift Commander to discontinue pursuit and allow the State Police to handle the \u201ctraffic incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Because \u201cwe have viewed gross negligence, rather, \u2018as something <em>more </em>than simple negligence, and likely more akin to reckless conduct,\u2019 \u201d there was a factual dispute that should have been presented ordinarily to the jury. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 187, 935 A.2d at 717 (citing <em>Taylor v. Harford County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>384 Md. 213, 229, 862 A.2d 1026, 1035 (2004) (emphasis in original)). Here, based on the accident reconstruction that surmised the over-taking speed of the police cruiser on the ramp, the lack of exigent circumstances justifying Officer Beall\u2019s pursuit, and Officer Beall\u2019s testimony (as an adverse witness called by Ms. Holloway-Johnson) that he saw Holloway-Lilliston apply his brakes on the exit ramp, a jury could have inferred reasonably that Officer Beall knew or should have known a collision between the vehicles was likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Ms. Holloway-Johnson relied on the same evidence for her battery claim, which required proof that \u201cone intends a harmful or offensive contact with another without that person\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Carroll, </em>355 Md. 593, 600, 735 A.2d 1096, 1099 (1999) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 13 <em>&amp; </em>cmt. d (1965)). The contact may be direct or indirect, but it must be intended. <em>Nelson, </em>355 Md. at 600-01, 735 A.2d at 1099-100. It is clear that \u201c[a] person can use an automobile or other vehicle to intentionally hit another person,\u201d but, in order for that to constitute civil battery, the element of intent must be present. <em>Hendrix v. Burns, </em>205 Md.App. 1, 22, 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>A.3d 415, 428 (2012). This intent \u201crequires not a specific desire to bring about a certain result, but rather a general intent to unlawfully invade another\u2019s physical well-being through a harmful or offensive contact or an apprehension of such a contact.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>355 Md. at 602-03, 735 A.2d at 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Accordingly, accidental conduct that \u201cinadvertently results in a harmful or offensive contact with another will not give rise to liability, but one will be liable for such contact if it comes about as a result of the actor\u2019s <em>volitional conduct </em>where there is an intent to invade the other person\u2019s legally protected interests.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>355 Md. at 603, 735 A.2d at 1101 (emphasis supplied). Although a plaintiff is required to adduce admissible facts as to each element of a claim in order to reach the jury, it is well-established that \u201cintent is a subjective element usually left for the jury\u2019s determination [and] there are circumstances under which the law will imply the intent element of an intentional tort or a crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Following the accident, Officer Beall made conflicting statements to investigators that the motorcycle darted in front of him on the ramp, that Holloway-Lilliston crashed his motorcycle, and his body bounced off a tree, among other claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Notwithstanding Officer Beall\u2019s differing after-the-fact accounts, his violation of the BCPD General Order and disregarding his Shift Commander\u2019s verbal directive were clearly intentional acts. It is clear further that contact was made between the two vehicles by Officer Beall\u2019s vehicle overtaking the motorcycle. Thus, Ms. Holloway-Johnson presented legally sufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>that a battery occurred on the exit ramp, which led to the collision, and was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">By the same token, the evidence could have been viewed by a reasonable fact-finder as supporting a claim for a violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Article 24<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is Maryland\u2019s equivalent due process provision, determined to \u201chave the same meaning and effect in reference to an exaction of property, and that the decisions of the Supreme Court on the Fourteenth Amendment are practically direct authorities.\u201d <em>Bureau of Mines of Maryland v. George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Land Co., </em>272 Md. 143, 156, 321 A.2d 748, 755 (1974). The analysis for an Article 24 violation follows the analysis used for claims under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, as a result, \u201call claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force \u2014 deadly or not \u2014 in the course of an arrest, ... should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment[\u2019s] \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 204, 757 A.2d 118, 141 (2000) (quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Officer Beall relies on <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 839, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1713, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998), in which the United States Supreme Court was asked to \u201cresolve a conflict among the Circuits over the standard of culpability on the part of a law enforcement officer for violating substantive due process in a pursuit case.\u201d The Supreme Court determined that \u201ca police officer [does not violate] the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of substantive due process by causing death through deliberate or reckless indifference to life in a high-speed automobile chase aimed at apprehending a suspected offender.\u201d <em>County of Sacramento, </em>523 U.S. at 836, 118 S.Ct. at 1711. Only \u201ca purpose to cause harm unrelated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the legitimate object of arrest will satisfy the element of arbitrary conduct shocking to the conscience, necessary for a due process violation.\u201d <em>County of Sacramento, </em>523 U.S. at 836, 118 S.Ct. at 1711-12. Although this case might support Officer Beall\u2019s argument to the jury (had he been called upon to address the jury on this count) that he did not violate Article 24, it bears on the burden of persuasion once the claim is presented to the fact-finder, who would evaluate the evidence to determine if the standard was met. It does not aid his argument regarding the sufficiency of the Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence via a vis his motion for judgment at the close of the Plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">As held by this Court, \u201cif there is any evidence adduced, however slight, from which reasonable jurors [applying the appropriate standard of proof] could find in favor of the plaintiff on the claims presented, the trial court should deny the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment at the close of the evidence and submit the claims to the jury for decision.\u201d <em>Hoffman v. Stamper, </em>385 Md. 1, 16, 867 A.2d 276, 285 (2005). After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Ms. Holloway-Johnson, we arrive at the same technical conclusion as the Court Special Appeals: the defense\u2019s motion for judgment based on the alleged insufficiency of the Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence should not have been granted on that ground. Our decision does not address whether a jury would find for Ms. Holloway-Johnson on these claims. We are concerned only with whether she adduced enough evidence on each element of contested, but withheld, substantive causes of action to have a jury consider them. We conclude that she did, but, as we shall explain now, this appellate \u201cvictory\u201d is a pyrrhic one.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II. Compensatory and Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The compensatory damages verdict Respondent received from the jury on her negligence claim represents all of the compensatory relief due under any or all of the causes of action advanced. Moreover, none of the withheld claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>would support submitting the punitive damage request to the jury. Accordingly, a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Compensatory damages are awarded in an \u201cattempt to make the plaintiff whole again by monetary compensation.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Albright, </em>433 Md. 303, 414, 71 A.3d 30, 97 <em>on reconsideration in part, </em>433 Md. 502, 71 A.3d 150 (2013) and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 134 S.Ct. 648, 187 L.Ed.2d 449 (2013). We have noted that, although compensatory damages are awarded to make a plaintiff whole, \u201cthey are not intended to grant to the plaintiff a windfall as a result of the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct. Thus, an award for compensatory damages must be anchored to a rational basis on which to ensure that the awards are not merely speculative.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp., </em>433 Md. at 414, 71 A.3d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Maryland law provides that \u201ca plaintiff is entitled to but one compensation for her loss and that satisfaction of her claim prevents further action against another for the same damages.\u201d <em>Underwood-Gary v. Mathews, </em>366 Md. 660, 667, 785 A.2d 708, 712 (2001) (citation omitted). The \u201cpurpose of the rule is to prevent double recovery and, thus, unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the Maryland rules, \u201c[different legal theories for the same recovery, based on the same facts or transaction, do not create separate \u2018claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 459, 445 A.2d 343, 346 (1982). Because it is common for a plaintiff to plead multiple claims or theories of recovery for the same incident, we clarified that \u201c[w]hat makes claims separate is <em>not </em>whether they are pled in separate counts or embody separate legal theories.\u201d <em>Med. Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc. of Maryland v. B. Dixon Evander &amp; Assocs., </em>331 Md. 301, 313, 628 A.2d 170, 176 (1993). Additionally, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">[W]here a claimant presents a number of legal theories, but will be permitted to recover on at most one of them, his possible recoveries are mutually exclusive, and he has but a single claim for relief. The existence of multiple claims ultimately depends upon whether the \u201caggregate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>operative facts\u201d presented states more than one claim which can be separately enforced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>Med. Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc. of Maryland, </em>331 Md. at 309, 628 A.2d at 174 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">For a plaintiff to have his or her \u201cclaims\u201d considered separate claims for purposes of separate compensatory damage awards, the injuries must have arisen from separate, unique transactions; otherwise, the multiple \u201cclaims\u201d are essentially different legal theories premised on a single set of facts. Here, Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s multiple claims all arise from the same set of facts and, therefore, she would have been entitled to but one compensatory recovery. The gross negligence, battery, and Article 24 violation claims were but different legal theories under which a jury could have awarded compensatory damages. Consequentially, Ms. Holloway-Johnson received a complete compensatory damages award for the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">We turn next to the matter of punitive damages. The Court of Special Appeals analyzed correctly in this regard the lack of significance of the negligence and gross negligence claims. The elements of neither tort claim would support submission to a jury of a prayer for punitive damages. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992) \u201cheld that \u2018implied malice,\u2019 to wit, gross negligence, would not qualify as a predicate for punitive damages.\u201d <em>Holloway-Johnson, </em>220 Md.App. at 226-27, 103 A.3d at 739. We disagree, however, with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s reasoning that the claims for battery or the Article 24 violation could serve as a predicate for a punitive damage award, without actual proof of malice. Our appellate colleagues concluded that \u201cmalice implicit\u201d in the foundational elements of these two intentional torts would be sufficient to allow a jury to consider an award of punitive damages, even in the absence of additional proof of actual malice; we do not reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Punitive damages are reserved typically for punishing the most heinous of intentional torts and tortfeasors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Such damages are only \u201cawarded in an attempt to punish a defendant whose conduct is characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, or fraud, and to warn others contemplating similar conduct of the serious risk of monetary liability.\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 454, 601 A.2d at 650. We explained that \u201cnegligence alone, no matter how gross, wanton, or outrageous, will not satisfy [the] standard [of actual malice].\u201d <em>Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>379 Md. 249, 264, 841 A.2d 828, 837 (2004) (citing <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 463, 601 A.2d at 654). The evidence \u201cmust show malicious conduct and not simply ... negligence\u201d in order to justify an award of punitive damages. <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 465, 601 A.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Reliance on an embedded \u201cmalice implicit\u201d in the elements of the intentional torts of the battery and Article 24 violations claims pushes our jurisprudence on punitive damages too far. To support a claim for punitive damages, \u201cin <em>any </em>tort case[,] a plaintiff must establish by clear and convincing evidence the basis for an award of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 469, 601 A.2d at 657. In \u201ca non-intentional tort action, the trier of facts may not award punitive damages unless the plaintiff has established that the defendant\u2019s conduct was characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud, <em>i.e., </em>\u2018actual malice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 460, 601 A.2d at 652 (footnote omitted). We apply this same principle for intentional torts because, even if a plaintiff makes-out a <em>prima facie </em>case of an intentional tort by a preponderance of the evidence, a plaintiff must be able to show additionally, to a clear and convincing standard, that the tort was committed with \u201cactual malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">By implying that malice is embedded within proof (by a preponderance standard) of the elements of battery and an Article 24 violation, the Court of Special Appeals whistles by an important part of the actual malice requirement. A civil battery may be committed without actual malice. In those cases, adducing a <em>prima facie </em>case for battery would not support submitting a punitive damages prayer to the fact-finder. The intent required for proof of a battery claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201crequires not a specific desire to bring about a certain result, but rather a general intent to unlawfully invade another\u2019s physical well-being through a harmful or offensive contact or an apprehension of such a contact.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>355 Md. at 602-03, 735 A.2d at 1101. This does not equate implicitly or necessarily to actual malice, which requires more than the general intent necessary to prove a civil battery. It requires proof of a specific intent to injure the plaintiff. Because we have restricted punitive damage awards to cases where the conduct is \u201ccharacterized by knowing and deliberate wrongdoing,\u201d a standard of \u201cmalice implicit\u201d would expose inappropriately defendants to punitive damages without requiring a plaintiff to prove actual malice and the required specific intent to injure by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc., </em>379 Md. at 265, 841 A.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Article 24 claims may be established also without proving actual malice necessarily. We apply the Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard (see discussion <em>supra </em>at 15) when we evaluate a claim for a violation of Article 24. We \u201ctake the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene of the incident at issue and pay close attention to the particular facts of each case.\u201d <em>Okwa, </em>360 Md. at 204, 757 A.2d at 141. In a case involving a question of qualified immunity for State Police troopers, the Court of Special Appeals, relying on our decision in <em>Okwa, </em>stated that \u201ca police officer acting without malice may be liable for using excessive force in an arrest, in violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Tavakoli-Nouri v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 716, 734, 779 A.2d 992, 1003 (2001). Therefore, it is possible for an officer to be found in violation of Article 24 without proof of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Because \u201ca judge must not allow the jury to consider the issue of \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u201d unless the evidence of malice is clear and convincing, and it is possible for a civil battery and an Article 24 violation to be proven without showing malice necessarily, it would be improper for a trial court to imply routinely malice in these counts based purely on a determination that a <em>prima facie </em>case of each claim was established by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc., </em>379 Md. at 270, 841 A.2d at 841 (But, \u201cwhere a defendant commits a tort with \u2018actual malice,\u2019 a jury may award the plaintiff punitive damages\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Court of Special Appeals did not analyze the Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence for proof of actual malice because it concluded that malice was implicit in the elements of battery and for violation of Article 24. Because we determine that clear and convincing evidence of malice and the specific intent to injure must be adduced before a jury is allowed to consider an award of punitive damages, our examination of Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence leads us to conclude that Ms. Holloway-Johnson would not be entitled to have the question of an award of punitive damages submitted to the jury because she did not produce clear and convincing evidence of actual malice on the part of Officer Beall. Respondent argues that because Officer Beall admitted that he \u201cpursued\u201d the motorcycle onto the ramp, without exigent circumstances and at least 10 m.p.h. over the speed limit, in violation of the General Order and contrary to his Shift Commander\u2019s directive, an intent to injure was shown or was inferable. This evidence showed, however, only that Officer Beall\u2019s actions were intentional, not that the actions were malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Ms. Holloway-Johnson argues further that Officer Beall\u2019s admission that he saw Holloway-Lilliston\u2019s brake lights on the ramp before the collision occurred and Sergeant McGee\u2019s conclusion that Officer Beall did not apply his brakes were evidence of actual malice or, at the very least evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Officer Beall\u2019s consciousness of wrong-doing. The theme of consciousness of wrong-doing pervaded Respondents\u2019 oral arguments before us, based primarily on the false exculpatory statements made by Officer Beall involving his \u201ctheory\u201d of the collision. Officer Beall\u2019s various post-hoc accounts of how the collision occurred <em>(see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>fn. 6), and his radioed statement after the collision that he \u201cfound this guy up here,\u201d go undoubtedly to his credibility as a witness and his appreciation of his negligence. It would not allow, however, for a reasonable inference that these statements reflected Officer Beall\u2019s intent at the time of the collision. Respondents\u2019 reliance also on Officer Beall\u2019s failure to apply his brakes on the exit ramp (after seeing the motorcycle\u2019s brake lights) do not support an inference of actual malice because there was no evidence on the record to show that Officer Beall was aware of the speed differential between the two vehicles or that he intended to injure or harm Holloway-Lilliston by \u201cclosing the gap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">No evidence was produced by Ms. Holloway-Johnson to establish directly or by reasonable inference that Officer Beall was acting with malicious intent during the pursuit or that he had a specific intent \u2014 to harm Holloway-Lilliston on the exit ramp.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Based on the evidence before the Circuit Court, Officer Beall\u2019s conduct could have been regarded as reckless or grossly negligent, but not conduct undertaken with actual malice. Without evidence from which a reasonable jury could find or infer actual malice, even had the battery and Article 24 claims survived the close of Plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, Ms. Hollo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>way-Johnson would not be entitled to punitive damages and therefore a remand is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">III. Local Government Tort Claims Act (LGTCA)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">a. Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Ms. Holloway-Johnson contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in approving the trial court\u2019s application of the LGTCA\u2019s compensatory damages \u201ccap\u201d to the jury verdict regarding the negligence count because Officer Beall failed to raise timely application of the LGTCA. She contends that the LGTCA is an affirmative defense and therefore must be pled before a verdict is rendered. Officer Beall responds that the Court of Special Appeals held correctly that he could not waive his employer\u2019s protection under the LGTCA, because the LGTCA is not an affirmative defense, and that Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s arguments have no support in Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">b. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s question is one of legislative interpretation, a question of law. Consequentially, we accord no deference to the lower courts\u2019 decisions here. <em>White v. Pines Cmty. Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>403 Md. 13, 31, 939 A.2d 165, 175 (2008); <em>see Gebhardt &amp; Smith LLP v. Maryland Port Admin., </em>188 Md.App. 532, 564, 982 A.2d 876, 894 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">c. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The Court of Special Appeals provided an exhaustive analysis of the LGTCA. <em>See Holloway-Johnson, </em>220 Md.App. at 207-18, 103 A.3d at 727-34. We agree with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">As noted aptly by the intermediate appellate court, \u201cthe LGTCA was designed to provide a remedy for persons injured by local government employees, who often have limited resources from which an injured person might collect on a judgment.\u201d <em>Holloway-Johnson, </em>220 Md.App. at 212, 103 A.3d at 730-31. \u201cBaltimore City police officers enjoy an <em>indirect </em>statutory qualified immunity under LGTCA [but] do not pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>sess a direct immunity from liability for their tortious conduct under LGTCA. They may be sued, and judgments may be entered against them.\u201d <em>Smith v. Danielczyk, </em>400 Md. 98, 129-30, 928 A.2d 795, 814 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Because the LGTCA does not allow a plaintiff to bring suit directly against the local government, the suit is brought against the employee. Even so, \u201ca person may not execute against an employee on a judgment rendered for tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employment with a local government [unless] it is found that the employee acted with actual malice.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> CJP \u00a7 5-302(a)-(b). If the employee is found to have acted with actual malice, the employee is liable fully for any damages awarded in the suit. CJP \u00a7 5-302(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Of specific concern here, CJP \u00a7 5-301(d)(21) makes clear that, under the LGTCA, the Baltimore City Police Department (BCPD) is considered a local government entity and that \u201c[f]or purposes of tort law, however, it has been since 1997 a \u2018local government\u2019 and, as such, the tort liability of its employees is governed by the LGTCA.\u201d <em>Holloway-Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>220 Md.App. at 212, 103 A.3d at 730. Therefore, because the BCPD is covered by the LGTCA, the question of whether a waiver of the statute\u2019s protections occurred in this case must be answered. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that LGTCA protection could not be waived by Officer Beall because it was not his to waive. Because the evidence was not sufficient to prove that Officer Beall had acted with actual malice (and he was operating within the scope of his employment), the LGTCA cap applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">As discussed by the Court of Special Appeals, in a case such as we have here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">whether the judgment be for $10,000 or $10 million, an injured party may not collect so much as one penny from the employee directly, so long as the employee is acting without malice and within the scope of his employment. Although the judgment is nominally against the employee, it is as a practical matter frequently meaningless as applied against the employee. No action is required by the employee to protect himself, except to cooperate in the defense of the action. Even then, such action need consist only of explaining to the court that the judgment is subject to the LGTCA and that the plaintiff may not execute against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\"><em>Holloway-Johnson, </em>220 Md.App. at 213-14, 103 A.3d at 731. Because this case implicates clearly the LGTCA, Respondent is entitled only to collect up to the damages cap of $200,000<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> from the local government, the amount she received after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Circuit Court reduced the verdict awarded by the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even though we conclude that Ms. Holloway-Johnson\u2019s additional substantive claims perhaps should not have been withheld from the jury ordinarily, because the single injury-single recovery of compensatory damages were \u201ccapped\u201d by the LGTCA as to the award on her negligence claim and no additional damages would be available to her had the other counts been submitted to the jury, it serves no purpose to remand for a new trial. Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and remand with directions to reinstate the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY.

These statements go only to Officer Beall\u2019s general credibility because they do not bear directly on Officer Beall's intent at the time of the collision. As noted by Judge Cathell during oral argument before us, there is a difference between saying \"I know I\u2019ve done something wrong\u201d and \"I intended to do something wrong.\u201d This distinction was mentioned during a portion of oral argument addressing the false exculpatory statements made by Officer Beall after the collision. Although lying after the collision is not sufficient to establish that Officer Beall intended maliciously at the time to strike and kill HollowayLilliston, it does provide some insight into the Officer\u2019s state of mind right after the incident and his motivation to prevaricate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">.

It involves the burden of persuasion and not the burden of production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-9\"><em>Holloway-Johnson v. Beall, </em>220 Md.App. 195, 227, 103 A.3d 720, 739 (2014). This does not change, however, our decision because a plaintiff is still required to produce evidence of actual malice before any request for punitive damages should be presented to a jury for consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">. <em>Compare Heinze v. Murphy, </em>180 Md. 423, 432-33, 24 A.2d 917, 922 (1942) (holding that there was no evidence of malice because the police officer did not know the plaintiff, \u201cthere ever was any reason for ill will,\u201d and the officer \"conducted himself becomingly as an officer of the law endeavoring to do his duty as he understood it to be\u201d) <em>with French v. Hines, </em>182 Md.App. 201, 221, 957 A.2d 1000, 1011 (2008) (discussing the inconsistency of a jury award of punitive damages without a finding of actual malice, when presented with evidence that the plaintiff bent over to get her purse at a traffic stop (only to be faced with the officer's drawn gun), testimony that her head was slammed into the side of the truck, and that the \"handcuffs were deliberately too tight\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\">. Actual malice, for purposes of the LGTCA, is defined as \"ill will or improper motivation.\u201d Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl.VoL), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5 \u2014 301 (b) (\"CJP\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. The LGTCA acts to protect local government employees in multiple ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">If the action alleges that the conduct was within the scope of the defendant\u2019s employment, the local government must provide a legal defense for the employee. CJP \u00a7 5-302(a). In addition, unless the employee is found to have acted with actual malice, the plaintiff may not execute on a judgment recovered against the employee, CJP \u00a7 5-302(b), but, rather, subject to certain limits, the local government is liable on the judgment. That protection may be broader than the common law immunity in that it does not appear to exclude liability for intentional torts, so long as they were committed within the scope of employment and without actual malice. Because of the construct of LGTCA, however, the complaint ... is not subject to dismissal by reason of this indirect statutory immunity. That immunity will have relevance only if a judgment is entered against [the party protected by the LGTCA],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\"><em>Smith v.

As of 1 October 2015, CJP \u00a7 5-303(a) provides that \"the liability of a local government may not exceed $400,000 per an individual claim, and $800,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions, or liability arising under subsection (b) of this section and indemnification under subsection (c) of this section.\u201d At the time the verdict in this case was returned and the verdict reduced, the relevant amounts were $200,000 per individual claim and $500,000 per total claims, but the statute was no less clear. The most Respondent could receive was $200,000 under CJP \u00a7 5-303(a), which, regardless of our assessment of the error in not submitting to the jury the additional claims, would not have allowed her to recover duplicative compensatory damages, as feared by Petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\">.
