In <em>Douglas v. State, </em>we held that an order denying such a petition is appealable because it is a final judgment. 423 Md. 156, 170-71, 31 A.3d 250, 258-59 (2011). Today we resolve a question left open by the decision in <em>Douglas: </em>does an order <em>granting </em>such a petition constitute a final judgment, such that the State can appeal it directly? Because we conclude that the procedural context is materially different when a court grants a petition for writ of actual innocence, the order is not a final judgment, and the State cannot directly appeal it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Around noon on July 26, 1984, a man knocked on Phyllis Diacont\u2019s (\u201cDiacont\u201d) door and asked to use her phone after claiming that his car had broken down. Shortly after entering her home, the man raped, robbed, and shot Diacont. Diacont survived and later identified George Cameron Seward (\u201cSeward\u201d) as her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In 1985, before the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\u201cthe trial court\u201d), Louise Stamathis (\u201cStamathis\u201d) testified that Seward had worked at her dog grooming shop during the summer of the attack on Diacont. Because she was caring for her ill husband, however, Stamathis was unable to locate employment records and state whether Seward was at work the week of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The trial court found Seward guilty of first degree rape, first degree sex offense, assault with intent to murder, breaking and entering of a dwelling house, using a handgun in the commission of a felony, and robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. Diacont\u2019s testimony provided the only substantive evidence to identify Seward as her attacker. Seward received two consecutive life sentences plus 73 years. The trial court merged the additional counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Seward\u2019s convictions in an unreported opinion. This Court denied Seward\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Seward v. State, cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 406, 514 A.2d 24 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Between 1996 and 1997, Seward\u2019s postconviction attorney located Stamathis\u2019s employment records. After reviewing the records, Stamathis concluded it was \u201cimpossible\u201d that Seward could have left the dog grooming shop to attack Diacont.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In 1997, Seward filed a petition for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. He alleged that his trial attorney failed to properly present evidence for an alibi defense. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\u201cthe post-conviction court\u201d) denied Seward\u2019s petition in 1999. The postconviction court concluded that Seward\u2019s trial attorney acted reasonably in investigating Stamathis as an alibi witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The Court of Special Appeals denied Seward\u2019s application for leave to appeal the denial of postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">In 2009, the General Assembly enacted Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2015 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABg\">A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that crime may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">(2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Seward filed a petition for writ of actual innocence in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\u201cCircuit Court\u201d) in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">At the hearing on this petition, Stamathis testified, based on her employment records, that Seward was at work the day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the crime. Discussing her policy and procedures, she explained that her employees, including Seward, usually worked between eight o\u2019clock and four o\u2019clock, ate lunch at the shop, and did not leave during the day. Moreover, Stamathis testified that her employees could not leave without her opening the doors to the shop, which she kept locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The Circuit Court granted Seward a new trial in 2012. Based on Stamathis\u2019s employment records, the Circuit Court concluded that a substantial possibility existed that the result of Seward\u2019s trial could have been different. At trial, the State had relied \u201csolely\u201d on Diacont\u2019s identification of Seward as her attacker. The records showed that Seward \u201ccould not have been at the scene of the crime while the crime was occurring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The Circuit Court also concluded that the records could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331, i.e., that Seward\u2019s trial attorney had acted with \u201cdue diligence.\u201d After reviewing the postconviction court\u2019s analysis of Seward\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s performance, the Circuit Court refused to conclude that the attorney \u201ccould have done anything else to obtain\u201d the records. Finally, the Circuit Court decided that the records were newly discovered evidence \u2014 although Seward and the State knew the records existed during trial, the parties did not then know the records\u2019 exculpatory nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The State filed a notice of appeal, but Seward moved to dismiss, citing the State\u2019s limited authority to appeal as established by statute. In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals denied Seward\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the State can appeal an order granting a petition for writ of actual innocence. <em>State v. Seward, </em>220 Md.App. 1, 5, 102 A.3d 798, 801 (2014), <em>cert. granted, </em>441 Md. 666, 109 A.3d 665 (2015). On the merits of the State\u2019s appeal, the intermediate appellate court concluded that Seward\u2019s petition must be denied. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 102 A.3d at 813-14. It concluded that the Circuit Court erred by applying the wrong standard for due diligence. <em>Id. </em>at 17-18, 102 A.3d at 808. Rather than remand for further proceedings, the intermediate appellate court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>versed, reasoning that the records were not newly discovered evidence under a proper due diligence analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 102 A.3d at 812-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We granted Seward\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari on the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">1. In a case of alleged innocence, where the State concedes the new alibi evidence of innocence is \u201cmaterial,\u201d and the Circuit Court also held that \u201c[i]f the trial judge had known that the records existed that showed that the Petitioner could not have been at the scene of the crime while the crime was occurring, there is a substantial possibility that he would not have found the Petitioner guilty;\u201d (Ex. 2 at 4) can an appellate court rest a decision to reverse the granting of a Writ of Actual Innocence on the belief that trial counsel failed to investigate [ ] the alibi, without considering the evidence of all the things trial counsel actually did to locate the alibi evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">2. Does the State have the right to appeal a Circuit Court decision granting a Writ of Actual Innocence under Md.Code, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 8-301, in light of: (1) this Court\u2019s prior precedent in <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156[, 31 A.3d 250] (2011); and (2) the General Assembly\u2019s decision not to put any appellate right in the statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">3. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in mischaracterizing the record evidence and factual findings by the Circuit Court to the extent that the Court\u2019s decision rests on a misunderstanding of the record?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Because we answer no to the second question, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The right of appeal is entirely statutory in Maryland. <em>Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard Cnty., </em>371 Md. 243, 247, 808 A.2d 795, 797 (2002). Thus, we examine Maryland Code (1973, 2013 RepLVol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) to resolve a question of law \u2014 whether the State has a right to appeal an order granting a petition for writ of actual innocence under CP \u00a7 8-301. We do so without according deference to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Critical to each party\u2019s argument is <em>Douglas v. State, </em>in which we held that \u201ca denial of a petition for writ of actual innocence is a final judgment under [CJP] \u00a7 12-301.\u201d 423 Md. at 174, 31 A.3d at 261. Seward argues that the State cannot seek a direct appeal under CJP \u00a7 12-301 because, unlike in <em>Douglas, </em>there is no final judgment here. An order granting a petition for writ of actual innocence is merely an interlocutory order. Seward also relies on <em>Douglas </em>to argue that an action under CP \u00a7 8-301 is part of the underlying criminal case. Finally, he alleges that the legislative history of CP \u00a7 8-301 does not justify the State\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The State counters that it can directly appeal a decision in a CP \u00a7 8-301 case because the <em>Douglas </em>Court concluded that such a decision was a final judgment under CJP \u00a7 12-301. The State then argues that an action under CP \u00a7 8-301 is a civil proceeding, collateral to the criminal case, as is true of a postconviction or coram nobis proceeding. Notably, it emphasizes that CP \u00a7 8-301 appears under Title 8 of the Criminal Procedure Article: \u201cOther Postconviction Review.\u201d Finally, the State finds the legislative history of CP \u00a7 8-301 instructive in that the General Assembly deleted a proposed right to appeal from the text of CP \u00a7 8-301 because CJP \u00a7 12-301 already authorized that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u201cIt is an often stated principle of Maryland law that appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally authorized, is determined entirely by statute, and that, therefore, a right of appeal must be legislatively granted.\u201d <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Bd. of Supervisors of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 485, 693 A.2d 757, 761 (1997). Because the State tethers its right to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>directly to CJP \u00a7 12-301, we begin with the pertinent part of that statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">Except as provided in \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">It is our role \u201cto define and give content to the meaning of the term, \u2018final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Sigma Reprod. Health Ctr. v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 664, 467 A.2d 483, 485 (1983) (citations omitted). The State reads this statute as authorizing its appeal because the order entered by the Circuit Court was \u201ca final judgement.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The State construes <em>Douglas </em>as affirming that CJP \u00a7 12-301 applies \u201cin actual innocence cases.\u201d The State would have us read <em>Douglas </em>for the proposition that any decision in an actual innocence case constitutes a final judgment. But the State fails to confront a patent difference between <em>Douglas </em>and this case. Although we held that the Circuit Court\u2019s decision in <em>Douglas </em>was a final judgment under CJP \u00a7 12-301, the procedural context was materially different. The question in <em>Douglas </em>was whether \u201can order <em>denying </em>a petition for writ of actual innocence\u201d is a final judgment and, thus, \u201can automatically appealable order[.]\u201d 423 Md. at 164, 31 A.3d at 255 (emphasis added). As we have interpreted CJP \u00a7 12-301, a judgment granting a new trial and a judgment denying a new trial are not to be treated the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In <em>Douglas, </em>we defined a final judgment as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amr\">one that \u201ceither determine^] and concluded] the rights of the parties involved or den[ies] a party the means to \u2018prose-cut[e] or defend[] his or her rights and interests in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>subject matter of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d Important is whether \u201cany further order is to be issued or whether any further action is to be taken in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 171, 81 A.3d at 259 (citations omitted). An interlocutory order, on the other hand, exists when \u201c \u2018there are pending proceedings in which issues on the merits of the case remain to be decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 31 A.3d at 260 (citation omitted). Moreover, the purpose of CJP \u00a7 12-301 is to permit appeals only from final judgments \u201cto \u2018prevent piecemeal appeals and ... the interruption of ongoing judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>31 A.3d at 259 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We concluded in <em>Douglas </em>that an order denying a petition for a writ of actual innocence was final because the order \u201cconclude[d] a petitioner\u2019s rights as to all claims based on the newly discovered evidence alleged in the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 31 A.3d at 259. \u201c[N]othing remains pending in the case\u201d when the circuit court denies such a petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We grounded our conclusion in the statutory requirements of CP \u00a7 8-301. One element of the statute \u201crequires the petitioner to \u2018distinguish the newly discovered evidence claimed ... from any claims made in prior petitions.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>(quoting CP \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b)(5)). When an order denies a petition based on allegedly newly discovered evidence, the petitioner can never refile \u201con the basis of the same [ ] evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 31 A.3d at 259. The order, then, prohibits the petitioner from further \u201c \u2018prosecuting] or defending] his ... rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 31 A.3d at 259. (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>Douglas </em>teaches that an order denying a petition is final because the order forecloses the right to raise a claim of actual innocence based on a particular piece of evidence. Once a circuit court denies the petition regarding that evidence, no \u201cfurther action is to be taken in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In direct contrast, the Circuit Court\u2019s order here does not prohibit the State from further prosecuting and defending its rights and interests in the newly discovered evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Because the Circuit Court granted Seward a new trial, the State may exercise its right to prosecute Seward at that trial and attack the newly discovered evidence. See <em>id. </em>Indisputably, \u201c \u2018further action is to be taken in th[is] case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s order put in motion proceedings to resolve \u201c \u2018issues on the merits of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 31 A.3d at 260 (citation omitted). Following the order, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County summoned Seward for his new trial. In effect, the Circuit Court\u2019s order \u201c[has kept] the parties in court to litigate the claims remaining between them.\u201d <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Servs., LLC, </em>412 Md. 555, 571-72, 989 A.2d 210, 219-20 (2010) (An order denying a motion to compel arbitration \u201cis not final\u201d because the order \u201ceffectively keeps the parties in court to litigate the claims remaining between them\u201d rather than putting them out of court.). To permit the State to appeal this order subverts the purpose of CJP \u00a7 12-301: \u201c \u2018to prevent piecemeal appeals and ... the interruption of ongoing judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 172, 31 A.3d at 259 (citation omitted). The Circuit Court\u2019s order is thus interlocutory and not appealable until after entry of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Indeed, we have previously held that an order granting a motion for a new trial is not a final judgment, and thus, not immediately appealable. <em>Snyder v. Cearfoss, </em>186 Md. 360, 366-67, 46 A.2d 607, 609-10 (1946), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, Inc., </em>328 Md. 51, 54-57, 612 A.2d 1294, 1296-97 (1992). Addressing an appeal of the grant of a new trial, we explained: \u201cIt is generally recognized that the effect of granting a motion for a new trial is to leave the cause in the same condition as if no previous trial had been held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 46 A.2d at 610. Hence, we concluded that there was \u201cno final judgment\u201d and granted the motion to dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.; see also Dean v. State, </em>302 Md. 493, 499, 489 A.2d 22, 25 (1985) (\u201cIt is clear that the order [granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial] from which the State sought to appeal in this case was not an appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>final order .... \u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 547, 873 A.2d 1122, 1140 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The State\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Dean, </em>made at oral argument, were unavailing. The State pointed out that Dean was not yet sentenced at the time he moved for a new trial, whereas Seward was sentenced years ago. But as discussed <em>supra, </em>what concerns us for purposes of finality is not the date of sentencing, but rather whether \u201cthere are pending proceedings in which issues on the merits of the case remain to be decided.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 172, 31 A.3d at 260 (citation omitted). The Circuit Court\u2019s order certainly leaves \u201cthe merits of the case ... to be decided.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Rather than confront these precedents, the State would have us focus on the question of whether CP \u00a7 8-301 is part of the underlying criminal case or is a collateral, civil proceeding. But that distinction is unhelpful. CJP \u00a7 12-301 provides a right of appeal \u201cin a civil <em>or </em>criminal case.\u201d (emphasis added). The appeal must, however, be \u201cfrom a final judgment.\u201d CJP \u00a7 12-301. We have already answered that question. The Circuit Court\u2019s order is not a final judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In its closing volley, the State argues that the General Assembly failed to include a right to appeal for either the petitioner or the State from CP \u00a7 8-801 because that right already lies in CJP \u00a7 12-301. This argument, however, presumes that the right of appeal in CJP \u00a7 12-301 is available to the State. It is not. The State has again misunderstood <em>Douglas. </em>In <em>Douglas </em>we said it \u201cwould be redundant\u201d for CP \u00a7 8-301 to have \u201cexplicit language\u201d that \u201cauthorizes the right of appeal from a final judgment.\u201d 423 Md. at 173, 31 A.3d at 260. The redundancy, however, followed from our conclusion that the <em>denial </em>of a petition for writ of actual innocence was a final judgment, and thus, within the scope of CJP \u00a7 12-301. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 31 A.3d at 259. Legislative history had nothing to do with that conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 173, 31 A.3d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Finally, we recognize that our decision serves a legitimate interest that CP \u00a7 8-301 advances. Prior to the enactment of CP \u00a7 8-301, the Office of the Public Defender (\u201cOPD\u201d) explained in a 2009 joint report: \u201cOnce convicted, a defendant faces almost insurmountable obstacles to obtaining relief on the grounds that he, in fact, did not commit the crime alleged.\u201d Governor\u2019s Office of Crime Control and Prevention &amp; Office of the Public Defender, Barriers to Post Conviction Review 7 (2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among other things, OPD discussed time limitations in Md. Rule 4-331, <em>id. </em>at 8, a rule which CP \u00a7 8-301 expands, <em>see </em>Fiscal and Policy Note Revised, S. 486.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A direct appeal by the State delays and therefore obstructs the interest in relief that CP \u00a7 8-301 can provide in the form of a new trial as an incarcerated individual must wait, sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>years, pending appeals, before realizing the fruits of that relief. <em>See Harris v. David S. Harris, P.A., </em>310 Md. 310, 314-15, 529 A.2d 356, 358 (1987) (The requirement of a final judgment \u201cprevents] piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions which do not terminate the litigation,\u201d and which would otherwise \u201crepeatedly interrupt and delay lower court proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Because the State had no right to appeal the Circuit Court\u2019s order granting Seward a petition for writ of actual innocence, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO GRANT THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE NOTICE OF APPEAL AND TO REINSTATE THE ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY GRANTING THE NEW TRIAL. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\">. The State aptly avoids grounding its argument in the text of Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.VoL, 2015 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\u201d) because, as we said in <em>Douglas v. State, </em>\"[CP] \u00a7 8-301 is silent with regard to a right of appeal.\u201d 423 Md. 156, 170, 31 A.3d 250, 258 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">. We are similarly unpersuaded by the State\u2019s secondary argument that the State's appeal in <em>Dean </em>was from a single trial judge to a court sitting in banc. As we said, \"[t]here [was] no different standard\u201d for appealability \u201cto a court in banc from that to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d <em>Dean v. State, </em>302 Md. 493, 497, 489 A.2d 22, 24 (1985), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 547, 873 A.2d 1122, 1140 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">. The State says that a CP \u00a7 8-301 proceeding is like a postconviction or coram nobis proceeding. But because the right of appeal is entirely statutory in Maryland, <em>Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard Cnty., </em>371 Md. 243, 247, 808 A.2d 795, 797 (2002), the State\u2019s argument misses the mark. The statutes creating these proceedings are different. The General Assembly has provided an appeal process in postconviction cases. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 7-109. Maryland Rule 15-1207 also states that an order on a petition for writ of error coram nobis is a final judgment. Thus, a right of appeal is available to the State via Maryland Code (1973, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). <em>See Skok </em>v. <em>State, </em>361 Md. 52, 65, 760 A.2d 647, 654 (2000) (\u201cAs a coram nobis case is an independent civil action, an appeal from a final judgment in such an action is authorized by the broad language of [CJP \u00a7 12-301].\u201d). By contrast, CP \u00a7 8-301 is silent on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">. The joint report was required as part of the 2008 amendments to CP \u00a7 8-201. <em>See </em>S.B. 211, 2008 Gen. Assemb. Reg. Sess.
