Specifically, here, we decide whether, in the absence of direct evidence that a property contained lead-based paint, there was sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence produced by a plaintiff, who alleged that she was injured as a child by lead-based paint at a property that the defendant owned and managed, to survive the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, such that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor as to the plaintiffs negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor as to the plaintiffs negligence claim where, even without direct evidence that the subject property contained lead-based paint and without expert testimony as to the source of the plaintiffs lead exposure, there was sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the subject property contained lead-based paint; and, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude that the subject property was a reasonable probable source of the plaintiffs lead exposure, and that there were no other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AHR\">The Residential History</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Myishia Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), Respondent, alleges that she suffered lead-based paint poisoning while residing at 1622 East Oliver Street (\u201cthe Oliver Street Property\u201d) from approximately 1991 to 1993. At various times during the first years of her life, Smith also resided at 418 South Monroe Street (\u201cthe Monroe Street Property\u201d) and 1508 North Collington Avenue (\u201cthe Collington Avenue Property\u201d), and visited 2017 Ashland Avenue (\u201cthe Ashland Avenue Property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">On October 21,1991, Smith was born. According to Smith\u2019s mother, Doris Plater (\u201cPlater\u201d), Smith lived at the Monroe Street Property from her birth until Spring 1992. At her deposition, Plater testified that the Monroe Street Property was in \u201c[g]ood condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>No later than Spring 1992, Plater and Smith moved from the Monroe Street Property to the Oliver Street Property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, Rowhouses, Inc. (\u201cRowhouses\u201d), Petitioner, owned and managed the Oliver Street Property. According to Plater, approximately \u201cthree to four months\u201d after she and Smith moved into the Oliver Street Property, she noticed that the paint on the \u201c[w]indowsills, the banister[, and the] baseboards\u201d \u201cstarted chipping and peeling[.]\u201d Plater also noticed dust on the floor. During the time that Plater and Smith lived at the Oliver Street Property, Smith began to walk at age ten months, and Plater testified that Smith spent time in areas in the house near deteriorated paint and that she observed Smith put her hands in her mouth while living in the Oliver Street Property. Indeed, according to Plater, Smith put her hands in mouth \u201cthree or four times out of a day.\u201d Smith spent most of her time at the Oliver Street Property, and did not attend daycare and was not babysat at any other address while residing at the Oliver Street Property. In Spring 1993, Plater and Smith moved from the Oliver Street Property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the Collington Avenue Property, where they resided until Spring 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">While Smith resided at the Monroe Street Property, the Oliver Street Property, and the Collington Avenue Property, Plater took Smith to visit her grandmother at the Ashland Avenue Property \u201c[e]very week\u201d for approximately \u201c[t]wo, three hours.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plater never observed any chipping, flaking, or peeling paint at the Ashland Avenue Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Smith\u2019s blood-lead levels were tested on three occasions between 1992 and 1993 \u2014 September 25, 1992, May 28, 1993, and September 21, 1993. On September 25, 1992, while Smith was residing at the Oliver Street Property, Smith\u2019s blood-lead level was reported as 11 micrograms per deciliter (pug/dL); on May 28, 1993, Smith\u2019s blood-lead level was reported as 7 gg/dL;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and on September 21, 1993, while Smith was residing at the Collington Avenue Property, Smith\u2019s blood-lead level was reported as 15 (jug/dL.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">On October 24, 2011, Smith filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) a complaint and demand for jury trial against Rowhouses and the Collington Avenue Property\u2019s owner for negligence and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act arising out of Smith\u2019s alleged exposure to lead-based paint at the Oliver Street Property and the Collington Avenue Property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By the time that Smith filed the complaint, the Oliver Street Property had been demolished and thus could not be tested for lead-based paint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Moreover, before being razed, the Oliver Street Property had not been tested for lead-based paint, and there were no violation notices issued for lead-based paint hazards. In other words, there was no direct evidence that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The parties engaged in discovery and identified expert witnesses. Smith designated Robert K. Simon, Ph.D. (\u201cDr. Simon\u201d), as an expert in \u201ctoxicology, lead risk assessment^] and industrial hygiene.\u201d On October 11, 2013, Dr. Simon prepared a report evaluating whether certain properties \u201cwere substantial contributing sources of lead exposure during [Smith\u2019s] early childhood.\u201d As to the Oliver Street Property, Dr. Simon stated that \u201cdeed records showed that the [Oliver Street Property] was built most likely in the early 1900s or before[,]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he age of th[e] house would presume the presence of lead[-]based paint[.]\u201d Dr. Simon concluded that \u201cit was more likely than not that [the Oliver Street Property] contained lead[-]based paint hazards during [Smith]\u2019s residency.\u201d Dr. Simon noted that the information that had been provided to him indicated the presence of \u201cdeteriorated paint\u201d at the Oliver Street Property while Smith resided there. In the report, Dr. Simon opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">It is my opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific probability that [S]mith was initially exposed to lead[-]based paint hazards during her residency at [the Oliver Street Property] from some months to about 2 years. She then continued to be exposed to lead[-]based paint hazards when she lived at [the Collington Avenue Property] from age 2 to 3 years.... It is my opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific probability that [the Oliver Street Property] and [the Collington Avenue Property] were both substantial, contributing sources for her lead exposure, elevated blood[-]lead levels [ ] and lead poisoning during [ ] Smith\u2019s early childhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">(Paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">On April 30, 2014, in response to supplemental documents that had been provided to him, Dr. Simon sent a letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Smith\u2019s counsel. In the letter, Dr. Simon noted that Plater had provided the following information at her deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB9\">[Plater] reported on deteriorated paint at [the Oliver Street Property] that was similar to the information [that was previously] provided[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">[Plater] did not report deteriorated paint at other [ ] childhood residences[ of Smith\u2019s].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">[Plater] reported that [Smith] visited ... [the Ashland Avenue Property] for several hours each week during her early childhood. [Plater] reported that this location did not have deteriorated paint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">[Plater] reported that [Smith] did not visit parks, playgrounds or attend daycare during her early childhood. [Plater] reported that she [ ] provided child care for [Smith] at their residences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">According to Dr. Simon, review of this supplemental information did not necessitate any change to his October 11, 2013 report, in which he opined that the Oliver Street Property was a substantial contributing source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">On May 5, 2014, Dr. Simon was deposed. At his deposition, the following exchange occurred as to potential sources of lead exposure during Smith\u2019s early childhood:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">[ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] As we sit here today[,] do you have an opinion as to whether or not [the Monroe Street Property] was a source of lead ingested by [Smith]? [DR. SIMON:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">[ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] And what is your opinion, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">[DR. SIMON:] Most likely not for two reasons. First of all, I have no blood[-]lead data indicating an exposure at that location. Number two, [Smith] really lived there approximately six months, so [Smith] is out of that location before [she]\u2019s really crawling, walking, moving around to get into any kind of lead risk. By eleven months we\u2019re at [the Oliver Street Property]. So again I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any data that would indicate to me that there was a problem of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>potential exposure at [the Monroe Street Property], I can\u2019t say absolutely there couldn\u2019t have been, but I don\u2019t see any information that would indicate that it was likely to have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">[ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] And just for my clarification purposes, you\u2019re basing that opinion on because you did not see any blood[-]lead testing data that would indicate [the Monroe Street Property] as a record address as part of your basis. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">[DR. SIMON:] That\u2019s part of it. And she was born October 21st, 1991. By the spring of 1992 they had moved to [the Oliver Street Property]. She\u2019s five or six months old. Normally until the child is crawling around and can get into stuff on their own, they\u2019re sitting in various restrainer type of chairs or cribs or whatever, and normally they\u2019re not going to be at high risk of being exposed at that young age. So for both of those reasons I would say more likely than not she wasn\u2019t exposed at [the Monroe Street Property]. [ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] Doctor, have you been furnished with any records at all for [the Ashland Avenue Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">[DR. SIMON:] [The Ashland Avenue Property]? No. Originally I knew nothing about that location until I read [Plater]\u2019s deposition that that was apparently the residence of the maternal grandmother for a number of years and that [Smith] had visited there during her early childhood, but I know nothing about [the Ashland Avenue Property] other than that [Plater] made the comment that there was no deteriorated paint. Other than that, I have no information about that address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">[ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] Do you have an opinion as to whether or not [the Ashland Avenue Property] was a source of lead ingested by [Smith]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">[DR. SIMON:] No, because I have no data on it. I couldn\u2019t rule it in, and I couldn\u2019t rule it out at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az0S\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Dr. Simon was also questioned about the significance of the age of a property, and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>[ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] Doctor, you mentioned that you presume that a property contains lead-based paint or contains lead based on its age, particularly if it is built before 1950, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">[DR. SIMON:] Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">[ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] If we take away the age of the property in this case, are you able to make a determination or an opinion that there was lead in the property without having any information about the age if we didn\u2019t know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">[DR. SIMON:] I don\u2019t know the answer to that question because if you\u2019re taking the age away, then what do I know about the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">[ROWHOUSES\u2019S COUNSEL:] Assuming you have all the other information that you have here today, if you didn\u2019t know the age of the property, would you then be able to opine that there was lead or lead-based paint hazards inside [the Oliver Street Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">[DR. SIMON:] No. If the house was built in 2014, then I wouldn\u2019t assume it had lead-based paint hazards. So again the age of the property has to be one where we\u2019re going to have used lead-based paint. In Baltimore we\u2019ve already said no interior paint after 1966, no exterior paint after the federal banning in 1978. So yeah, if the house was built after 1978, then more likely than not it didn\u2019t contain lead-based paint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">On cross-examination by Smith\u2019s counsel, when asked whether \u201cage of the property was a consideration but not the only consideration that le[ ]d [him] to [his] opinions with regard to\u201d the Oliver Street Property, Dr. Simon responded: \u201cCorrect. It\u2019s one of the considerations or parameters that you review in coming to this type of assessment as to whether there w[ere] lead-based paint hazards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Dr. Simon opined that the Oliver Street Property was a \u201csubstantial contributing source[ ]\u201d of Smith\u2019s lead exposure. Dr. Simon testified that he based this opinion on the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the Oliver Street Property, Plater\u2019s \u201ctestimony about deteriorated paint[,]\u201d and Smith\u2019s elevated blood-lead levels, age, and \u201chand to mouth activity\u201d while she was residing at the Oliver Street Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Smith designated Vera B. Brown, MD (\u201cDr. Brown\u201d), a pediatrician, as a medical expert. On November 18, 2013, Dr. Brown prepared a report in which she opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">Smith was exposed to flaking and peeling paint at [the Oliver Street Property] and [the Collington Avenue Property], This exposure took place during the first 2 years of her life when her developing brain would have been most susceptible to the effects of lead. This caused loss of IQ and cognitive deficits as well as neuropsychological abnormalities all attributable to lead exposure and resulting brain damage. Records show consistently elevated (by today\u2019s standards) of [blood-]lead [levels] until at least 6 years old. [ ] Smith was therefore injured as a result of lead exposure. She had numerous absences[,] which are common in lead[-]exposed children. She had difficulty learning and eventually quit school. These injuries are permanent and will likely lead to loss of income and inability to properly care for her child. The exposure to lead at a critical time in her life is an extremely important cause of these injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">On May 29, 2014, Rowhouses filed a motion for summary judgment and memorandum in support, arguing that Dr. Simon lacked an adequate factual basis for his opinion that the Oliver Street Property was a source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure, that Dr. Simon should be precluded from offering his opinion, and that Smith had failed to produce other evidence showing that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint. Rowhouses asserted that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because, absent \u201ccredible evidence that [Smith] ingested any lead from\u201d the Oliver Street Property, Smith could not \u201cmeet her burden of proof regarding causation[,]\u201d <em>ie., </em>to show that the Oliver Street Property was a substantial contributing factor to her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>On June 12, 2014, Smith filed a motion to strike the motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, an opposition to the motion for summary judgment. Smith contended that the motion for summary judgment was filed almost two months after the dispositive motions deadline established by the circuit court\u2019s scheduling order and that the motion should have been stricken for that reason. Alternatively, Smith argued a genuine dispute of material fact precluded the grant of summary judgment. Smith attached to the opposition an affidavit in which Plater averred, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">[Smith] and I lived at [the Oliver Street Property] from approximately 1991 to approximately 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">[Smith] spent almost all of her time at [the Oliver Street Property] when we lived there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">[Smith] occasionally visited her grandmother at [the Ash-land Avenue Property] when we lived at [the Oliver Street Property]. When [Smith] visited [the Ashland Avenue Property], I never saw chipping, peeling or flaking paint at th[e] property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">[Smith] had no contact with old battery casings, lead figures, painted toys, plastic jewelry, naval paint, bullets, fishing weights, ceramic pottery, folk medicine[,] or any other source of lead to my knowledge when she had elevated blood[-]lead levels while we resided at [the Oliver Street Property].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">On June 26, 2014 \u2014 six days after this Court issued <em>Hamilton v. Kirson, </em>439 Md. 501, 96 A.3d 714 (2014) \u2014 Smith filed a supplement to the opposition to which she attached various exhibits, including: (1) printouts from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation for properties near the Oliver Street Property \u2014 1623, 1624, 1626, 1628, and 2324 East Oliver Street \u2014 showing that the properties were built in either 1914 or 1915; (2) records from the Baltimore City Health Department Lead Paint Poisoning Prevention Program showing that properties on East Oliver Street had been issued numerous lead-based paint violation notices over the years; (3) an \u201cEmergency Violation Notice and Order to Remove Lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Nuisance\u201d issued on August 11, 1987, by the Baltimore City Health Department for 1620 East Oliver Street \u2014 the row house immediately next door to the Oliver Street Property\u2014 noting the presence of lead-based paint on twenty-six interior surfaces and five exterior surfaces; (4) a second \u201cEmergency Violation Notice and Order to Remove Lead Nuisance\u201d issued on January 6, 1988 for 1620 East Oliver Street noting the presence of lead-based paint on ten interior surfaces; and (5) a \u201cLead-based Paint Survey Report\u201d prepared by Arc Environmental, Inc. for 2324 East Oliver Street noting the presence of lead-based paint on twelve interior surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On June 27, 2014, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motion for summary judgment. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment, orally ruling from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">I looked closely at [Dr.] Simon[\u2019s] reports----[F]or [the Oliver Street Property], Dr. Simon said that the age of this house would presume the presence of lead-based paint according to Maryland regulations. And [Smith\u2019s] information and the blood-lead levels would indicate that deteriorated paint at this property during [Smith]\u2019s residency in 1991 to 1993, age a few months to two years, led him to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that this house contained lead-based paint hazards during [her] residency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">I am compelled by <em>[Hamilton, </em>439 Md. 501, 96 A.3d 714,] to find that that\u2019s not enough....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">An expert may ... extrapolate from data and facts contained in others\u2019 reports and studies in order to form his [or her] expert opinion. Facts upon which an expert bases his [or her] opinion must ... permit reasonably accurate conclusions as distinguished from mere conjecture and guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">... I cannot let this case go to a jury based on the presumption that the age of the house provides, [that the Oliver Street Property is] a source of lead exposure in this case. That\u2019s all [Smith] ha[s] at the current time in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>case. And I\u2019m compelled to grant the motion for summary-judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Immediately thereafter, Smith\u2019s counsel asked the circuit court whether it was \u201cfinding that [the] Ashland Avenue [Property] was a reasonable probable source as well ... [b]ecause under that scenario, there is no other ... property but\u201d the Oliver Street Property. In response, the circuit court stated: \u201cI have and I cannot get past the speculative ... nature ... as to the address. I simply don\u2019t think I have a choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">On June 30, 2014, the circuit court issued an order that was consistent with its oral ruling, denying the motion to strike the motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in favor of Rowhouses as to both negligence and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Smith appealed, and in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to negligence, affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment in all other respects, and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Smith v. Rowhouses, Inc., </em>223 Md.App. 658, 669, 117 A.3d 622, 628 (2015). The Court of Special Appeals held that there was sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence to show the presence of lead-based paint at the Oliver Street Property while Smith was residing there, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">The evidence on the summary judgment record, when viewed in the light most favorable to Smith, showed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>there was admissible evidence to prove the following facts: (1) from not long after her birth and for the next year, Smith spent the majority of her time at the Oliver Street Property, which contained peeling, chipping, and flaking interior paint; (2) the Monroe Street Property, where Smith lived before moving to the Oliver Street Property, was in \u201c[gjood condition,\u201d meaning that it did not have the peeling, chipping, or flaking interior paint that later was seen at the Oliver Street Property; (3) the Ashland Avenue Property, which Smith visited frequently, did not have peeling, chipping, or flaking interior paint; (4) while living at the Oliver Street Property, Smith often was seen with her hands on interior areas that had peeling, chipping, and flaking paint and then with her hands in her mouth; (5) Smith had her first elevated blood-lead level when she was living at the Oliver Street Property; (6) Smith did not have contact with any other known source of exposure to lead at that time; and (7) the Oliver Street Property was built before 1950.... [Tjhis evidence could support a reasonable inference by the trier-of-fact that the Oliver Street Property was the only <em>reasonably probable </em>source of the lead to which Smith was exposed before she first tested positive for lead on September 25, 1992. Because there was adequate circumstantial evidence on the summary judgment record to show the presence of lead-based paint in the Oliver Street Property when Smith was living there, summary judgment should not have been granted in favor of [Rowhouses] on the negligence count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 668-69, 117 A.3d at 627-28 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Rowhouses petitioned for a \u25a0writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Rowhouses v. Smith, </em>445 Md. 19, 123 A.3d 1005 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Rowhouses contends that the circuit court was correct in granting summary judgment in its favor because the circumstantial evidence presented by Smith was insufficient to show both that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and that Smith ingested lead-based paint at the Oliver Street Property. Stated otherwise, Rowhouses argues that the circumstantial evidence that Smith produced was legally insufficient to prove proximate cause, an element of negligence. According to Rowhouses, where a plaintiff does not present direct evidence of lead-based paint at a subject property and instead relies on circumstantial evidence, that circumstantial evidence \u201cmust be sufficient to establish a reasonable likelihood or probability, not just a possibility, of exposure to and ingestion of lead at the subject property.\u201d (Citation omitted). Rowhouses notes that, where there are multiple possible exposures to lead and no direct evidence of lead-based paint, a plaintiff must rule out other reasonably probable sources to demonstrate that it was reasonably probable that the subject property contained lead-based paint. Rowhouses maintains that Smith failed to eliminate other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure, namely, the Monroe Street Property and the Ashland Avenue Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Smith responds that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment by not considering the totality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>evidence and by ruling that the only evidence that she had produced to support the existence of lead-based paint at the Oliver Street Property was the age of the house. Smith contends that she produced sufficient circumstantial evidence, to a \u201creasonable likelihood or probability, and not a mere possibility!,]\u201d demonstrating that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint that caused her injury. Smith points out that a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case needs only to produce sufficient circumstantial evidence to rule out other reasonably probable sources \u2014 as opposed to all possible sources \u2014 of lead exposure. Stated otherwise, Smith observes that a plaintiff is not required to eliminate or rule out every possible source of lead exposure, and instead is required only to produce evidence from which a trier of fact could eliminate all reasonably probable identified sources of lead exposure, aside from the subject property. Smith asserts that, based on the totality of the evidence presented in this case, a trier of fact could conclude that the other properties in which she resided or visited were not reasonably probable sources of her lead exposure and that the Oliver Street Property was the only reasonably probable source of her lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In a reply brief, Rowhouses contends that the circumstantial evidence presented by Smith does not rise above the level of speculation and conjecture, and that Plater\u2019s \u201cself-serving testimony\u201d that properties other than the Oliver Street Property were in good <em>condition </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>did not contain deteriorated paint \u2014 \u201ccannot be enough to both establish the existence of lead-based paint at one property and rule it out at another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">A trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [ ] the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md.

The most familiar method today is through the opinion of [an] expert who states that, based on facts in evidence, X was the efficient cause of the injury. Such opinion testimony is not always required, and the plaintiff produces legally sufficient proof to get to the jury once he [or she] shows [that] it is more probable than not that [the] defendant\u2019s act caused his [or her] injury. This does not mean [that the] plaintiff is required to exclude every other possible cause of the accident.

L &amp; R Props., Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 67, 796 A.2d 139 (2002). In <em>Dow, id. </em>at 68-69, 76, 796 A.2d at 140, 144, the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, a rental property management company, where there was circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact could infer the presence of lead-based paint at the subject property and that the subject property was the \u201conly possible source\u201d of the child\u2019s lead exposure. In <em>Dow, id. </em>at 69, 796 A.2d at 140, the plaintiffs alleged that the child lived at the subject property, which contained chipping and flaking lead-based paint, which caused the child\u2019s injury when she ate paint chips. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that there was no evidence of lead-based paint at the subject property, and pointing out that the plaintiffs had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>designated an expert to testify that lead-based paint existed at the subject property and had not tested for lead-based paint in the subject property\u2019s interior. <em>See id. </em>at 70, 796 A.2d at 140-41. The plaintiffs responded by presenting evidence that the subject property had been built in 1935, and contending that there was a statutory presumption that houses that were built before 1950 contained lead-based paint. <em>See id. </em>at 70, 796 A.2d at 141. The plaintiffs further argued that they had lived in the subject property while it contained chipping and peeling paint, and that the child had had a habit of placing her hands and fingers in her mouth and playing at or near areas of chipping and peeling paint. <em>See id. </em>at 70-71, 796 A.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Later in the litigation, the child\u2019s mother filed an affidavit in which she averred that the child had lived at the subject property from age two months to almost five years, and that the child had not lived at any other residence or visited or spent nights at any other residence during that time period. <em>See id. </em>at 71, 796 A.2d at 141-42. The mother further averred that she saw the child place paint chips from the interior of the subject property into her mouth. <em>See id. </em>at 71-72, 796 A.2d at 142. According to the mother, the child did not have contact with other items that were known to contain lead, such as old battery casings, naval paint, or fishing weights, and the child did not play outside in the dirt while they resided at the subject property. <em>See id. </em>at 72, 796 A.2d at 142. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, and observed that the subject property had never been tested for lead-based paint, nor had a violation notice addressing the issue of lead-based paint ever been issued for the subject property. <em>See id. </em>at 72, 796 A.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs conceded that there was no direct evidence of lead-based paint at the subject property, but argued that they had presented sufficient circumstantial evidence that the paint at the subject property was lead-based paint. <em>See id. </em>at 73-74, 796 A.2d at 143. The Court of Special Appeals agreed and held that, \u201c[vjiewing the circumstantial evidence and the inferences that could be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to [the plaintiffs] as the non-moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>party, [the Court was] satisfied that [the plaintiffs] could properly establish that the paint in question was lead[-]based and thus caused [the child]\u2019s alleged injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74-75, 796 A.2d at 143. As to circumstantial evidence of causation, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">There is no requirement that, in a negligence suit, the matter of causation ... be prove[n] by direct and positive proof to an absolute certainty. Circumstantial evidence may support a negligence determination if it amounts to a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility. Indeed, Maryland has gone almost as far as any jurisdiction that we know of in holding that meager evidence of negligence is sufficient to carry the case to the jury.... Of course, causation evidence that is wholly speculative is not sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 75, 796 A.2d at 143-44 (citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted) (ellipses in original). Turning to the case before it, the Court of Special Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">If believed, the evidence offered by [the plaintiffs] in opposition to the motion for summary judgment could establish that the chipping and peeling paint inside [the subject property] was the only possible source of [the childj\u2019s lead poisoning. [The mother\u2019s affidavit indicates that [the child] did not spend time anywhere else and was never exposed to any other sources of lead. That, coupled with the undisputed fact that homes [that were] built before 1950 often contain lead-based paint, could indeed support an inference that the paint in question contained lead.

Here, the evidence is inconclusive as to the source of [the plaintiff\u2019s lead exposure. It is entirely possible from the evidence presented that [the plaintiff was exposed to lead-based paint at [another property] and not at [the subject property].

In <em>West, id. </em>at 166, 66 A.3d at 1146, there was no direct evidence of lead-based paint at the defendants\u2019 property because no tests for lead-based paint had ever been conducted, and the defendants\u2019 property had been razed. Accordingly, the plaintiffs case rested on the following circumstantial evidence: (1) from birth to age six, the plaintiff \u201ceither resided or spent substantial amounts of time at a variety of different residences[,]\u201d including the defendants\u2019 property and three other properties; (2) three blood-lead level tests in 1990 and 1991, which listed the defendants\u2019 property as the plaintiffs address, showed that the plaintiff had an elevated blood-lead level; (3) three blood-lead level tests in 1992, which listed another property as the plaintiffs address, showed that the plaintiff had an elevated blood-lead level; (4) at her deposition, the plaintiffs mother initially testified that she lived at yet another address when the plaintiff was born, and that the plaintiff lived at that address, but later testified that the plaintiff lived with his grandparents at the defendants\u2019 property immediately after birth; (5) for the first eleven months of the plaintiffs life, the defendants were not yet the owners of the defendants\u2019 property; (6) the plaintiffs mother testified that, although she lived at various other properties, she provided her parents\u2019 address (the defendants\u2019 property) instead of her own when seeking medical treatment; and (7) a report from Kennedy Krieger Institute stated that the plaintiff resided with his mother until he was five years old, \u201ceffectively excluding the defendants\u2019 property] as a place of residence, for[,] by the time that [the plaintiff] was five[,] his grandpar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ents had moved away from\u201d the defendants\u2019 property. <em>Id. </em>at 166-68, 66 A.3d at 1146-47.

In <em>Dackman, id. </em>at 592, 75 A.3d at 328, the plaintiff resided at three different properties from birth to age six. None of the three properties, however, was the basis for the plaintiffs claim of lead poisoning; rather, the plaintiff alleged that he had been injured at the defendants\u2019 property, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>plaintiffs father lived and where the plaintiff \u201coften visited and sometimes stayed overnight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 75 A.3d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">During discovery, the plaintiff submitted a report in which Arc Environmental, Inc. stated that testing for lead-based paint on eight exterior surfaces on the defendants\u2019 property revealed that one surface \u2014 the rear exterior door transom\u2014 tested positive for the presence of lead-based paint; the report did not indicate whether the paint on the rear exterior door transom was intact or deteriorated. <em>See id. </em>at 594-95, 75 A.3d at 330.

As to the plaintiffs experts, the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201can expert cannot transform thin evidence or assumptions into viable causal connections simply by labeling them an expert opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 75 A.3d at 338. The Court of Special Appeals explained further that Maryland courts \u201chave for some time required more of a plaintiff than simply a showing that he [or she] lived in an old house in an area where lead-based paint historically was present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, 75 A.3d at 340. Thus, \u201ca plaintiff bears the burden to establish the presence of lead in the child\u2019s environment, and cannot just assume it merely from the age or location of the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, 75 A.3d at 340 (citations omitted). Applying those principles, the Court concluded that the plaintiffs experts did not possess the necessary qualifications or an adequate factual basis to render an opinion as to the source of the plaintiffs lead exposure. <em>See id. </em>at 614-15, 75 A.3d at 341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The Court of Special Appeals held that, absent expert opinion testimony, the only evidence of lead-based paint at the defendants\u2019 property \u201cwas the lone test on a transom over the rear exterior door of the house[,]\u201d which was not sufficient to show that the interior of the defendants\u2019 property contained lead-based paint. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 75 A.3d at 343. The Court noted that other evidence \u201cdiminished\u201d the likelihood that the defendants\u2019 property harmed the plaintiff, including that, in answers to interrogatories, the plaintiff stated that he \u201crarely played in the back yard\u201d of the defendants\u2019 property and that there was no evidence of any violations of the Baltimore City Housing Code. <em>Id. </em>at 617-18, 75 A.3d at 343-44.

The Court concluded that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor because the plaintiff \u201cwas left with no evidence \u2014 direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>or </em>circumstantial \u2014 that would establish the [defendants\u2019] property as a probable source of his elevated blood-lead levels, and because his experts could not make evidence out of assumptions[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 75 A.3d at 344 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The Court of Special Appeals also commented on whether a plaintiff is required to rule out all other potential sources of lead exposure, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">We did not mean to suggest in <em>Dow, </em>[144 Md.App. 67, 796 A.2d 139,] or elsewhere, that plaintiffs must rule out all other potential sources in all cases. That process of elimination revived the plaintiffs case in <em>Dow, </em>and[,] on the other hand, the expert\u2019s inability to eliminate that uncertainty in <em>Taylor[, </em>207 Md.App. at 142, 51 A.3d at 755-56,] contributed to our holding that summary judgment was appropriate there. i\u00fcoss[, 430 Md. at 670-71, 63 A.3d at 13-15,] went the extra step, too, in suggesting that[,] even though a plaintiff need not produce an expert to establish causation, there are still limits to the inferences in a plaintiffs favor that yet could allow summary judgment. That suggestion does not mean, though, that[,] as a matter of law, a plaintiff cannot create a genuine [dispute] of [material] fact that a property probably was responsible for something [that was] less than all of a plaintiffs demonstrated lead exposure. To be sure, that would be a hard case \u2014 among other things, such a plaintiff would need to produce probability-level evidence as to exposure at each property separately. But the fact that such, a case might be hard to prove doesn\u2019t make it impossible, and the fact that a lead-exposed child might have lived or spent time in more than one lead-based-painted property should not foreclose that child as a matter of law from pursuing any one of those potential sources \u2014 as long as he [or she] is able to <em>rule in </em>the subject property in the first place through an appropriate combination of direct or circumstantial evidence establishing the probability of exposure by that plaintiff in that property. We clarify, therefore, that a plaintiffs ability to prove causation through circumstantial evidence is limited by the probability requirement, whatever the factual theory, rather than any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>requirement to eliminate all other potential sources of exposure. From there, each case stands or falls on the quantum and quality of the evidence [that] a plaintiff is able to produce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><em>Dackmcm, </em>213 Md.App. at 616-17, 75 A.3d at 342-43 (emphasis in original) (some citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Less than a year later, in <em>Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 544, 546, 96 A.3d at 740, 741, in an opinion that consolidated two cases, this Court held that the trial courts in the respective cases, the <em>Alston </em>case and the <em>Hamilton </em>case, were correct in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants because the Alstons and the Hamiltons failed to produce sufficient circumstantial evidence to satisfy the causation element of a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case. In <em>Hamilton, id. </em>at 529-30, 96 A.3d at 731, we discussed causation in lead-based paint cases generally, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">To connect the dots between a defendant\u2019s property and a plaintiffs exposure to lead[-based paint], the plaintiff must tender facts admissible in evidence that, if believed, establish two separate inferences: (1) that the [subject] property contained lead-based paint, and (2) that the lead-based paint at the subject property was a substantial contributor to the [plaintiffj\u2019s exposure to lead[-based paint]. At times, these separate inferences may be drawn from the same set of facts, but parties would do well to remember that these inferences are separate and often will require different evidentiary support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We then turned our attention to two key cases, <em>Dow, </em>144 Md.App. 57, 796 A.2d 139, and <em>West, </em>212 Md.App. 164, 66 A.3d 1145. As to <em>Dow, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">In sum, the facts in <em>Dow </em>showed that (1) the child victim spent most of her time at the subject property[,] where she lived[,] and [she] did not have contact with other possible sources of lead during the relevant period; (2) the child was observed ingesting regularly flaking or chipping paint at that property; (3) the child played frequently in the area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the flaking or chipping paint; and (4) the child had high blood[-]lead levels during that time period, i.e., developed lead poisoning. The [Cjourt [of Special Appeals] concluded that, under those circumstances, there was more than a mere possibility that the house where the child resided <em>and spent most of her time </em>was the <em>only </em>possible source of the lead exposure. As such, because the child spent almost all of her time at that house, the [C]ourt concluded additionally that it was more than a mere possibility that the house contained lead-based paint. Even though there was no direct evidence at that property, i.e., no scientific testing, it was reasonable to infer that there had to be lead[-based paint] at that property because the child would not have suffered otherwise from lead poisoning. In that sense, the plaintiff eliminated all other possible sources of lead poisoning in order to make reasonable and probable those conclusions. Thus, the [C]ourt drew two necessary, separate inferences on the basis of the same set of facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><em>Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 531, 96 A.3d at 732 (emphasis in original). As to <em>West, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">We agree with the <em>West </em>[C]ourt\u2019s analysis for application to those cases where a plaintiff relies on a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation. Under a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, a plaintiff must rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure in order to prove that it is probable that the subject property contained lead-based paint. Where the plaintiff fails to rule out other reasonably probable sources, the necessary inferences for a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation cannot be drawn with sufficient validity to allow the claim to survive summary judgment. That certain facts are missing to establish a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, however, does not mean that the lead-poisoned plaintiff has no way to prove circumstantially a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case. To the extent that <em>West </em>suggests that a lead-[based ]paint plaintiff must exclude all other sources of lead exposure in every instance of circumstantial proof, we do not agree necessarily with that conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 536-37, 96 A.3d at 735-36 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Indeed, we explained that \u201c[a] lead-[based Jpaint poisoned plaintiff may prove circumstantially that the subject property contained lead-based paint in a number of ways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 96 A.3d at 736. One such way to present a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case is \u201cto exclude other reasonably probable sources of lead, [ ] as in <em>Dow </em>[.]\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 537, 96 A.3d at 736. We also described an example of another way to present a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case, providing an illustration of a row of four row houses, A, B, C, and D, in which row house B, the subject property, is between row house A and row house C, the interiors of which both had tested positive for the presence of lead-based paint; it is unknown whether row house D, on the other side of row house C, contains lead-based paint. <em>See id. </em>at 537, 96 A.3d at 736. We elaborated upon the illustration, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">In this hypothetical, row house \u201cB\u201d is the subject property ... that a plaintiff hopes to prove, through circumstantial evidence, contains lead-based paint. Perhaps the row house was razed, however, and direct testing is impossible at the time of the litigation. There exists, however, evidence that these four row houses were built at the same time in the 1920[ ]s and that they were owned as a group by a series of persons or entities through the 1950[]s. Moreover, the City\u2019s records reveal that row houses \u201cA\u201d and \u201cC\u201d ... tested positive previously for lead[-based] paint on the interior of the houses. Thus, in this hypothetical (at least in the absence of evidence of lead abatement measures), the plaintiff is able to present circumstantial evidence from which a jury could infer reasonably that the subject property contained lead-based paint \u2014 without having to exclude all other sources of potential exposure to lead[] poisoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIl\"><em>Id. </em>at 538, 96 A.3d at 736 (footnote omitted). We summarized our reasoning as to the two ways to present a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case, stating: \u2018Where a plaintiff who does not produce evidence to support another theory of causation and, instead, relies on a causation theory similar to that espoused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>in <em>Dow, </em>the validity of the necessary inference is limited to those circumstances where the plaintiff is able also to exclude other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 96 A.3d at 736. We concluded, however, that <em>\u201cDow </em>does not define the only set of circumstantial facts that may satisfy a plaintiffs burden to establish a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case for lead [ ] poisoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 96 A.3d at 739. Indeed, \u201c[t]he pertinent question to be asked is whether the particular circumstantial evidence permits an inference or inferences of the desired ultimate fact or facts as a \u2018reasonable likelihood or probability,\u2019 and not a mere \u2018possibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 96 A.3d at 739. Thus, we disagreed \u201cwith the exclusivity of [the] conclusion\u201d \u201cthat the only way to prove a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case circumstantially is to eliminate every other reasonable possibility as an alternative sourcef.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 96 A.3d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Applying the principles distilled from the case law, we then turned to the two cases at issue. As to the <em>Hamilton </em>case, we determined not only that was there no direct evidence that the subject property contained lead-based paint, but also that there was no circumstantial evidence, \u201cas there was in <em>Dow, </em>that the [plaintiffs] spent substantially all of their time in one house, the subject property, such that the [trial c]ourt could conclude that a fact-finder could be persuaded that there was a reasonable probability that the subject property contained lead-based paint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542-43, 96 A.3d at 739. In the <em>Hamilton </em>case, the plaintiffs presented evidence consisting of: (1) a report regarding exterior surfaces; (2) the mother\u2019s statements that the plaintiffs put paint chips in their mouths at the subject property; (3) the plaintiffs\u2019 elevated blood-lead levels; and (4) the age of the subject property. <em>See id. </em>at 543, 96 A.3d at 739. While opining that perhaps the subject property contained lead-based paint, the plaintiffs\u2019 experts were unable to rule out two visitation properties as potential sources where some information suggested those properties contained lead-based paint. <em>See id. </em>at 543, 96 A.3d at 739. We explained that \u201cthe sole concern should not be that the [plaintiff]s\u2019 experts were provided with little information on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>other potential sources of lead exposure[,]\u201d and instead, \u201cthe concern should be that the [plaintiff]s\u2019 experts reached the conclusion that the [subject property] contained lead-based paint on a presumption that houses built during a certain time period contain typically lead-based paint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 96 A.3d at 740. Accordingly, the experts lacked an adequate factual basis \u201cto reach the conclusion that the interior of a specific property contained lead-based paint during the relevant time period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 96 A.3d at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">As to the <em>Alston </em>case, this Court held that the circuit court was correct in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because the Alstons argued a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, yet \u201cfailed to eliminate other reasonably probable identified sources of lead exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 96 A.3d at 741. Indeed, the Alstons had failed to meet their burden \u201cto advance a viable theory of causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 96 A.3d at 741. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that the trial court had determined that the evidence demonstrated that two properties could have been the source of the Alstons\u2019 lead exposure, which was simply not sufficient to establish causation. <em>See id. </em>at 545, 96 A.3d at 741. Thus, although the Alstons had shown that the subject properties had deteriorating paint, and that they had experienced elevated blood-lead levels while living in the subject properties, summary judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor was appropriate because the Alstons failed to rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure. <em>See id. </em>at 545-46, 96 A.3d at 740-41.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Returning to the instant case, we hold that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in Rowhouses\u2019s favor as to Smith\u2019s negligence claim because, even without direct evidence that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and without Dr. Simon\u2019s expert testimony as to the source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint; and, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude that the Oliver Street Property was a reasonable probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure, and that there were no other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\n<em>Reasonable Probable Source</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Before we delve into the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence that Smith presented, we begin by examining what constitutes a reasonable probable source of lead exposure. As described above, this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have held that circumstantial evidence may be used to establish a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case so long as the circumstantial evidence demonstrates that the subject property is a reasonable probable source of lead exposure. <em>See Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 542, 96 A.3d at 739 (\u201cThe pertinent question to be asked is whether the particular circumstantial evidence permits an inference or inferences of the desired ultimate fact or facts as a \u2018reasonable likelihood or probability,\u2019 and not a mere \u2018possibility.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Dackman, </em>213 Md.App. at 605, 75 A.3d at 336 (\u201c[A] plaintiff must establish ... a probability that [the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ject] property exposed him or her to injury-causing lead[based] paint.\u201d (Citation omitted)); <em>West, </em>212 Md.App. at 170-71, 66 A.3d at 1149 (\u201cThere is no dispute that a negligence case may be proven using only circumstantial evidence, so long as it creates a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility supporting a rational inference of causation, and is not wholly speculative.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Dow, </em>144 Md.App. at 75, 796 A.2d at 144 (\u201cCircumstantial evidence may support a negligence determination if it amounts to a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility.\u201d (Brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)). In this case, the parties have raised an issue as to what constitutes a reasonable probable source; accordingly, we attempt to define the phrase \u201creasonable probability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We determine that, for purposes of causation in lead-based paint cases at the summary judgment phase, a reasonable probability requires a showing that is less than \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but more than a mere \u201cpossibility.\u201d In other words, there are degrees of probability, with more likely than not having the highest degree of probability, followed by reasonable probability, followed by mere possibility. In the context of an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>specifically, whether evidence was material even if helpful and even if suppressed, in <em>Adams v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 352, 435-36, 885 A.2d 833, 881-82 (2005), writing for the Court of Special Appeals, Judge Moylan explained that a reasonable probability is not synonymous with more likely than not and that more likely than not is the higher standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">An obvious weakness of the term of art \u201creasonable probability\u201d is that the unwary reader may readily confuse it with the informal and commonplace notion of \u201cprobability.\u201d To the untutored ear, probability sounds like something that is more likely true than not. As we have analyzed at length, however, ... \u201creasonable probability\u201d implies no such thing.... The Court speaks in terms of the familiar, and perhaps familiarly deceptive, formulation: whether there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different outcome if the evidence withheld had been disclosed. The Court rightly cautions that the standard intended by these words does not require defendants to show that a different outcome would have been more likely than not with the suppressed evidence .... [T]he continued use of the term \u201cprobability\u201d raises an unjustifiable risk of misleading courts into treating it as akin to the more demanding standard, \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">(Citations, emphasis, and paragraph breaks omitted). What can be gleaned from the discussion in <em>Adams </em>is that a reasonable probability is less than more likely than not, which is a higher standard to meet. We agree with the general principle that more likely than not implies a higher degree of proof than the standard of reasonable probability. Significantly, for purposes of surviving summary judgment, neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals has required a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case to show that it is more likely than not that the subject property contained lead-based paint and is the source of the plaintiffs lead exposure. Rath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>er, as discussed above, at the summary judgment stage, a plaintiff need only show that the subject property is a reasonable probable source of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">To that end, we further examine the definition of \u201creasonable probability.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014) defines \u201cprobability,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201c[s]omething that is likely; what is likely[.]\u201d Similarly, Merriam-Webster defines \u201cprobable\u201d as \u201clikely to be or become true[.]\u201d Probable, Merriam-Webster (2015), http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/probable [https://perma.cc/84MQ-2X8 H]. \u201cLikely,\u201d in turn, means \u201c[apparently true ...; probable\u201d and \u201c[s]howing a strong tendency; reasonably expected[.]\u201d Likely, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). \u201cReasonable,\u201d on the other hand, means \u201c[flair, proper, or moderate under the circumstances[.]\u201d Reasonable, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). Similarly, Merriam-Webster defines \u201creasonable\u201d as \u201cnot extreme or excessive\u201d and \u201cmoderate, fair[.]\u201d Reasonable, Merriam-Webster (2015), http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/reasonable [https://perma.cc/QE89-RNWD]. Considering theses definitions together, we conclude that a \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a fair likelihood that something is true. In the context of lead-based paint cases, that means that the subject property is a reasonable probable source of a plaintiffs lead exposure where there is a fan-likelihood that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a source of the lead exposure. <em>Compare Dow, </em>144 Md.App. at 76, 796 A.2d at 144 (The subject property was a reasonable probable source of the child\u2019s lead exposure where the evidence, if believed, demonstrated \u201cthat the chipping and peeling paint inside [the subject property] was the only possible source of [the child]\u2019s lead poisoning.\u201d), <em>with Taylor, </em>207 Md.App. at 146, 51 A.Sd at 758 (The subject property was not a reasonable probable source of lead exposure where \u201cthe evidence [wa]s inconclusive as to the source of [the plaintiff]\u2019s lead exposure\u201d and where \u201c[i]t [wa]s entirely possible from the evidence presented that [the plaintiff] was exposed to lead-based paint at [another property] and not at [the subject property].\u201d), <em>and Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 542-43, 96 A.3d at 739 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>(The subject property was not a reasonable probable source of lead where there was no direct or circumstantial evidence, \u201cas there was in <em>Dow, </em>that the children spent substantially all of their time in one house, the subject property, such that the [trial cjourt could conclude that a fact-finder could be persuaded that there was a reasonable probability that the subject property contained lead-based paint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Obviously, by the very nature of the phrase, a \u201creasonable probability\u201d is not a \u201ccertainty,\u201d which is \u201c[t]he quality, state, or condition of being indubitable or certain, especially] upon a showing of hard evidence^]\u201d and \u201c[a]nything that is known or has been prove[n] to be true.\u201d Certainty, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). Indeed, in a case that is premised on circumstantial evidence, it would be nearly impossible, if not completely impossible, to demonstrate to a certainty that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a source of the plaintiffs lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Also, a \u201creasonable probability\u201d is more than a mere \u201cpossibility.\u201d A \u201cpossibility\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">1. The quality, state, or condition of being conceivable in theory or in practice; the character of perhaps being, of perhaps existing, or of comporting with physical laws or the laws of reason[.] ... In this sense, the word often (but not always) conveys a sense of uncertainty or improbability. 2. The chance that something is ... true, or that something ... will happen[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Possibility, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). Similarly, Merriam-Webster defines \u201cpossibility\u201d as \u201ca chance that something might exist, happen, or be true[.]\u201d Possibility, Merriam-Webster (2015), http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/possibility [https://perma.cc/WD6Y-9JJX]. Thus, something that is possible is less probable than something that is reasonably probable; a possibility is a mere chance that something might be true, as opposed to a fair likelihood that something is true. Establishing a possibility requires a lower quantum of proof or evidence (the showing of a chance, not necessarily a fair likelihood) than establishing a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>probability. In that regard, a \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a higher standard than a \u201cpossibility.\u201d In the context of lead-based paint cases, any property in which a plaintiff has resided or visited could be a possible source of the plaintiffs lead exposure. However, a possible source does not become a reasonable probable source without additional evidence that elevates the mere chance that the property contained lead-based paint and was a source of lead exposure to the fair likelihood that the property contained lead-based paint and was a source of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Indeed, reading these definitions together makes it evident that a reasonable probability is less than more likely than not, but more than a possibility. As stated above, in a lead-based paint case, a subject property is a reasonable probable source of a plaintiffs lead exposure where there is a fair likelihood that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a source of the lead exposure. Now, keeping in mind what a reasonable probable source is, and that it is not synonymous with a possible source or a source that is more likely than not, we consider whether circumstantial evidence may be used both to establish the subject property as a reasonable probable source and to rule out other reasonably probable sources. We hold that it can at the summary judgment stage and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Under existing case law, as discussed in detail above, a plaintiff may use circumstantial evidence to establish that the subject property contained lead-based paint and is a reasonable probable source of lead exposure. The case law is clear that, when proceeding under a <em>Dow </em>theory of causa<em>tion </em>\u2014 ie., using circumstantial evidence to establish the subject property as a reasonable probable source of lead exposure \u2014 a plaintiff must rule out other reasonably probable sources.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 538, 96 A.3d at 736 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>(\u201cWhere a plaintiff who does not produce evidence to support another theory of causation and, instead, relies on a causation theory [that is] similar to that espoused in <em>Dow, </em>the validity of the necessary inference is limited to those circumstances where the plaintiff is able also to exclude other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure.\u201d); <em>West, 212 </em>Md.App. at 175, 66 A.3d at 1151 (\u201c[W]here there was no direct evidence that [the defendants\u2019 property] even contained lead[-based] paint, [the plaintiff could] rely on that critical fact, as a necessary part of his circumstantial evidence, [only] if he [could] show by the process of elimination that [the defendants\u2019 property] was the only possible cause for the critical effect of lead poisoning.\u201d); <em>Taylor, </em>207 Md.App. at 146, 51 A.3d at 758 (\u201c[M]ore is required to support [the pediatrician]\u2019s opinion that [the plaintiff] was exposed to lead-based paint at [the subject property] because, unlike in <em>Dow, </em>[the plaintiff] could not rule out all other sources for her lead exposure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">However, the case law has not discussed what exactly is required to rule out other reasonably probable sources. Here, we hold that, where a plaintiff proceeds under a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, just as circumstantial evidence may be used to rule in the subject property as a reasonable probable source of lead exposure, circumstantial evidence may also be used to rule out another property as a reasonable probable source of lead exposure. In other words, to rule out or eliminate other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure, a plaintiff does not need to produce direct evidence that another property did not contain lead-based paint \u2014 through, for example, a test for lead-based paint. Requiring direct evidence to rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>is simply too high a burden of production on a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case, especially at the summary judgment stage. Accordingly, we conclude that a plaintiff need only produce circumstantial evidence that, if believed, would rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead. At the summary judgment stage, although expert witness testimony may be helpful to rule out another property as a reasonable probable source, it is not necessary. <em>Cf. Ross, </em>430 Md. at 669, 63 A.3d at 13 (\u201c[T]he link between a defendant\u2019s property and a plaintiffs childhood exposure to lead[-based] paint and [lead] dust may be established through circumstantial evidence, even if expert opinion testimony is not available.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Instead, circumstantial evidence that rules out other reasonably probable sources may take the form of a lay witness\u2019s testimony at a deposition or averment in an affidavit that a property other than the subject property did not contain deteriorated, chipping, or flaking paint and was in good condition. In essence, in that situation, the witness\u2019s testimony or affidavit is circumstantial evidence that the other property did not contain a lead-based paint hazard.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>witness\u2019s testimony or affidavit may also rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead, including environmental sources such as soil or items such as painted toys, by stating that the plaintiff did not have any contact with such sources. In sum, a lay witness\u2019s testimony or affidavit may serve as circumstantial evidence that, if believed, rules out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure. We hasten to add that, at the summary judgment stage, a trial court cannot weigh the credibility of a witness and determine that the witness is not credible, and accordingly grant summary judgment against a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case on that basis. <em>See Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 93, 756 A.2d 963, 972 (2000) (\u201cEvidentiary matters, credibility issues, and material facts [that] are in dispute cannot properly be disposed of by summary judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted)). Rather, any issue as to a witness\u2019s credibility is to be decided by the trier of fact, which is a jury in most, if not all, lead-based paint cases. Indeed, the standard that we announce today is simply that, where a plaintiff proceeds under a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, a plaintiff need only produce circumstantial evidence that, if believed, would rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Before moving on, we pause to state that we are aware that, at the summary judgment stage, a witness\u2019s deposition testimony or affidavit may serve as circumstantial evidence that both helps to rule in the subject property as a reasonable probable source of lead exposure and to rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure. For example, as in this case, a plaintiffs parent may testify at a deposition that the subject property contained deteriorated, chipping, and flaking paint, and that other properties in which the plaintiff resided or visited were in good condition and did not contain deteriorated, chipping, and flaking paint. For purposes of summary judgment, viewing the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>light most favorable to the plaintiff \u2014 who is the non-moving party \u2014 and given that issues of credibility are the province of the trier of fact, the parent\u2019s deposition testimony could be sufficient circumstantial evidence that, if believed, would rule out the other properties as reasonable probable sources of lead exposure. We recognize that, in this scenario, the parent\u2019s testimony may be perceived as \u201cself-serving,\u201d as Row-houses contends. Nevertheless, whether the parent\u2019s testimony is credible is up to the trier of fact, and a defendant is certainly free at trial to probe the veracity of the parent\u2019s recollection of the conditions of the various relevant properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">\n<em>The Properties in this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">With the principles established above in mind, we turn to the case at hand. Here, we are specifically concerned with the source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure and elevated blood-lead levels in 1992 and 1993, the narrow time frame during which she resided in the Oliver Street Property. The record reveals that all of the following are possible sources of Smith\u2019s lead exposure during that time period: (1) the Monroe Street Property, where Smith lived from birth until either late 1991 or Spring 1992; (2) the Oliver Street Property, where Smith lived from either late 1991 or Spring 1992 to Spring 1993; (3) the Ashland Avenue Property, where Smith visited once per week or every other week for two to three hours each visit while she was residing at the Monroe Street Property and the Oliver Street Property; and (4) environmental or other sources, such as soil or toys. Upon review of the record, we hold that Smith produced sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonably probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure, and that there were no other reasonably probable sources of lead <em>exposure </em>\u2014 i.e., the circumstantial evidence ruled out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We start by examining the circumstantial evidence that ruled out the other sources of lead as reasonably probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>sources.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As to the Monroe Street Property, Smith produced the following circumstantial evidence: (1) Plater testified at her deposition and/or averred in her affidavit that Smith resided at the Monroe Street Property from her birth on October 21, 1991, until either late 1991 or Spring 1992; (2) Plater testified at her deposition that Smith did not crawl or walk while residing at the Monroe Street <em>Property </em>\u2014 i.e., she was not mobile \u2014 and Plater did not observe Smith come into contact with any possible lead-based paint hazard; (3) Plater testified at her deposition that the Monroe Street Property was in \u201c[g]ood condition[,]\u201d meaning that it did not contain deteriorated, chipping, or flaking paint; and (4) Smith\u2019s first blood-lead test occurred on September 25, <em>1992 </em>\u2014 i.e., at least three months after Smith moved from the Monroe Street Property to the Oliver Street Property \u2014 and the test indicated an elevated blood-lead level.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">As to the Ashland Avenue Property, Smith produced the following circumstantial evidence: (1) Smith never resided at the Ashland Avenue Property; (2) Plater testified at her deposition that, while residing at the Oliver Street Property, Smith visited the Ashland Avenue Property every other week for two to three hours each visit; and (3) Plater testified at her deposition that she never observed any chipping, flaking, or peeling paint at the Ashland Avenue Property. Additionally, on brief, Smith pointed out that Plater never testified at her deposition that the Ashland Avenue Property had dust on the floors, as she did as to the Oliver Street Property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Essentially, Smith established that she spent a very small amount of time, less than six hours per month, at the Ashland Avenue Property, and that, according to Plater, there was no evidence of chipping and peeling paint at the Ashland Avenue <em>Property </em>\u2014 ie., there were no known lead-based paint hazards at the Ashland Avenue Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">And, as to environmental or other sources, Smith produced the following circumstantial evidence: (1) Plater testified at her deposition that she never took Smith to any playgrounds or parks; and (2) in her affidavit, Plater averred that, to her knowledge, while residing at the Oliver Street Property, Smith \u201chad no contact with old battery casings, lead figures, painted toys, plastic jewelry, naval paint, bullets, fishing weights, ceramic pottery, folk medicine[,] or any other source of lead[.]\u201d Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Smith\u2014 and, again, keeping in mind that credibility determinations are properly left to the trier of fact \u2014 we conclude that Smith produced sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence that, if believed, rules out the Monroe Street Property, the Ashland Avenue Property, and environmental and other sources as reasonably probable sources of her lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">At oral argument, Rowhouses\u2019s counsel made much of the circumstance that Dr. Simon testified at his deposition that, as to the Ashland Avenue Property, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t rule it in, and [he] couldn\u2019t rule it out at th[at] point.\u201d Rowhouses\u2019s reliance on this point is a red herring. As stated above, <em>see supra </em>Footnote 8, both the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals determined that Dr. Simon lacked an adequate factual basis to support his opinion that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was a substantial contributing source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure, and that his opinion was not admissible to prove causation; and, in this Court, neither party has filed a petition or cross-petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>as to the issue, and, accordingly, we do not address the matter. As such, the circumstance that Dr. Simon could not rule the Ashland Avenue Property in or out is of no consequence whatsoever to our analysis in this case. Moreover, as discussed above, evidence in the form of expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>witness testimony, although potentially helpful, is not required to rule in or out a reasonable probable source. Indeed, as we explain, Smith produced sufficient circumstantial evidence, even without Dr. Simon\u2019s expert testimony, from which a trier of fact could conclude that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was the only reasonable probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure. And, in any event, as Judge Battaglia pointed out at oral argument, Dr. Simon\u2019s deposition testimony that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t rule [the Ashland Avenue Property] in, and [he] couldn\u2019t rule it out at th[at] point\u201d is a matter of equipoise, or a state of equilibrium or counterbalance. Simply put, Dr. Simon\u2019s testimony as to the Ashland Avenue Property added nothing to the circumstantial evidence analysis. With certainty, under our holding today and as an extension of <em>Hamilton, </em>Smith did not need expert testimony to provide evidence sufficient to rule out the Ashland Avenue Property as a reasonable probable source. That Dr. Simon could not render an opinion one way or the other does not bar Smith from meeting the standard for ruling out the Ashland Avenue Property through the use of other circumstantial evidence at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">That Smith produced sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence to rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure is not the end of our analysis. We must also determine whether Smith produced sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence that rules in the Oliver Street Property as a reasonable probable source of her lead exposure. As the Court of Special Appeals did, <em>see Smith, </em>223 Md.App. at 668-69, 117 A.3d at 628, we conclude that Smith produced sufficient circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was the only reasonable probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure for the relevant time frame. As to the Oliver Street Property, Smith produced the following circumstantial evidence: (1) Plater testified at her deposition and/or averred in an affidavit that, from not long after Smith\u2019s birth, sometime in late 1991 or Spring 1992, until Spring 1993, Smith resided at the Oliver Street Property; (2) in an affidavit, Plater averred that Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u201cspent almost all of her time at\u201d the Oliver Street Property while they resided there; (3) at her deposition, Plater testified that, approximately three to four months after moving into the Oliver Street Property, Plater noticed that the paint on the \u201c[w]indowsills, the banister[, and the] baseboards\u201d \u201cstarted chipping and peeling\u201d; (4) Plater noticed dust on the floor in the Oliver Street Property while they resided there; (5) while residing at the Oliver Street Property, Smith began to walk; (6) at her deposition, Plater testified that Smith spent time in areas in the house near deteriorated paint and that she observed Smith put her hands in her mouth while living in the Oliver Street Property; (7) Smith had her first blood-lead level test while residing at the Oliver Street Property, and the test indicated an elevated blood-lead level; and (8) the Oliver Street Property was most likely built in the early 1900s or earlier. Although there was no direct evidence of lead-based paint at the Oliver Street Property, Smith produced evidence that, between approximately 1991 and Spring 1993, she spent substantially all of her time in one house, the Oliver Street Property, a property that had chipping and peeling paint and where she experienced elevated blood-lead levels. This evidence is sufficient to establish a reasonable probability that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was the source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Smith, and remembering that credibility determinations are properly left to the trier of fact, we hold that Smith produced sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence that, if believed, demonstrated that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint while she resided there, and, given the circumstantial evidence that rules out other reasonably probable sources of lead, that the Oliver Street Property was the only reasonable probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure. Stated otherwise, Smith presented through circumstantial evidence a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in Rowhouses\u2019s favor as to Smith\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We observe that our above analysis is based on Smith\u2019s reliance on a <em>Dow </em>theory of causation, which requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure be eliminated. As we discussed in <em>Hamilton, </em>439 Md. at 537-38, 96 A.3d at 736, however, this is not the only way in which a plaintiff can present a <em>prima facie </em>negligence case. Here, in response to <em>Hamilton, </em>Smith filed a supplement to the opposition to the motion for summary judgment in which she produced additional circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact could infer that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonable probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure. Specifically, Smith produced the following additional circumstantial evidence: (1) properties near the Oliver Street Property were built in either 1914 or 1915; (2) records from the Baltimore City Health Department Lead Paint Poisoning Prevention Program showed that properties on East Oliver Street had been issued numerous lead-based paint violation notices over the years; (3) on August 11, 1987, 1620 East Oliver Street, the row house immediately next door to the Oliver Street Property, had been issued a violation notice by the Baltimore City Health Department for the presence of lead-based paint on twenty-six interior surfaces and five exterior surfaces; (4) on January 6, 1988, 1620 East Oliver Street had been issued another violation notice by the Baltimore City Health Department for the presence of lead-based paint on ten interior surfaces; and (5) a lead-based paint survey report for 2324 East Oliver Street noted the presence of lead-based paint on twelve interior surfaces. This circumstantial evidence bolsters the reasonable inference that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonable probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In conclusion, for the above reasons, we hold that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in Rowhouses\u2019s favor as to Smith\u2019s negligence claim because, even without direct evidence that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and without Dr. Simon\u2019s expert testimony as to the source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint; <em>i.e., </em>a jury could conclude that the Oliver Street Proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ty was a reasonable probable source of Smith\u2019s lead exposure and that there were no other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure. We observe that our holding is simply that there was sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence to preclude summary judgment. Ultimately, though, it will be up to the jury to determine liability at trial, and, if the jury finds Rowhouses liable, any damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

According to Plater, she and Smith moved from the Oliver Street Property to the Collington Avenue Property in Spring 1993; thus, it is not clear whether the May 28, 1993 testing of Smith\u2019s blood-lead levels occurred while she was residing at the Oliver Street Property or soon after she moved out of the Oliver Street Property. However, in their briefs, both parties state that the May 28, 1993 testing occurred while Smith was residing at the Oliver Street Property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. Smith also had her blood-lead levels tested in 1994 and 1995, with the following results: on March 23, 1994, Smith's blood-lead level was reported as 8 p,g/dL; on January 17, 1995, Smith\u2019s blood-lead level was reported as 11 pg/dL; and in May 1995, Smith's blood-lead level was reported as 8 |j,g(dL.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\">.

At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Smith's counsel stated that he would \"not provid[e] an opposition\u201d to Rowhouses\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Smith's claim for violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. And, at oral argument in this Court, Smith\u2019s counsel confirmed that, at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, he \"submitted\u201d on the claim for violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.

In the Court of Special Appeals, Smith also contended that Dr. Simon had \"a substantial factual basis for his opinions and properly considered multiple potential sources of exposure.\u201d In response, Rowhouses argued that Dr. Simon \"lacked a sufficient factual basis to support his opinion that [the Oliver Street Property] was the source of [Smith]'s lead exposure or the cause of any injuries allegedly therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). The Court of Special Appeals concluded: \"Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion that there was lead-based paint inside the Oliver Street Property rested solely on an inadequate factual basis[ <em>i.e., </em>the age of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Oliver Street Property]. Therefore it was not admissible, and the circuit court correctly ruled that it could not be used to prove causation.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>223 Md.App. at 666, 117 A.3d at 626. Neither Smith nor Rowhouses filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>or a cross-petition raising an issue as to whether Dr. Simon had an adequate factual foundation to support his opinion that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint and was a substantial contributing source of Smith's lead exposure.
