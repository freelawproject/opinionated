On September 9, 2012, a church-sponsored fireworks display took place on property adjacent to Toms\u2019 dairy operation. A permit to discharge fireworks had been obtained, and the event was supervised by a deputy fire marshal. No misfires or malfunctions took place. According to Toms, the fireworks display was so loud that it startled his cattle, and caused a stampede inside his dairy barn. The stampede resulted in the death of four dairy cows, property damage, disposal costs, and lost milk revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Toms filed suit against the respondents, collectively, Calvary Assembly of God, Inc. (\u201cCalvary\u201d), Zambelli Fireworks Manufacturing Co. (\u201cZambelli\u201d), Zambelli employee Kristo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>pher Lindberg (\u201cMr. Lindberg\u201d), and Auburn Farms, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Frederick County (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d). He alleged that the stampede was the result of negligence, nuisance, and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity. After a bench trial, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the respondents. Toms appealed to the Circuit Court for Frederick County (\u201cCircuit Court\u201d). The Circuit Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling. We granted Toms\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Andrew David Toms v. Calvary Assembly of God, Inc., </em>442 Md. 515, 113 A.3d 624 (2015). For the reasons explained below, we hold that lawfully discharging fireworks is not an abnormally dangerous activity, and, therefore, the imposition of strict liability is unwarranted. We affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Toms operates a dairy farm on 69 acres of leased property near Walkersville, Frederick County, Maryland. The farm includes a barn and a herd of approximately ninety dairy cows. Auburn Farms, Inc., at the time of the incident, possessed the adjacent 40 acre property. Calvary sought and obtained permission from Auburn Farms, Inc. to use its property to host a fireworks display celebrating a church youth crusade.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Calvary then hired Zambelli, a professional fireworks company, to handle the fireworks.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Pursuant to Md.Code (2003, 2011 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-104(b) of the Public Safety Article, an application for a permit to discharge fireworks was submitted to the Office of the State Fire Marshal. The application identified the date, time, and location of the anticipated fireworks display, as well as the size and number of fireworks shells that would be used. It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>identified Mr. Lindberg as the Zambelli employee who would be responsible for discharging the fireworks, and included his \u201cState shooter permit\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> information, and proof of Zambelli\u2019s insurance for the event. Deputy Fire Marshal Glen Ruch inspected Auburn Farms, Inc. and approved the location. He testified that, based on the number of shells, the State required a firing radius of 250 feet around the firing site.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, he noted that, in the application, Mr. Lindberg included an aerial photo with notations indicating he planned to extend the firing radius to 300 feet. The application was approved, including the 300 foot firing radius, and a permit to discharge fireworks was obtained by the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The event was open to the public, and advertised in radio interviews, a newspaper ad, and on a banner located on Calvary\u2019s property on Route 194. Toms recalls seeing the banner, but states he had no notice of the event\u2019s time or location. On September 9, 2012, the day of the event, Mr. Lindberg accidently drove onto Toms\u2019 farm, and Toms assisted him in locating the entrance to Auburn Farms, Inc. Mr. Lindberg testified that he identified himself and his purpose when speaking to Toms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fireworks display took place at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>8:30 p.m., and Senior Deputy Fire Marshal Michael Guderjohn was onsite to supervise the event. Apparently, 250 shells were discharged over a fifteen-minute period without any misfires or duds. According to the parties\u2019 Agreed Statement of Facts submitted in their briefs to this Court, there is no dispute that Toms\u2019 barn was at least 300 feet away from the firing location.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">At the time of the event, Toms\u2019 cattle were inside the barn. Toms, however, arrived at the barn a few minutes after Mr. Lindberg began discharging fireworks. Toms states that the explosions startled his dairy cows, and caused them to stampede inside the barn. No witnesses, however, actually saw the stampede because no one was inside the barn with the cattle at the time the event started. The stampede, Toms states, resulted in the deaths of three cows shortly thereafter, and injuries to a fourth cow that ultimately led to its death, because it had to be \u201cculled\u201d from the herd a few weeks later.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition to the loss of four dairy cows, Toms sustained property damage to fences and gates, disposal costs, and lost milk revenue. Toms sent a demand letter to Calvary outlining the damages, but Calvary and Zambelli denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">On December 9, 2013, Toms filed suit in District Court against the respondents seeking damages of $13,148.20 under the theories of negligence, nuisance and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity. On May 2, 2014, a one-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>bench trial took place in the District Court before Judge W. Milnor Roberts. Several witnesses testified on Toms\u2019 behalf, including his dairy veterinarian, Dr. Richard Doak, and lay witnesses with experience handling cattle. At the time of the event, the lay witnesses were located nearby the barn, and they testified about the loudness of the fireworks display, and hearing \u201cbanging\u201d noises emanating from the barn at the time of the alleged stampede. Dr. Doak testified, among other things, about the tendency of loud unexpected noises to trigger a \u201cstartle response\u201d in cows, which can lead to a stampede as well as injuries if a herd is confined to a small space.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The respondents called several witnesses to testify. Deputy Fire Marshal Ruch testified that Calvary and Zambelli complied with applicable laws by applying for, and receiving, a permit to discharge fireworks. He also inspected and approved of the firing location. On the day of the event, Senior Deputy Fire Marshal Guderjohn supervised the fireworks show, and stated that Mr. Lindberg maintained a proper firing radius around the firing location, and that all shells were properly discharged without incident. Additionally, he stated that several fireworks displays had taken place within a mile of Toms\u2019 location on previous occasions. Mr. Lindberg also testified, and stated that the fireworks were discharged from 550 to 600 feet from Toms\u2019 barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The District Court entered judgment in favor of the respondents. It found that although Toms sustained damage, Toms did not establish any basis for liability for the injuries to his property, including livestock. The District Court determined that the fireworks display was a single event with no evidence that injuries or damages were sustained by direct contact with the discharged shells. No evidence established negligence on behalf of the respondents, because they had lawfully complied with statutory requirements by obtaining a permit, and the conditions of the permit were not violated. As to the issue of strict liability, the District Court found that the discharge of fireworks could be an abnormally dangerous activity, but that the danger is contained within the area allowed by the permit: here, a 300 foot firing radius. The District Court, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>did not find that noise from a fireworks discharge itself was abnormally dangerous. Furthermore, it reasoned, strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity could not be imposed, because Toms\u2019 barn was not located within 300 feet of the firing location.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">On May 29, 2014, pursuant to Md. Rule 7-113, Toms noted an appeal on the record to the Circuit Court. On November 24, 2014, oral arguments took place before Judge Julie S. Solt of that court. On January 8, 2015, the court affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment. Although it held that the use of fireworks was abnormally dangerous as to the damage from explosions, the Circuit Court stated that the respondents \u201care not strictly liable because the type of harm \u2014 damage caused by noise \u2014 is not of a type that makes the activity abnormally dangerous.\u201d Under the theory of negligence, it found no evidence to show that the respondents breached any duty of care. There was substantial evidence to show that the respondents \u201cacted reasonably and with due care in preparing [and discharging] the fireworks display.\u201d Lastly, the Circuit Court held that the theory of private nuisance was inapplicable, because, as a one-time event, \u201cthe fireworks were not substantial and unreasonable and did not rise to the level of significant harm needed to create a private nuisance.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We granted <em>certiorari, Andrew David Toms v. Calvary Assembly of God, Inc., </em>442 Md. 515, 113 A.3d 624 (2015), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Does the doctrine of strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity apply to the noise of a fireworks discharge, based on the facts of this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>For the reasons stated below, we shall answer in the negative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court, and agree that there is no liability for abnormally dangerous activities, but for reasons different than those articulated by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The question before this Court is whether discharging fireworks \u2014 specifically, the noise it produces \u2014 is abnormally dangerous, and thus, subject to strict liability. Whether an activity constitutes an abnormally dangerous activity is a question of law. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 cmt. 1 (Am. Law Inst. 1977) (stating that the function of the court is to decide whether an activity is abnormally dangerous by considering several factors and \u201cthe weight given to each that it merits upon the facts in evidence\u201d). \u201cAs with all questions of law, we review this matter <em>de novo.\u201d State v. Johnson, </em>367 Md. 418, 424, 788 A.2d 628, 631 (2002). <em>See also Gallagher v. H.V. Pierhomes, LLC, </em>182 Md.App. 94, 109, 957 A.2d 628, 636 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">For questions of fact for an action tried without a jury, we apply a clearly erroneous standard. Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYC\">When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u201cOn appellate review, the Court of Appeals may set aside the judgment of the lower court based on the factual findings of the lower court only when those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Helinski v. Harford Mem\u2019l Hosp., Inc., </em>376 Md. 606, 614, 831 A.2d 40, 45 (2003) (citing Md. Rule 8-131(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Maryland has long recognized the doctrine of strict liability, which does not require a finding of fault in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>impose liability on a party. <em>See Yommer v. McKenzie, 255 </em>Md. 220, 222, 257 A.2d 138, 139 (1969); <em>Toy v. Atl. Gulf &amp; Pac. Co., </em>176 Md. 197, 212, 4 A.2d 757, 764-65 (1939). The doctrine is derived from the famous 1868 English case of <em>Rylands v. Fletcher, </em>which recognized that, under certain circumstances, no-fault liability could be imposed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cFor more than a century, the Court of Appeals has recognized the doctrine of strict liability, derived initially from <em>Rylands v. Fletcher </em>.... \u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>182 Md.App. at 101, 957 A.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The modern formulation of the strict liability doctrine is found in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 519-520 (1977). This Court adopted that formulation in <em>Yommer, </em>while the Restatement (Second) of Torts was still in its tentative draft. 255 Md. at 223-24, 257 A.2d at 139. In <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>we discussed the evolution of the doctrine: \u201cUnlike the rule first enunciated in <em>Rylands, </em>this definition does not limit applicable activities to those causing an \u2018escape\u2019 of something onto the land of another; it requires only that there be harm to the person or property of another resulting from the abnormally dangerous activity.\u201d 335 Md. 58, 70, 642 A.2d 180, 185 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 519 defines strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">One who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject to liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of another resulting from the activity, although he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the harm.... This strict liability is limited to the kind of harm, the possibility of which makes the activity abnormally dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">To determine whether an activity is abnormally dangerous, a court uses six factors. These factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 (Am. Law Inst. 1977). <em>See Kelley v. R.G. Indus., Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 132, 497 A.2d 1143, 1146 (1985) (\u201cWhether an activity is \u2018abnormally dangerous\u2019 under these sections depends on its satisfying the following six factors, specified in \u00a7 520.\u201d). As the Restatement (Second) of Torts reminds us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">Because of the interplay of these various factors, it is not possible to reduce abnormally dangerous activities to any definition. The essential question is whether the risk created is so unusual, either because of its magnitude or because of the circumstances surrounding it, as to justify the imposition of strict liability for the harm that results from it, even though it is carried on with all reasonable care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 cmt. f (Am. Law Inst. 1977). The Reporter\u2019s Note for this section identifies typical abnormally dangerous activities, such as the storage of large quantities of water or explosives in dangerous locations, and conducting blasting operations in the middle of a city.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">In Maryland, we weigh each factor independently. More emphasis is placed on the fifth factor: the appropriateness of the activity in relation to its location. <em>Yommer, </em>255 Md. at 226, 257 A.2d at 140. \u201cThe thrust of the doctrine is that the activity be abnormally dangerous in relation to the area where it occurs.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 133, 497 A.2d at 1147. <em>\u201cYommer </em>emphasized that the appropriateness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>activity in the particular place was the most crucial factor.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Hylton, </em>51 Md.App. 365, 374, 443 A.2d 640, 645 (1982) (citation omitted). \u201cThe Court of Appeals reiterated the importance of locale in <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon Co. USA </em>[335 Md. 58, 642 A.2d 180 (1994) ]\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>182 Md.App. at 104, 957 A.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In <em>Yommer, </em>the owners of a gasoline station were held strictly liable for damages resulting from gasoline contamination of the well water of an adjacent residential property. 255 Md. at 227, 257 A.2d at 141. There, we applied the Restatement factors, and found the fifth factor to be the most persuasive factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">No one would deny that gasoline stations as a rule do not present any particular danger to the community. However, when the operation of such activity involves the placing of a large tank adjacent to a well from which a family must draw its water for drinking, bathing and laundry, at least that aspect of the activity is inappropriate to the locale, even when equated to the value of the activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\"><em>Yommer, </em>255 Md. at 225, 257 A.2d at 140. \u201cWe accept the test of appropriateness as the proper one: that the unusual, the excessive, the extravagant, the bizarre are likely to be non-natural uses which lead to strict liability.\u201d <em>Yommer, </em>255 Md. at 226, 257 A.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In applying the six factors, it is not necessary to have all six factors weigh in favor of a particular party. \u201cAny one of them is not necessarily sufficient of itself in a particular case, and ordinarily several of them will be required for strict liability. On the other hand, it is not necessary that each of them be present, especially if others weigh heavily.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 cmt. f (Am. Law Inst. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Though the doctrine of strict liability has evolved since the rule in <em>Rylands </em>was first announced,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the policy concerns in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>favor of limiting its application remain. Previously, when this Court was still applying the rule in <em>Rylands, </em>this Court noted that without strict limitations, \u201cthe rule would impose grievous burdens as incident to the ownership of land____\u201d <em>Toy, </em>176 Md. at 213, 4 A.2d at 765. In <em>Rosenblatt, </em>we discussed the nature of the limitations on the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">We have taken care to limit the application of this doctrine because of the heavy burden it places upon a user of land. Our cases have limited the class of abnormally dangerous activities to those activities which would be abnormally dangerous in relation to the area where they occur. Moreover, we have limited the doctrine with regard to the class of actors to which it applies: we have required that the one engaging in the relevant activity have ownership or control over the land.... And, finally, we have required that the act have a relation to the occupation or ownership of land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9Y\">335 Md. at 73-74, 642 A.2d at 187 (internal citations omitted). In <em>Kelley, </em>we refused to apply the doctrine in a case involving a minor\u2019s death caused by the firing of a handgun. 304 Md. at 133, 497 A.2d at 1147. \u201cThe dangers inherent in the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime ... bear no relation to any occupation or ownership of land. Therefore, the abnormally dangerous activity doctrine does not apply to the manufacture or marketing of handguns.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">After applying the Restatement\u2019s multi-factor test, in <em>Kirby v. Hylton, </em>the Court of Special Appeals declined to expand the strict liability doctrine where a minor was fatally injured after playing -with, and being run over by, a heavy pipe. 51 Md.App. 365, 375, 443 A.2d 640, 645-46 (1982). The intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">We find that we need not address the issues of escape and intervention because we do not think that the storage of a pipe in the instant case is an abnormally dangerous activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>according to the criteria set forth in \u00a7 520 of the tentative draft and quoted in <em>Yommer </em>.... Because the activity did not entail an unreasonable risk of harm, the appellants must show negligence in order to recover and cannot rely on the doctrine of strict liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><em>Kirby, </em>51 Md.App. at 375-76, 443 A.2d at 645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In <em>Gallagher v. H.V. Pierhomes, LLC, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that pile driving was not an abnormally dangerous activity. 182 Md.App. 94, 113, 957 A.2d 628, 639 (2008). There, pile driving operations at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore City caused minor damage in a 200 year old residence located 325 feet away from the construction site. <em>Gallagher, </em>182 Md.App. at 110, 957 A.2d at 637. The intermediate appellate court found that the defendants had acted appropriately in obtaining the proper permits, conducting geotechnical studies, and carefully monitoring the vibrations produced by the pile driving operations. \u201c[Tjhere was only a single recorded vibration that exceeded the limits.\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>182 Md. App. at 99-100, 957 A.2d at 631. The court concluded that the risk of harm produced by pile driving operations \u201cis not a high degree of risk which requires the application of strict liability\u201d because that risk can be eliminated \u201cthrough the exercise of ordinary care.\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>182 Md.App. at 110, 957 A.2d at 637-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Jurisdictional Split on Strict Liability and Fireworks</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Whether fireworks discharge constitutes an abnormally dangerous activity is a case of first impression in Maryland, because fireworks liability normally arises in the context of nuisance and negligence litigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Some jurisdictions, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ever, have addressed the issue of whether fireworks are abnormally dangerous. As evidenced by the cases below, litigation often came to fruition due to a malfunction or misfire at a fireworks display, which resulted in spectator injuries. Although fireworks liability eases often share similar facts, jurisdictions disagree on whether discharging fireworks is an abnormally dangerous activity, as evident by the split of legal authority on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The highest appellate court in Washington, for instance, held pyrotechnicians strictly liable when a shell exploded improperly and injured spectators at a public fireworks show. <em>Klein v. Pyrodyne Corp., </em>117 Wash.2d 1, 810 P.2d 917, <em>amended by </em>117 Wash.2d 1, 817 P.2d 1859 (1991). It stated that Restatement factors (a) through (d) weighed in favor of imposing strict liability, because discharging fireworks creates a \u201chigh risk of serious bodily injury or property damage\u201d due to the possibility of a malfunction or similar issue. <em>Klein, </em>810 P.2d at 922. \u201cThe dangerousness ... is evidenced by the elaborate scheme of administrative regulations with which pyrotechnicians must comply[,]\u201d including licensing and insurance requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 920. Under factor (d), it further determined that discharging fireworks was not a matter of common usage, because the licensing scheme restricts the general public from engaging in that activity. <em>Id. </em>at 921. In addition to the high risk discharging fireworks creates, that court determined that public policy and fairness warranted strict liability. <em>Id. </em>at 922. Otherwise, the injured spectators would have been subject to the \u201cproblem of proof\u2019 because \u201call evidence was destroyed as to what caused the misfire of the shell that injured the Kleins.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Arizona\u2019s intermediate appellate court was persuaded by the rationale in <em>Klein </em>in a case involving a misfire at a mall-sponsored fireworks display. <em>Miller v. Westcor Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>171 Ariz. 387, 831 P.2d 386, 392 (Ct.App.1991). Although the issue was in the context of negligence liability under \u00a7 427 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, like <em>Klein, </em>it found that the risk of malfunction or misfire could not be entirely eliminated, and that the \u201clegislature has also recognized the dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>gerousness of fireworks by regulating their use\u201d as reflected in a \u201cstatutory requirement that a pyrotechnician obtain a surety bond or certificate of insurance for at least $1,000,000 in order to obtain a license to conduct a public fireworks display.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>831 P.2d at 391-92. Therefore, it held that public fireworks displays were an inherently dangerous activity-</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Other jurisdictions, however, have come to the opposite conclusion, and have held that the level of risk involved with a fireworks discharge does not warrant strict liability. In <em>Haddon v. Lotito, </em>Pennsylvania\u2019s highest appellate court applied the ultrahazardous activity test, and determined that strict liability \u2014 referred to as absolute liability \u2014 did not apply in a case involving spectator injuries at a public fireworks display. 399 Pa. 521, 161 A.2d 160, 162 (1960). Critically, that court distinguished lawful from unlawful fireworks displays:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[A] public fireworks display, handled by a competent operator in a reasonably safe area and properly supervised (and there is no proof to the contrary herein), is not so dangerous an activity____Where one discharges fireworks illegally or in such a manner as to amount to a nuisance and causes injury to another, some jurisdictions have held that liability follows without more. But the production of a public fireworks display, under the circumstances presented herein, is neither illegal nor a nuisance and, consequently, liability, if existing, must be predicated upon proof of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Other courts have ruled similarly. In <em>Litzmann v. Humboldt Cty., </em>California\u2019s intermediate appellate court determined that \u201cthe handling and discharge of fireworks ... were not such as to come within the definition of ultrahazardous activities.\u201d 273 P.2d 82, 88 (Cal.Dist.Ct.App.1954). In that case, an undischarged firework was negligently discarded on fairgrounds, and a minor was severely injured when he found and ignited it. After applying the Restatement factors, that court declined to impose strict liability, because \u201c[i]t was the failure of care that caused the injuries and not the nature of the risks involved.\u201d <em>Litzmann, </em>273 P.2d at 88.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>[TJhese risks could be eliminated by a degree of care far within the bounds of \u2018utmost care\u2019.... [B]y the method of firing adopted[,] it was a reasonably easy matter to direct the firing so that injury would not arise through misdirection of the missiles; and that observation by those skilled enough to be licensed to explode fireworks was adequate to detect the lack of explosion of the material shot into the air. It appears, therefore, that the activities engaged in and charged to be ultrahazardous were in fact risks which could be and would be eliminated if commensurate care had been exercised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In <em>Cadena v. Chicago Fireworks Mfg. Co., </em>the Illinois intermediate appellate court stated that only Restatement factors (a), which focuses on the existence of a high degree of risk of some harm, and (b), which concerns the likelihood that the harm that results will be great, weighed in favor of strict liability. 297 Ill.App.3d 945, 232 Ill.Dec. 60, 697 N.E.2d 802, 814 (1998) <em>overruled on other grounds by Ries v. City of Chicago, </em>242 Ill.2d 205, 351 Ill.Dec. 135, 950 N.E.2d 631 (2011). Notably, that court reminded readers that factor (c) \u201cdoes not require the reduction of <em>all </em>risk\u201d and that \u201cthe exercise of reasonable care in displaying fireworks will significantly reduce the risks involved [in a fireworks display].\u201d <em>Cadena, </em>232 Ill.Dec. 60, 697 N.E.2d at 814 (emphasis in original).

Law Inst. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Toms argues that the facts of the case are sufficient to show that each factor weighs in favor of imposing strict liability. He maintains that the resulting sudden loud explosions, for example, involve a high risk of harm that can trigger a startle reflex in dairy cows, which are known to be large, clumsy animals. That startle reflex may cause, as Toms alleges happened here, the cows to stampede and cause injuries to themselves as well as to property. Under factor (c), Toms posits that there is no way to eliminate this risk other than by choosing an alternative location to host the fireworks display. He also argues that the risk can be mitigated with advanced notice to the owner of the dairy cows of the fireworks display. For instance, Toms states that he was never given specific or general notice aside from a banner on Calvary\u2019s property advertising the event. With advanced notice, Toms contends he could have mitigated the risks by moving the cows from the barn to an outdoor enclosure. Toms further argues that factor (d) weighs in his favor, because although \u201cfireworks displays at public parks, ballparks, and the like, are common, exploding fireworks adjacent to an active dairy farm is not.\u201d Additionally, under factor (e), discharging fireworks 300 to 500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>feet from a herd of cattle, in Toms\u2019 view, \u201cis a disaster waiting to happen\u201d and therefore, is not an appropriate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">For support, Toms cites to <em>Toy v. Atl. Gulf &amp; Pac. Co., </em>and its discussion of liability without fault when an \u201coccupier was not using the land in the common and natural way, and had artificially produced the potential danger....\u201d 176 Md. 197, 213, 4 A.2d 757, 765 (1939). Toms states that the property of Auburn Farms, Inc. was not being used in the \u201ccommon and natural way\u201d because it was hosting a one-time event. Toms further argues that under factor (f), a local church activity provides little benefit to the community, and does not outweigh the risks associated with the fireworks display to the adjacent dairy farm operation. Lastly, in addition to the Restatement factors, Toms highlights important policy considerations. \u201cBecause of population growth in Maryland, the interaction [between] farmers and development is a continuing issue----Expanding Maryland case law to provide protection for farmers against damages from such abnormal intrusion would meet a social need.\u201d Toms argues that he sustained a preventable injury, and if the court does not impose strict liability, it shall remain an injury without remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The respondents contend that the lower courts were correct in determining that, based on the facts of this case, strict liability is inapplicable, because evidence is insufficient to support Toms\u2019 claim that the noise produced by the fireworks discharge is abnormally dangerous to livestock. As support, the respondents cite to Md.Code (2003, 2011 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article as evidence that the General Assembly \u201chas already regulated the use of fireworks, and it does not afford protection to the chattel for noise.\u201d Furthermore, they posit, the Restatement factors do not support expanding the doctrine of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities. In their view, all the factors weigh in favor of the respondents. Under factor (a), there is not a high degree of risk associated with the discharge of fireworks, because the use of fireworks is heavily regulated: a deputy fire marshal inspected and authorized the firing location, and testified that the respondents lawfully complied with the per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>miffing </em>process; the respondents obtained a permit for the event; Mr. Lindberg voluntarily extended the firing radius an additional 50 feet beyond the State\u2019s requirement; a senior deputy fire marshal supervised the event, and testified that the shells were properly discharged with no misfires or duds. Furthermore, the respondents contend that Toms did not provide evidence that the risk of cows stampeding due to sudden loud noise is commonly known. Under factor (b), the most common risks associated with a fireworks display\u2014 mishandling, misfires, and malfunctions \u2014 did not occur in the instant case. There is no evidence of the foreseeability of a herd of dairy cows suffering great harm from a fireworks display. In the past, similar fireworks displays have taken place in close proximity to Toms\u2019 dairy farm operation without apparent incident. Factor (c) is resolved in the respondents\u2019 favor, they suggest, because Toms was aware of the event. Lastly, the respondents state that factors (d) through (f) do not weigh in favor of strict liability, because fireworks displays are a frequent event in the city of Walkersville, the event was open to the public, and applicable laws were not violated. No noise ordinances were violated and advanced notice to Toms was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In applying the clearly erroneous standard as it applies to questions of fact, we are satisfied with the evidentiary findings made by the District Court. There was sufficient evidence in the record to support those findings. Therefore, we need only review <em>de novo </em>the question of law for the issue of whether strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity should be imposed on a lawful fireworks display.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Maryland defines fireworks as \u201ccombustible, implosive or explosive compositions, substances, combinations of substances, or articles that are prepared to produce a visible or audible effect by combustion, explosion, implosion, deflagration, or detonation.\u201d Md.Code (2003, 2011 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-101(f) of the Public Safety Article. We disagree with Toms that our analysis should be so narrow as to focus solely on the audible component \u2014 the noise produced \u2014 by a fireworks display. In the petition for writ of certiorari, Toms refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cnoise of a fireworks discharge,\u201d but the noise itself is a byproduct of the activity of discharging fireworks. By definition, under \u00a7 10 \u2014 101(f) of the Public Safety Article, fireworks \u201care prepared to produce a visible or audible effect----\u201d Therefore, when applying the multi-factor test from \u00a7 520 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, we will consider all the characteristics and the nature of the risks associated with discharging fireworks. After all, we are also mindful that \u201c[o]ne who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is not under strict liability for every possible harm that may result from carrying it on.\u201d Restatement (Second) op Torts \u00a7 519 cmt. e (Am. Law Inst. 1977). We apply the Restatement factors to the instant case:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others. Special events requiring the use of large, professional \u201cdisplay fireworks\u201d are heavily regulated in Maryland pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article. In accordance with \u00a7 10-104, each fireworks display requires a permit to discharge fireworks. The authority to grant such permits is vested in the State Fire Marshal. In pertinent part, \u00a7 10-103 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the State Fire Marshal may issue a permit to authorize the discharge of fireworks in a place where the discharge of fireworks is legal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">(b) <em>Findings required by State Fire Marshal. </em>\u2014 The State Fire Marshal shall issue a permit to discharge fireworks only if the State Fire Marshal determines that the proposed discharge of fireworks will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">(1) not endanger health or safety or damage property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">(2) be supervised by an experienced and qualified person who has previously secured written authority from the State Fire Marshal to discharge fireworks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">In order to obtain a permit, an individual must submit an \u201cApplication for Public Fireworks Display\u201d to the State Fire Marshal. The application requires, among other things, event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>information, and the size and number of shells to be used. It also requires the firework company\u2019s contact information, proof of insurance, and its agent-shooter\u2019s name and the shooter\u2019s permit number. Additionally, prior to submitting the application, the site must be inspected and approved by an authority having jurisdiction. Md.Code (2003, 2011 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-107 of the Public Safety Article. Here, the site was found to be an appropriate location, and it was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">We hold that a lawful fireworks display does not pose a high degree of risk, because the statutory scheme in place is designed to significantly reduce the risks associated with fireworks, namely mishandling, misfires, and malfunctions. Furthermore, the required firing radius of 250 feet was voluntarily extended by Mr. Lindberg to 300 feet. Critically, in enacting the Public Safety Article, the General Assembly did not regulate the audible effects of display fireworks, which indicates that any risk associated with the decibel level of a fireworks discharge is minimal or non-existent.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Lawful fireworks displays do not pose a significant risk because \u201c[a] person who possesses or discharges fireworks in violation\u201d of the permitting process \u201cis guilty of a misdemean- or and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $250 for each offense.\u201d Md.Code (2003, 2011 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-lll(a) of the Public Safety Article. To impose a relatively light penalty for an unlawful fireworks display is telling. If an unlawful fireworks display is only a misdemeanor offense with no possibility of incarceration, why then should strict liability be imposed for risks associated with a lawful fireworks display?</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great. This factor also weighs in favor of not imposing strict liability, because the purpose of a 300 foot perimeter surrounding the firing location is to mitigate the likelihood of harm. The instructions sheet attached to the \u201cApplication for Public Fireworks Display\u201d states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">If other properties are in the fall out zone of the fireworks, a letter must be attached from the property owner or representative of the property owner stating that they give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>permission for their property to be used in the fall out zone. If any structures are within the fall out zone, the owner of the structure must provide documentation that the structure will not be occupied during the fireworks display. All structures within the fall out zone shall be deemed as being unimportant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The statutory scheme regulating the use of fireworks is specifically designed to reduce risk. \u201cThe harm threatened must be major in degree, and sufficiently serious in its possible consequences to justify holding the defendant strictly responsible for subjecting others to an unusual risk. It is not enough that there is a recognizable risk of some relatively slight harm \u2014 \u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 cmt. g (Am Law Inst. 1977). <em>See also Gallagher, </em>182 Md.App. at 110, 957 A.2d at 637 (\u201cUnder section 520(b), a plaintiff must show that the defendants\u2019 pile driving was likely to produce significant harm, not simply that she suffered some harm as a result of the pile driving activity.\u201d). Because Toms\u2019 dairy barn, and therefore his cows, were not located within the fall out zone, the likelihood of harm to the public and property was significantly reduced. The 300 foot firing radius was effective because no shells fired that night malfunctioned, and no debris littered Toms\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care. We are reminded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">It is not necessary, for the factor stated in Clause (c) to apply, that the risk be one that no conceivable precautions or care could eliminate. What is referred to here is the unavoidable risk remaining in the activity, even though the actor has taken all reasonable precautions in advance and has exercised all reasonable care in his operation, so that he is not negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 cmt. h (Am. Law Inst. 1977). We disagree with Toms that reasonable care cannot reduce the risk of harm to livestock to acceptable levels. In enacting \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article, the General Assembly took care to implement sufficient precau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tions so as to ensure that lawful fireworks displays can be a safe and enjoyable activity. This is evidenced by the active role the State Fire Marshal and authorities having jurisdiction have over the permitting process. Pursuant to \u00a7 10 \u2014 103(b) of the Public Safety Article, the \u201cState Fire Marshal shall issue a permit to discharge fireworks\u201d upon a determination that the proposed event will \u201c(1) not endanger health or safety or damage property; and (2) be supervised by an experienced and qualified person who has previously secured written authority from the State Fire Marshal to discharge fireworks.\u201d Health and safety, therefore, are of paramount concern, and we are satisfied that the regulations sufficiently protect the public and property. Only qualified professional fireworks companies and their agents \u2014 authorized shooters \u2014 may apply for a permit. The requirements of mandatory insurance coverage, a physical site inspection, and event supervision is evidence of reasonable care that reduces the risk of harm. The site inspection and prior approval of an authority having jurisdiction ensures that the firing location is appropriate and that injury is unlikely. Importantly, additional measures are required if other properties are located within the fall out zone, including notice and permission from that property owner for their property to be used in the fall out zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The 300 foot firing radius is sufficient. Furthermore, notice to Toms was not necessary, because his dairy barn was located beyond the firing radius. In our view, the Restatement does not require the elimination of all risk, and because the risks inherent with a fireworks discharge can be reduced to acceptable levels, this factor does not support a conclusion of an abnormally dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"> (d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage. \u201cAn activity is a matter of common usage if it is customarily carried on by the great mass of mankind, or by many people in the community.\u201d <em>Yommer, </em>255 Md. at 225 n. 2, 257 A.2d at 140 (citation omitted). We recognize that the discharging of lawful fireworks displays is a matter of common usage. In a letter dated July 3, 1776, John Adams wrote about the pomp and circumstance that should surround the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>celebration of our Nation\u2019s independence: \u201cI am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations.... It ought to be solemnized with ... Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As stated in \u00a7 10-101 of the Public Safety Article, fireworks are designed \u201cto produce a visible or audible effect\u201d for the benefit of spectators. Therefore, we define \u201ccommon usage,\u201d as it pertains to this case, broadly to include not only the professionals who discharge fireworks, but also the spectators who partake in the fireworks display. Almost by definition, lawful fireworks displays involve two parties: the shooter and the audience. We conclude that lawful fireworks displays are a matter of common usage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See also Cadena, </em>282 Ill.Dec. 60, 697 N.E.2d at 814 (determining that the \u201csocial utility\u201d of fireworks displays to communities \u201cis not outweighed by its dangerous attributes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on. When this Court adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts\u2019 multi-factor test for abnormally dangerous activities, this particular factor was identified as being the most crucial. <em>Yommer, </em>255 Md. at 225, 257 A.2d at 140. \u201cThe thrust of the doctrine is that the activity be abnormally dangerous in relation to the area where it occurs.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 133, 497 A.2d at 1147. Implicit in the granting of a permit to discharge fireworks, is the lawfulness of that pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>posed fireworks display. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-103(a) of the Public Safety Article (\u201c[T]he State Fire Marshal may issue a permit to authorize the discharge of fireworks in a place where the discharge of fireworks is legal.\u201d). At trial, two deputy fire marshals testified about the procedures entailed with the permitting process, that a physical site inspection showed that the proposed firing location was appropriate, that the event was supervised and properly executed, and that the respondents complied with all applicable laws. Furthermore, Deputy Fire Marshal Ruch testified that although the State required a perimeter of 250 feet from the firing location, the respondents voluntarily extended it to 300 feet. Additionally, Senior Deputy Fire Marshal Guderjohn testified that previous fireworks displays had taken place within a mile of Toms\u2019 dairy barn. Notably, Frederick County does not have a noise ordinance regulating the decibel level of fireworks. If Frederick County enacted regulations further restricting the use of fireworks, the respondents would be obliged to comply with those regulations in addition to applicable State laws. After all, pursuant to \u00a7 10 \u2014 103(c)(1) of the Public Safety Article, a permit to discharge fireworks \u201cdoes not authorize the holder of the permit to possess or discharge fireworks in violation of an ordinance or regulation of the political subdivision where the fireworks are to be discharged....\u201d In sum, we do agree that a lawful fireworks display does not fall within the context of \u201cthe unusual, the excessive, the extravagant, the bizarre .... non-natural uses which lead to strict liability.\u201d <em>Yommer, </em>255 Md. at 226, 257 A.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes. Here, a church-sponsored fireworks display celebrated a youth crusade, and the event was open to the public. As a symbol of celebration, fireworks play an important role in our society, and are often met with much fanfare. The statutory scheme regulating its use minimizes the risk of accidents, thus, reinforcing the popularity of these displays. This Court recognizes that not all segments of the population may enjoy fireworks displays, especially those with noise sensitivities, however, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that the social desirability of fireworks appear to outweigh their dangerous attributes.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Policy considerations. We are mindful that the doctrine of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities is narrowly applied in order to avoid imposing \u201cgrievous burdens\u201d on landowners and occupiers of land. <em>Toy, </em>176 Md. at 213, 4 A.2d at 765. Toms argues that we should expand the factual application of this doctrine, however, the Restatement factors do not support such a position. The use of fireworks, especially in public fireworks displays, is heavily regulated pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article. Under \u00a7 10-103, a permit to discharge fireworks cannot be obtained <em>unless </em>the State Fire Marshal determines that proposed fireworks display will \u201cnot endanger health or safety or damage property....\u201d In light of this policy, the respondents cannot be held strictly liable, because they lawfully complied with the conditions of the permit as well as applicable laws. We are persuaded by the rationale in <em>Haddon: </em>\u201ca public fireworks display, handled by a competent operator in a reasonably safe area and properly supervised (and there is no proof to the contrary herein), is not so dangerous an activity.\u201d 161 A.2d at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">At issue in this case is a lawful fireworks display that was implemented pursuant to the requirements of the Public Safety Article. At trial, Toms did not present any evidence concerning what noise levels should be appropriate for public fireworks display. Sufficient evidence was not presented to the trier of fact that a lawful fireworks display was abnormally dangerous to livestock. Thus, as a matter of law and on a case-by-case basis, we do not extend the doctrine of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court. Lawful fireworks displays are not an abnormally dangerous activity, because the statutory scheme regulating the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>fireworks significantly reduces the risk of harm associated with the discharge of fireworks. Furthermore, it is not the province of the Judiciary, but rather, the Legislature to determine zoning classifications and enact noise ordinances that would further regulate the use of fireworks.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The parties disagree as to how much notice Toms had of the event, although the District Court Judge found that Toms had at least some notice.

Upon arrival, Toms testified, he saw four \"downed\u201d cows meaning the cows were lying down on the concrete floor of the barn, and were unable to stand up. Despite Toms' attempts to assist the cattle and after phone consultations with his veterinarian, after a week, only one cow was able to stand up. Therefore, Toms had to put down the other three dairy cows. One month later, the fourth cow was culled and sold for slaughter, because it lost utility: it could no longer produce milk or become pregnant. \"Cull\u201d is defined as \"[something picked out from others, [especially] something rejected due to inferior quality.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 280 (3rd ed.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. We granted Toms\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari, which raised the single issue of strict liability. In his brief to this Court, Toms raised the additional question of whether the lower court erred in not finding the discharge of 250 shells constituted a nuisance, and he briefly addressed the issue during oral arguments. In order to resolve the issue of strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity, we need not, and do not, address the nuisance issue raised in Toms\u2019 brief. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">. \u201cDean Thayer pointed out the error in the popular assumption that the rule of <em>Rylands v. Fletcher </em>makes the defendant liable for all consequences in fact resulting from his conduct. This is precisely what the rule of the case does <em>not </em>do; it makes [the] defendant liable ... only for proximate consequences, not for remote consequences.\u201d Fowler V. Harper, <em>Liability Without Fault and Proximate Cause, </em>30 Mich. L.Rev. 1001, 1005 (1932) (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">. The common law concept of strict liability was first articulated in <em>Rylands v. Fletcher. </em>Later, it was incorporated into the Restatement of Torts. It referred to strict liability as \"absolute liability\u201d and imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>such liability on persons engaging in \"ultrahazardous activities.\u201d Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 520-524 (Am. Law Inst. 1938). The modem version of the doctrine is found in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 519-520, and refers instead to \"abnormally dangerous activities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">. Under certain circumstances, causes of action may exist in cases involving fireworks liability under the theories of negligence or nuisance. <em>See Crowley v. Rochester Fireworks Co., </em>183 N.Y. 353, 76 N.E. 470 (1906) (\u2018\u2018[T]here may be negligence in the character of the fireworks used on a particular occasion as well as in the method of their discharge.\u201d); <em>Little v. Union Trust Co. of Maryland, </em>45 Md.App. 178, 183, 412 A.2d 1251, 1254 (1980) (discussing possible nuisance liability for shooting fireworks in the street).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">. In the petition for writ of certiorari, Toms states \"This Court ... can expand the factual application of this tort to instances where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>sudden, abnormal noise of a fireworks display, adjacent to livestock, can create strict liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\">. <em>Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776, </em>Mass.

Although we determine that lawful fireworks displays are a matter of common usage for shooter and spectator alike, this is based on the social nature of the activity. Previous courts have applied a narrower construction of the term \"common usage,\u201d but those activities lacked the positive social element in the instant case. <em>See Yommer, 255 </em>Md. at 224-25, 257 A.2d at 140 (determining that the placement of \u201ca large underground gasoline tank in close proximity to the appellees\u2019 residence ... is not a matter of common usage\u201d); <em>Gallagher, </em>182 Md.App. at 111, 957 A.2d at 638 (stating that although pile driving is a common activity in the area where it took place, \"the average citizen has not personally conducted any pile driving activity, nor is it their custom to do so\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
