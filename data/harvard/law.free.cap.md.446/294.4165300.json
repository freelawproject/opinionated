Landeo\u2019s clients and/or family members filed complaints against Landeo with the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">On December 30, 2014, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Landeo, charging her with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 1.5(a) (Reasonable Fees), 1.15(a), 1.15(c), 1.15(d) (Safekeeping Property), 1.16(d) (Terminating Representation), 5.3(a), 5.3(b), 5.3(c) (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation), 8.4(d) (Conduct That is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), 8.4(a) (Violating MLRPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>On January 15, 2015, this Court designated the Honorable Steven G. Salant (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On August 3, 4, and 5, 2015, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On September 28, 2015, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that: (1) as to the Castillo matter, Landeo had violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, 1.16, and 8.4, but had not violated MLRPC 1.5; (2) as to the Flores matter, Landeo had violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, 1.16, and 8.4, but had not violated MLRPC 1.5 or 5.3;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) as to the Martinez-Ramos matter, Landeo had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4, but had not violated MLRPC 1.5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,1.16, or 5.3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On January 7, 2016, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we indefinitely suspend Landeo from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">On December 12, 2001, this Court admitted Landeo to the Bar of Maryland. Since January 2004, Landeo has worked at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Landeo and Capriotti, LLC, which focuses on immigration law. Landeo is not fluent in any language other than English. Thus, Landeo uses bilingual office assistants to communicate with Spanish-speaking clients; none of the office assistants are certified interpreters or translators.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<em>The Castillo Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In 2003, Castillo, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States illegally. Castillo is fluent in Spanish, speaks little English, and cannot read English.' In 2009, Castillo married Steven Keener, Jr. (\u201cKeener\u201d), a United States citizen. Keener is fluent in English, but not Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On February 23, 2012, Castillo and Keener met with Landeo for the first and only time. Castillo and Keener retained Landeo to file three documents on Castillo\u2019s behalf to assist Castillo in obtaining legal permanent resident status. The first document \u2014 Form 1-130, or an \u201cImmediate Family Petition\u201d \u2014 would, if granted, allow Castillo to obtain a green card<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> through \u201cconsular processing,\u201d or applying in person at the United States consulate in Guatemala. The second document \u2014 Form 1-601, or a \u201cWaiver of Unlawful Presence\u201d\u2014 would, if granted, allow Castillo to return to the United States without being subject to the rule that an illegal immigrant who returns to his or her home country cannot return to the United States for ten years. The third document was a visa<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> application.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Keener paid Landeo a $600 retainer and agreed to pay $200 per month for sixteen months, for a total of $3,800 in attorney\u2019s fees, plus a $520 filing fee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the Immediate Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Petition. Keener ended up paying Landeo a total of $3,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and the $520 filing fee. Landeo did not deposit the attorney\u2019s fees or filing fee into an attorney trust account, nor did Landeo have Castillo\u2019s and Keener\u2019s consent, confirmed in writing, to deposit the fees into an account other than an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Landeo testified that she planned to refrain from filing the Immediate Family Petition until after the Department of Homeland Security promulgated an amendment to the regulation regarding waiver of unlawful presence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Landeo failed to adequately convey, either herself or through her staff, to either Castillo or Keener that she planned to wait to file the Immediate Family Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Landeo provided Castillo and Keener with a retainer agreement that was in English. Landeo did not provide a retainer agreement that was in Spanish. The retainer agreement stated: \u201cI/We acknowledge that each and every part of this legal services agreement has been explained to me in Spanish by the person named below as an interpreter.\u201d The retainer agreement, however, did not name an interpreter, and no interpreter was present at the meeting; Castillo relied on Keener to communicate with Landeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In a letter dated April 16, 2012, Landeo requested that Castillo and Keener provide the $520 filing fee and the documents that were necessary to file the Immediate Family Petition. As of July 2012, Castillo and Keener had provided Landeo the filing fee and all of the documents that were necessary to file the Immediate Family Petition. On July 30, 2012, Landeo signed an attorney appearance form to be attached to the Immediate Family Petition. Landeo, however, did not file the Immediate Family Petition with the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> until nearly eight months later, on March 28, 2013. In the interim, on January 3, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security published the amendment to the regulation regarding waiver of unlawful presence; and, on March 4, 2013, the amendment became effective. The amendment in no way affected the form or substance of Immediate Family Petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Between May 2012 and March 2013, Landeo never directly communicated with Castillo or Keener, despite Castillo\u2019s multiple attempts to speak with Landeo. Between May 2012 and March 2013, Castillo telephoned Landeo\u2019s office at least fifteen times requesting status updates and information as to the filing of the Immediate Family Petition. Castillo requested that Landeo call her back, but Landeo failed to do so. Keener also attempted to speak with Landeo by telephone. Whenever Castillo and Keener telephoned Landeo\u2019s office to speak with Landeo, a member of the firm\u2019s staff told them that Landeo was \u201cunavailable.\u201d When Keener was unable to speak with Landeo by telephone and requested a meeting with Landeo, the firm\u2019s office manager indicated that, under the retainer agreement, Keener would need to pay $250 for a meeting with Landeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Castillo and Keener decided to check the Immediate Family Petition\u2019s status on USCIS\u2019s website, but discovered that they needed the receipt number to monitor its progress. When Castillo and Keener telephoned Landeo\u2019s office, the firm\u2019s office manager told them that the Immediate Family Petition was \u201cin process,\u201d which they took to mean that the Immediate Family Petition had been filed, and Landeo was awaiting a receipt number. On multiple later occasions, Castillo asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Landeo\u2019s office for a receipt number so that she could check the Immediate Family Petition\u2019s status on USCIS\u2019s website, and a member of the firm\u2019s staff told Castillo that Landeo was unavailable and that the staff member was not in a position to provide the receipt number. Landeo never explained to Castillo or Keener why she delayed in filing the Immediate Family Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In March 2013, Castillo telephoned USCIS and learned that Landeo had not yet filed the Immediate Family Petition. On March 20, 2013, Keener telephoned Landeo\u2019s office and stated that he would stop paying fees until Landeo provided a receipt for the filing of the Immediate Family Petition. Eight days later, Landeo filed the Immediate Family Petition. Castillo and Keener had been unaware of any plan on Landeo\u2019s part to file the Immediate Family Petition in mid-March 2013. On April 4, 2013, the firm\u2019s office manager telephoned Keener to tell him that he had a receipt number for the Immediate Family Petition. By that time, however, Keener had already told Landeo\u2019s office that he and Castillo were terminating Landeo\u2019s representation and were in the process of retaining a new lawyer. After the termination of her representation, Landeo sent Castillo and Keener a bill for $4,205.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On April 5, 2013, Castillo and Keener retained a new immigration lawyer, Xavier Racine (\u201cRacine\u201d), to file an Immediate Family Petition and a Waiver of Unlawful Presence. On that day, Racine sent to Landeo a letter in which he requested the contents of Castillo\u2019s file as well as a refund of unearned fees. On April 8, 2013, Landeo received the letter. In addition to sending the letter, Racine telephoned Landeo\u2019s office to facilitate the transfer of the file, but was unable to speak with Landeo; instead, Racine was able to communicate with Landeo only through an office assistant and via e-mail. Landeo\u2019s office assistant told Racine that the file had been sent to him, but it had not. On May 21, 2013, in response to an e-mail from Racine, Landeo e-mailed Racine to state that the documents in Castillo\u2019s file would be scanned and sent to his office. Racine waited until June 13, 2013, but Landeo did not send the documents in Castillo\u2019s file or provide a refund to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Castillo and Keener; as such, Racine filed a complaint with the Commission against Landeo. As of August 6, 2013, Racine had not received Castillo\u2019s file, and Castillo and Keener had not received a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\n<em>The Flores Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In July 2002, Flores, a native and citizen of El Salvador, entered the United States illegally. Flores speaks English, but prefers communicating in Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">On October 1, 2010, Flores met with Landeo and retained Landeo to file two documents on her behalf. The first document \u2014 Form 1-360, or an \u201cAbused Spouse Petition\u201d \u2014 is a petition filed by an immigrant who is protected under the Violence Against Women Act, if he or she is married to a United States citizen and is a victim of domestic violence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The second document \u2014 Form 1-485, or an \u201cAdjustment of Status\u201d \u2014 would, if approved, allow Flores to get a green card for work authorization.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In the retainer agreement, Flores agreed to pay Landeo $2,500 in attorney\u2019s fees, plus a $1,170 filing fee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As of June 1, 2011, Flores had paid Landeo $2,500. On August 30, 2012, Flores paid the filing fee. Landeo never placed the fees in an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>As of June 27, 2011, Flores had provided Landeo with all of the documents that were necessary to file the Abused Spouse Petition, and Flores had signed the Abused Spouse Petition; thus, as of that date, the Abused Spouse Petition was ready for filing. Landeo, however, did not file the Abused Spouse Petition until nearly three months later, on September 22, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">At some point after the filing of the Abused Spouse Petition, Landeo\u2019s office forwarded to Flores letters in which USCIS stated that it had made \u201ca <em>prima facie </em>determination\u201d as to the Abused Spouse Petition. Between July 6, 2012 and October 1, 2012, Landeo mailed to Flores letters informing Flores that the <em>\u201cprima facie </em>determination\u201d as to her classification as an abused spouse of a United States citizen had been extended. Flores requested from Landeo an explanation of USCIS\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>determination as to the Abused Spouse Petition, but Landeo never provided Flores with an explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In a letter dated July 6, 2012, Landeo recommended filing the Adjustment of Status before USCIS approved the Abused Spouse Petition; the retainer agreement, however, provided that the Adjustment of Status would be filed after USCIS approved the Abused Spouse Petition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although it was not possible to obtain a work permit while the Abused Spouse Petition was pending, in the July 6, 2012 letter, Landeo stated that Flores \u201cmay wish to proceed with filing [her Adjustment of [SJtatus application so that [she could] obtain work authorization while\u201d the Abused Spouse petition was pending. In a letter dated July 10, 2012, Flores agreed to having the Adjustment of Status filed before USCIS approved the Abused Spouse Petition. Landeo, however, never explained the process to Flores.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>As of September 27, 2012, Flores had provided Landeo with all of the documents that were necessary to file the Adjustment of Status. Landeo, however, never filed the Adjustment of Status.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">On December 4 and 7, 2012, Flores telephoned Landeo\u2019s office asking for a status update. During the latter telephone call, a member of Landeo\u2019s staff told Flores that Landeo would telephone her when the Adjustment of Status was \u201cready for signature.\u201d On December 17, 2012, Flores visited Landeo\u2019s office to ask for a copy of her file. At some point between December 17 and 27, 2012, Flores terminated Landeo\u2019s representation and retained a new lawyer, Jonathan Bloom (\u201cBloom\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On December 27, 2012, Bloom mailed and faxed to Landeo a letter in which he requested Flores\u2019s file. On January 2, 2013, Landeo mailed to Bloom a letter in which she stated that would \u201cscan and e[-]mail [Flores\u2019s] file before the end of the week.\u201d As of January 18, 2013, Bloom had not received anything else from Landeo; on that date, Bloom sent to Landeo a second letter in which he requested Flores\u2019s file. On January 24, 2013, a member of Landeo\u2019s staff e-mailed to Bloom scanned copies of Flores\u2019s file. In a letter dated February 7, 2013, Bloom reiterated his request for the originals of Flores\u2019s file and requested a refund of the $1,170 filing fee and $1,250 in unearned attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On February 22, 2013, Landeo mailed to Bloom Flores\u2019s file and a statement of account, according to which Flores owed Landeo $2,138.72. Landeo never refunded attorney\u2019s fees to Flores.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>The Martinez-Ramos Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In 1997, Martinez-Ramos, a native and citizen of Honduras, entered the United States illegally. Martinez-Ramos does not read or write English, and, at all relevant times, communicated only in Spanish. On or about November 15, 1999, Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tinez-Ramos was granted \u201cTemporary Protective Status,\u201d which allows an immigrant from a country that is suffering from war or natural disaster to be protected from deportation, obtain work authorization, and obtain authorization to leave and return to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In 2009, without authorization from the United States government, Martinez-Ramos left the United States and returned to Honduras. Because Martinez-Ramos failed to get advance permission to leave and re-enter the United States, she was detained when she attempted to illegally re-enter the United States at the Texas border in 2010. On August 21, 2010, an order for Martinez-Ramos\u2019s removal and deportation was issued. Martinez-Ramos was released, however, on an \u201cOrder of Supervision,\u201d which provided her with a conditional grace period to remain in the United States. To avoid removal, Martinez-Ramos had to get her Temporary Protective Status reinstated; in December 2010, USCIS reinstated Martinez-Ramos\u2019s Temporary Protective Status.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In a letter dated June 14, 2012, USCIS informed Martinez-Ramos that it had withdrawn her Temporary Protective Status. In the letter, USCIS stated that Martinez-Ramos could appeal the decision withdrawing her Temporary Protective Status by filing a Form I-290B, or \u201cNotice of Appeal or Motion,\u201d within thirty-three days of the date of the letter; USCIS stated: \u201cIf a motion or appeal is not filed within [thirty-three] days[,] this decision is final.\u201d Thus, the deadline for filing the Notice of Appeal or Motion was July 17, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On July 6, 2012, Martinez-Ramos met with Landeo, and communicated with Landeo through one of Landeo\u2019s part-time assistants, who acted as an interpreter. On that day, Martinez-Ramos retained Landeo to file a \u201cMotion to Reopen/Reconsider Denied/Revoked\u201d Temporary Protective Status on her behalf. Landeo charged Martinez-Ramos $1,600 in attorney\u2019s fees and $730 in filing fees and other costs. Landeo did not deposit the $730 in filing fees and other costs into an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>As of July 10, 2012, Landeo had completed a brief for the Notice of Appeal or Motion. On July 14, 2012, Landeo signed an attorney appearance form. Thus, the Notice of Appeal or Motion was ready for filing three days before the deadline. However, Landeo did not file the Notice of Appeal or Motion until more than three months later, on October 28, 2012. The Notice of Appeal or Motion did not provide any reasons for the late filing. Landeo never explained the late filing to Martinez-Ramos. On December 13, 2012, USCIS denied the untimely Notice of Appeal or Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Meanwhile, on September 12, 2012, Martinez-Ramos retained Landeo to file a work permit application on her behalf. Landeo charged Martinez-Ramos $350 in attorney\u2019s fees and $565 in filing fees and other costs. Landeo never filed the work permit application. Landeo did not deposit the $565 in filing fees and other costs into an attorney trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In September 2012, Martinez-Ramos met with her immigration officer. At the meeting, the immigration officer wrote something on a paper and gave it to Martinez-Ramos; the note was written in English, and Martinez-Ramos, who speaks and writes only in Spanish, was unable to understand the note. Accordingly, Martinez-Ramos went to Landeo\u2019s office to ask for an explanation of the note, but Martinez-Ramos was unable to meet with Landeo to have the note explained to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">On October 1, 2012, Martinez-Ramos visited Landeo\u2019s office to ask for copies of documents so that she could show her immigration officer that she was represented by a lawyer and that she had filed a Notice of Appeal or Motion. On October 12, 2012, during a telephonic conversation, a member of Landeo\u2019s staff told Martinez-Ramos that she could pick up the documents that day. As of that date, however, Landeo had not filed either the Notice of Appeal or Motion or the attorney appearance form.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">On November 7, 2012, Martinez-Ramos visited Landeo\u2019s office to ask whether Landeo had heard anything about the Notice of Appeal or Motion, and to inform Landeo that she would be meeting with her immigration officer on November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>26, 2012. On November 8, 2012, a member of Landeo\u2019s staff informed Martinez-Ramos that Landeo\u2019s office had not heard anything about the Notice of Appeal or Motion, and that, if Landeo\u2019s office had still not heard anything by November 26, 2012, Landeo would telephone Martinez-Ramos\u2019s immigration officer. Landeo failed to telephone Martinez-Ramos\u2019s immigration officer by November 26, 2012. On November 26, 2012, during her meeting with her immigration officer, Martinez-Ramos was detained for purposes of deportation. Between July 6, 2012, when Martinez-Ramos first retained Landeo, and November 26, 2012, when Martinez-Ramos was detained for purposes of deportation, Martinez-Ramos had no direct contact with Landeo. On November 28, 2012, in an e-mail, Landeo wrote that she had spoken with Martinez-Ramos\u2019s immigration officer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">On November 27, 2012, one day after Martinez-Ramos had been detained for purposes of deportation, Martinez-Ramos\u2019s sister, Marcia Vasquez (\u201cVasquez\u201d), and Vasquez\u2019s husband, Isaac Vasquez (\u201cIsaac\u201d), sought to retain Landeo for \u201cinitial evaluation, review[,] and legal advice\u201d concerning Martinez-Ramos\u2019s detainment. On that day, Landeo signed an attorney appearance form for an \u201calien detained.\u201d Three days later, Vasquez and Isaac went to Landeo\u2019s office to find out what Landeo had learned; at that time, a member of Landeo\u2019s staff advised Vasquez and Isaac that Landeo was unavailable and that it would cost $250 to set up an appointment with Landeo. At that point, Vasquez requested the documents in Martinez-Ramos\u2019s file, but Landeo\u2019s office was unable to provide the documents and stated that Vasquez would need to wait five business days.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">On December 5, 2012, Vasquez retained Landeo to file a Form 1-246, or a \u201cMotion to Stay Removal,\u201d on Martinez-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Ramos\u2019s behalf. Landeo charged Vasquez $600, which Vasquez paid on that date. On December 7, 2012, Landeo mailed the Motion to Stay Removal to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On December 10, 2012, ICE informed Landeo that, per the instructions on Form I-246, the Motion to Stay Removal needed to be hand-delivered to the ICE office in Baltimore. On that day, Landeo telephoned Vasquez, told her what ICE had stated, and said that she could travel to Baltimore for another $600. Vasquez told Landeo to \u201cdefinitely go\u201d to Baltimore, and provided her credit card information to pay the additional $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Ultimately, Landeo\u2019s office could not process Vasquez\u2019s credit card information. On December 11, 2012, Landeo\u2019s assistant telephoned Vasquez about Landeo\u2019s office\u2019s inability to process Vasquez\u2019s credit card, and stated that to go to Baltimore Landeo needed the money to be paid. Vasquez decided not to pay Landeo another $600 because she believed that Landeo had done nothing since being retained. On that date, Vasquez went to Landeo\u2019s office to retrieve the documents from Martinez-Ramos\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">On December 14, 2012, Martinez-Ramos was deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Aggravating Factors and Mitigating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The hearing judge found three aggravating factors: (1) \u201ca pattern of misconduct\u201d; (2) \u201cmultiple violations of the\u201d MLRPC; and (3) a refusal \u201cto acknowledge the wrongfulness of [Landeo\u2019s] misconduct[.]\u201d The hearing judge found at least one mitigating factor: \u201cno prior [attorney] disciplinary offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Without expressly crediting the evidence, the hearing judge discussed evidence of mitigating factors that Landeo had offered. According to the hearing judge, Landeo testified as follows. As of 2007, Landeo had two sons. In August 2007, Landeo married her current husband, with whom she has had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>two more children. Landeo\u2019s husband was physically abusive to her and her children. At least two of Landeo\u2019s children had either physical or developmental issues, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and pyloric stenosis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In early 2014, Landeo separated from her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Landeo suffers from chronic severe anemia, which causes fatigue, mental cloudiness, and an inability to function. Landeo also suffers from depression and anxiety, but denied that her mental health affected her ability to represent her clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">On July 30, <em>2015 </em>\u2014 i.e., four days before the hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding began \u2014 Landeo mailed to Flores a check for $1,170, and mailed to Vasquez a check for $840. Landeo intended the checks to be refunds of filing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">As a result of this attorney discipline proceeding, Landeo \u201csets available dates for clients to meet with her for questions[.]\u201d However, Landeo\u2019s retainer agreement still states that if requested by the client a meeting with her after the initial meeting costs $250. Landeo and her law partner are in the \u201cprocess\u201d of creating a Spanish version of her retainer agreement, but, as of the hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding, they had not completed the Spanish version of the retainer agreement. Landeo no longer charges large retainers up front, and instead charges small monthly payments; Landeo puts only earned fees into her operating account, and puts unearned fees in trust.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Landeo will no longer have a part-time assistant, but instead will have a full-time assistant who will contact Landeo with important messages or if a client is upset or concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>According to Landeo\u2019s counsel, any delays that occurred during Landeo\u2019s representation of Castillo, Flores, and Martinez-Ramos were because Landeo was either away from the office or sick with the flu, which became pneumonia in January 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16 \u2014 759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shuler, </em>443 Md. 494, 501, 117 A.3d 38, 43 (2015) (\u201c[T]his Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[.]\u201d (Citations omitted)); Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d). This Court determines whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that a lawyer violated an MLRPC. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition [for disciplinary or remedial action] by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AB_\">(A) Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Keener agreed to pay a \u201ctotal fee [of] $3[,]800 plus a $520 filing fee\u201d for the Immediate Family Petition. (Footnote omitted). The Commission contends that, according to the retainer agreement, the $3,800 in attorney\u2019s fees was for not only the Immediate Family Petition, but also the Waiver of Unlawful Presence and the forms for consular processing. We agree and sustain the Commission\u2019s exception. The retainer agreement that Castillo and Keener signed stated at the outset that the \u201cnature of [the] case\u201d was \u201cSpouse Petition <em>[i.e., </em>the Immediate Family Petition], [and] Waiver for Unlawful Presence with Consular Processing[.]\u201d (Some capitaliza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tion omitted). Under the heading \u201cWhat Your Anticipated Attomeyt\u2019s] Fee Include[s],\u201d the retainer agreement provided: \u201cYour attomeyt\u2019s] fee indicated herein is presented as an anticipated flat fee based on the estimated billable time that it will take to complete your case. Your fee of $3[,]800 includes up to [eleven] hours of case-related work, which should be sufficient to include an interview by USCIS, if scheduled.\u201d (Bolding, underlining, and some capitalization omitted). Under the heading \u201cCosts and Fees,\u201d the retainer agreement provided that the anticipated attorney\u2019s fees for \u201cSpousal Petition, Waiver for Unlawful Presence with Consular Processing\u201d were $3,800. (Bolding and some capitalization omitted). The retainer agreement did not delineate the separate costs for the preparation of the Immediate Family Petition, Waiver of Unlawful Presence, and the forms for consular processing, but instead lumped the items together and stated that the anticipated attorney\u2019s fees for all of the items were $3,800. In other words, the retainer agreement did not state that the attorney\u2019s fees for just the Immediate Family Petition were $3,800, as the hearing judge found. Accordingly, we sustain the Commission\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Landeo excepts to several of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. In support of her exceptions, Landeo relies on her own testimony at the hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding. Landeo also relies on her \u201cfile,\u201d which her office maintained. At oral argument, Landeo\u2019s counsel acknowledged that Landeo\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact concerned the hearing judge\u2019s credibility determinations and discrediting of parts of Landeo\u2019s testimony, but nevertheless urged this Court to \u201cre-weigh\u201d the evidence presented to the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We overrule Landeo\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. In an attorney discipline proceeding, it is the role of the hearing judge to credit or discredit evidence, including testimony, and resolve conflicting versions of events. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Marcalus, </em>414 Md. 501, 512, 996 A.2d 350, 356 (2010) (\u201c[Weighing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflict in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder____[T]he hearing judge may pick and choose which evidence to rely upon[.]\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). As such, we must \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B). Here, in finding facts as he did, the hearing judge discredited parts of Landeo\u2019s testimony and the exhibits that she offered. We decline to second-guess the hearing judge\u2019s determinations of credibility; the hearing judge did not clearly err in making the findings of fact to which Landeo excepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">(B) Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Before addressing the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, for clarity and ease of reference, we set forth the below table outlining the Commission\u2019s charges (reflected in italics) and the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law as to each matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">MLRPC The Castillo The Flores Matter The Martinez-Matter Ramos Matter</p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">1.1 (Competence) <em>Not charged Charged Charged </em>Charge withdrawn Violated</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">1.3 (Diligence) <em>Charged Charged Charged </em>Violated Violated Violated</p>\n<p id=\"AG_\">1.4 (Communica- <em>Charged Charged Charged </em>tion)</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">1.4 violated but no 1.4 violated but no 1.4 violated but no subsection specified subsection specified subsection specified</p>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">1.5(a) (Reasonable <em>Charged Charged Charged </em>Fees)</p>\n<p id=\"AGr\">Not violated Not violated Not violated</p>\n<p id=\"AQs\"><em>Charged Charged Charged </em>1.15(a), (c), and (d) (Safekeeping Property)</p>\n<p id=\"AGD\">1.15 violated but no 1.15 violated but no No conclusion of subsection specified subsection specified law made</p>\n<p id=\"A-V\">1.16(d) (Terminat- <em>Charged Charged Charged </em>ing Representation)</p>\n<p id=\"AMl\">Violated Violated Not violated</p>\n<p id=\"Aan\">5.3(a), (b), and (c) (Responsibilities <em>Not charged Charged Charged</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Regarding Non-lawyer Assistants)</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">Not violated Not violated</p>\n<p id=\"A-cG\">8.4(a) (Violating <em>Charged Not charged Charged </em>the MLRPC)</p>\n<p id=\"AbR\">8.4 violated but no 8.4 violated but no subsection specified subsection specified</p>\n<p id=\"ACq_\">8.4(c) (Dishonesty, <em>Charged Not charged Charged </em>Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation)</p>\n<p id=\"ALl\">8.4 violated but no 8.4 violated but no subsection specified subsection specified</p>\n<p id=\"ATV\">8.4(d) (Conduct <em>Charged Charged Charged </em>That is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"AD9\">8.4 violated but no 8.4 violated but no 8.4 violated but no subsection specified subsection specified subsection specified</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">The Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo did not violate MLRPC 1.5(a) (Reasonable Fees) in representing Castillo. The Commission also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to conclude that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.15 (Safekeeping Property) in representing Martinez-Ramos.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">Without referencing MLRPC 1.4, Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she \u201cfailed to reasonably communicate with [ ] Keener and Castillo[.]\u201d (Bolding and some capitalization omitted). Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 1.15 in representing Castillo. Without referencing MLRPC 1.16(d), Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she \u201cfailed to timely forward [Castillo\u2019s] file\u201d to Racine, her new lawyer (Bolding and capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">Without referencing MLRPC 1.3, Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she \u201cdid not act with diligence to file [Flores\u2019s] spousal abuse petition\u201d and that \u201cshe did not act with diligence to file [Flores\u2019s] adjustment of status petition[.]\u201d (Bolding and capitalization omitted). Without referencing MLRPC 1.4, Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she \u201cfailed to adequately communicate with Flores[.]\u201d (Bolding and some capitalization omitted). Without referencing MLRPC 1.16(d), Landeo appears to except to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 1.16(d) by stating that she \u201cadequately transferred the file to Flores\u2019[s] new eounsel[.]\u201d (Bolding and some capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Without referencing MLRPC 1.3, Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she \u201cfailed to act diligently by failing to perform services [that she] was not hired to perform\u201d in the Martinez-Ramos matter. (Bolding and capitalization omitted). Without referencing MLRPC 1.4, Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she \u201cdid not adequately communicate with\u201d Martinez-Ramos. (Bolding and capitalization omitted).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Significantly, many of Landeo\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law rest on exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, which, in turn, involve the hearing judge\u2019s determinations of credibility. As discussed above, we overrule Landeo\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Accordingly, to the extent that Landeo\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law rely on her exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, we overrule Landeo\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">For the below reasons, we: (1) sustain the Commission\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo did not violate MLRPC 1.5(a) in representing Castillo; (2) sustain the Commission\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to conclude that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.15(a) in representing Martinez-Ramos; (3) overrule all of Landeo\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law; (4) reverse the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Landeo did not violate MLRPC 1.5(a) in representing Flores and Martinez-Ramos; and (5) uphold the rest of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>MLRPC 1.1 (Competence)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness^] and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.1 in representing Martinez-Ramos. The Notice of Appeal or Motion was ready for filing three days before the deadline. However, Landeo did not file the Notice of Appeal or Motion until more than three months after the deadline, and the Notice of Appeal or Motion did not provide any reasons for the late filing. As a result, USCIS denied the untimely Notice of Appeal or Motion. Additionally, Landeo mailed the Motion to Stay Removal to ICE despite the fact that, per the instructions on the form, the Motion to Stay Removal needed to be hand-delivered to the ICE office in Baltimore. Landeo did not correct the mistake of having mailed the Motion to Stay Removal, and instead insisted on additional payment from Vasquez to hand-deliver the Motion to Stay Removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">As mentioned above, Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that she violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing Flores and Martinez-Ramos. We overrule the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d MLRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing Castillo. As of July 2012, Castillo and Keener had provided Landeo the filing fee and all of the documents that were necessary to file the Immediate Family Petition. On July 30, 2012, Landeo signed an attorney appearance form. Landeo, however, did not file the Immediate Family Petition with USCIS until nearly eight months later, on March 28, 2013. In the interim, on January 3, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security published the amendment to the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tion regarding waiver of unlawful presence. The amendment in no way affected the form or substance of Immediate Family Petitions. Even if waiting for the amendment to be published were a valid reason for delaying in filing the Immediate Family Petition and attorney appearance form, Landeo still delayed nearly three months after the amendment was published.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing Flores. Flores provided Landeo with all of the documents that were necessary to file the Abused Spouse Petition, and Flores signed the Abused Spouse Petition. Landeo, however, did not file the Abused Spouse Petition until nearly three months later. Additionally, Flores provided Landeo with all of the documents that were necessary to file the Adjustment of Status. Landeo, however, never filed the Adjustment of Status.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.3 in representing Martinez-Ramos. The Notice of Appeal or Motion was ready for filing three days before the deadline. However, Landeo did not file the Notice of Appeal or Motion until more than three months later. Additionally, Martinez-Ramos retained Landeo to file a work permit application on her behalf, but Landeo never filed the work permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>MLRPC 1.4 (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that she violated MLRPC 1.4 in representing Castillo, Flores, and Martinez-Ramos. We overrule the exceptions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">MLRPC 1.4 provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">(a) A lawyer shall: ... (2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; [and] (3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">(Paragraph breaks omitted). Comment [5] to MLRPC 1.4 explains that \u201c[t]he client should have sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and the means by which they are to be pursued.... Adequacy of communication depends in part on the kind of advice or assistance that is involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.4 in representing Castillo. Between May 2012 and March 2013, Landeo never directly communicated with Castillo or Keener, despite Castillo\u2019s multiple attempts to speak with Landeo. Between May 2012 and March 2013, Castillo telephoned Landeo\u2019s office at least fifteen times requesting status updates and information as to the filing of the Immediate Family Petition. Castillo requested that Landeo call her back, but Landeo failed to do so. Keener also attempted to speak with Landeo by telephone. Whenever Castillo and Keener telephoned Landeo\u2019s office to speak with Landeo, a member of the firm\u2019s staff told them that Landeo was \u201cunavailable.\u201d On multiple occasions, Castillo asked for a receipt number so that she could check the Immediate Family Petition\u2019s status on USCIS\u2019s website, and a member of the firm\u2019s staff told Castillo that Landeo was unavailable and that the staff member was not in a position to provide the receipt number. Landeo never explained to Castillo or Keener why she delayed in filing the Immediate Family Petition. In sum, Landeo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), and 1.4(b) by: failing to keep Castillo and Keener reasonably informed about the status of the case generally and the Immediate Family Petition specifically; failing to promptly comply with Castillo\u2019s and Keener\u2019s reasonable requests for information; and failing to explain the matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Castillo and Keener to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.4 in representing Flores. After the filing of the Abused Spouse Petition on September 22, 2011, Landeo\u2019s office forwarded to Flores letters in which USCIS stated that it had made <em>\u201ca prima facie </em>determination\u201d as to the Abused Spouse Petition. Between July 6, 2012 and October 1, 2012, Landeo mailed to Flores letters informing Flores that the <em>\u201cprima facie </em>determination\u201d as to her classification as an abused spouse of a United States citizen had been extended. Flores requested from Landeo an explanation of USCIS\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>determination as to the Abused Spouse Petition, but Landeo never explained the matter to Flores. In a letter dated July 6, 2012, Landeo recommended filing the Adjustment of Status before USCIS approved the Abused Spouse Petition. In a letter dated July 10, 2012, Flores agreed to having the Adjustment of Status filed before USCIS approved the Abused Spouse Petition. However, Landeo never explained the process to Flores. Landeo violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), and 1.4(b) in representing Flores by: failing to keep Flores reasonably informed about the status of the matter; failing to promptly comply with Flores\u2019s reasonable requests for information; and failing to explain the matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Flores to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.4 in representing Martinez-Ramos. Landeo did not file the Notice of Appeal or Motion until more than three months after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>deadline, and she never explained the late filing to Martinez-Ramos. Landeo violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) and 1.4(b) in representing Martinez-Ramos by: failing to keep Martinez-Ramos reasonably informed about the status of the matter; and failing to explain the matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Martinez-Ramos to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">MLRPC 1.5(a) (Reasonable Fees)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">As stated above, the Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo did not violate MLRPC 1.5(a) in representing Castillo. We sustain the exception, and also reverse the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Landeo did not violate MLRPC 1.5(a) in representing Flores and Martinez-Ramos.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee[.]\u201d MLRPC 1.5(a). \u201cAlthough a fee for certain services may not be unreasonable on its face, the fee is unreasonable if the lawyer fails to perform the services to any meaningful degree.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, </em>445 Md. 379, 393, 127 A.3d 562, 570 (2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

(Footnote omitted). As discussed above, the hearing judge\u2019s finding was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>clearly erroneous because Keener and Castillo agreed to pay $3,800 in attorney\u2019s fees for not only the Immediate Family Petition, but also the Waiver of Unlawful Presence and the forms for consular processing. Keener ended up paying Landeo a total $3,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and the $520 filing fee. Although Landeo filed the Immediate Family Petition after Keener telephoned Landeo\u2019s office and stated that he would stop paying fees until Landeo provided a receipt for the filing of the Immediate Family Petition, Landeo never filed the Waiver of Unlawful Presence or the forms for consular processing. After Keener and Castillo terminated Landeo\u2019s representation, Landeo sent them a bill for $4,205. Keener\u2019s and Castillo\u2019s new lawyer requested a refund of unearned fees. However, Landeo never provided Keener and Castillo with a refund. In essence, although Keener and Castillo paid nearly eighty percent of the agreed upon attorney\u2019s fees, Landeo only partially performed the services for which she was retained. In other words, Landeo failed to perform the services concerning the Waiver of Unlawful Presence and the forms for consular processing to any meaningful degree, despite the receipt of nearly eighty percent of the total attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Additionally, a review of Landeo\u2019s final bill to Keener and Castillo reveals that Landeo charged for items such as \u201cPrepare/Send Payment Reminder\u201d and \u201cPayment by phone Rec\u2019d and Receipt processed,\u201d as well as for telephone calls from Keener and Castillo that were handled by someone other than Landeo, at a rate of $15 to $30 per telephone call, and that were necessitated by Landeo\u2019s lack of communication with Keener and Castillo. Notably, the retainer agreement that Keener and Castillo signed did not state that Landeo would charge them for accounting services, such as the processing of payments and the sending payment reminders, or contain any express statement that they would be charged for routine telephone calls in which they requested a status update and were unable to speak with Landeo.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We conclude that charg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ing fees for these items was unreasonable under the circumstances of this case, where Keener and Castillo did not consent to the charges for accounting services and routine telephone calls to Landeo\u2019s office and where no extenuating circumstances warranted the imposition of separate fees for those items. <em>Cf.

Indeed, the failure to place any funds received from clients into an attorney trust account is a textbook violation of MLRPC 1.15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the conclusion that Landeo also violated MLRPC 1.15(c) in representing Castillo. At the initial consultation, Keener paid Landeo $600 in attorney\u2019s fees, prior to any work (other than the initial consultation) being performed in the case. Despite not having obtained Castillo\u2019s or Keener\u2019s informed consent, confirmed in writing, to a different arrangement, Landeo failed to deposit Keener\u2019s unearned attorney\u2019s fees in an attorney trust account. Such conduct violated MLRPC 1.15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the conclusion that Landeo also violated MLRPC 1.15(c) in representing Flores. Flores agreed to pay $2,500 in attorney\u2019s fees for the preparation and filing of an Abused Spouse Petition and Adjustment of Status. As of June 1, 2011, Flores had paid Landeo $2,500 in attorney\u2019s fees, but Landeo never placed the fees in an attorney trust account. As of the date that Flores paid the attorney\u2019s fees in full, neither the Abused Spouse Petition nor Adjustment of Status had been prepared or filed. In other words, despite not having Flores\u2019s informed consent, confirmed in writing, to a different arrangement, Landeo deposited Flores\u2019s unearned attorney\u2019s fees into an account other than an attorney trust account.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Such conduct violated MLRPC 1.15(c).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>MLRPC 1.16(d) (Terminating Representation)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Landeo excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that she violated MLRPC 1.16(d) in representing Castillo and Flores.

Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 322, 44 A.3d 344, 359 (2012) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.16(d) in representing Castillo. As of April 4, 2013, Keener had informed Landeo\u2019s office that he and Castillo were terminating Landeo\u2019s representation. On April 5, 2013, Castillo and Keener retained a new immigration lawyer, Racine. On that day, Racine sent to Landeo a request for Castillo\u2019s file; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Landeo received the request on April 8, 2013. In addition to sending the letter, Racine telephoned Landeo\u2019s office to facilitate the transfer of Castillo\u2019s file. Landeo\u2019s office assistant told Racine that the file had been sent to him, but it had not. On May 21, 2013, in response to an e-mail from Racine, Landeo e-mailed Racine to state that the documents in Castillo\u2019s would be scanned and sent to his office. Racine waited until June 13, 2013, but Landeo did not send the documents in Castillo\u2019s file. As of August 6, 2013, Racine still had not received Castillo\u2019s file. In other words, despite having been advised by Landeo\u2019s office assistant and by Landeo that Castillo\u2019s file had been, or would be, sent to him, Racine still had not received Castillo\u2019s file as of four months after Racine\u2019s initial request for Castillo\u2019s file. Thus, Landeo violated MLRPC 1.16(d) by failing to reasonably protect Castillo\u2019s interests and to timely surrender papers and property to which Castillo and Racine, Castillo\u2019s new lawyer, were entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.16(d) in representing Flores. Sometime between December 17 and 27, 2012, Flores terminated Landeo\u2019s representation and retained a new lawyer, Bloom. On December 27, 2012, Bloom mailed and faxed to Landeo a letter requesting Flores\u2019s file. On January 2, 2013, Landeo mailed to Bloom a letter in which she stated that she would scan and e-mail to him Flores\u2019s file \u201cbefore the end of the week.\u201d As of January 18, 2013, Bloom had not received anything else from Landeo; on that date, Bloom sent to Landeo a second letter requesting Flores\u2019s file. On January 24, 2013, almost a month after Bloom\u2019s original request, a member of Landeo\u2019s staff e-mailed to Bloom scanned copies of Flores\u2019s file. In a letter dated February 7, 2013, Bloom reiterated his request for the originals of Flores\u2019s file. Two weeks later, on February 22, 2013 \u2014 almost two months after Bloom\u2019s original request \u2014 Landeo mailed Flores\u2019s file to Bloom. Landeo failed to reasonably take steps to protect Flores\u2019s interests by delaying in transmitting copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and the originals of Flores\u2019s file to Bloom, thus violating MLRPC 1.16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Landeo had violated MLRPC 1.16(d) in representing Martinez-Ramos. On December 11, 2012, Vasquez decided not to pay Landeo any additional money; on that day, Vasquez went to Landeo\u2019s office to retrieve the documents from Martinez-Ramos\u2019s file. In other words, there was no delay in surrendering, or failure to surrender, Martinez-Ramos\u2019s file.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">MLRPC 5.3(a), (b), and (c) (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">MLRPC 5.3 states, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">(a) a partner, and a lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable managerial authority in a law firm[,] shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the [law] firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the [nonlawyer]\u2019s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">(b) a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the [nonlawyer]\u2019s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">(c) a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of [a nonlawyer] that would be a violation of the [MLRPC] if engaged in by a lawyer if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">(1) the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">(2) the lawyer is a partner or has comparable managerial authority in the law firm in which the [nonlawyer] is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the [non-lawyer], and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated[,] but fails to take reasonable remedial action[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Here, the hearing judge was correct in concluding that clear and convincing evidence did not establish that Landeo had violated MLRPC 5.3(a) or (b) in representing Flores and Martinez-Ramos, and hearing judge was correct in concluding that Landeo was not vicariously responsible for any nonlawyer\u2019s conduct under MLRPC 5.3(c). Although Landeo was a named partner at her law firm, and certainly must have had supervisory authority over office staff and assistants, the hearing judge did not find that Landeo directly supervised office staff and assistants at the law firm, or that nonlawyers employed at the law firm engaged in conduct that was incompatible with Landeo\u2019s professional obligations or engaged in conduct that would have been a violation of the MLRPC if Landeo had engaged in it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">Deceit, or Misrepresentation)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to[ ] ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit[,] or misrepresentation[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Here, as an initial matter, we observe that the Commission charged Landeo with violating MLRPC 8.4(c) only in representing Castillo and Martinez-Ramos, not in representing Flores. And, without specifying a subsection, the hearing judge concluded that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4 in representing Castillo, stating: \u201cThe [hearing judge] finds by clear and convincing evidence that [Landeo] violated several [MLRPC] in the context of representation of [Castillo] and therefore violated [MLRPC] 8.4.\u201d Similarly, without specifying a subsection, the hearing judge concluded that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4 in representing Martinez-Ramos, stating: \u201cThere is clear and convincing evidence that [Landeo] violated M[L]RPC 8.4 based on her multiple violations of other [MLRPC] in the representation of Martinez[-Ramos.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The phrasing of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law as to MLRPC 8.4 leads to the logical conclusion that the hearing judge determined that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4(a) (\u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>is professional misconduct for a lawyer to[ ] violate ... the\u201d MLRPC.), not MLRPC 8.4(c) (\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to[ ] ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit[,] or misrepresentation!)]\u201d). In other words, the hearing judge concluded that, because Landeo had violated other MLRPC in representing Castillo and Martinez-Ramos, she had also violated MLRPC 8.4(a). Upon our independent review, we decline to conclude that clear and convincing evidence establishes that Landeo violated MLRPC 8.4(c) in representing Castillo or Martinez-Ramos. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In its Exceptions and Recommendation for Sanction, the Commission asserts that the hearing judge concluded that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4(c), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">The [MLRPC] 8.4(c) violation was related to the misrepresentations made to [ ] Keener and [ ] Castillo regarding the status of the [Immediate Family P]etition. The [MLRPC] 8.4(c) violation in [ ] Martinez[-]Ramos\u2019s case is also related to misrepresentations made to [ ] Martinez-Ramos regarding the filing of her Motion to Stay and [Landeo]\u2019s lack of candor concerning her deportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">What the Commission has identified as the alleged bases for violations of MLRPC 8.4(c), without more, simply does not rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence that Landeo engaged in \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit[,] or misrepresentation[.]\u201d And, more importantly, the hearing judge did not find that Landeo engaged in such conduct or otherwise made misrepresentations warranting the conclusion that she violated MLRPC 8.4(c).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>At oral argument, in support of the contention that the hearing judge concluded that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4(c), Bar Counsel drew this Court\u2019s attention to a footnote in the hearing judge\u2019s opinion, in which the hearing judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ9\">It should be noted that [Landeoj\u2019s policy was to charge an additional $100 in filing fees set by the U[.]S[.] governmental authorities.

Further, the retainer notes that administrative costs will be billed \u201cseparately to the client.\u201d Therefore, even if not an unreasonable amount for direct costs, it is certainly confusing and deceptive when there is no way to tell the relationship of the routinely added $100 to the actual \u201cdirect cost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As an initial matter, the above statement is in a footnote in the hearing judge\u2019s discussion of the findings of facts as to Landeo\u2019s representation of Flores; as mentioned above, Bar Counsel did not charge Landeo with violating MLRPC 8.4(c) in representing Flores. And, given its location in the hearing judge\u2019s opinion, it is unclear that the hearing judge intended the information to be generally applicable to Landeo\u2019s representation of Castillo and Martinez-Ramos as well. As another matter, the footnote follows a discussion of the expert testimony on the reasonableness of the fees that Landeo charged Flores. Simply put, the hearing judge\u2019s comment that Landeo\u2019s practice of charging an additional $100 in filing fees was \u201cconfusing and deceptive\u201d was not made in connection with any analysis of any MLRPC, let alone MLRPC 8.4(c), and, as pointed out, was made in a footnote in the findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In short, all that can be gleaned from the hearing judge\u2019s opinion is that the hearing judge concluded that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4(a).

As discussed above, the phrasing of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law as to MLRPC 8.4 with respect to Castillo and Martinez-Ramos leads to the logical conclusion that the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>judge determined that Landeo violated MLRPC 8.4(a) (\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to[ ] violate ... the\u201d MLRPC.); the hearing judge did not provide specific analysis that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4(d) with respect to Castillo and Martinez-Ramos. And, without specifying a subsection, the hearing judge concluded that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4 in representing Flores, stating: \u201cBased upon the violations found by the [hearing judge] by clear and convincing evidence, the [hearing judge] finds that [Landeo] violated [MLRPC] 8.4.\u201d This, too, appears to be a conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 8.4(a) in representing Flores. Nonetheless, upon our independent review, we determine that clear and convincing evidence \u2014 credited in the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact \u2014 supports the conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 8.4(d) in representing all three clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">As discussed above, although Castillo and Keener provided Landeo the filing fee and all of the documents that were necessary to file the Immediate Family Petition, and Landeo had signed an attorney appearance form, Landeo did not file the Immediate Family Petition with USCIS until nearly eight months later. Although Flores provided Landeo with all of the documents that were necessary to file the Abused Spouse Petition and had signed the Abused Spouse Petition, Landeo did not file the Abused Spouse Petition until nearly three months later. Additionally, although Flores provided Landeo with all of the documents that were necessary to file the Adjustment of Status, Landeo never filed the Adjustment of Status. In representing Martinez-Ramos, Landeo did not file the Notice of Appeal or Motion until more than three months after the deadline, and failed to provide any reasons for the late filing. As a result, USCIS denied the untimely Notice of Appeal or Motion. Additionally, Landeo mailed the Motion to Stay Removal to ICE despite the fact that, per the instructions on the form, the Motion to Stay Removal needed to be hand-delivered to the ICE office in Baltimore. Landeo did not correct the mistake of having mailed the Motion to Stay Removal. Additionally, Martinez-Ramos retained Landeo to file a work permit application on her behalf, but Landeo never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>filed the work permit application. And, ultimately, Martinez-Ramos was deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Moreover, in representing each client, in addition to displaying a lack of diligence, Landeo failed to deposit attorney\u2019s fees and filing fees into an attorney trust account and failed to keep her clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters and to explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary to permit her clients to make informed decisions regarding the representation. Under these circumstances, in representing each client, Landeo engaged in conduct that would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public.

Geesing, </em>436 Md. 56, 71, 66, 58, 80 A.3d 718, 727, 724, 719 (2013), this Court suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for ninety days a lawyer who violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1), 5.3(a), and 8.4(d) by routinely authorizing two non-lawyer members of his law firm\u2019s staff to sign his name on documents \u2014 including affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>vits that the staff members falsely notarized \u2014 in foreclosure filings. In determining the appropriate sanction, we noted that the lawyer\u2019s conduct was aggravated by only two aggravating factors \u2014 a pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses \u2014 and was mitigated by seven factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">(a) the absence of a prior disciplinary record; (b) the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) timely good-faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; (d) full disclosure to the Commission and cooperation and participation in the attorney discipline proceeding; (e) good character and reputation; (f) remorse; and (g) significant press coverage of the issue and considerable time and effort that the lawyer and the lawyer\u2019s firm spent correcting the problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 67, 70, 80 A.3d at 725, 726 (citation, ellipsis, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Here, Landeo violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a), 1.15(c), 1.16(d), and 8.4(d) by: failing to provide competent representation to Martinez-Ramos; failing to provide diligent representation in time-sensitive immigration matters and waiting months to file documents; failing to keep her clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters, promptly comply with her clients\u2019 reasonable requests for information, and explain matters to the extent reasonably necessary to permit her clients to make informed decisions regarding the representation; charging and collecting attorney\u2019s fees for services that she failed to provide to any meaningful degree or at all; failing to deposit attorney\u2019s fees and filing fees into an attorney trust account; failing to deposit Keener\u2019s and Castillo\u2019s unearned attorney\u2019s fees and Flores\u2019s unearned attorney\u2019s fees into an attorney trust account without the clients\u2019 informed consent, confirmed in writing, to a different arrangement; failing to reasonably protect Castillo\u2019s and Flores\u2019s interests and timely surrender files to which Castillo\u2019s and Flores\u2019s new lawyers were entitled; and engaging in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice. As to Landeo\u2019s mental state, the record demonstrates that Landeo acted intentionally in depos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>iting her clients\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees and filing fees into an account other than an attorney trust account, and that Landeo, at a minimum, acted negligently, if not knowingly, in failing to provide competent and diligent representation and in failing to adequately communicate with her clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Landeo injured Castillo by failing to provide agreed-upon services in a diligent manner, thus necessitating Castillo\u2019s and Keener\u2019s decision to terminate Landeo\u2019s representation and incur the expense of retaining a new immigration lawyer, and causing additional delay in the process of Castillo\u2019s obtaining legal permanent resident status. Similarly, Landeo injured Flores by failing to provide agreed-upon services in a diligent manner, thus necessitating Flores\u2019s decision to terminate Landeo\u2019s representation and incur the expense of retaining a new immigration lawyer, and causing additional delay in the process of Flores\u2019s obtaining a green card for work authorization. And, Landeo injured Martinez-Ramos by failing to timely file the Notice of Appeal or Motion, failing to explain the late filing, and failing to hand-deliver the Motion to Stay Removal as required, ultimately resulting in Martinez-Ramos\u2019s detention and deportation. Additionally, in each matter, Landeo engaged in conduct that would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of a reasonable member of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The hearing judge found three aggravating factors: (1) \u201ca pattern of misconduct\u201d; (2) \u201cmultiple violations of the\u201d MLRPC; and (3) a refusal \u201cto acknowledge the wrongfulness of [Landeo\u2019s] miseonduct[.]\u201d Upon our review, we note five aggravating factors. First and second, Landeo engaged in a pattern of misconduct and committed multiple violations of the MLRPC. Third, Landeo has refused to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Fourth, Landeo\u2019s clients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>were vulnerable victims.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And, fifth, Landeo has substantial experience in the practice of law, as she had been a member of the Bar of Maryland for approximately a decade at the time of her misconduct.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The hearing judge found one mitigating factor: the absence of prior attorney discipline. Upon our review, we note only the same mitigating factor. We decline to determine that Landeo\u2019s refunds to Flores and Vasquez for filings fees constitute a timely good faith effort to make restitution because the refunds were mailed to Flores and Vasquez on July 30, 2015, more than two-and-a-half years after Flores terminated Landeo\u2019s representation and after Martinez-Ramos was detained and deported, and only four days before the hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding began. In other words, the refunds were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We also decline to consider as mitigation the circumstance that Landeo\u2019s law firm\u2019s bank accounts are periodically reviewed by a certified public accountant pursuant to a conditional diversion agreement entered into by Landeo\u2019s law partner.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Although Landeo\u2019s law firm may benefit from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>terms of her partner\u2019s conditional diversion agreement, the existence of the conditional diversion agreement does not constitute mitigation as to Landeo. Indeed, Landeo herself has no obligations under her partner\u2019s conditional diversion agreement. Moreover, Landeo\u2019s partner did not enter into the conditional diversion agreement until July 2015 \u2014 several years after Landeo\u2019s misconduct occurred. In other words, Landeo did not take it upon herself to timely correct the problems with her law firm\u2019s accounting practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We agree with the Commission that the appropriate sanction for Landeo\u2019s misconduct is an indefinite suspension from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days. Among other misconduct, Landeo failed to provide diligent representation, failed to adequately communicate with her clients, failed to place fees into an attorney trust account, failed to timely turn over client files once her representation was terminated, and engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Landeo\u2019s misconduct resulted in actual injury to her clients\u2014 Castillo and Flores experienced delays in obtaining their desired immigration statuses, and were forced to terminate Landeo\u2019s representation and seek new counsel, and Martinez-Ramos was detained and deported. Landeo also engaged in conduct that would negatively impact the perception of the legal professional of a reasonable member of the public. Landeo\u2019s misconduct is aggravated by several factors, including a pattern of misconduct and multiple violations of the MLRPC in representing three clients, a refusal to acknowledge her misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature, and substantial experience in the practice of law. Moreover, as immigrants who had entered the United States illegally, Castillo, Flores, and Martinez-Ramos were vulnerable. To protect the public, we must impress upon Landeo, and all other lawyers, the impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tance of diligent representation and adequate communication in immigration cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Like the lawyer in <em>David, </em>331 Md. at 318-19, 323, 628 A.2d at 179, 181, Landeo violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.5(a), 1.16(d), and 8.4(d) in representing multiple clients, and her representation can be characterized as being \u201cmarked by serious neglect and inattention.\u201d Notably, unlike Landeo, the lawyer in <em>David, id. </em>at 324, 318-19, 628 A.2d at 181, 179 \u2014 who was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after six months <em>(ie., </em>ninety days longer than the sanction we impose on Landeo) \u2014 violated MLRPC that Landeo did not violate, including MLRPC 8.1(a), 8.1(b), and 8.4(c). Additionally, like the lawyer in <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 97-98, 75, 81, 753 A.2d at 39, 27, 30, where the lawyer was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days, Landeo violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(b), and 8.4(d) in connection with multiple matters, but her misconduct is mitigated by the absence of prior attorney discipline. And, like the lawyer in <em>Lee, </em>393 Md. at 567, 563, 556, 903 A.2d at 908, 905, 901, where the lawyer was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Maryland, Landeo violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(b), 1.16(d), and 8.4(d), failed to diligently pursue her clients\u2019 interests in a timely manner, and failed to keep her clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Unlike the lawyer in <em>Geesing, </em>436 Md. at 71, 67, 68, 80 A.3d at 727, 725, however, where the lawyer was suspended from the practice of law in Maryland for ninety days, Landeo\u2019s misconduct is aggravated by five factors (not two factors), including the vulnerability of the victims and a refusal to acknowledge her misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature, and is mitigated only by the absence of prior attorney discipline (instead of seven factors, such as remorse, timely good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of the misconduct, and good character). Simply put, Landeo\u2019s misconduct is accompanied by more aggravating factors and far fewer mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>factors than the lawyer\u2019s misconduct in <em>Geesing, </em>and necessarily warrants a more severe sanction than the ninety-day suspension that we imposed in <em>Geesing. </em>Nevertheless, unlike in <em>Thomas, </em>440 Md. at 558, 551-55, 103 A.3d at 650, 646-48, where the lawyer was disbarred, Landeo did not fail to attend a hearing, misrepresent the status of the case to a client, fail to tell a client that he or she had been ordered removed from the country, fail to participate in this attorney discipline proceeding, or fail to complete any work whatsoever for which she was retained to complete. In other words, although certainly egregious and displaying a gross lack of competence, and a pattern of a lack of diligence and adequate communication, Landeo\u2019s misconduct does not rise to a level warranting disbarment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Accordingly, for the above reasons, we indefinitely suspend Landeo from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days.

The changes in Landeo\u2019s office\u2019s financial accounting practices occurred as a result of Landeo\u2019s partner\u2019s response to a complaint that was filed with the Commission.

Notably, aside from Landeo\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated MLRPC 1.15 in the Castillo matter, Landeo fails to expressly identify any other MLRPC in her exceptions. In other words, most of Landeo's exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law are implied without reference to the MLRPC at issue or pertinent case law. As such, we have inferred through context the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law to which Landeo excepts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">. To be sure, the amendment to the regulation became effective on March 4, 2013. Nonetheless, even using this date as a measure, Landeo delayed more than three weeks after the amendment became effective before filing the Immediate Family Petition and attorney appearance form with USCIS, despite the circumstance that, as of July 30, 2012, Landeo had been provided the filing fee and necessary documentation for the Immediate Family Petition, and Landeo had signed the attorney appearance form. And, in any event, Landeo failed to adequately convey, either herself or through her staff, to either Castillo or Keener that she planned to wait to file the Immediate Family Petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\">. By contrast, the retainer agreement stated that the anticipated fee did not include any mail services more than $5 per envelope or package <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>or \"any long distance, collect, or out of country calls[,]\u201d and that the client would \"be billed separately for any such services.\" In other words, telephone calls that Landeo would need to make during the course of the representation that were long distance, collect, or out of country would be billed separately to Keener and Castillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The retainer agreement also provided that, should the client's case be terminated for nonpayment of fees, the client would \"be billed for all administrative fees, including but not limited to postage fees, copy fees, mileage fees, or any other fees incurred in [the] case.\u201d That section of the retainer is inapplicable here because Landeo did not terminate Castillo\u2019s case for nonpayment of fees. And, in any event, even if applicable, that clause of the retainer agreement does not provide for the separate billing of accounting services or telephone calls from the client.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">. The hearing judge found that Landeo charged Martinez-Ramos $730 in filing fees and other costs for the Notice of Appeal or Motion and $565 in filing fees and other costs for the work permit application. These filing fees and other costs total $1,295, which is $455 more than what Landeo refunded to Vasquez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b366-12\"><em>. </em>Landeo does not except to the hearing judge's conclusion that she violated MLRPC 1.15 in representing Flores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">.

The hearing judge did not make similar findings of fact in the Martinez-Ramos <em>matter </em>\u2014 i.e., that unearned attorney\u2019s fees were not placed in an attorney trust account. Although, ostensibly, attorney\u2019s fees that were paid to Landeo in the Martinez-Ramos matter were unearned at the time they were paid and yet not placed in an attorney trust account, absent specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>findings by the hearing judge that such fees were unearned, we decline to conclude that clear and convincing evidence supports a conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.15(c) in representing Martinez-Ramos.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">. Nothing in the hearing judge's findings of fact gives rise to the conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.15(d) in representing Castillo, Flores, or Martinez-Ramos, <em>i.e., </em>that Landeo received funds or other property in which her clients or third persons had an interest and then failed to promptly deliver those funds. Accordingly, clear and convincing evidence would not support a conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.15(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">. At oral argument, Bar Counsel argued that Landeo\u2019s staff\u2019s communications to Keener and Castillo that the Immediate Family Petition was \"in process\u201d was a misrepresentation because the Immediate Family Petition had not yet been filed with USCIS. The hearing judge, however, did not find such a misrepresentation had been made. Indeed, the hearing judge found: \"[Landeoj\u2019s office manager told Keener and Castillo that the [Immediate Family Petition] was \u2018in process!,]\u2019 [and] the clients interpreted that to mean that the form was filed and they were just waiting for a receipt.\u201d In other words, the hearing judge did not find that Landeo\u2019s office manager told Keener and Castillo that the Immediate Family Petition was in process with USCIS; rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Keener and Castillo simply interpreted the office manager\u2019s words as such. And, as Judge Adkins pointed out at oral argument, the phrase \"in process\u201d can \"have a myriad of meanings\u201d; <em>i.e., </em>telling a client that a form was \"in process\u201d did not necessarily mean that the form had been filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. At oral argument, Bar Counsel directed our attention to an exhibit from the parties that supposedly substantiated a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c). That exhibit, appended to the hearing judge\u2019s opinion in the record, is entitled \"Landeo Attachment.\" Far from substantiating a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c), however, the Landeo Attachment merely sets forth verbatim all of the MLRPC with which Landeo was charged with violating, including subsections of MLRPC with which she was not charged with violating. For example, the Commission charged Landeo with violating only MLRPC 1.5(a) in all three matters; the Landeo Attachment, however, sets forth MLRPC 1.5 in its entirety, including MLRPC 1.5(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). Moreover, the Landeo Attachment does not contain any analysis of the MLRPC violations charged. In sum, the Landeo Attachment provides no support whatsoever for the contention that the hearing judge concluded that Landeo had violated MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b378-9\">. The Commission did not charge Landeo with violating MLRPC 8.4(a) in representing Flores, so we decline to conclude that Landeo violated MLRPC 8.4(a) in that instance. However, had the Commission charged Landeo with violating MLRPC 8.4(a) in representing Flores, we would have no difficulty in concluding that clear and convincing evidence supports a conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 8.4(a) based on Landeo\u2019s other violations of the MLRPC in representing Flores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">. On the first page of its recommendation, the Commission mistakenly specified sixty days. The Commission filed in this Court a corrected version of the first page, which should have specified ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Additionally, at oral argument, when asked whether the recommended sanction would change if this Court concluded that Landeo had not violate MLRPC 8.4(c), Bar Counsel responded in the negative and stated that the recommendation for an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days would remain the same even absent a conclusion that Landeo violated MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">. At the time, MLRPC 1.4(a)(a) and 1.4(a)(3) did not yet exist; the provisions that are now in MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) and 1.4(a)(3) were in MLRPC 1.4(a), which provided: <em>\"A </em>lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.\u201d <em>See Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 75, 753 A.2d at 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">. <em>See supra </em>note 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. To be sure, at oral argument, Landeo\u2019s counsel seemingly acknowledged that Landeo violated MLRPC 1.15(a) by failing to place attorney\u2019s fees and filings fees into an attorney trust account, t.e., that Landeo\u2019s misconduct with respect to fees was wrongful. However, the record does not demonstrate that Landeo has acknowledged the wrongfulness of her misconduct in any other respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">.

Generally, where a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(c) by engaging in intentional dishonest conduct, disbarment \u2014 not an indefinite suspension \u2014 is the appropriate sanction, absent compelling extenuating circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Thomas, </em>445 Md. at 402, 127 A.3d at 576 (The lawyer \"violated MLRPC 8.4(c)[by], for the purpose of continuing to practice law, [] dishonestly refrain[ing] from informing Bar Counsel that he was using alcohol and/or opiates and that, on two occasions, he had been discharged from a substance abuse program for failing to attend the required number of counseling sessions. Absent compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer will result in disbarment. Here, there are no mitigating factors, let alone compelling extenuating circumstances, that would have justified a lesser sanction.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">By contrast, an indefinite suspension is an appropriate sanction where a lawyer violates multiple MLRPC, but not MLRPC 8.4(c). <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In other words, a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) is not a predicate for imposition of an indefinite suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
