McGann (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On March 25 and 26, 2015 and April 29, 2015, the hearing judge conducted a hearing, at which Chanthunya was present and self-represented. On June 18, 2015, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Chanthunya had violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.4(b), and 8.4(d), but had not violated MLRPC 8.4(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The hearing judge found that testimony by Traore that Chanthunya touched her breast was not credible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>In our view, the hearing judge\u2019s explanation of his finding reveals that the hearing judge based his findings on what he believed a victim of sexual assault would or should do\u2014 namely, report the incident to law enforcement and/or the victim\u2019s spouse, and cease contact with the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">On September 28, 2015, we heard oral argument. On October 1, 2015, we remanded this attorney discipline proceeding to the hearing judge to address important issues that arose out of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Chief among other issues, we ordered the hearing judge to \u201c[pjrovide a better explanation for why he found that [] Traore\u2019s testimony [that Chanthunya touched her breast] was not credible ..., if indeed [the hearing judge] continue[d] to maintain that[.]\u201d On January 22, 2016, the hearing judge filed in this Court a supplemental opinion in which the hearing judge maintained that Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast was not credible, and concluded that Chanthunya had violated MLRPC 8.4(a), but had not violated MLRPC 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In his supplemental opinion, the hearing judge provided essentially the same basis for finding not credible Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast without her consent. Given that we have already remanded this attorney discipline proceeding to the hearing judge to address this matter, and that the hearing judge provided the same inappropriate basis for finding that Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible in his supplemental opinion, we conclude that it would be futile to remand yet again to the hearing judge to properly address the matter of Traore\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Nonetheless, for the below reasons, we indefinitely suspend Chanthunya from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In his original opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In 1978, Chanthunya first became a lawyer. Over twenty years later, on June 24, 1999, this Court admitted Chanthunya to the Bar of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Chanthunya\u2019s Representation of Traore</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In 1998, Traore, a citizen of Guinea, entered the United States. In 2009, Traore retained Chanthunya to represent her in her application for a green card and her application for a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility. On November 23, 2009, on Traore\u2019s behalf, Chanthunya filed an application for a green card with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\u201cUSCIS\u201d). The application for a green card contained inaccurate statements and spaces that were not filled in that should have been, and Chanthunya failed to attach required or necessary documents, such as the identification page of Traore\u2019s passport. In December 2009, April 2010, and September 2010, USCIS requested additional documents from Chanthunya, who failed to inform Traore of USCIS\u2019s three requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">USCIS scheduled an interview regarding Traore\u2019s application for a green card. Chanthunya failed to: prepare Traore for the interview; advise her of what to expect at the interview; appear at the interview himself; and ask USCIS to reschedule the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">USCIS denied Traore\u2019s application for a green card and a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility, and Chanthunya failed to inform Traore as much. After USCIS informed Traore about the applications\u2019 denial, Traore contacted Chanthunya, who promised to file an appeal. Traore, however, did not receive notice from USCIS that the appeal had been filed. Traore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>telephoned Chanthunya to ask about the status of the appeal, and Chanthunya promised to call her back. Chanthunya, however, failed to contact Traore, prompting her to visit USCIS herself. Upon visiting USCIS, Traore was unable to confirm that the appeal had been filed. Chanthunya\u2019s omissions cost Traore the opportunity to have USCIS consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Finally, on at least ten occasions during Chanthunya\u2019s representation of her, Traore visited Chanthunya\u2019s office because he was not answering her telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Chanthunya\u2019s Representation of Vanguere</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In 2007, Vanguere, a citizen of the Central African Republic, entered the United States. Vanguere applied for asylum and retained Chanthunya to represent her in her application for asylum. Chanthunya failed to: prepare Vanguere for the asylum hearing; advise her of the benefits and risks of postponing her case; advise her of the type of evidence that she needed; and submit on Vanguere\u2019s behalf corroborating evidence, such as evidence that Vanguere\u2019s family members had been persecuted in the Central African Republic.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Chanthunya also failed to review the Baltimore Immigration Court\u2019s file to ensure its completeness. Although the Baltimore Immigration Court denied Vanguere\u2019s application for asylum, the hearing judge found that the denial was due to Vanguere\u2019s lack of credibility, not Chanthunya\u2019s lack of preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Vanguere subsequently filed a motion to reopen her asylum application based on ineffective assistance of counsel by Chanthunya as well as changed country conditions in the Central African Republic. The Board of Immigration Appeals granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the motion, and remanded the case to the Baltimore Immigration Court for a <em>de novo </em>asylum hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Aggravating Factors and Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The hearing judge found that Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct is aggravated by a pattern of misconduct, multiple violations of the MLRPC, refusal to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s \u2022wrongful nature, and substantial experience in the practice of law. The hearing judge found that Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct is mitigated by the absence of prior attorney discipline and the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Remand and Supplemental Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In his original opinion, the hearing judge found that Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast during a meeting in Chanthunya\u2019s office was not credible. The hearing judge explained the basis for his finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY9\">[Traore] never called [law enforcement], never reported [the alleged assault] to any authorities[,] and continued to be represented by [Chanthunya]. If [Traore] told her husband[,] it would be odd that he never confronted [Chanthunya;] and[,] if [Traore] didn\u2019t tell her husband[,] that would be an abnormal reaction. I wasn\u2019t convinced by clear and convincing evidence that [Chanthunya] assaulted [ ] Traore[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In his original opinion, the hearing judge concluded that Chanthunya had violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act) and 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), but the hearing judge did not explain the bases for those conclusions. The hearing judge also concluded that Chanthunya had not violated MLRPC 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The Commission excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Traore\u2019s testimony concerning Chanthunya\u2019s touching of her breast was not credible. The Commission pointed out that Traore\u2019s testimony on this point was uncontested, that the hearing judge concluded that Chanthunya violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act), and that the only basis for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>a conclusion was the Commission\u2019s allegation that Chanthunya sexually assaulted Traore. The Commission asserted that the hearing judge\u2019s finding was influenced by the hearing judge\u2019s \u201cassumptions or beliefs about what the victim of a sexual assault would or should do[.]\u201d (Emphasis omitted). The Commission also excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Chanthunya had not violated MLRPC 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">We remanded to the hearing judge with instructions to address the following four issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">1. Reconciliation of what appears to be a discrepancy between his determination that [Chanthunya] violated [MLRPC] 8.4(b) in [ ] Traore\u2019s case and his finding that [ ] Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible as to the facts underlying the alleged [MLRPC] 8.4(b) violation; 2. Provide a better explanation for why he found that [ ] Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible on the issue of the unconsented sexual touching, if indeed he continues to maintain that; 3. Clarify the bases for the conclusion that \u201cThere is not clear and convincing evidence that [Chanthunya] violated [MLRPC] 8.4(a)\u201d, while also concluding elsewhere that [MLRPC] 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.4(b), and 8.4(d) were violated; and 4. Explain the basis for the conclusion that [Chanthunya] violated [MLRPC] 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">(Citations and paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In his supplemental opinion, the hearing judge determined that Chanthunya did not violate MLRPC 8.4(b) because the Commission failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Chanthunya sexually assaulted Traore. The hearing judge again found that Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast was not credible because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">Traore was vague regarding the date on which the alleged incident occurred, she failed to report the incident to the authorities, her husband failed to take any action[,] and she continued to allow [Chanthunya] to represent her. [] Traore\u2019s previous deceptions with respect to her immigration application cast additional doubt about her credibility.... Traore conceded that she: lied to U.S. Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>officials to gain entry into the United States; prepared a false document that she wanted to use for her asylum application; and lied on her Facebook page when she said [that] she worked for the French Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In his supplemental opinion, the hearing judge concluded that Chanthunya had violated MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice) by violating MLRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), and 1.4 (Communication) in representing Traore and Vanguere, and that Chanthunya had violated MLRPC 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC) by violating other MLRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shuler, </em>443 Md. 494, 501, 117 A.3d 38, 43 (2015) (\u201c[T]his Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[.]\u201d (Citations omitted)); Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d). This Court determines whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that a lawyer violated an MLRPC. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition [for disciplinary or remedial action] by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">(A) Contentions Other Than Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Chanthunya contends that the hearing judge erred in admitting records from USCIS into evidence because the records were inadmissible hearsay. In making this allegation, Chanthunya specifies only one exhibit: the Commission\u2019s Exhibit 4, which is USCIS\u2019s response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act by Michael Schwartz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(\u201cSchwartz\u201d), Traore\u2019s new lawyer. When the Commission offered its Exhibit 4 into evidence at the hearing, Chanthunya objected solely on a ground other than hearsay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, Chanthunya failed to preserve for review the issue of whether the Commission\u2019s Exhibit 4 was inadmissible hearsay. <em>See Peterson v. State, </em>444 Md. 105, 148, 118 A.3d 925, 949 (2015) (\u201cWhen an objector sets forth the specific grounds for his [or her] objection, the objector will be bound by those grounds and will ordinarily be deemed to have waived other grounds not specified[.]\u201d (Brackets, citation, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Chanthunya also contends that the hearing judge erred in accepting Ana Zigel (\u201cZigel\u201d) as an expert in the field of immigration and nationality law and in allowing Zigel to opine that Chanthunya was neither competent nor diligent in representing Traore and Vanguere. Specifically, Chanthunya argues that: (1) the Commission did not disclose during discovery that it would offer Zigel as an expert witness; (2) Zigel\u2019s opinions lacked a sufficient factual basis; (3) Zigel impermissibly speculated; and (4) Zigel\u2019s opinions lacked a basis that was generally accepted as reliable. We reject all of Chanthunya\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Chanthunya fails to state whether he ever required the Commission by interrogatory to identify anyone whom the Commission intended to call as an expert witness at the hearing. <em>See </em>Md. R. 2 \u2014 402(g)(1)(A) (\u201cA party by interrogatories may require any other party to identify each person, other than a party, whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial[.]\u201d). The record contains a scheduling order by the hearing judge stating that all discovery had to be completed by March 11, 2015. The discovery order did not specify a date for disclosure of expert witnesses, <em>i.e., </em>order the parties to disclose expert witnesses by a certain date. In the absence of a requirement by the hearing judge in the scheduling order that the parties disclose expert witnesses without being asked to do so, Maryland Rule 2-402(g) governs. As such, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-402(g), it was incumbent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>upon Chanthunya to request the identification of experts by interrogatory, which he failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Zigel\u2019s opinions had a sufficient factual basis. <em>See </em>Md. R. 5-702(3) (\u201c[A] sufficient factual basis [must] support [] expert testimony.\u201d). As the hearing judge detailed in his opinion, Zigel reviewed several documents related to Chanthunya\u2019s representation of Traore and Vanguere, and Zigel identified several defects in those documents; for example, Chanthunya failed to attach essential documents, such as the identification page of Traore\u2019s passport, to Traore\u2019s application for a green card.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">As long as an expert is qualified to testify, a sufficient factual basis supports an expert\u2019s opinion, and the expert\u2019s testimony will be helpful to the trier of fact, the expert may testify. <em>See </em>Md. R. 5-702 (\u201cExpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d); Md. R. 5-701 (excepting experts from the requirement that opinions be \u201crationally based on the perception of the witness\u201d); Md. R. 5-703(a) (\u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing.\u201d); <em>see also Cerrato-Molina v. State, </em>223 Md.App. 329, 333 n. 1, 115 A.3d 785, 788 n. 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>445 Md. 5, 122 A.3d 975 (2015) (\u201cThe appellant makes an automatic villain of the verb \u2018speculate.\u2019 It is a rush to judgment. The word\u2019s etymology looks to the Latin root \u2018spec,\u2019 meaning \u2018to look at.\u2019 \u2018To speculate\u2019 is then to think about the implications of what one has looked at and seen. Blind or purely random speculation, to be sure, can be treacherously deceptive. Informed and educated speculation, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>other hand, is a salutary and, indeed, indispensable part of the decision-making process.\u201d). In other words, an expert may render an opinion as long as the expert\u2019s opinion is based on sufficient facts, as opposed to the expert\u2019s mere speculation. <em>See In re 2012 Legislative Districting, </em>436 Md. 121, 188, 80 A.3d 1073, 1111 (2013) (\u201cAn expert\u2019s opinion must be grounded in sufficient facts, such that it constitutes more than mere speculation or conjecture.\u201d (Brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, in his findings of fact, the hearing judge detailed Zigel\u2019s qualifications as an expert, and it is obvious from Zigel\u2019s testimony that she had reviewed documents pertaining to Chanthunya\u2019s representation of Traore and Vanguere. Chanthunya\u2019s allegation that Zigel\u2019s testimony was speculation is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">An expert\u2019s opinion must have a basis that is generally accepted as reliable if and only if the expert\u2019s opinion is scientific; in other words, the <em>\u201cFrye-Reed </em>test\u201d applies only \u201cto evidence based on scientific opinion.\u201d <em>Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chesson, </em>399 Md. 314, 328, 923 A.2d 939, 947 (2007) (citations omitted). Thus, the <em>\u201cFrye-Reed </em>test\u201d does not apply to a legal expert\u2019s opinion that a lawyer violated the MLRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In sum, the hearing judge did not err in admitting Zigel as an expert in the field of immigration and nationality law and in allowing Zigel to opine that Chanthunya was neither competent nor diligent in representing Traore and Vanguere.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Chanthunya also contends that the hearing judge erred by failing to tell him at the hearing that the Commission met the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that Chanthunya had violated the MLRPC. Chanthunya alleges that he did not testify at the hearing because he did not think that the Commission had met its burden. Contrary to Chanthunya\u2019s assertion, in an attorney discipline proceeding, a hearing judge has no obligation to inform the lawyer at the hearing whether the Commission has met its burden of proof; if the lawyer has any evidence to offer and/or anything about which to testify, the lawyer should do so at the hearing, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the lawyer does not think that the Commission has met its burden of proof. Here, Chanthunya decided not to testify at the hearing, and his attempt to blame the hearing judge for the consequences of his decision is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Finally, Chanthunya contends that the hearing judge erred in not applying the law of ineffective assistance of counsel, as embodied in such cases as <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in evaluating his representation of Traore and Vanguere. Specifically, Chanthunya argues that the hearing judge should have applied the \u201cperformance\u201d prong and the \u201cprejudice\u201d prong under <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201c[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.... [A] court making the prejudice inquiry must ask if the defendant has met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.\u201d). <em>See also Gross v. State, </em>371 Md. 334, 350, 809 A.2d 627, 636 (2002) (This Court referred to the two-step inquiry under <em>Strickland </em>as <em>\u201cStrickland\u2019s </em>performance and prejudice prongs[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Chanthunya is mistaken. The law of ineffective assistance of counsel applies to cases in which a person has been criminally charged and convicted \u2014 typically, cases that arise out of petitions for postconviction relief. By contrast, in an attorney discipline proceeding, a hearing judge\u2019s role is to find facts and conclude whether the lawyer violated the MLRPC, as this Court has interpreted and applied them. For the purpose of determining whether a lawyer has violated the MLRPC, <em>Strickland </em>and its progeny do not apply to the analysis in an attorney discipline proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">(B) Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Finding That Traore\u2019s Testimony About Sexual Touching Was Not Credible</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In response to the hearing judge\u2019s supplemental opinion, the Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Traore\u2019s testimony regarding Chanthunya\u2019s touching of her breast was not credible. With regard to the hearing judge\u2019s finding in his supplemental opinion that Traore\u2019s \u201chusband failed to take any action[,]\u201d the Commission points out that Traore\u2019s husband did not testify, and, thus, there was no evidence that Traore\u2019s husband took no action; and, in any event, the Commissions asserts that it is inappropriate to assess a witness\u2019s testimony based on someone else\u2019s actions or omissions. The Commission contends that it was inappropriate for the hearing judge to consider that Traore did not contact law enforcement or terminate Chanthunya\u2019s representation because Traore testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [she] was supposed to do, because\u201d Chanthunya had Traore\u2019s immigration files, which included information about \u201call [of her] problems with the green card.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Reluctantly, we overrule the Commission\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast was not credible. Although the hearing judge again, partially, based his finding on what he believed that a victim of sexual assault would or should do\u2014 namely, report the incident to law enforcement and/or the victim\u2019s spouse, and cease contact with the perpetrator \u2014 the conundrum is that, even if the hearing judge relied on incorrect grounds in finding Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast not credible, it does not follow that Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast was, indeed, accurate. It is possible that Traore\u2019s testimony was <em>inaccurate </em>\u2014 ie., not credible \u2014 and the hearing judge found that Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible for the wrong reasons. By way of analogy, suppose that a witness inaccurately testified that \u201ctwo plus two equals five,\u201d and a hearing judge found that the witness\u2019s inaccurate testimony was not credible on the ground that \u201cthe witness was wearing a red tie, and people who wear red ties always lie.\u201d That the hearing judge found that the witness\u2019s testimony was not credible for the wrong reason does not mean that the witness\u2019s testimony was accurate. In the end, even though no other evidence contradicted Traore\u2019s testimony, this Court declines to supersede the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>hearing judge\u2019s determination that Traore\u2019s testimony on this matter was not credible. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>435 Md. 84, 104, 76 A.3d 1198, 1210 (2013) (\u201cWeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflict in the evidence are tasks [that are] proper for the\u201d hearing judge. (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Under the circumstances of this attorney discipline proceeding, we will not supplant the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible. We cannot stress enough, however, that we disapprove of the manner in which the hearing judge addressed Traore\u2019s testimony. In his original opinion, the hearing judge found Traore\u2019s testimony not credible solely on the following grounds: (1) Traore \u201cnever called [law enforcement], never reported [the alleged assault] to any authorities[,] and continued to be represented by\u201d Chanthunya; and (2) \u201c[i]f [Traore] told her husband[,] it would be odd that he never confronted [Chanthunya;] and[,] if [Traore] didn\u2019t tell her husband[,] that would be an abnormal reaction.\u201d The bases for the hearing judge\u2019s findings were so inappropriate that we instructed the hearing judge, on remand, to \u201c[pjrovide a better explanation for why he found that [] Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible on the issue of the unconsented sexual touching, if indeed he continues to maintain that[.]\u201d In his supplemental opinion, not adhering to this Court\u2019s instruction, the hearing judge essentially gave the same reasons that he had already expressed for finding that Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible, and simply added a few inconsequential new reasons.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, the hearing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>once again relied on the circumstances that Traore \u201cfailed to report the incident to the authorities^] her husband failed to take any action[;] and she continued to allow [Chanthunya] to represent her.\u201d Our concern is that, in both his original opinion and his supplemental opinion, which was in response to our remand order, the hearing judge based his finding on what he believed a victim of sexual assault and the victim\u2019s spouse would or should do \u2014 namely, inform law enforcement and cut off contact with the perpetrator, and, in the victim\u2019s spouse\u2019s case, confront the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">These beliefs are unfounded, and indicative of an uninformed view of the manner in which a victim of sexual assault responds to the occurrence. Contrary to the hearing judge\u2019s analysis, it is well known that, in many instances, a victim of sexual assault refrains from informing anyone of the sexual assault. Even when the victim informs someone, the disclosure may occur a great deal of time after the assault. There are voluminous possible reasons for the victim\u2019s permanent or protracted silence; examples include fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, an unwillingness to relive the experience, or, perhaps, fear that the victim will be disbelieved, ridiculed, or ostracized.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In an attorney discipline proceeding, a hearing judge must evaluate an allegation of sexual assault as the hearing judge would evaluate any other allegation of misconduct. Such an analysis would necessarily include consideration of the circumstances of the alleged misconduct, the purported victim\u2019s demeanor and manner of presentation in court, and consideration of any evidence that supports or contradicts the purported victim\u2019s report. Simply stated, we do not want hearing judges in future attorney discipline proceedings to assess a report of sexual assault in the manner that the hearing judge did in this attorney discipline proceeding \u2014 namely, by evaluating the allegation of sexual assault based on the hearing judge\u2019s unfounded beliefs of what a victim of sexual assault would or should do after such an incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Other Factual Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The Commission excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s refraining from finding as an aggravating factor vulnerability of the victims \u2014 Chanthunya\u2019s clients, Traore and Vanguere, both of whom were not United States citizens and who had immigrated to this country. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, </em>440 Md. 523, 558, 103 A.3d 629, 649 (2014), this Court concluded that a lawyer\u2019s misconduct was aggravated by vulnerability of the victim, even though this Court did not state that the hearing judge found as much. This Court noted the \u201cspecial vulnerability of immigrants as clients[,]\u201d given that people who immigrate to this country may be \u201cextremely vulnerable people, largely unable or unwilling as a practical matter to defend themselves[ ] from being preyed on[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 103 A.3d at 649 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as we did in <em>Thomas, </em>we determine that vulnerability of the victims was an aggravating factor. Accordingly, we sustain the Commission\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>In response to the hearing judge\u2019s original opinion, Chanthunya excepted to several of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, asking us \u201cto review the [testimony] of the witnesses ... and draw [our] own independent conclusions.\u201d Chanthunya contends, among other things, that the hearing judge \u201c[w]rongful[ly] evaluated]\u201d the evidence presented, that one of the hearing judge\u2019s findings is a \u201ctotal lie[,]\u201d that the hearing judge considered only evidence presented on direct examination and ignored testimony that Chanthunya elicited on cross-examination, and that the hearing judge \u201cdidn\u2019t grasp the main issue\u201d concerning Traore\u2019s application for a green card. For example, Chanthunya contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The hearing judge noted in his findings the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeM\">USCIS scheduled an interview on [ ] Traore\u2019s application for her green card. [ ] Traore and [her husband] appeared, but [Chanthunya] failed to appear. He called them at 7:30 am that morning and said that he had a flat tire. He did not ask USCIS to reschedule the interview on his client\u2019s behalf. He did not advise [ ] Traore and [her husband] as to what to expect at their interview. He did not prepare them for the interview. [Chanthunya] provided no evidence to explain his contradicting statements to his client and USCIS as to whether his failure to appear at the interview was deliberate or accidental. He provided no evidence that he prepared the client for the interview, or that he communicated with USCIS on the morning of the interview regarding his failure to appear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABR\">The hearing [j]udge erred in his summary because he only considered what [] Trao[r]e said in Examination in Chief. The [hearing j]udge did not include in his summary what [ ] Trao[r]e testified in Cross[-]Examination. He also did not review the documentary evidence in [the Commission]\u2019s Exhibit 4. Hence the Summary did not represent the whole truth about matters regarding the Interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">(Record references and bolding omitted). Thus, Chanthunya appears to take issue with the hearing judge\u2019s allegedly not having considered or included in the findings of fact all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>testimony and evidence. We are unable to extrapolate much more from Chanthunya\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">We observe initially that, just because Chanthunya disagrees with the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact does not make the findings of fact clearly erroneous. And, that the hearing judge does not mention a particular piece of evidence or particular testimony in making findings of fact does not mean that the hearing judge failed to consider such evidence. Indeed, as this Court has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">Our hearing [judges]\u2019 duties are to consider all evidence properly submitted in the discipline process. Absent indications that such evidence is not considered, we presume it was considered along with all the other evidence.... The fact that [ ] testimony [i]s not specifically discussed in the [hearing judge]\u2019s finding does not indicate a failure to consider it. Moreover, the [hearing judge is] free to disregard th[e] evidence if it was not credible. The reception of evidence is to a large degree entrusted to the discretion of the trial judge and will seldom be reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 385, 773 A.2d 463, 468 (2001) (citation and paragraph break omitted). Moreover, \u201cweighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflict in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder____ [T]he hearing judge may pick and choose which evidence to rely upon[.]\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Reviewing Chanthunya\u2019s exceptions as a whole, we are \u201cunable to discern any meaningful challenge to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Davy, </em>435 Md. 674, 694, 80 A.3d 322, 333 (2013); as such, we overrule the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">In response to the hearing judge\u2019s original opinion, Chanthunya also excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that there were several defects in documents that were related to Chanthunya\u2019s representation of Traore. The hearing judge\u2019s finding was supported by Zigel\u2019s expert opinion that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>several defects in the documents. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">For the above reasons, we overrule all of Chanthunya\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">(C) Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">By excepting to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Traore\u2019s testimony that Chanthunya touched her breast was not credible, the Commission implicitly excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion in his supplemental opinion that Chanthunya did not violate MLRPC 8.4(b). Chanthunya excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated MLRPC 8.4(d). For the below reasons, we overrule both parties\u2019 exceptions and uphold all of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">MLRPC 1.1 (Competence) and MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.

On Traore\u2019s behalf, Chanthunya filed an application for a green card with USCIS. The application for a green card contained inaccurate statements and spaces that were not filled in, and Chanthunya failed to attach essential documents, such as the identification page of Traore\u2019s passport. Additionally, after USCIS scheduled an interview regarding Traore\u2019s application for a green card, Chanthunya failed to: prepare Traore for the interview; advise her of what to expect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>interview; appear at the interview himself; and ask USCIS to reschedule the interview. Additionally, Chanthunya failed to pursue an appeal of USCIS\u2019s denial of Traore\u2019s applications for a green card and for a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions in his original opinion that Chanthunya violated MLRPC 1.1 and 1.3 in representing Vanguere. Chanthunya failed to: prepare Vanguere for the asylum hearing; advise her of the benefits and risks of postponing her case; advise her of the type of evidence that she needed; and submit on Vanguere\u2019s behalf corroborating evidence, such as evidence that Vanguere\u2019s family members had been persecuted in the Central African Republic. Chanthunya also failed to review the Baltimore Immigration Court\u2019s file to ensure its completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">MLRPC 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), and 1.4(b) (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall: ...

Additionally, after Traore telephoned Chanthunya to ask about an appeal\u2019s status, Chanthunya promised to call her back; however, Chanthunya failed to update Traore. Furthermore, on at least ten occasions during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Chanthunya\u2019s representation, Traore visited Chanthunya\u2019s office because he was not answering her telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion in his original opinion that Chanthunya violated MLRPC 1.4(b) in representing Vanguere.

In concluding that an indefinite suspension from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days was the appropriate sanction, this Court did not note any aggravating factors, and noted only one mitigating factor: the absence of prior attorney discipline. <em>See id. </em>at 98, 753 A.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brugh, </em>353 Md. 475, 478-79, 727 A.2d 913, 915, 914 (1999), this Court indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Maryland, with the right to apply for reinstatement after sixty days, a lawyer who violated MLRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 1.16(d) (Terminating Representation), and 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). In separately representing each of three clients, the lawyer \u201cneglected the matter and failed to communicate with his client.\u201d <em>Brugh, </em>353 Md. at 476, 727 A.2d at 913. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>observed that, at the time of his misconduct, the lawyer was experiencing personal problems in that his wife was having an affair. <em>See id. </em>at 477, 727 A.2d at 914. This Court also noted that the hearing judge found that the lawyer suffered from an adjustment disorder; that the lawyer had \u201crecovered]\u201d thanks to antidepressants and therapy; and that the lawyer was \u201cgenuinely remorseful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 727 A.2d at 914. Finally, at oral argument, the lawyer\u2019s counsel stated that the lawyer intended to pay within six months the money that the lawyer owed to his former clients. <em>See id. </em>at 478, 727 A.2d at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Here, Chanthunya violated MLRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(b) (Communication), and 8.4(d) (Conduct That Is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct cost Traore the opportunity to have USCIS consider an appeal, and impeded the progress of both of his clients in becoming naturalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We note five aggravating factors: (1) a pattern of misconduct, as Chanthunya engaged in similar misconduct in separately representing two clients; (2) multiple violations of the MLRPC; (3) a refusal to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature; (4) substantial experience in the practice of law, as Chanthunya had been a member of the Bar of Maryland for approximately ten years at the time of his misconduct; and (5) the victims\u2019 vulnerability, as both of Chanthunya\u2019s clients, Traore and Vanguere, were not United States citizens and had immigrated to this country, <em>see Thomas, </em>440 Md. at 558,103 A.3d at 649 (This Court noted the \u201cspecial vulnerability of immigrants as clients[,]\u201d given that people who immigrate to this Country may be \u201cextremely vulnerable people, largely unable or unwilling as a practical matter to defend themselves[ ] from being preyed on[.]\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We note two mitigating factors: (1) the absence of prior attorney discipline; and (2) the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>We conclude that the appropriate sanction for Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct is an indefinite suspension from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after sixty days. This sanction will impress on Chanthunya and other lawyers in immigration cases the importance of representing their clients competently, diligently, and with adequate communication, as clients in such cases are vulnerable and dependent on their lawyers for their \u2014 and, in some instances, their family members\u2019 \u2014 very ability to continue living in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">As noted above, in its filing, the Commission initially recommended that we indefinitely suspend Chanthunya from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after six months. At oral argument, however, Assistant Bar Counsel stated that, if this Court concluded that Chanthunya did not violate MLRPC 8.4(b), the Commission would recommend that we indefinitely suspend Chanthunya from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after sixty days. Upon consideration of Chanthunya\u2019s violations of MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(b), and 8.4(d), the negative impacts that Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct had on both of his clients, the five aggravating factors, and the fact that there are only two mitigating factors \u2014 the absence of prior attorney discipline and the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive \u2014 to adequately protect the public, we are more than convinced that the sanction that Bar counsel recommended at oral argument, an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after sixty days, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Although not involving entirely similar misconduct, <em>Mooney </em>and <em>Brugh </em>are helpful in determining the appropriate sanction in this case. Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct was not as serious as the lawyer\u2019s misconduct in <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 98, 97, 84, 87-88, 753 A.2d at 39, 31, 33-34; for example, Chanthunya did not violate MLRPC 8.4(c). Accordingly, <em>Mooney </em>suggests that Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct merits a sanction that is less than an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct is similar to that of the lawyer in <em>Brugh, </em>353 Md. at 476, 727 A.2d at 913; like the lawyer in <em>Brugh, </em>Chanthunya neglected cases and failed to communicate with clients. It is true that the lawyer in <em>Brugh, id. </em>at 478-79, 727 A.2d at 915, 914, violated an MLRPC that Chanthunya did not \u2014 namely, MLRPC 1.16(d) (Terminating Representation)\u2014 and the lawyer in <em>Brugh </em>engaged in misconduct involving three clients, in contrast to Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct involving two clients. No aggravating factors, however, accompanied the misconduct of the lawyer in <em>Brugh, id. </em>at 477, 727 A.2d at 914. And, significantly, the lawyer in <em>Brugh, id. </em>at 477-78, 727 A.2d at 914, offered substantial evidence of mitigating factors in the form of personal problems, a mental disability, remorse, and an effort to make restitution. Here, although Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct involved only two clients, as opposed to three, and although he did not violate MLRPC 1.16(d), there were multiple aggravating factors and fewer mitigating accompanying Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct. Specifically, only two mitigating factors accompany Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct, and five aggravating factors \u2014 including a refusal to acknowledge the misconduct, substantial experience in the practice of law, and the victims\u2019 vulnerability \u2014 accompany Chanthunya\u2019s misconduct. A comparison of <em>Brugh </em>with this case indicates that an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after sixty days is the appropriate sanction for Chanthunya.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">For the above reasons, we indefinitely suspend Chanthunya from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement after sixty days. The suspension will begin thirty days after the date on which this opinion is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761(b), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST ALEXANDER MANJANJA CHANTHUNYA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b643-6\">Judge HARRELL joins in the judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-13\">.

In Summer 2009 or 2010, Traore visited Chanthunya\u2019s office to give him some papers that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>related to her legal matters. Traore said that she needed to use the restroom. Chanthunya gave her the key to the restroom. Traore used the restroom and returned the key to Chanthunya, who then touched Traore\u2019s breast. Traore asked: \"What [was] that for?\u201d Chanthunya's only response was: \"Well.\u201d Chanthunya did not ask for permission to touch Traore's breast.

The record includes a transcript of the asylum hearing, which occurred in the Baltimore Immigration Court on May 4, 2009. At the asylum hearing, Vanguere testified as follows. All of Vanguere\u2019s family members belonged to a political party called the Movement of the Liberation of the People of Central Africa. On January 1, 1991, members of an opposing political party killed Vanguere\u2019s father. On May 28, 2001, a group of soldiers shot Vanguere\u2019s uncle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b623-4\">. At the hearing, during Schwartz\u2019s direct-examination, Assistant Bar Counsel asked Schwartz why he never asked for pages that were redacted from responses to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Schwartz responded: \"Because they aren't germane to the purposes for which I am seeking the record.\" Immediately afterward, Assistant Bar Counsel offered the Commission's Exhibit 4 into evidence. The hearing judge asked Chanthunya whether he objected, and Chanthunya responded: \"Yes.\u201d The hearing judge asked for the basis of Chanthunya's objection, and Chanthunya responded: \"My objection is, just as [Schwartz] said, the [Freedom of Information Act] request [is] germane to the papers.\u201d The hearing judge offered Chanthunya the opportunity to <em>voir dire </em>Schwartz about the Commission\u2019s Exhibit 4, and Chanthunya did so. After Chanthunya finished the <em>voir dire, </em>the hearing judge admitted the Commission's Exhibit 4 into evidence over Chanthunya\u2019s objection. At no point did Chanthunya indicate that hearsay was another ground for his objection to the Commission\u2019s Exhibit 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b623-5\">. We note that, prior to the hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding, Chanthunya filed a \"Motion to Strike [the Commissionj's Responses to [Chanthunya]'s Request for Admissions,\u201d in which Chanthunya argued that the intended introduction into evidence of the Commission\u2019s Exhibit 4 was problematic because \u201d[i]t [wa]s not known what [wa]s in the blocked pages[,] but certainly [the blocked pages] must have a bearing on the case for or against\u201d him, and that he had \u201cno effective means of defending himself without knowing the reasoning upon which USCIS twice denied [ ] Traore\u2019s\u201d application for waiver of grounds of admissibility and the \"reasoning process upon which USCIS granted [ ] Traore's\u201d third application. In essence, Chanthunya moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude introduction of the Commission\u2019s Exhibit 4. The hearing judge denied the motion. Chanthunya filed a motion for reconsideration, again referencing the Commission's Exhibit <em>4, </em>and arguing that the Commission \"did not rebut or offer any explanation why [Chanthunya] would not be prejudiced by missing information from [] Traore\u2019s file that [the Commission] intends to submit to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>[hearing judge] as part of its evidence[,]\u201d and asserting that it was \"incumbent on the [Commission] that its case be based on fact and not speculations^]\u201d The Commission opposed the motion for reconsideration. In a reply to the opposition, Chanthunya contended that he had \"demonstrated that [the Commission]^ failure to obtain full and complete records from USCIS and the [Baltimore] Immigration Court prejudice[d] him in preparation of his defense to [the] charges of misconduct.\u201d The hearing judge denied the motion for reconsideration. Chanthunya did not expressly contend in his filings that the Commission's Exhibit 4 was inadmissible hearsay. And, at the hearing in this attorney discipline proceeding, Chanthunya did not reference the arguments made in his filings or otherwise indicate a basis for not admitting the Commission's Exhibit 4 other than the reason that he provided at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b629-5\">. The new reasons were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">Traore was vague regarding the date on which the alleged incident occurred].] ... Traore conceded that she: lied to U.S. Government officials to gain entry into the United States; prepared a false document that she wanted to use for her asylum application; and lied on her Facebook page when she said [that] she worked for the French Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Traore's inability to recall the exact date on which Chanthunya allegedly touched her breast is the only one of these reasons that directly relates to the alleged assault itself and provides little to no support for the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">The Commission excepts to the other new reasons for which the hearing judge found that Traore\u2019s testimony was not credible. For example, the Commission contends that the hearing judge clearly erred in finding that Traore \"prepared a false document that she wanted to use for her asylum application\u201d; the Commission asserts that Traore testified that it was Chanthunya who proposed that she prepare a false document, which he would file as part of an application for asylum. As discussed above, the fact that the hearing judge found that the witness's testimony was not credible for the wrong reason does not mean that the witness\u2019s testimony was accurate. Accordingly, even if we sustained the Commission\u2019s exceptions to the new reasons for which the hearing judge found that Traore's testimony was not credible, it would not follow that Traore's testimony was accurate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. Case in point: In this attorney discipline proceeding, Traore testified that she \"didn\u2019t know what [she] was supposed to do\u201d about Chanthun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ya's touching of her breast because Chanthunya had her immigration files, which included damaging information about her. In other words, Traore feared that, if she informed anyone of the alleged assault, Chanthunya could harm her chances of succeeding in her immigration matters, or reveal the damaging information about her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\">. In response to the hearing judge\u2019s supplemental opinion, Chanthunya repeats the contentions and exceptions that he made in response to the hearing judge's original opinion. For the above reasons, we reject those contentions and overrule those exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">. In making his conclusion of law, the hearing judge did not specify a subsection of MLRPC 1.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\">. The Commission did not charge Chanthunya with violating MLRPC 8.4(a) in representing Vanguere, so we decline to conclude that Chanthunya violated MLRPC 8.4(a) in that instance. However, had the Commission charged Chanthunya with violating MLRPC 8.4(a) in representing Vanguere, we would have no difficulty in concluding that clear and convincing evidence supports a conclusion that Chanthunya violated MLRPC 8.4(a) based on Chanthunya\u2019s other violations of the MLRPC in representing Vanguere.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
