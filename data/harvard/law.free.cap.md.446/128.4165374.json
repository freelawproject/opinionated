The law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>classifies a violation of those regulations as a misdemeanor. While a police officer is generally authorized to arrest an individual who commits a misdemeanor in the officer\u2019s presence, a statute directs a police officer who observes a misdemeanor violation of an MAA regulation to issue a citation for the violation and also provides that an officer \u201cneed not\u201d make an arrest, except in certain circumstances. This case concerns whether an officer retains authority to arrest for such an offense even when the officer \u201cneed not\u201d do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">At the time of the incident giving rise to this case, Respondent Vadim Roshchin was employed as a driver by Respondent American Sedan Services, Inc. (\u201cAmerican Sedan\u201d). American Sedan is a commercial transportation service that has a permit from MAA to provide ground transportation services at BWI. In February 2010, Mr. Roshchin was picking up passengers at the airport without the required permit in his possession. Providing commercial transportation services at BWI without displaying a permit as required by an MAA regulation is a misdemeanor. Maryland Transportation Authority (\u201cMdTA\u201d) police, who happened to be conducting a special enforcement effort of the permit requirement that night, arrested Mr. Roshchin and impounded American Sedan\u2019s car. Both were released early the next day. The criminal charges against Mr. Roshchin were ultimately dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Two years later Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan sued MAA, MdTA, the MdTA police, and the State for false arrest, false imprisonment, and related claims. They asserted that the arrest of Mr. Roshchin and impoundment of the car without the issuance of a citation were unlawful, because issuing a citation is mandatory and, in these circumstances, exclusive of an arrest. They also argued that the regulation had to be posted at the airport to be enforceable and that it had not been posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">We hold that nothing in the MAA regulation or the Transportation Article deprives a police officer of the general authority under Maryland law to arrest an individual who com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>mits a misdemeanor in the presence of the officer. Thus, the arrest of Mr. Roshchin and the impoundment of the American Sedan car for noncompliance with the permit requirement were lawful. The regulation requiring commercial transportation services to display permits need only have been published in accordance with the State Administrative Procedure Act and State Documents Law and was not required to be posted at the airport as a prerequisite to its enforcement. On the basis of the undisputed facts, the claims of Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>A. Regulation of Ground Transportation at BWI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">MAA operates BWI, a State-owned airport. Maryland Code, Transportation Article (\u201cTR\u201d), \u00a7 5-412. MAA has established certain rules concerning the discharge and pick-up of passengers by commercial transportation services on the roadways adjacent to the airport terminal. MAA enters into contracts with certain transportation companies, which pay fees for the privilege of using the \u201cinner roadway\u201d near the baggage claim to pick up passengers who have not previously arranged for transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Certain other categories of commercial vehicles are authorized to use the \u201couter roadway\u201d under permits issued by MAA. One such category is for-hire commercial transportation services that arrange in advance to pick up arriving passengers. COMAR 11.03.01.05-1 A(6) (\u201cRegulation 05-1 A\u00a9\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These services are prohibited from picking up a passenger who has not made an arrangement with the service in advance. Regulation 05-1 C(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>MAA regulations require operators of commercial vehicles conducting business at BWI to obtain and display a permit from the MAA. Regulation 05-1 A(l), (3), C(5). A commercial operator that falls within this category must display the permit on the rearview mirror of the vehicle. There is no dispute that the failure to obtain or display the permit is a misdemeanor, although the parties disagree as to the statute that sets forth that offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The MdTA Police Force, a law enforcement agency created by State law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides law enforcement services at BWI. In particular, MdTA police officers have the powers \u201cof a peace officer and a police officer\u201d under State law on airport property. TR \u00a7 4-208(a)(2), (b). Among other things, MdTA police officers enforce the rules relating to the pick-up and discharge of passengers by commercial vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">From time to time, in response to numerous complaints about the unauthorized operation of commercial vehicles at BWI,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MAA and the MdTA police have conducted \u201cenforcement initiatives\u201d at the airport to deter such illegal activity. During such initiatives, police officers stop operators of commercial vehicles to determine whether they are operating legally. Initially, officers conducting enforcement initiatives issued citations to first time offenders and arrested recidivists. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>However, the MdTA police eventually concluded that arresting all violators was a more effective deterrent. One such arrest resulted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>B. The Arrest and Impoundment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The circumstances of the arrest of Mr. Roshchin and the impoundment of American Sedan\u2019s vehicle are undisputed. During the evening of February 23, 2010, MAA and the MdTA police were conducting an initiative at BWI focused on enforcement of the regulations requiring commercial transportation services to obtain and display a permit. As part of that effort, police officers stopped commercial vehicles to check for permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">On that evening, Mr. Roshchin was operating a commercial vehicle on behalf of American Sedan to make a pre-arranged pick-up of two passengers at BWI. American Sedan had a valid permit for the vehicle,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but Mr. Roshchin had left it in a different American Sedan vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, he was picking up the passengers without displaying a permit, in violation of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">At around 7:40 p.m. on that night, officers stopped Mr. Roshchin and determined that he was not displaying a permit. They arrested him and impounded American Sedan\u2019s vehicle. Mr. Roshchin was processed at the MdTA police facility at BWI and then transported with other arrestees to a District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Court Commissioner in Anne Arundel County. The Commissioner issued a charging document alleging that Mr. Roshchin had violated Regulation 05-1 and released him on his own recognizance early the next morning. American Sedan recovered its vehicle that day after paying a $150 towing fee. The State\u2019s Attorney for Anne Arundel County eventually decided not to prosecute Mr. Roshchin.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>C. The Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Two years later, in February 2012, Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against the State of Maryland, MAA, MdTA, and the MdTA police (collectively, \u201cthe State\u201d). The counts seeking relief for Mr. Roshchin alleged false arrest, false imprisonment, and a violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \u2014 the due process clause of the Maryland Constitution. The counts seeking relief for American Sedan asserted tort claims for trespass to chattels and tortious interference with business relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The State moved for summary judgment on the basis that the arrest was supported by probable cause and did not violate Mr. Roshchin\u2019s rights under Article 24, and that the impoundment of the American Sedan vehicle was appropriate in light of the lawful arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Circuit Court granted summary judgment for the State on all counts, relying on Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), \u00a7 2-202, which authorizes a police officer to make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor committed in the presence of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan appealed. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment. 219 Md.App. 169, 100 A.3d 499 (2014). The court concluded that the arrest did not violate Mr. Roshchin\u2019s constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>rights because the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that Mr. Roshchin had committed a misdemeanor in the officer\u2019s presence. Nonetheless, it also held that the officer lacked legal justification for the arrest. In particular, the court concluded that TR \u00a7 5-1104, which provides that an officer \u201cshall prepare\u201d a citation and \u201cneed not\u201d arrest an individual charged with a misdemeanor under the State aviation law, limited the officer\u2019s discretion to take Mr. Roshchin into custody. The court further reasoned that, because TR \u00a7 5-1104 is the more specific statute, it prevailed over the general arrest authority conferred on police officers by CP \u00a7 2-202. The court also held that the regulation that Mr. Roshchin had allegedly violated was required to be posted to be enforceable and that there was a factual dispute as to whether the regulation had been properly posted, rendering summary judgment inappropriate. For the same reasons, the court also reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s award of summary judgment on the two tort claims of American Sedan.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to consider whether there was legal justification for the arrest of Mr. Roshchin and whether posting of the regulation affects that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">At issue before us is whether the State is entitled to summary judgment on Mr. Roshchin\u2019s claims of false arrest and false imprisonment and American Sedan\u2019s related tort claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [a] party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-501(a). Because the decision turns on resolution of a legal issue, a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is \u201csubject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>a non-deferential review on appeal.\u201d <em>Muskin v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>422 Md. 544, 554, 30 A.3d 962 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">A. <em>Whether There was Legal Justification to Arrest Mr. Roshchin that Precludes Potential Tort Liability in this Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">1. The relationship between tort liability and police authority to arrest a driver and impound a vehicle</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">For a plaintiff to succeed on a false arrest or false imprisonment claim, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant deprived the plaintiff \u201cof his or her liberty without consent and without legal justification.\u201d <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 190, 757 A.2d 118 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). One possible legal justification for an arrest is set forth in CP \u00a7 2-202(b), which provides that a police officer \u201cmay arrest without a warrant a person who commits ... a ... misdemeanor in the presence or within the view of the police officer.\u201d This provision codifies the common law concerning the authority of a peace officer to make an arrest in those circumstances. <em>See </em>D. Kauffman, <em>The Law of Arrest in Maryland, </em>5 Md. L.Rev. 125, 155-57 (1941). In other words, a police officer who observes a person committing a misdemeanor and makes a warrantless arrest of the offender ordinarily will not be liable for false arrest or false imprisonment, because CP \u00a7 2-202 provides legal justification for the deprivation of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Likewise, one is not liable for trespass to chattels when one \u201cis acting in discharge of ... authority created by law to preserve the public safety, health, peace, or other public interest, and [one\u2019s] act is reasonably necessary to the performance of [one\u2019s] duty ...\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 265. Police have authority to \u201cseize and remove ... vehicles impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>409 Md. 415, 430 n. 5, 975 A.2d 877 (2009). Pursuant to Regulation 05(B)(2), a vehicle may not be left unattended at curbside at BWI, because it poses a threat to public safety and an impediment to public convenience. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>There is no exception to this rule when the vehicle is unattended because the driver was arrested. Thus, police have authority to seize and remove a vehicle left unattended at curbside at BWI as a result of a lawful arrest and their doing so does not give rise to liability for trespass to chattels.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">To prove tortious interference with business relations one must show, among other things, that the defendant acted with malice. <em>Natural Design, Inc. v. Rouse Co., </em>302 Md. 47, 71, 485 A.2d 663 (1984). Malice, in this context, means an act that is wrongful and without legal justification. <em>Id.; Ronald M. Sharrow, Chartered v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>306 Md. 754, 764, 511 A.2d 492 (1986) (citing <em>Stannard v. McCool, </em>198 Md. 609, 617, 84 A.2d 862 (1951)). A lawful arrest of a driver and impoundment of an unattended vehicle constitutes legal justification for an act that would otherwise be tortious interference with business relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In short, there is ordinarily no liability for false arrest, false imprisonment, trespass to chattels, or tortious interference with business relations when a police officer observes a driver committing a misdemeanor, arrests the driver, and impounds the now-unattended vehicle that has been left where it may not be left unattended.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">2. Whether TR \u00a7 5-1104 Precludes an Arrest in these Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan argue that the ordinary rule does not apply in this case because the arresting officer failed to issue a citation to Mr. Roshchin and, in any event, the officer\u2019s authority was limited in these circumstances to issuing a citation instead of effecting an arrest. They also contend that MAA itself has interpreted its own regulation to preclude an arrest for failure to display a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan rely on TR \u00a7 5-1104. They argue that this statute makes the issuance of a citation a prerequisite to an arrest and, in the circumstances of this case, precludes an arrest. TR \u00a7 5-1104 provides that, when a person is \u201capprehended by a police officer\u201d for a misdemeanor violation of any provision of Title 5 of the Transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Article \u2014 the aviation title of that Article \u2014 or for the misdemeanor \u201cviolation of any rule, regulation, or order adopted under\u201d Title 5, \u201cthe officer <em>shall </em>prepare and sign a written citation.\u201d TR \u00a7 5-1104(a) (emphasis added). If the person charged gives \u201chis written promise to appear in court by signing the form for written promise on the citation prepared by the police officer,\u201d then \u201cthe officer <em>need not </em>take the person into physical custody for the violation unless\u201d one of two conditions is met: either \u201c[t]he person charged does not furnish satisfactory evidence of identity,\u201d or \u201c[t]he officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person charged will disregard a written promise to appear.\u201d TR \u00a7 5-1104(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan argue that the issuance of a citation pursuant to TR \u00a7 5-1104(a) and the opportunity for the alleged violator to provide a written promise to appear in court are a prerequisite for an officer to have discretion to arrest under TR \u00a7 5-1104(c) \u2014 and then only if one of the two conditions in that subsection is met. Because the arresting officer did not issue a citation to Mr. Roshchin and because neither of the conditions mentioned in TR \u00a7 5-1104(c) were present, they argue, the officer had no authority to arrest Mr. Roshchin.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">This poses a question of statutory construction. In construing a statute, one begins with the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statutory language and may end there if the meaning is plain enough.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But even when the language is unambiguous, it is useful to review legislative history of the statute to confirm that interpretation and to eliminate another version of legislative intent alleged to be latent in the language.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is also a common maxim of statutory construction that related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>statutes governing the same subject are to be construed together and harmonized.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Statutory Text</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">CP \u00a7 2-202 provides that an officer \u201cmay arrest\u201d for a misdemeanor committed in the officer\u2019s presence. The verb \u201cmay\u201d indicates that an officer has the authority to arrest, but need not do so. <em>Rockwood Casualty Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>385 Md. 99, 119, 867 A.2d 1026 (2005) (\u201cmay\u201d commonly understood to confer discretion). The first clause of the key sentence in TR \u00a7 5-1104(c) states that an officer \u201cneed not\u201d arrest for a misdemeanor violation of a regulation adopted under the aviation title of the Transportation Article if the alleged violator provides a written promise to appear in court. The phrase \u201cneed not\u201d expresses that an arrest is not mandatory in these circumstances \u2014 apparently a restatement of the discretion that an officer has under the general arrest authority granted by CP \u00a7 2-202.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The second clause of that sentence qualifies that general statement and appears to restrict the officer\u2019s discretion to forgo an arrest in certain <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 i.e., when the alleged violator fails to provide satisfactory evidence of identity or there are reasonable grounds to believe that the violator will not appear in court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is no contention that either of those circumstances existed in this case and thus the officer had the usual discretion to arrest \u2014 or forgo an arrest \u2014 for a misdemeanor committed in the officer\u2019s presence. Hence, under the statutes, the officer could, but did not need to, arrest Mr. Roshchin.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In asserting that TR \u00a7 5-1104 precludes an arrest in these circumstances, Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan argue that TR \u00a7 5-1104, which requires the issuance of a citation, is more specific than CP \u00a7 2-202, which authorizes a police officer generally to arrest for misdemeanors committed in an officer\u2019s presence. They also note that CP \u00a7 2-201(b) specifically says that the subtitle that contains CP \u00a7 2-202, which grants the authority to arrest, \u201cdoes not deprive a person of the right to receive a citation for ... a criminal violation as provided by law or the Maryland Rules.\u201d Thus, they conclude, both because the specific governs the general and because CP \u00a7 2-201(b) explicitly protects the right to receive a citation, Mr. Roshchin had a right to receive a citation in lieu of being arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">It is true that \u201c \u2018when two statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 194, 909 A.2d 694 (2006) (quoting <em>State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 116, 695 A.2d 143 (1997)). It is also true that TR \u00a7 5-1104(a) states that an officer \u201cshall\u201d issue a citation for a misdemeanor violation of regulations under the aviation title of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Typically the issuance of a citation is an alternative to making an arrest for an alleged offense. But citation and arrest are not mutually exclusive. That much is clear from TR \u00a7 5-1104 itself, which directs an officer in certain circumstances to arrest an alleged violator to whom the officer has issued a citation. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 5-1104(c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Hence, these statutes do not conflict. Because the canon of construction that the specific governs the general applies when two statutes conflict, but these statutes do not conflict, the more \u201cspecific\u201d statute does not negate the authority-granted by the more general statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">While Mr. Roshchin may have had a right, pursuant to CP \u00a7 2 \u2014 201(b) and TR \u00a7 5-1104(a), to receive a citation, that requirement has no bearing on whether the officer had authority to arrest him. A failure to satisfy the direction in TR \u00a7 5-1104(a) to issue a citation does not detract from the authority provided in CP \u00a7 2-202 \u2014 TR \u00a7 5-1104 does not specify <em>any </em>consequences for the failure to issue a citation and so the officer still had discretion to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The legislative history of TR \u00a7 5-1104 does not reveal a legislative purpose to trump the usual arrest powers of police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>officers. The predecessor of TR \u00a7 5-1104 was originally enacted in 1949 as a part of the revised \u201cAeronautics\u201d article of the Maryland Code (Article 1A) that authorized the enforcement of regulations adopted under that article. Chapter 422, \u00a7 31, Laws of Maryland 1949. As originally enacted, the provision did not specifically address the issuance of citations or making arrests. The statute was recodified as Article 1A, \u00a7 10-1001 when the article was revised in 1974. Chapter 363, Laws of Maryland 1974. The revised version of the statute stated that a law enforcement officer who apprehends a violator <em>\u201cmay </em>prepare\u201d a citation and that the officer was \u201cnot required\u201d to take the alleged violator into custody unless the person could not furnish satisfactory evidence of identity or the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person would disregard a promise to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">This language was in contrast to a contemporary provision of the Maryland Vehicle Code that stated that an officer \u201cshall\u201d issue a citation for certain violations, but that, in specified circumstances (including when there was failure to provide satisfactory evidence of identity or there were reasonable grounds to believe the person would disregard a provision to appear), the officer had discretion to issue a citation \u201cor\u201d arrest the alleged violator \u2014 apparently identifying issuance of a citation and arrest as alternative courses of action. Maryland Code, Article 663A, \u00a7 16-107 (1974). The authority to issue a citation or to arrest for a violation of the Maryland Vehicle Code is now incorporated in TR \u00a7 26-201 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In 1977, the aviation provision was recodified in its current location as part of the Transportation Article. Chapter 13, Laws of Maryland 1977. The code revisors indicated that the language had been revised to \u201cconform more closely\u201d to a similar provision in the Natural Resources Article (\u201cNR\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at pp. 248-49 (Revisor\u2019s Note). The referenced provision in the Natural Resources Article \u2014 NR \u00a7 1-205 \u2014 as revised in 1973, had been \u201cmodeled\u201d after the provision in Motor Vehicle Code mentioned above (Article 66)6, \u00a7 16-107). <em>See </em>Chapter 4, 1st Spec. Sess., Laws of Maryland 1973 at p. 466 (Revisor\u2019s Note). The revisors indicated that the language was included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>in NR \u00a7 1-205 \u201cto elucidate the circumstances under which a Natural Resources Police officer <em>must </em>take a person into custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">When one wanders through the weeds of this legislative history, it is evident that the code revisors were attempting to conform similar, although not identical, code provisions concerning the issuance of citations in relation to arrests that appeared in different articles of the Maryland Code. But it is equally evident that the provision of the Motor Vehicle Code, which specified circumstances in which an officer has discretion to arrest, is distinct from the other two provisions, which are phrased in terms of the circumstances under which an officer must arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In any event, there is no indication in the legislative history that the General Assembly intended to abrogate the common law authority of a peace officer to arrest for a misdemeanor committed in the officer\u2019s presence \u2014 authority that the Legislature codified in the predecessor to CP \u00a7 2-202 in 1969. Chapter 561, Laws of Maryland 1969. Thus, we are reluctant to construe TR \u00a7 5-1104 as limiting that authority. <em>See Mummert v. Alizadeh, </em>435 Md. 207, 214, 77 A.3d 1049 (2013) (\u201cstatutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed, and it is not to be presumed that the Legislature ... intended to make any alteration in the common law other than what has been specified and plainly pronounced\u201d) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>Significance of the Acting Parking Manager\u2019s Letter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan argue that MAA itself has interpreted Regulation 05-1 to be enforceable only by the issuance of a citation without an arrest, and that this agency interpretation should be given deference. <em>See Maryland Bd. of Pub. Works v. K. Hovnanian\u2019s Four Seasons at Kent Island, LLC, </em>425 Md. 482, 520, 42 A.3d 40 (2012) (\u201ca reviewing court is required to give considerable deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation\u201d). They point to correspondence by BWI\u2019s Acting Parking Manager directed to permit holders in June 2009. In that notice, which largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>concerned the continuing validity of permits issued in previous years, the Acting Manager added a warning that permit holders could be fined if they failed to display their permits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Acting Parking Manager\u2019s letter did not purport to be an interpretation of the enforcement provisions of the aviation title of the Transportation Article and said nothing, one way or the other, about police authority to arrest violators. Moreover, the authority to arrest in this case did not come from the MAA regulation, but rather CP \u00a7 2-202 and the common law, which MAA does not administer. In any event, the reference to a fine appeared to be a reminder that there could be adverse consequences for failing to display a permit even if, as the letter detailed, the permit on its face appeared to have expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Finally, the degree of deference given to an agency interpretation depends on, among other things, \u201cwhether the agency (1) administers the statute it is interpreting, (2) developed its interpretation through a well-reasoned process, (3) in an adversarial proceeding or formal rule promulgation, and (4) consistently applied that interpretation for a \u2018long\u2019 period of time.\u201d <em>Bayly Crossing, LLC v. Consumer Protection Division, </em>417 Md. 128, 137-38, 9 A.3d 4 (2010). None of these criteria appear to be met here; thus, even if the letter were considered an interpretation of the regulation, it would be accorded little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">3. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Thus, while statute directs an arresting officer to issue a citation for a failure to display a permit in violation of Regulation 05-1, the issuance of a citation was not a prerequisite to arresting Mr. Roshchin for that offense. Nor does the statutory direction to issue a citation preclude the making of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>arrest in these circumstances. There is no dispute that the officer had probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor violation of the regulation was being committed in the officer\u2019s presence. Accordingly, there was legal justification for the arrest.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>B. Whether a Factual Dispute about Posting of the Regulation Matters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan contend that, even if the statutes permit an arrest for violation of Regulation 05-1, that regulation would not have been enforceable at the time of Mr. Roshchin\u2019s arrest if it was not posted at that time. The Court of Special Appeals agreed on that point and concluded that there was a factual dispute as to whether the regulation had been posted prior to the arrest, thereby precluding the award of summary judgment. 219 Md.App. at 179, 100 A.3d 499. The State contends that posting is immaterial to the enforceability of the permit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">1. Preservation of the issue</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">As an initial matter, Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan argue that this issue is not properly before this Court because the State failed to raise it in its petition for <em>certiorari. </em>We granted <em>certiorari </em>to determine whether a police officer has authority to make an arrest for the misdemeanor offense of failing to display a permit in violation of a regulation under the aviation title of the Transportation Article. If, as Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan contend, the answer may turn on whether the particular regulation has been posted, then the issue is implicitly contained within the question on which we granted <em>certiorari. </em>In any event, this Court retains discretion to consider such an issue, even if not expressed explicitly in the petition for certiorari,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and we shall do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>2. Statutory authority for the regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">MAA proposed to adopt Regulation <em>05-1 </em>in <em>1998, </em>together with two other new regulations and amendments to two existing regulations. <em>See </em>25:25 Md. Reg. 1853 (December 4, 1998). While the regulatory action largely concerned the issuance of permits to commercial and courtesy vehicles to operate at BWI and the enforcement of the permit requirement, it also proposed amendments to existing regulations, one of which concerned parking and ground transportation at BWI.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The proposed new regulations and amendments were ultimately adopted as proposed. 26:5 Md. Reg. 392 (effective July 1, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The notice listed four statutes as providing authority for the regulations that were the subject of the notice: TR \u00a7\u00a7 5-204, 5-208, 5-408, and 5-426.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These statutes provide support for MAA to adopt regulations for various purposes, but some have only tangential, if any, relevance to the permit requirement in Regulation 05-1. We examine in turn each of those provisions, which are unchanged in pertinent part since the 1998 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\"><em>TR \u00a7 5-204. </em>This statute provides MAA with authority to adopt regulations that are \u201cfor the functioning and administr\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tion\u201d of MAA. TR \u00a7 5-204(d)(4). The regulations proposed in 1998 and adopted the following year dealt with the \u201cfunctioning and administration\u201d of MAA in the sense that they detailed the responsibilities of MAA\u2019s Division of Transportation and Terminal Services with respect to the issuance of permits to commercial transportation services and assigned the Division authority to conduct disciplinary proceedings as set forth in Regulation 05-2. TR \u00a7 5-204 does not set forth any special publication or posting requirement for such regulations. Thus, any regulations would be published and available in accordance with the State Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), which provides for notice and publication of proposed regulations,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the State Documents Law, which provides for the compilation of regulations in COMAR.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><em>TR \u00a7 5-208. </em>This provision broadly authorizes MAA to adopt regulations to carry out its duties under State law, to protect public safety, and to develop aviation in Maryland, among other things. TR \u00a7 5-208(a).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is likely to be authority for any regulation adopted by MAA consistent with its statutory responsibilities. TR \u00a7 5-208 explicitly requires that MAA regulations be filed and \u201cmade available\u201d in accordance with the State APA and the State Documents Law. TR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u00a7 5-208(c). It also does not contain an additional posting requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><em>TR \u00a7 5-408. </em>This statute authorizes MAA to enter into contracts and other \u201carrange[ments]\u201d regarding services provided by or at an airport. TR \u00a7 5-408(a). It authorizes MAA to establish \u201cterms and conditions\u201d for those entities that MAA allows to provide services at an airport. TR \u00a7 5-408(b). Under this provision, MAA clearly has authority to regulate those who provide commercial transportation services at BWI, which is no doubt why it was cited in the notice.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See TR 5-408(a)(1) (MAA \u201cmay ... [g]rant to the person the privilege of ... [supplying services ... at the airport\u201d). TR \u00a7 5-408 does not explicitly authorize MAA to adopt regulations, but in carrying out the authority conferred by the statute, MAA is likely to establish generally applicable policies that fall within the definition of regulation under the State APA and would therefore be required to be expressed in regulation pursuant to the State APA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This statute does not make posting a prerequisite to the exercise of the powers it confers on MAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><em>TR \u00a7 5-426. </em>This statute authorizes MAA to adopt regulations regarding parking, traffic, safety, and order at an airport. TR \u00a7 5-426(a). It explicitly requires that regulations adopted under the statute \u201cbe posted conspicuously in a public place at the airport\u201d \u2014 a requirement that was in the statute in 1998. TR \u00a7 5-426(b). It was likely included as part of the statutory authority for the regulatory action proposed in the 1998 notice because that notice proposed an amendment of Regulation 05, entitled \u201cControl of Landside Traffic and Ground Transportation,\u201d which regulates parking at the airport in some detail (although the 1998 amendment did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>concern parking). In addition, the new Regulation 05-1 cross-referenced the parking regulations in Regulation 05.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">3. Whether posting was necessary to enforce the permit requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan have consistently focused solely on TR \u00a7 5-426 as the source of authority for the permit requirement in Regulation 05-1 and asserted that, accordingly, the regulation had to be posted to be enforced. The State has been inconsistent during the course of this case as to the source of authority for the offense for which Mr. Roshchin was arrested \u2014 failure to display a permit. In the Circuit Court, the State apparently accepted the contention that TR \u00a7 5-426 was the source of authority for the regulation and that, accordingly, the penalty was set forth in TR \u00a7 5-427(b) (violation of regulation adopted under TR \u00a7 5-426\u2014 other than a parking regulation \u2014 is a misdemeanor punishable by a f\u00edne up to $500). In holding that the arrest of Mr. Roshchin was justified on the basis of a misdemeanor committed in the officer\u2019s presence, the Circuit Court referred to the misdemeanor offense set forth in TR \u00a7 5-427(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, the State continued to accept the premise that TR \u00a7 5-426 was the pertinent statute underlying the offense, but argued that posting was not required for the regulation to be effective. It is thus unsurprising that the intermediate appellate court focused in its opinion on the posting requirement set forth in TR \u00a7 5-426(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Before us, the State has taken the position that the permit requirement of Regulation 05-1 was not \u2014 and could not have been \u2014 adopted under TR \u00a7 5-426. It now points to TR \u00a7 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>208 and TR \u00a7 5^408 as the bases for those portions of the regulation and, accordingly, cites TR \u00a7 5 \u2014 1105(a)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> as defining the relevant misdemeanor for which Mr. Roshchin was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">If this were a criminal prosecution, we might well hold the State to its original position and limit the potential criminal penalty to be imposed accordingly. A violation of TR \u00a7 5-1105(a) potentially carries a term of incarceration while the penalty under TR \u00a7 5-427(b) is limited to a fine. But this is not a criminal prosecution, both statutes define misdemeanors for which an arrest may be made, and the only issue before us is whether public posting in addition to the requirements of the State APA and State Documents Law is required for the permitting scheme established by the regulation to be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In our view, TR \u00a7 5-208 and TR \u00a7 5-408 are the statutes that confer authority on MAA to adopt and enforce a permit requirement <em>for </em>commercial transportation services. Regulation 05-1 is essentially a licensing regulation that governs the authority of commercial and courtesy vehicles to operate at an airport under permits granted by MAA. The authority for its adoption is found in TR \u00a7 5-408 (the statute that allows MAA to set up a permitting arrangement for ground transportation services) and TR \u00a7 5-208 (the statute that authorizes MAA to adopt regulations to carry out its responsibilities) alone. Both of those statutes require only the normal notice and publication required by the State APA and Documents Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>TR \u00a7 5-426 supplies none of the authority necessary to adopt a regulation imposing a permitting regime. If MAA had <em>only </em>the rulemaking authority in TR \u00a7 5-426 (concerning parking, traffic, etc.) it could not have created this permitting regime in Regulation 05-1. On the other hand, if MAA did not have the rulemaking authority in TR \u00a7 5-426, it still could have adopted the permit requirement for commercial transportation services under TR \u00a7 5-208 and TR \u00a7 5-408. Consequently, Regulation 05-1 was not \u201cadopted under\u201d TR \u00a7 5-426.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In our view, the citation of TR \u00a7 5-426 \u2014 presumably because the regulation cross-references and incorporates parking and traffic laws adopted under the authority of TR \u00a7 5-426 \u2014 does not import the posting requirement of TR \u00a7 5-426 into the other statutes that provide authority for the permit requirement. Regulation 051 need not have been posted to be enforced. Thus, any factual dispute regarding posting is not material to the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we hold that, on the basis of the undisputed facts, the arrest of Mr. Roshchin and impoundment of the American Sedan vehicle were lawful. The Circuit Court properly awarded summary judgment on the tort claims asserted in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals Reversed.

Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan assert that the relevant misdemeanor is defined in TR \u00a7 5-427(b), which provides for a penalty of a fine of up to $500. The State entities contend that the relevant statute is TR \u00a7 5-1105(a), which states that the penalty is up to 90 days imprisonment, a $500 fine, or both. <em>See also </em>Regulation 10D(3). Although the applicable criminal penalty is irrelevant to this civil case, for other reasons we later determine that TR \u00a7 5-1105(a) defines the relevant misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Part II.B of this opinion below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">.

While the putative expiration date of American Sedan\u2019s permit had long passed, there is no dispute that it remained valid. At the time of the enforcement initiatives in 2009 and 2010, many permits- \u2014 -including permits held by American Sedan \u2014 apparently stated on their face that they expired on June 30, 2006 or June 30, 2007. Consistent with a notice sent to permit holders by MAA\u2019s Acting Manager of Parking and Transportation in June 2009, MdTA police officers recognized the validity of such permits. (As we shall see later in this opinion, Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan also rely on a statement in the Acting Parking Manager\u2019s June 2009 notice that failure to display a permit \"could result in a $50.00 fine.\u201d <em>See </em>Part II.A.2 of this opinion below.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\">.

Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan also moved for partial summary judgment contending that they were entitled as a matter of law to a ruling that a violation of Regulation 05-1 A(l) is not an offense for which an alleged violator may be arrested or incarcerated. The Circuit Court did not explicitly rule on that motion, although its disposition of the State's motion effectively denied it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">.

While resolution of that issue might affect the course of a criminal prosecution, we need not resolve whether \"shall\u201d is directory or mandatory to answer the questions presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">. Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan note that TR \u00a7 5-1104(c) provides that a person who has received a citation \"may give his written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>promise to appear in court\u201d by signing the citation. They argue that this is \"rendered meaningless\u201d if the police have discretion to arrest the person even if the person has signed the citation form. TR \u00a7 5-1104(c) may be given its full effect even if the alleged violator is arrested; the alleged violator need only be given the opportunity to sign the form and promise to appear in court. A willingness to sign the form and promise to appear may be to a person\u2019s advantage even if it does not avoid arrest, because, for example, it may affect a judicial officer's decision whether to release the individual and what, if any, conditions to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan also observe that a citation can be an alternative charging document to a statement of charges, and that, when an offender is arrested without a warrant, \"unless an information is filed in the District Court, the officer who has custody of the defendant shall ... cause a statement of charges to be filed against the defendant in the District Court.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-211(b)(2). The charges are then given to the defendant at the first court appearance. Maryland Rule 4-213(a)(2). Asserting that a statement of charges would be duplicative of a citation, Mr. Roshchin and American Sedan say that it is anomalous to give a citation to a person who is to be arrested. However, as noted in the text, TR \u00a7 5-1104(c) explicitly contemplates that an alleged violator who receives a citation will also be arrested \u2014 and presumably receive a statement of charges later in the proceeding. Moreover, the rules allow for several types of charging documents. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-102(a) (defining \"charging document\u201d). It is not unusual for one charging document to be superseded by another in a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. Mr. Roshchin also points to deposition testimony of the Acting Manager that, at the time he sent the letter, he believed that the penalty for failing to display a permit was limited to a fine. That may be because the MAA parking regulations provided for a $50 fine for failure to display a permit. <em>See </em>Regulation 05 E(2)(k).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">.

Indeed, the statute has been construed to provide MAA with state action immunity under the federal antitrust laws in connection with its regulation of commercial taxicabs at BWI. <em>See </em>73 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>38 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\">. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-101(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">. In particular, it provided that \"[p]arking is only allowed in the public parking facilities subject to current parking rates and regulations.\u201d Regulation 05-1 A(4). Similarly, the regulation prohibits a permit holder from violating the parking regulations. Regulation 05-1 C(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Other portions of the regulations proposed in 1998 prohibit violation of State traffic laws, which arguably concerns the movement of traffic at the airport. <em>See </em>Regulation 05-1 C(10)-(l 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, any person who violates any provision of this title or of any rule, regulation, or order adopted or issued under this title is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding 90 days or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\"><em>See also </em>Regulation 10 D(3) (\"Violators of any other of these regulations may be charged with a misdemeanor and, upon conviction ..., shall be subject to a maximum fine of $500, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b187-11\">. If indeed TR \u00a7 5-426 were the statutory authority for the licensing regime, we would agree with the cogent analysis of that statute by the Court of Special Appeals concerning the requirement of posting. <em>See </em>219 Md.App. at 178-80, 100 A.3d 499. As noted above, the other statutory sources of authority for the 1998 regulatory proposal' \u2014 in particular, those that related to the permit requirement \u2014 were apparently not brought to the attention of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8O\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Respectfully, I dissent.
