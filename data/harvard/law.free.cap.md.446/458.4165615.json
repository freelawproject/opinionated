Bircher, </em>442 Md. 743, 114 A.3d 710 (2015). The trial judge in this case had given a supplemental jury instruction on transferred intent after the jury, during deliberations, asked, \u201cWe are confused on the term \u2018intent.\u2019 Does it mean to kill a person or the specific person. Can you please clarify? Thank you.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>We have stated that, \u201cTrial judges walk a fine line when answering questions posed by jurors during the course of their deliberations. Any answer given must accurately state the law and be responsive to jurors\u2019 questions without invading the province of the jury to decide the case.\u201d <em>Appraicio v. State, </em>431 Md. 42, 44, 63 A.3d 599, 600 (2013). We have also acknowledged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cThe main purpose of a jury instruction is to aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-325(a) states that \u201c[t]he court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing arguments and may supplement them at a later time when appropriate.\u201d Upon a party\u2019s request, the court shall \u201cinstruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding.\u201d Supplemental instructions can include an instruction given in response to a jury question. When the jury asks such a question, \u201ccourts must respond with a clarifying instruction when presented with a question involving an issue central to the case.\u201d Trial courts must avoid giving answers that are \u201cambiguous, misleading, or confusing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 51, 63 A.3d at 604 (internal citations omitted). \u201c[W]hether to give supplemental instructions is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal, absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sidbury v. State, </em>414 Md. 180, 186, 994 A.2d 948, 951 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Our jurisprudence references various considerations to guide a judge with respect to giving jury instructions. We have opined that the jury instruction initially must be a correct statement of the law and be applicable under the facts of the case. In <em>Brogden v. State, </em>384 Md. 631, 866 A.2d 129 (2005), for example, Brogden was charged with carrying or transporting a handgun, among other crimes to which he presented no defense at the close of the State\u2019s case. The jury sent a note during its deliberations asking whether it was a crime to have a handgun and if the State had the burden of proving that the defendant did not have a license to carry the gun. Over Brogden\u2019s objection, the trial judge gave a supplemental instruction, which in part stated that, \u201c \u2018It\u2019s the burden of the Defendant to prove the existence of the license, if one exists, not the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 866 A.2d at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We reversed, reasoning that the supplemental instruction \u201cdid not state the \u2018applicable law as to the issues relating to the handgun charge then properly before the jury for deliberation. At the point the supplemental instruction was given, the entire burden of proving the commission of that particular crime rested with the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644, 866 A.2d at 136. Thus, to instruct the jury that Brogden had the burden of proving the existence of a license, when he did not raise that affirmative defense, \u201cwas to impose a burden on petitioner that he never had.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Clark Bros. Co. v. United Rys. &amp; Elec. Co. of Baltimore City, </em>137 Md. 159, 165, 111 A. 829, 832 (1920) (An instruction given by the court in response to the jury\u2019s request \u201cwas limited to the question propounded by the jury, stated the law correctly on this point, and in no way magnified the importance of that question or detracted from the importance of other questions involved in the case. It was clearly within the province of the trial court to instruct the jury as to the law, and we find no error in either the form or substance of the instruction objected to.\u201d); <em>Higginbotham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 145, 157, 655 A.2d 1282, 1287 (1995), overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Allen, </em>387 Md. 389, 400, 875 A.2d 724, 730 (2005) (a supplemental instruction cannot be given where it is not supported by the evidence and \u201conce the court chose to give supplemental instructions, it was required to state the law correctly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">A trial judge also must respond to a question from a deliberating jury in a way that clarifies its confusion, such that the judge\u2019s response is not ambiguous or misleading. For example, in <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 685, 414 A.2d 1266, 1271 (1980), Battle was charged with first degree rape and assault with intent to rape, among other violations. After a period of deliberation, the jury sent a question to the judge, which read, \u201cWhen a possible consensual sexual relationship becomes non-consensual for some reason, during the course of the action \u2014 can the act then be considered rape?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 414 A.2d at 1268. The judge replied, \u201cI will answer your question by saying, \u2018Yes, that it is possible for a situation to start out as consensual and then become a non-consensual one in the course of the event.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We determined that, \u201cthe combination of the ambiguous question, ambiguously clarified by the trial judge, and the answer create sufficient confusion in this case to warrant reversal and a remand for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, 414 A.2d at 1271; <em>see also Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 41, 139 A.2d 209, 217 (1958), quoting <em>Wintrobe v. Hart, </em>178 Md. 289, 296, 13 A.2d 365, 368 (1940) (\u201c[(Instructions which are ambiguous, misleading or confusing to jurors can never be classed as non-injurious.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We reiterated this notion in <em>State v. Baby, </em>404 Md. 220, 262, 946 A.2d 463, 488 (2008). Baby had been charged with first degree rape and the trial judge had originally instructed the jurors that, \u201cRape is unlawful vaginal intercourse with a female by force or threat of force and without her consent,\u201d and also supplied the jury with descriptions of \u201cvaginal intercourse,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cconsent,\u201d which were taken from the pattern jury instructions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deliberating jury asked ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>tions involving whether first degree rape could occur if the victim had originally consented to intercourse but later changed her mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Faced with the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a supplemental instruction, we reversed Baby\u2019s conviction, stating that the trial judge failed to \u201caddress either of the jury\u2019s questions as the definition makes no reference to the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent which was central to the jury\u2019s questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263-64, 946 A.2d at 489. We concluded that, \u201ca trial court must respond to a question from a deliberating jury in a way that clarifies the confusion evidenced by the query when the question involves an issue central to the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 946 A.2d at 488 citing <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 657-60, 702 A.2d 261, 278-79 (1997) (holding that a trial court has a duty to instruct \u201cin response to a jury\u2019s question concerning a matter that the jury is required to consider.\u201d); <em>see also Perez v. State, </em>201 Md.App. 276, 284, 29 A.3d 656, 661 (2011) (\u201cthe court was required to provide a supplemental instruction to resolve the jury\u2019s confusion\u201d where \u201cthe issue ... was central to the jury\u2019s decision in this case, and its definition was not fairly covered by any of the other jury instructions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">A trial judge, moreover, should avoid answering questions in a way that improperly comments on the evidence and invades the province of the jury to decide the case. <em>Apprai</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>cio, </em>431 Md. at 53, 63 A.3d at 605. Appraicio was charged with assault and, during deliberations, the jury sent a note asking, \u201cCan we consider the fact that there was no police report in evidence or no police testimony or to what extent can we consider the lack of above.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 63 A.3d at 603. The trial judge responded that the jury was to decide the case \u201cbased on what is in evidence\u201d and \u201c[i]n considering the evidence which is solely the province of the jury, consider it in light of your own commonsense and your experiences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 63 A.3d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Before us, Appraicio argued that the trial judge should have instructed the jury \u201cthat a reasonable doubt can arise from the evidence or the lack thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 63 A.3d at 605. We determined that the trial court \u201cwas right to be cautious concerning its response to the jury\u2019s question because too much commentary on the evidence can cross the line into being inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 63 A.3d at 605. We reasoned that when the jury\u2019s question seeks guidance on how to find the facts, the judge\u2019s response must not \u201cinvade the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 214, 522 A.2d 1338, 1343 (1987) (\u201cThe sufficiency in fact of the evidence was in the hands of the jury when the trial judge below instructed the jury that there was sufficient evidence as a matter of law to convict Gore. As such, we believe the instruction was an indirect comment on the general weight of the evidence as to each count and outside the permissible scope of comment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We also have determined that a trial judge\u2019s supplemental instruction must not be prejudicial to the accused via \u201cthe juxtaposition of the supplemental instruction <em>vis a vis </em>defense closing arguments.\u201d <em>Cruz v. State, </em>407 Md. 202, 212, 963 A.2d 1184, 1190 (2009). Cruz had been charged with second degree assault on Hayder Meza and Oscar Martinez, but there was conflicting testimony regarding whether Cruz had actually hit Mr. Meza or if Mr. Meza had been injured when he fell. The trial court, recognizing that second degree assault had various flavors, inquired of the State as to its theory to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>State responded was battery, whereupon the judge gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">Now, in this case the defendant is charged with the crime of second degree assault on Heder Meza Herrera and, or Oscar Martinez. Assault is causing offensive physical contact to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">In order to convict the defendant of assault the State must prove: one, that the defendant caused offensive physical contact with, and, or physical harm to Heder Meza Herrera and, or Oscar Martinez. Two, that the contact was the result of an intentional or reckless act of the defendant and was not accidental. And, three, that the contact was not consented to by Heder Meza Herrera and/or Oscar Martinez.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 207, 968 A.2d at 1187. During his closing argument, Cruz\u2019s counsel conceded that Cruz \u201cwent after\u201d Meza but argued Cruz did not strike him with the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">During deliberations, however, the jury asked, \u201c[I]s Y falling on a sidewalk &amp; hitting head while being chased by a bat by X, an assault by X on Y?\u201d, which precipitated a supplemental instruction, over Cruz\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection, that discussed the elements of attempted battery. <em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 963 A.2d at 1187-88. Cruz contended before us that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on a new theory of culpability after closing arguments were completed. We agreed and reversed Cruz\u2019s conviction, concluding that, \u201cThe court\u2019s supplemental attempted battery instruction, though generated by the evidence, was not appropriate under Md. Rule 4-325 because it was given after closing arguments and thereby deprived Cruz of an adequate opportunity to defend against the new theory of culpability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 963 A.2d at 1196. We reasoned that defense counsel \u201ctailored her argument to address the battery theory of assault the State elected to pursue\u201d and that, \u201cIn stating that Cruz \u2018went after\u2019 the victim, defense counsel essentially conceded the defendant\u2019s intent to make contact and walked into an attempted battery verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 963 A.2d at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>We stated that <em>\u201cBaby </em>and <em>Brogden </em>address whether a supplemental instruction is appropriate in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial\u201d and recognized that our prior decisions had not confronted the issue of \u201cwhether the juxtaposition of the supplemental instruction <em>vis a vis </em>defense closing arguments was prejudicial\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 212, 963 A.2d at 1190. We relied upon cases from the federal circuits and our sister states to support our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>United States v. Gaskins, </em>849 F.2d 454, 458 (9th Cir. 1988), one of the cases cited in <em>Cruz, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered whether a district court\u2019s supplemental instruction to the jury on aiding and abetting was prejudicial. Gaskin was charged with possessing and manufacturing methamphetamine, but claimed that his brother-in-law was using his property to make methamphetamine and he had merely \u201ckept his eyes closed when he shouldn\u2019t have\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 456. Although the Government requested an instruction on aiding and abetting, the trial judge did not give one. <em>Id. </em>During deliberations, however, the jury sent a note to the court asking \u201cWhat level of involvement constitutes manufacturing?\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">Is it possible to have a clarification of the word \u201cmanufacturing\u201d? Would we be correct [to assume] under the law that a person allowing or providing a physical space for a product to be produced, and/or being aware of what the product is and/or having agreed to accept a payment of any nature constitute being a party to the manufacturing? What level of involvement constitutes manufacturing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\"><em>Id. </em>In response, the trial judge then instructed the jury on aiding and abetting. Gaskin objected to the instruction and requested leave to reopen closing argument to argue the facts regarding the aiding and abetting charge, but the judge denied his request. <em>Id. </em>at 456-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and concluded that, \u201cinstructing the jury that it could convict Gaskin as an aider or abettor without allowing additional argument to address this theory require[d] reversal\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 460. The court determined that, under Rule 30,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it was error to give the instruction after informing counsel that no such instruction would be given and that, \u201c[f]ailure to comply with Rule 30 is reversible error, however, \u2018only if counsel\u2019s closing argument was prejudicially affected thereby.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458. The court stated that, \u201ca district court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 30 prejudices a party if the party was unfairly prevented from arguing his or her defense to the jury or was substantially misled in formulating and presenting arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further opined that, \u201cthe district judge\u2019s decision to give the aiding and abetting instruction during jury deliberations, after initially stating at the Rule 30 hearing that he would not, unfairly prevented Gaskin\u2019s counsel from arguing against an aiding and abetting theory to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460. The court reasoned Gaskin suffered prejudice because his counsel was not given an opportunity to address whether Gaskin could have been convicted as an aider or abettor. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hannah, </em>97 F.3d 1267 (9th Cir.1996) (defendant was not prejudiced by supplemental instruction on aiding and abetting in response to a question from the jury when the court properly permitted supplemental closing arguments on that theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In <em>United States v. Horton, </em>921 F.2d 540, 541 (4th Cir.1990), the district court judge had instructed the jury on aiding and abetting in response to an inquiry. Horton was indicted for murder along with two others, but Horton was the only one tried. <em>Id. </em>at 542. At trial, Horton objected to the submission of an aiding and abetting instruction, and the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>agreed to withdraw it. The trial judge, however, instructed regarding aiding and abetting after the jury asked, \u201cIf you were not the one to plan the murder, can you be convicted of first-degree murder?\u201d and \u201cIf you are not the only one to premeditate the murder, can you be convicted of first-degree murder?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543. Ultimately, after the trial judge gave a supplemental instruction to the jury, the judge permitted additional closing argument. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">On appeal, Horton argued that \u201cthe aiding and abetting instruction should not have been given because the Government\u2019s theory of the case had always been that Horton was the principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544. Horton viewed the Government\u2019s tactical decision to try the case in this manner as preventing it \u201cfrom requesting an aiding and abetting instruction, even if there was sufficient evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>relying on <em>United States v. Williams, </em>604 F.2d 277 (4th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, while acknowledging that the Government was not entitled to an aiding and abetting instruction, recognized that the judge was not precluded from giving the instruction as long as evidentiary support existed. <em>Id. </em>The court also reasoned that \u201cwhere a new theory is presented to the jury in a supplemental instruction after closing argument, the court generally should give counsel time for additional argument. Adequate additional argument can cure any prejudice experienced as a result of supplemental instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547 (internal citations omitted). The court stated that, \u201cThough three minutes would have been utterly inadequate to develop an additional argument made necessary under a supplemental instruction, we are unable to discern either from defendant\u2019s actual supplemental argument or from his brief what new line of argument to the jury he really wished to pursue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, there was no prejudice where Horton\u2019s \u201carguments would have been the same, whether one or both theories had been charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">State cases also relied upon in <em>Cruz </em>included <em>People v. Millsap, </em>189 Ill.2d 155, 244 Ill.Dec. 54, 724 N.E.2d 942 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In <em>Millsap </em>the Supreme Court of Illinois held that a supplemental instruction on liability for aiding and abetting was inappropriate when it had introduced an entirely new theory of the case. Millsap was charged with robbery and home invasion. The State did not pursue an accomplice liability theory, nor did it request that the jury be instructed on accomplice liability. <em>Id. </em>244 Ill.Dec. 54, 724 N.E.2d at 945. The jury sent the judge a note during deliberations asking, \u201c \u2018[i]s the accomplice just as guilty [as] the offender who causes an injury in a home invasion?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Over objection, the trial court gave the instruction on accomplice liability without affording any reargument reasoning that the evidence supported it. <em>Id. </em>The jury found Millsap guilty of both robbery and home invasion. Millsap appealed, arguing the court erred giving a supplemental instruction on aiding and abetting. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Supreme Court of Illinois reversed, relying on <em>Gaskins, </em>and stated that, \u201cBecause the court in this case instructed the jury on accountability after the jury had begun its deliberations, defendant\u2019s attorney was entirely deprived of an opportunity to defend against that theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>244 Ill.Dec. 54, 724 N.E.2d at 947; <em>see also State v. Ransom, </em>56 Wash.App. 712, 785 P.2d 469, 470 (1990) (instructing the jury on accomplice liability in response to a question from the jury was reversible error because \u201c[a]ecomplice liability is a distinct theory of criminal culpability\u201d and \u201c[t]he effect was to add a theory that the State had not elected and that defense counsel had no chance to argue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In <em>People v. Clark, </em>453 Mich. 572, 556 N.W.2d 820 (1996), another case relied upon in <em>Cruz, </em>Clark was charged with involuntary manslaughter after her child died from dehydration. Before closing arguments, the parties agreed to an instruction regarding gross negligence that required the jury to find that Clark failed to use ordinary care such that \u201c \u2018it must have been apparent that the result was likely to be serious injury\u2019 \u201d in order to convict. <em>Id. </em>at 822. After the State closed, Clark\u2019s counsel asked the court to modify the instruction by substituting \u201ccause death\u201d for \u201ccause serious injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822. The trial court agreed and defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>counsel proceeded to argue in closing that Clark \u201cwas a concerned parent doing her best in a difficult situation, and that it could not possibly have been apparent to her that her actions would result in [the child\u2019s] death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 823. Before instructing the jury, however, the trial judge indicated that he had changed his mind about the modification, because it would have imposed a higher burden on the State than the law required. When the judge offered Clark an opportunity to reopen closing argument, her counsel declined because reargument \u201cwould only accentuate issues that should not be accentuated and create credibility problems with the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The Supreme Court of Michigan vacated the conviction and ordered a new trial, because Clark\u2019s counsel \u201crelied on and conformed his closing argument\u201d to the requested instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 827. The court determined that prejudice occurs \u201cwhen the change in the instructions is substantial, when the judge\u2019s instructions repudiate counsel\u2019s argument, or when the judge\u2019s instructions impair the effectiveness of the attorney\u2019s argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828, quoting <em>United States v. White, </em>27 F.3d 1531, 1538 (11th Cir.1994). The court reasoned that, \u201cDefense counsel tailored his closing argument to be consistent with the theory that the defendant could not possibly have known that withholding water from the child would lead to his death\u201d and concluded that, \u201cUnder the higher standard argued by defense counsel, the defendant might have been acquitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827. The court also determined that reargument would not have cured the prejudice because it \u201cwould have accentuated the issue and impaired defense counsel\u2019s credibility with the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The takeaways from <em>Cruz </em>and the cases upon which it relied are that a supplemental instruction should not be given if the accused \u201cwas unfairly prevented from arguing his or her defense to the jury or was substantially misled in formulating and presenting arguments.\u201d <em>Gaskins, </em>849 F.2d at 458. Factors considered in determining prejudice include: \u201cwhen the change in the instructions is substantial, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>judge\u2019s instructions repudiate counsel\u2019s argument, or when the judge\u2019s instructions impair the effectiveness of the attorney\u2019s argument.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>556 N.W.2d at 828; <em>see also United States v. White, </em>27 F.3d 1531, 1538 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The issue of transferred intent in the instant case arose after testimony was adduced that Bircher shot Gary Hale and David Garrett; Mr. Hale was hit once in the arm and survived, while Mr. Garret was struck eight times, in the head behind his right ear, his right shoulder, the right side of his back, his right hip, his right lower leg and left lower leg. There was no dispute that Bircher was the shooter. In closing, Bircher\u2019s counsel argued that Bircher did not intend to shoot Mr. Garrett; that Bircher acted in self-defense, and that Bircher did not intend to hit anyone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Mr. David Garrett is truly, truly an innocent victim. Mr. Hale, we will talk about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u2756 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">And if Mr. Bircher acted in legitimate complete self-defense, then he is not guilty entirely. If he acted under Mistake of Fact, a fact that he believed, that these folks were coming at him, with the intent to harm him, which if true would have justified it, then he is not guilty of everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">That gun has taken on a life of its own. And I say that not to distance Mr. Bircher from the responsibility of pulling the trigger. That is his responsibility. But to let us remember that his intent to fire is not the same as saying his intent to have the shots go where they ended up. And understanding how that can happen without him intending it to happen in the hands of a drunk, scared, inexperienced shooter is important to understand because these crimes are Specific Intent Crimes for the most part. Which means you got to find that he intended to commit these crimes. That he intended to hit Gary Hale. That he intended to kill David Garrett.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>In response, the State asserted that Bircher was trying to kill everyone in the area: \u201cFrom the State\u2019s theory and the State\u2019s belief and the evidence, he was trying to kill everybody out there. You empty a clip into a crowd of people, you are trying to kill everybody in that kill zone and that is exactly what the Defendant did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">During jury deliberations, the court received a note stating that, \u201cWe are confused on the term \u2018intent.\u2019 Does it mean to kill a person or the specific person. Can you please clarify? Thank you.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State asserted that giving an additional instruction on transferred intent would be a proper response to the jury\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">[Although there is only a specific charge in regards to David Garrett, that does not necessarily mean the State cannot argue the intent was to kill all individuals. So the State believes that the \u2014 in regards to the question, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>refers to transfer intent, and although the State did not initially request a transferred intent Jury Instruction the State believes that the information was presented to the jury where it actually \u2014 encapsulates transferred intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Defense counsel conversely argued that giving a transferred intent instruction would prejudice his previous argument that Bircher had no intent to shoot Mr. Garrett:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">[M]y argument of \u2014 in part was \u2014 that there was no evidence in this case to support any reason as to why the Defendant would attempt to kill David Garrett.... And so that factor was argued to support the fact that the Defendant did not have an intent to kill. Did not have an intent to kill anybody and specifically did not have an intent to kill David Garrett. Had we known that that theory was going to be in the case we would not have put the emphasis on the lack of intent to kill David Garrett as a fact that was \u2014 the lack of motive or reason to kill David Garrett in the same way that we did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The trial judge took a brief recess to review <em>Cruz </em>and determined that a supplemental instruction on transferred intent was proper since it was fairly generated from the evidence and not prejudicial to Bircher. The trial judge also recognized that, \u201cthere is case law that supports the position of offering additional closing time\u201d and that \u201cthe Court is prepared to give that if the parties want it.\u201d The State believed it had already \u201cput the argument forward that supports a transfer of intent\u201d and declined to give additional closing arguments. Bircher\u2019s counsel decided to give additional closing arguments but asked for a day to prepare, which the judge allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">After recessing for a day, the court gave the jury an instruction on transferred intent that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">Pending before the Court was Jury Instruction \u2014 Jury Exhibit No. 1, which is, \u201cWe are confused on the term intent. Does it mean to kill a person or the specific person. Can you please clarify. Thank you\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The Court is going to give you a Supplemental Instruction on this issue but you are not to consider it in a vacuum, you are to consider it with the rest of the Instructions including the Instruction that I previously gave you, concerning intent. And the Instruction is as follows, the Supplemental Instruction. Defendant is charged with murder, with the murder of David Garrett. One element of this offense is the requirement of intent. Based on the Doctrine of Transferred Intent, intent is present if a person attempted to kill one person and as a result of that act accidentally or mistakenly killed another person, such as a bystander or a third person. Under the Doctrine of Transferred Intent the intent is transferred from the intended victim to the unattended victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">If after a full and fair consideration of all of the facts and circumstances in evidence, if the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant attempted to kill another person and as a result of that act instead accidentally or mistakenly killed David Garrett the Defendant is deemed to have intended to kill David Garrett.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Bircher\u2019s counsel then gave additional closing argument in which he stated that, \u201cto the same extent that [Bircher] did not intend to kill Mr. Garrett, he did not intend to kill anybody. If the bullets ended up on Mr. Garrett they were unintended there and that is further emphasis for the position that we have taken that his \u2014 he was not aiming to kill.\u201d The jury, nevertheless, thereafter convicted Bircher of the charges of first degree murder of Mr. Garrett and attempted first degree murder of Mr. Hale.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">We have defined the doctrine of transferred intent as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">[I]f one intends injury to the person of another under circumstances in which such a mental element constitutes <em>mens rea, </em>and in the effort to accomplish this end he inflicts harm upon a person other than the one intended, he is guilty of the same kind of crime as if his aim had been more accurate. In such cases all the components of the crime are present. The psychical element which consists of a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>general mental pattern is not varied by the particular person who may be actually harmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Henry v. State, </em>419 Md. 588, 594, 19 A.3d 944, 947 (2011), quoting <em>Gladden v. State, </em>273 Md. 383, 404, 330 A.2d 176, 188 (1974). In explaining the doctrine of transferred intent we have found helpful Clark and Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes, \u00a7 10.06 (6th ed., 1958), which offered the following illustration of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">Whenever an accountable man kills another intentionally, he is guilty of murder with express malice unless the killing is justifiable or excusable, or unless there are such circumstances of provocation as will reduce the homicide to manslaughter. This principle is applied when a man kills one person when he intended to kill another. For example, if a man shoots at one person with intent to kill him, and unintentionally kills another, or sets poison for one person and another drinks it and dies, it is murder with express malice of the person killed, though he is a friend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\"><em>Harrison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 499-500, 855 A.2d 1220, 1233 (2004), quoting <em>Gladden, </em>273 Md. at 392, 330 A.2d at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Bircher initially argues before us that the supplemental instruction on transferred intent given in the instant case was not generated by the evidence. He also asserts that the supplemental instruction introduced an entirely new theory of the case that was prejudicial to him, because \u201c[cjounsel focused exclusively on disproving the specific intent element of the murder charges, and the court\u2019s supplemental instruction essentially repudiated the heart of [his] argument.\u201d Essentially, Bircher argues that his \u201clack of specific intent to kill David Garrett was the lynchpin of his defense\u201d and the supplemental instruction undermined this argument by introducing a new theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">With respect to whether the evidence generated the transferred intent instruction, the testimony adduced at trial reflected that Bircher, on the evening of the shooting, drove around, after having imbibed and having had an argument with his girlfriend at her parents\u2019 home in Sykesville, Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>land. While driving, Bircher spotted Cheers Bar and Lounge in Eldersburg, Carroll County. During the course of the evening, Bircher drank beer and spoke to patrons, soliciting cigarettes from a number of persons inside and outside the Bar including Kristen Remmers with whom he also sauntered toward his car in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The testimony also reflected that Ms. Remmers had arrived at the Bar with Gary Hale, who, when he saw Bircher and Ms. Remmers together, yelled out, \u201chey, you better stay away from him,\u201d because he did not recognize Bircher. Later on in the evening, Ms. Remmers returned to Mr. Hale\u2019s side, whereupon Mr. Hale said loud enough for Bircher to hear, \u201cYour little boyfriend is about to get his ass beat.\u201d Bircher did attempt to leave, but realized that he had left his debit card at the Bar. Afraid for his life, Bircher secured a semiautomatic Glock 23 pistol from his car and began to return to the Bar at which time he spotted Mr. Hale approaching him. Bircher fired a thirteen round magazine in a matter of seconds, hitting Mr. Hale once in the arm and David Garrett eight times. Mr. Garrett had been standing next to Mr. Hale when the shots were fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The evidence, thus, reflected that Bircher could have heard Mr. Hale and his threats and been afraid. The evidence also suggested that when Bircher returned to the bar to get his debit card, he may have intended to protect himself by shooting Hale, while the bullets killed David Garrett, the person standing next to Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In determining that the evidence generated a transferred intent instruction, we utilize an abuse of discretion standard, rather than a sufficiency analysis apparently applied by the Court of Special Appeals when they concluded that transferred intent \u201chad no place at Mr. Bircher\u2019s trial to begin with.\u201d <em>Bircher v. State, 221 </em>Md.App. 376, 390, 109 A.3d 153, 162 (2015). Utilizing an abuse of discretion standard, on the other hand, yields the conclusion that the evidence supports the transferred intent instruction given.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>With respect to whether the supplemental instruction prejudiced Bircher, moreover, we come to a different conclusion than that which we came to in <em>Cruz. </em>In the present case, unlike in <em>Cruz, </em>Bircher\u2019s counsel did not concede that Bircher intended to shoot Mr. Hale but not Mr. Garrett, an argument that would have \u201cwalked into\u201d the transferred intent issue. To the contrary, Bircher\u2019s counsel repeatedly emphasized that Bircher did not intend to shoot anyone, did not intend to shoot Mr. Garrett specifically and acted in self-defense. None of these arguments prejudiced Bircher with regard to the giving of a transferred intent instruction because Bircher, according to his counsel, \u201cDid not have an intent to kill anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Like <em>Horton, </em>921 F.2d at 547, guilt of either a direct intent to kill Mr. Garrett and of transferred intent are \u201cso similar that the arguments to be made against guilt are essentially the same under both theories.\u201d Essentially, under either theory, Bircher\u2019s argument was that he did not intend to shoot anyone, did not intend to shoot Mr. Garrett specifically and that he acted in self-defense. Bircher\u2019s counsel reiterated during his supplemental closing the same message: \u201cIf the bullets ended up on Mr. Garrett they were unintended there and that is further emphasis for the position that we have taken that his \u2014 he was not aiming to kill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In addition to the lack of any concession regarding transferred intent, Bircher\u2019s counsel was given adequate time to prepare additional closing remarks, unlike what occurred in the reversal of convictions in <em>Cruz, Gaskins, Millsap </em>and <em>Ransom. </em>A day to prepare and then give additional closing remarks exceed that which was given in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Bircher, however though, relies on two cases from Texas for the proposition that \u201cunder certain circumstances additional argument does not cure the resulting prejudice.\u201d In <em>Moore v. State, </em>848 S.W.2d 920 (Tex.App.1993), Moore was charged with delivering cocaine; during closing arguments his counsel asserted that Moore should be acquitted because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>personally commit the crime and that the \u201ccharge\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not authorize his conviction for the conduct of another. <em>Id. </em>at 921. After defense counsel\u2019s argument, the State requested the charge \u201cbe amended by adding a parties instruction\u201d and the judge gave an instruction on accomplice liability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Texas intermediate appellate court reversed Moore\u2019s conviction stating that, \u201cTexas law provides, \u2018After the argument begins no further charge shall be given to the jury unless required by the improper argument of counsel or the request of the jury, or unless the judge shall, in his discretion, permit the introduction of other testimony....\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 921. Thus, the supplemental instruction was error where, \u201c[t]here was no improper defense argument, no request of the jury, and no additional testimony after evidence closed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>cause the error statutorily was not sufficient to mandate reversal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cunless the error was calculated to injure the defendant\u2019s rights or it appears there was not a fair trial,\u201d the court then determined that there had not been a fair trial, because \u201c[djefense counsel had the right to rely on the original charge\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Defense counsel had the right to rely on the original charge, which lacked any instruction on parties, and he did so. He told the jury it could not convict appellant for the acts of another, but could only convict if it found appellant personally made an actual or constructive transfer. Counsel made a legitimate argument that was based entirely on the trial judge\u2019s written instructions, and it is one the jury may have found persuasive if it followed those instructions, as it was bound by oath to do. Based on the jury charge as it stood when defense counsel argued, the evidence was not overwhelming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 922-23. Texas\u2019s statutes clearly differ from our prevailing norm and Moore\u2019s counsel clearly argued the converse of the supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In <em>Murray v. State, </em>857 S.W.2d 806, 807 (Tex.App.1993), the other case cited by Bircher, Murray was charged with robbery and the charge submitted to the jury stated that, \u201cA person commits robbery if in the course of committing theft and with intent to obtain or maintain control of the property, he intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to another.\u201d Murray had stolen goods from a department store, dropped the goods when chased by security guards and then fought with a guard after being tackled in the ensuing chase. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Murray\u2019s counsel argued in closing that the injury incurred was not \u201cin the course of committing theft\u201d because Murray had dropped the stolen goods and fled before the fight occurred. <em>Id. </em>After closing arguments, the trial judge gave a supplemental instruction stating that, \u201c \u2018In the course of committing theft\u2019 means conduct that occurs in an attempt to commit, during the commission, or in immediate flight after the attempt or commission of theft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Texas intermediate appellate court reversed and concluded that, \u201cthe court\u2019s repudiation of the very argument it allowed caused the trial to lose its character as an adversary proceeding, greatly jeopardizing Murray\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 811. The court remarked that the case was similar to <em>Moore </em>which \u201calso recognized that this type of action is tantamount to denying counsel the opportunity to make closing argument and denies the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Murray </em>case, like <em>Moore, </em>is clearly inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In conclusion, the judge did not abuse his discretion in giving the supplemental instruction on transferred intent in the instant case because the evidence generated the instruction and the instruction did not prejudice Bircher.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

I agree with the Majority that the supplemental jury instruction was generated by the evidence, but I respectfully part company with my colleagues on the issue of whether the instruction was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>By its very nature, a supplemental jury <em>instruction </em>\u2014 i.e., a jury instruction given after deliberations have begun \u2014 has a special potential for prejudice. It is given after the defendant has already decided whether and how to put on a defense and given a closing argument, and after the jury has been given the initial jury instructions based on the evidence in the case. In other words, by the time that a supplemental jury instruction is given, the defendant has already adopted one theory of the case, and it is too late to change course and adopt a different one.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">For multiple reasons, a jury is highly likely to place great focus on a supplemental jury instruction given after deliberations have begun. First, it is almost always given in response to a question by a jury. Second, it is given after the initial jury instructions, and, thus, is given outside the context of all of the jury instructions as a whole. And third, although the parties may have the opportunity to present additional argument in light of the supplemental jury instruction, there is no opportunity for the presentation of additional evidence to address any questions or inferences suggested by the supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Given the high stakes, the attorneys involved, generally, thoroughly discuss with the trial court whether, as in this case, it is warranted to give a supplemental jury instruction \u2014 even one that simply clarifies the initial jury instructions \u2014 and, if it is warranted, how the supplemental jury instruction should be phrased.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Here, rather than agreeing to the supplemental jury instruction, counsel for Jacob Bircher (\u201cBircher\u201d), Respondent, objected to the instruction and informed the circuit court he would have handled the defense otherwise had he known of the supplemental jury instruction. In this Court, Bircher does not contend that the supplemental jury instruction was an incorrect statement of the law or that it was not generated by the evidence. And, I agree with the Majority that the supplemental jury instruction was generated by the evidence. If we were reviewing an initial jury instruction, our inquiry would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>end there. <em>See Derr v. State, </em>484 Md. 88, 133, 73 A.3d 254, 281 (2013) (\u201cA trial court must give a requested jury instruction where[:] (1) the instruction is a correct statement of [the] law; (2) the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in instructions actually given.... [I]f, taken as a whole, [jury instructions] correctly state the law, are not misleading, and cover adequately the issues raised by the evidence, [then] the defendant has not been prejudiced[,] and reversal is inappropriate.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">For good reason, supplemental jury instructions, however, are held to a higher standard than initial ones are. In other words, an appellate court may conclude that giving a supplemental jury instruction was an abuse of discretion even though the supplemental jury instruction was a correct statement of law, was generated by the evidence, and was not fairly covered by the initial jury instructions. An appellate court may conclude as much where the supplemental jury instruction prejudices the defendant. See <em>Cruz v. State, </em>407 Md. 202, 204, 963 A.2d 1184, 1186 (2009) (\u201cThe [trial] court\u2019s supplemental instruction, though generated by the evidence, was not appropriate under Maryland Rule 4-325 [ (Instructions to the Jury) ] because defense counsel\u2019s reliance on the [trial] court\u2019s pre-closing argument instructions resulted in prejudice to [the defendant].\u201d). This is because a supplemental jury instruction has a special and high potential for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The <em>Cruz </em>case offers an clear example of such prejudice. In <em>Cruz, id. </em>at 220, 963 A.2d at 1195, this Court held that a trial \u201ccourt abused its discretion in giving the jury a supplemental instruction on attempted battery during the jury\u2019s deliberations, because the [trial] court at the close of evidence indicated that it would only instruct the jury on battery, the sole theory of second degree assault elected by the State.\u201d At trial, a State\u2019s witness testified that the defendant hit the victim with a baseball bat, whereas a defense witness testified that the defendant used the bat to chase away the victim, who fell down while running away. <em>See id. </em>at 205-06, 963 A.2d at 1186. At the prosecutor\u2019s request, the trial court initially</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>instructed the jury only on battery. <em>See id. </em>at 206-07, 968 A.2d at 1187. During the defendant\u2019s closing argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cstrategically conceded in closing that he \u2018went after\u2019 [the victim] with the bat, thinking that attempted battery was off the table.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 963 A.2d at 1188. While deliberating, the jury submitted the following note: \u201c \u2018[I]s Y falling on a sidewalk &amp; hitting head while being chased by a bat by X, an assault by X on Y?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 963 A.2d at 1187 (brackets in original). Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court instructed the jury on attempted battery. <em>See id. </em>at 207-08, 963 A.2d at 1187-88.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">Upon review, this Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">Although courts must respond with a clarifying instruction when presented with a question involving an issue central to the case, a supplemental instruction is not appropriate under Md. Rule 4-325 if given in response to a question that has absolutely nothing to do with the case as presented to that jury. The jury should be limited in its deliberations to the issues and evidence as presented to it and should not be given answers to inquiries which reach outside of the case as presented at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 211, 963 A.2d at 1189 (brackets, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Applying these legal principles to facts in Cruz, this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">[The defendant] relied on [the State\u2019s battery] theory in tailoring his closing argument and suffered actual prejudice from the supplemental attempted battery instruction.... It is unlikely that [the defendant\u2019s counsel would have acknowledged that [the defendant] \u201cwent after\u201d [the victim] with the bat had the State elected to pursue an attempted battery theory of assault at the close of evidence. In stating that [the defendant] \u201cwent after\u201d the victim, defense counsel essentially conceded the defendant\u2019s intent to make contact and walked into an attempted battery verdict. Had [the defendant] known that the jury would be instructed on this assault theory, his counsel would likely not have hinged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>his defense on the contact element of battery and, instead, would have emphasized that [the defendant] never intended to bring about harmful physical contact when he grabbed the bat and chased [the victim]____The court\u2019s supplemental attempted battery instruction, though generated by the evidence, was not appropriate under M[aryland] Rule 4-325 because it was given after closing arguments and thereby deprived [the defendant] of an adequate opportunity to defend against the new theory of culpability. The [trial] court, when presented with the jury\u2019s question pertaining to the new theory of culpability, should have told the jurors that they were to apply the law on which they had been instructed. At the close of evidence, the State would have been entitled to an instruction on any version of second degree assault as each theory constituted the \u201capplicable law\u201d under [Maryland] Rule 4-325. But once the State locked into the battery theory of assault, and declined an instruction on the other theories, [the defendant] had a right to rely on the State\u2019s elected theory of culpability and tailor his closing argument accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 220-22, 963 A.2d at 1195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Notably, we rejected the State\u2019s contention that the jury instruction on attempted battery entitled the defendant only to additional argument, which the defendant did not request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgdM\">We are not persuaded that a supplemental closing argument would have cured the problem created by the court\u2019s eleventh hour insertion of this new theory of culpability. Even in a supplemental closing argument, defense counsel could not eradicate her earlier concession that [the defendant] \u201cwent after\u201d [the victim] with bat in hand. With these two words, counsel conceded and emphasized the first two of three elements of attempted battery, an offense counsel thought had been withdrawn from consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 216, 963 A.2d at 1192 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Here, reversal is warranted because, as the defendant in <em>Cruz </em>did, Bircher made prejudicial concessions that he might not have made had he had the benefit of knowing in advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>about the supplemental jury instruction and did not pursue available defenses because he was unaware that the supplemental jury instruction on transferred intent would be given. Specifically, Bircher testified on his own behalf that he bought a Glock .40 caliber pistol \u201cfor self[-]defense.\u201d On July 13, 2012, he left his residence and drove to Cheers Lounge. He left his pistol inside his car, entered Cheers Lounge, drank some beer, and spent some time with Kristen Remmers (\u201cRemmers\u201d). While Bircher was outside of the lounge smoking a cigarette, Gary Allen Hale, Sr. (\u201cHale\u201d) said to Remmers: \u201cYour little boyfriend is about to get his ass beat.\u201d Another person said: \u201cWell he will be lucky if that is all that he gets.\u201d Bircher decided that \u201cit [wa]s probably time to go.\u201d He returned to his car, but realized that he had left his debit card inside Cheers Lounge. As a result, he put his pistol into his pocket and walked back toward Cheers Lounge. A group of people, including Hale, were near Cheers Lounge\u2019s entrance. Hale said something, but Bircher could not hear what Hale said. Hale made \u201ca head gesture[.]\u201d All of the people in the group looked at Bircher \u201cat the same time\u201d and then began walking towards him. Bircher was afraid that he was going to get \u201cbeaten to death[.]\u201d Bircher pulled out his pistol and began \u201cfiring in between people.\u201d (Emphasis added). He intended \u201cto scare everybody away[,]\u201d not to shoot anyone. (Emphasis added). He ran out of bullets, returned to his car, and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It was undisputed that Bircher shot Hale, who survived, and David Garrett (\u201cGarrett\u201d), who died. During Bircher\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing argument, he stressed that the State had offered no reason as to why Bircher would intend to kill Garrett. In other words, Bircher\u2019s counsel argued that Bircher was not guilty of the murder of Garrett because Bircher did not intend to kill Garrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">During deliberations, the jury submitted a note that stated: \u201cWe are confused on the term \u2018intent.\u2019 Does it mean to kill a person or the specific person. Can you please clarify. Thank you.\u201d (Second underlining in original). Bircher\u2019s counsel argued that a supplemental jury instruction on transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>intent would be prejudicial because a very important part of Bircher\u2019s defense to the murder count was to demonstrate that Bircher had no intent to kill Garrett. Bircher\u2019s counsel argued that the State had failed to request an initial jury instruction on transferred intent, and that the initial jury instructions were an integral part of how he had formulated his closing argument, <em>ie., </em>limiting the argument to Bircher\u2019s lack of intent to kill Garrett. Tellingly, Bircher\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cHad we known that th[e] theory [of transferred intent] was going to be in th[is] case[,] we would not have put the emphasis on ... the lack of motive or reason to kill [ ] Garrett in the same way that we did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Over Bircher\u2019s objection, the circuit court gave the following supplemental jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Defendant is charged ... with the murder of David Garrett. One element of this offense is the requirement of intent. Based on the [d]octrine of [transferred [i]ntent, intent is present if a person attempted to kill one person[,] and[,] as a result of that act[,] accidentally or mistakenly killed another person, such as a bystander or a third person. Under the [d]octrine of [transferred [i]ntent[,] the intent is transferred from the intended victim to the un[inte]nded victim. If[,] after a full and fair consideration of all of the facts and circumstances in evidence, [] the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant attempted to kill another person[,] and[,] as a result of that act[,] instead accidentally or mistakenly killed David Garrett[,] the Defendant is deemed to have intended to kill David Garrett.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_U\">(Paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">I am not convinced that this supplemental jury instruction caused no prejudice to Bircher. Bircher would likely have made different strategic choices during the trial if he had had the benefit of knowing in advance about the supplemental jury instruction and had known it would be material to adduce evidence of his lack of intent to kill any person in the crowd\u2014 Hale or any other member of the crowd. Bircher\u2019s counsel advised the circuit court as much. Bircher testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>shot into the crowd to scare away the crowd. Although Bircher did not explicitly testify that he had the intent to kill anyone in the crowd, the jury may reasonably have inferred that by deliberately shooting into the crowd, Bircher had the intent to kill a person in the crowd, <em>ie., </em>Hale or someone else. The instruction on transferred intent permitted the jury to convict Bircher of murder on the theory that he intended to kill a person other than Garrett. Had Bircher known in advance of the supplemental jury instruction, Bircher might not have elected to testify that he fired his pistol in the direction of a group of people that included Hale and others. Bircher\u2019s counsel would not have hung the defense on the limited assertion that Bircher did not intend to kill Garrett; in doing so, Bircher\u2019s counsel\u2019s theory of the case did not address the potential finding that Bircher intended to kill Hale or someone else in the crowd, but ended up accidentally shooting Garrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The Majority concludes that the supplemental jury instruction did not prejudice Bircher because \u201cBircher\u2019s counsel did not concede that Bircher intended to shoot [ ] Hale but not [ ] Garrett[.]\u201d Maj. Op. at 478-79, 132 A.3d at 304. Although this is true, the fact remains that Bircher\u2019s counsel relied on the assertion that Bircher did not intend to kill Garrett and allowed Bircher to testify that he shot into a crowd that Hale \u2014 a person who had threatened Bircher earlier \u2014 was a part of. As such, Bircher\u2019s counsel\u2019s assertion that Bircher did not intend to kill Garrett essentially became pointless after the supplemental jury instruction, since the instruction permitted the jury to find that Bircher intended to kill Hale or anyone else in the crowd, and ended up accidentally shooting Garrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Although a group of judges may be able to determine that neither Bircher nor his counsel made an explicit concession as to his intent to kill Hale or another member of the crowd, it is less clear that a jury of lay people would necessarily have discerned the same. Indeed, after hearing the supplemental jury instruction, the jury could very well have believed that Bircher\u2019s counsel had been hiding the ball all along by focusing on Bircher\u2019s lack of intent to kill Garrett and ignoring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>circumstance that Bircher shot into a crowd of people, including Hale \u2014 that belief would have been fatal to Bircher\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In my view, the Majority\u2019s holding is worrisome because it condones a supplemental jury instruction: (1) that the State did not initially request;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) to which the defendant objected; and (3) that essentially undermined the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. Although the goal of any criminal trial is to unearth the truth, a trial \u2014 even one involving serious criminal charges such as this \u2014 must be fair for the defendant; and, in this case, the supplemental jury instruction acted as something of an unfair ambush on the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-6\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge ADKINS have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-14\">. The supplemental jury instruction could easily have been requested by the State in advance. The record reveals no logical reason for the State's failure to have requested the instruction. The concern is that, by permitting a supplemented jury instruction under these circum<em>stances- </em>\u2014 i.e., an instruction that could easily have been requested by the State but was not, and was given over the objection of the defendant, and where the potential for prejudicial was evident \u2014 -we invite similar occurrences in the future and leave it for appellate courts to parse the facts of the case to determine whether the defendant may have been prejudiced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
