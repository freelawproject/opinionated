(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">-\u201c(d) Petitioners cannot show that their taxes will be increased as a direct and immediate consequence of any of the matters complained of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u25a0\u201c(e) Petitioners, thus, have no interest as taxpayers which will allow them to maintain this suit, and accordingly, there is no justiciable controversy and the petition fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">The District Court in a brief Order granted the motions to dismiss the petitions under Rule 12(b) (6) F.R.Civ.P. for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d It did not rule with respect to the summary judgment phase of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">While the District Court did not in its Order state the reason or reasons for its determination that the petitions failed \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d, implicit in its references to cases cited in that Order is its conclusion \u2014 not stated in terms \u2014 that the appellants had failed to allege that they had sustained, or were in immediate danger of sustaining, some direct injury as the result of the carrying out of the Agreement, or that they had a real interest beyond a desire to see that the laws of the Virgin Islands are enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">The parties to these appeals have seen fit to expend their talented energies and indefatigable efforts in presenting their respective arguments with respect to what may be designated as the \u201csubstantive\u201d merits of the controversy as to whether the District Court erred in dismissing the petitions for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The arguments are academic to the issue presented by these appeals as to whether the District Court erred in dismissing the petitions in view of the fact that it was procedurally precluded from doing so under the clear and dis-positive provisions of Rule 12(b) and (c) of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Rule 12(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">\u201c* * * If, on a motion asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, <em>matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, </em>the motion <em>shall </em>be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Rule 12(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\u201c(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion <em>shall </em>be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">In the instant cases the Motions to Dismiss in paragraph 1(C) earlier set forth, were premised on what appeared \u201cin the petitions, the Act and the Agreement <em>and the affidavits attached as Exhibits 1-8\u201d, </em>which had been \u201cpresented to and not excluded by the Court\u201d, and according to the mandate of Rule 12(b) and (c), the District Court could not dismiss the petitions but was compelled to proceed under Rule 56, the summary judgment rule. Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 357 n. 4, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959); Gager v. Bob Seidel, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 135, 300 F.2d 727, 731 (1962), cert. den. 370 U.S. 959, 82 S.Ct. 1612, 8 L.Ed.2d 825; Ellis v. Carter, 291 F.2d 270, 275 (9 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Since the record made below fairly presents the issue as to whether Government and Harvey are entitled to summary judgments judicial economy will patently be served by an immediate determination of this issue rather than remanding these cases to the District Court for disposition. Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">As earlier stated, the appellants premised their petitions seeking a decree declaring the Agreement and Act 814 invalid on the grounds that it lacked \u201cadequate\u201d consideration and there was \u201cneither public need nor purpose\u201d (1) for the Government\u2019s conveyance of public lands to Harvey as site for its alumina plant and deep-water channel project; (2) reimbursement by Government of $3,000,000 of Harvey\u2019s cost in developing the channel; and (3) the Government\u2019s granting of tax exemptions and subsidies to Harvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">While neither Government nor Harvey asserted in terms in their individual motions to dismiss and for summary judgment that the Agreement and Act 814 were designed to effectuate the public purpose they, however, filed in support of their motions an affidavit of Lawrence A. Harvey, president of Harvey, certifying that the alumina project would entail an expenditure of $25,000,000; that construction had been commenced; and that $1,000,000 had been expended \u201con the design and construction of the alumina plant\u201d; and additonal affidavits that Harvey had supplied to Government the $6,-100 to acquire the Krause Lagoon acreage ; that prior to such acquisition Government had not levied any taxes against the Krause Lagoon acreage since 1936; that the revenues derived by Government from Airport Land \u201cat no time has been more than $1,760.00 per year\u201d; and that Harvey had covenanted to pay into the Airport Fund of the Virgin Islands $2,500.00 for a period of sixteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>commencing December 31, 1962 in consideration of the conveyance to it of Airport Land.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Government and Harvey also filed as an Exhibit an \u201cAddress of Governor Ralph M. Paiewonsky [of the Virgin Islands], made a part of the Legislative record of the subject Act No. 814 * * * \u201d in which he stated that salt water conversion and power plants to be constructed and operated by Harvey in connection with its project would make available for public consumption surpluses of water and power, and that the alumina development would \u201cupgrade\u201d the economy of the Virgin Islands. Further, at a hearing held by the District Court on the dismissal and summary judgment motions both Government and Harvey cited in support of the public purpose design of the Agreement and Act the declarations of such purpose contained therein, and th\u00e9 finding of the Legislature, expressed in the Act, that the Harvey development would make available \u201cpublic pier, docking and warehousing facilities\u201d which \u201cwill promote the public interest by economic development of the Virgin Islands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Prior to the hearing on the dismissal and summary judgment motions the appellants filed affidavits expressing \u201cexpert\u201d opinions that (1) 100 to 300 acres would be ample to provide a site for the alumina plant and that 1200 acres \u201cwas excessive\u201d; (2) there was no condition of unemployment in St. Croix; (3) Krause Lagoon had a great value to the Virgin Islands as a wildlife refuge, breeding ground and area for game fishing; and (4) the 500-acre Krause Lagoon (for which $6,100 had been paid) had an appraised value of from $125,000 to $350,000, and the 700-acre Airport Land an appraised value of from $625,-000 to $969,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It must immediately be noted on the score of these appraisals that appellants have not adverted to them here, either in the several briefs which they have filed or at oral argument, and have merely stated without specification, in their petitions and briefs, that there was not \u201cadequate consideration\u201d for the conveyance of the public lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Again, as earlier stated, the appellants have premised their petitions on their view that \u201cthere was neither public need nor purpose\u201d for conveying public land to Harvey, granting it tax exemptions and subsidies and reimbursement of $3,-000,000 of its cost in developing the deep-water channel and turnabout area and that accordingly, Act 814 and the Agreement which it adopted and ratified were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Appellants do not dispute that if there was \u201cpublic need or purpose\u201d in the enactment of Act 814, and the Agreement and its undertakings, they have not made out a case. They vigorously contend, however, that the record affirmatively establishes absence of \u201cpublic need or purpose\u201d, and alternatively, it at least presents genuine issues as to material facts with respect to the existence of \u201cpublic need or purpose\u201d which preclude entry of summary judgment against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Applicable to these contentions are these well-settled principles:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\"> \u201cUnder the system of government created by our Constitution, it is up to legislatures, not courts, to decide on the wisdom and utility of legislation\u201d; \u201c * * * courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws\u201d; and \u201cLegislative bodies have broad scope to experiment with economic problems\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>They may \u201clegislate so as to increase the industries of the State, develop its resources, and add to its wealth and </em>prosperity.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\"> \u201cSubject to specific constitutional limitations, when the legislature has spoken, the public interest has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>declared in terms well-nigh conclusive\u201d; further, \u201cThe role of the judiciary\u201d in determining whether the legislative power is being exercised for a public purpose \u201cis an extremely narrow one\u201d and once the public purpose has been established the means of its effectuation are for the legislative body \u2014 and it alone\u2014 to determine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Courts \u201cdo not sit as a super-legislature to weigh the wisdom of legislation\u201d, and they <em>\u201cleave debatable issues as respects business, economic, and social affairs to legislative decision.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u201cThe public welfare is a broad and inclusive concept. The moral, social, <em>economic, and physical well-being of the community </em>is one part of it; the political well-being, another.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u201cSo far as the requirement of due process is concerned, and in the absence of other constitutional restriction, a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose. The courts are without authority either to declare such policy, or, when it is declared by the legislature, to override it.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Whether legislation serves a public purpose \u201cis a practical question addressed to the law-making department, and it would require a plain case of departure from every public purpose which could reasonably be conceived to justify the intervention of a court.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Applying the principles stated we are of the opinion that the legislative record provides a rational basis for the enactment of Act 814 and that it would constitute judicial trespass on the legislative function to proceed further with this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">Courts may not serve as a forum for the debate of legislative decisions though they may be fairly debatable. It is settled law that a rational actual basis for particular legislation must be held to exist if the question of what the facts establish is a fairly debatable one. Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 594, 59 S.Ct. 744, 83 L.Ed. 1001 (1939); United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 154, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">The appellants contend that the critical issue as to whether the Act, the Agreement and its undertakings, are invalid, depends on resolution of what they term to be \u201cgenuine issues with respect to material facts\u201d, to wit: (1) were the land grants to Harvey for a public purpose and had it \u201cbeen given large tracts of land exceeding its needs\u201d; (2) were the tax exemptions and subsidies accorded Harvey, and reimbursement to it of $3,000,000 of its cost in developing the deep-water channel, justifiable as effectuating the public purpose; (3) was the deep-water channel \u201can essential public project\u201d; and (4) had the Legislature \u201chad adequate time to study the Agreement and to investigate its many ramifications ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-19\">It is immediately apparent that what the appellants identify as \u201cgenuine issues as to material facts\u201d are nothing more and nothing less than the assertion of debatable issues concerning which they entertain one view and the Legislature another, and as to which the Legislature has the last word. As we said in United States v. Kissinger, 3 Cir., 250 F.2d 940, 942 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-20\">\u201cThey [courts] do not have power to inquire into either the degree of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>necessity for * * * legislation or its wisdom or effectiveness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">It may be observed, parenthetically, on the score of the appellants\u2019 debatable issue as to whether the Legislature \u201chad adequate time to study the Agreement and to investigate its many ramifications\u201d that some six months before the Legislature enacted Act 814 on February 19, 1962, it authorized a special independent industrial development committee to study alumina plants on the Island of Jamaica, where they are a major industry; that on February 14, 1962, the Legislature, sitting as \u201cA Committee of the Whole\u201d, held a well-attended public hearing on the proposed Act and Agreement at St. Croix at which its proponents and opponents, including among the latter, counsel for the appellants, vigorously expressed their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">It might be said anent our earlier statement that the legislative record presents a rational basis for its enactment of Act 814 that we had in mind its specific findings and declarations that the $25,000,000 alumina plant and its related facilities, as well as the deep-water channel and supplementary public piers, docks and warehousing facilities would relieve the Virgin Islands of dependence on tourism; promote employment; \u201cpromote the public interest by economic development of the Virgin Islands\u201d; and provide water and power facilities whose surplus would be available for public use; further, \u201cthat the extraordinary advantages and benefits to the people of the Virgin Islands, to be directly derived from the undertakings proposed, <em>fully warrant and require the cooperation, encouragement and assistance of the Government\". </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">It may be noted in passing that the United States, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, approved the conveyance of Government\u2019s restricted title to Airport Land to Harvey, after it considered the provisions of the Agreement; further, that the \u201cDeed of Release\u201d from the United States to the Virgin Islands, dated May 16, 1962, specifically noted that such Release was to enable Government to convey the land to Harvey as site for its alumina plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court dismissing the appellants\u2019 petitions will be vacated and the causes remanded with directions to the District Court to enter summary judgments against the appellants:</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-15\">.
