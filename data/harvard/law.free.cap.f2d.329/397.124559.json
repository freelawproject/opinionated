Fraser, U. S. Atty., Savannah, Ga., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b452-11\">Before RIVES, CAMERON and BELL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">The appellant alleged in his petition in the District Court, that on his plea of guilty of unlawfully transporting firearms in interstate commerce (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902), he was sentenced on or about February 13, 1963; that he now believes that (1) he was placed in jeopardy by that Court in violation of his rights as a citizen ; (2) he was denied a just and speedy trial, fair trial, and due process of law insofar as the \u201cCourt lost jurisdiction to prosecute your petitioner.\u201d On these bare allegations, he asked that he be granted, \u201cThe records and files of all proceedings against your Petitioner, or copies thereof, in order that your Petitioner may ascertain the correctness of his beliefs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">It does not appear, and he does not allege, that any other legal proceeding is now pending relative to his said conviction, and it is obvious that the time for his direct appeal therefrom has long since expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">The District Court denied the motion for copies of records without a hearing, but granted the application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Thereupon the appellant moved this Court for appointment of counsel to represent him upon his appeal. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">As said in Ketcherside v. United States, 6 Cir. 1963, 317 F.2d 807, 808:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArG\">\u201cIn the present state of the law, neither \u00a7 753(f) nor \u00a7 1915 of Title 28 U.S.C.A., entitles a federal prisoner to obtain such a transcript at government expense for the purpose of <em>preparing </em>a case pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. Taylor v. United States, 238 F.2d 409, 411 (C.A.9, 1956) cert. denied, 353 U.S. 938, 77 S.Ct. 817, 1 L.Ed.2d 761; United States v. Stevens, 224 F.2d 866, 868-869 (C.A.3, 1955); In re Fullam, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 152 F.2d 141 (C.A.D.C., 1945); United States ex rel. McNeill v. Avis, 108 F.2d 457 (C.A.3, 1939); United States v. Lott, 171 F.Supp. 178, 179 (W.D.Ky., 1959); United States v. Hoskins, 85 F.Supp. 313, 314 (E.D.Ky, 1949); United States v. Lawler, 172 F.Supp. 602, 605-606 (S.D.Tex, 1959); Application of Pruitt, 119 F.Supp. 737 (W.D.S.C, 1954); United States v. Carter, 88 F.Supp. 88 (D.D.C, 1950); Cohen v. United States, 123 F.Supp. 717, 718 (E.D.Mich, 1954). Furthermore, neither Section 1915 nor Section 753(f) authorizes the furnishing of a transcript where there is no motion to vacate sentence pending in the District Court. Ex parte Allen, 78 F.Supp. 786, 787 (E.D.Ky., 1948).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">See also, Prince v. United States, 10 Cir. 1962, 312 F.2d 252. The statutory right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to proceed in forma pauperis does not include the right to obtain copies of court orders, indictments, and transcript of record, without payment therefor, for use in proposed or prospective litigation. Hullom v. Kent, 6 Cir. 1959, 262 F.2d 862; In re Fullam, 1945, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 152 F.2d 141. Furthermore, this appellant\u2019s motion to obtain free records and files of the proceedings was insufficient under section 1915 of Title 28 U.S.C.A., because it failed to state with any particularity or color of merit why or in what respects the judgment was allegedly illegal. Compare United States v. Glass, 4 Cir. 1963, 317 F.2d 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The appeal is frivolous and is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
