The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A91\">\u201cFor the reason that the evidence shows that the process set out in claim 28 is old, and the only difference is that it recites analogous materials which are clearly shown to have been known to the art when the application was filed, it is clear that the use of such materials in the method of Simon et al. would be obvious to one skilled in the art.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">We find no error affecting substantial rights. Compare Zenith Radio Corp. v. Ladd, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 310 F.2d 859 (1962). The judgment of the District. Court, dismissing the complaint, will accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"AQ0m\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
