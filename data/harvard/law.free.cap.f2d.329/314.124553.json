The court, quite similarly, interrogated the opposite number witness for the Government. As to undue participation by a judge in the interrogation of witnesses, \u201cThe test is not the number of questions which the trial court asks.\u201d United States v. DeFillo, 257 F.2d 835, 839 (2 Cir. 1958). The test is whether, because of such questioning, the defendant was prejudiced. United States v. Stayback, 212 F.2d 313, 320 (3 Cir. 1954). Admittedly, in the present situation, as appellant states, \u201cThe court was seeking to ferret out the truth.\u201d And the district judge in this instance was completely conscious of his proper role and the necessity of keeping within it. In that endeavor, from our own examination of the trial record, the court\u2019s questioning did not result in substantial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">We take this opportunity of cautioning our trial judges to continue exercising meticulous care to avoid unfair implications which might arise from any examination of a trial witness undertaken by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
