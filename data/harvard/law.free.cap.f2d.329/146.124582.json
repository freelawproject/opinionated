On appeal his exceptions were overruled and judgment ordered for the State. State of Maine v. Bennett, 158 Me. 109, 179 A.2d 812 (1962). In both courts Bennett was represented by counsel of unquestioned competence and diligence. In January of this year he filed application for <em>habeas corpus </em>in the United States District Court for the District of Maine with an affidavit of poverty and a request for appointment of \u201cadvisory counsel.\u201d That court granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>but denied Bennett\u2019s request for appointment of counsel and summarily denied his application for <em>habeas corpus </em>on the ground of lack of jurisdiction for the reason that Bennett\u2019s allegations constituted only an attack on the credibility of witnesses and the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence to support his conviction (assertions considered and rejected by the Supreme Judicial Court of the State of Maine on Bennett\u2019s appeal), and therefore failed to allege facts to show that Bennett was in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States as required by Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (3). Subsequently that court refused to issue a certificate of probable cause for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A3O\">In this court Bennett has presented three \u201cmotions\u201d:, 1) a \u201cmotion\u201d for a certificate of probable cause for appeal, 2) a \u201cmotion\u201d for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and 3) a \u201cmotion\u201d to amend his complaint to make the hackneyed charge that his conviction was obtained by the prosecuting authorities by the known use of perjured testimony and the known suppression of evidence in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"AhA\"> An examination of the files discloses that the court below was clearly correct in its analysis of the allegations in Bennett\u2019s application for <em>habeas corpus. </em>We shall therefore deny Bennett\u2019s motion for a certificate of probable cause for appeal and also his motion for leave to proeeed in this court <em>in forma </em>pau<em>peris. </em>And we shall also deny Bennett\u2019s motion for leave to amend his application for <em>habeas </em>corpus as not properly made in this court. Orders will be entered accordingly-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
