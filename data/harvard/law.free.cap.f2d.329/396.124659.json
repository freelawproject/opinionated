The parties will be referred to as they were designated in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-26\">This is an action for personal injuries and property damage alleged to have been sustained by plaintiff as a result of a collision between his Mercedes-Benz automobile and a tractor-trailer unit owned and operated by defendant. The collision occurred on Interstate Highway 35, approximately eleven miles east of Ottawa, Kansas, near the interchange of Highway K-33. The case was submitted to a jury, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff. Plaintiff timely moved for a new trial, upon the same grounds urged in this appeal, which motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-27\">Jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship and the amount involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-28\">The first point urged by plaintiff is that the trial court erred in refusing to grant plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the defendant\u2019s answer and enter an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>locutory judgment for the reason that counsel for defendant was \u201chouse counsel\u201d for the insurance company, a corporation, defendant\u2019s insurer. Plaintiff charges that defendant\u2019s counsel is a full-time salaried employee-lawyer or \u201chouse counsel\u201d. A careful consideration of this question leads us to the conclusion that no merit exists in plaintiff\u2019s contention and the decision of the trial court was a proper ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The second point urged by plaintiff is that the court erred in not allowing his counsel sufficient time to argue his case to the jury. The length of time allowed counsel for argument to the jury is within the discretion of the trial judge, and allowing 40 minutes to plaintiff\u2019s counsel for argument was not an abuse of such discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The third point urged by plaintiff is that the trial court erred in allowing the highway patrolman, who investigated the accident but who was not an eyewitness to the same, to give his opinion as to the point of impact. Even if we assume arguendo that the admission of the testimony of the patrolman was technically improper, it by no means follows that a reversal of the judgment is required. The point of impact was established by an abundance of other credible evidence, indeed there was no real dispute as to this element of the case. Therefore, even if, as contended, the Missouri rules of evidence are applicable, we can find no basis for a reversal of the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such action would be inconsistent with the admonition of Rule 61, Fed.R.Civ.P., which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u201cNo error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence * * is ground * * * for setting aside a verdict * * * or otherwise disturbing a judgment * * unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVEL\">See also Een v. Consolidated Freightways, 8 Cir., 220 F.2d 82 (1955); Ross v. Philip Morris &amp; Company, Ltd., 8 Cir., 328 F.2d 3 (1964); and Hawkins v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 8 Cir., 188 F.2d 348 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">The fourth and last point urged by plaintiff is that the trial court erred in allowing the partner of defendant\u2019s trial counsel to testify as to the availability of one of plaintiff\u2019s doctors based upon a telephone conversation he had with the doctor\u2019s receptionist. Since the jury did not reach the question of damages in arriving at its verdict, the admission of such testimony was harmless and did not constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">The verdict of the jury was based upon substantial evidence, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-21\">. In the Missouri cases relied upon by plaintiff, the point of impact was in dispute and essential to the issue of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
