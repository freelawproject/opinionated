V. Williams. Assuming the facts all to be as contended for by the appellants, we conclude that payments made by them to the state official charged with the duty of enforcing the State liquor laws to enable him to carry out this State-directed function can not, under any theory of the law, be considered ordinary and necessary business expenses. The jury merely found what we conclude would have been appropriate for the trial court itself to decide, i. e., these expenses were not deductible from the income of these appellants for federal income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
