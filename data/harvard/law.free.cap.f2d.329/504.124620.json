Here, as they did in the Court below, appellants challenge the jurisdiction of the Commission on the ground that the claim for compensation was exclusively within the province of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">Harris, employed as a welder by The Boston Metals Company, died as the result of injuries received while engaged in dismantling a gun turret on the U.S.S. Guam. The Guam, a decommissioned battle cruiser, had been sold by the Navy to The Boston Metals Company by a contract which provided that the vessel should be broken down for scrap. The contract further provided that certain equipment should be removed and returned to the Navy, and the ship could not be remodeled or remade into another type of vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">For the purpose of carrying out the scrapping operations, the Guam was towed by tugs from Bayonne, New Jersey, to Baltimore, and was deliberately run aground alongside the main pier of Boston Metals in the Patapsco River. At the time of sale and continuously thereafter, the engines of the Guam were disconnected and inoperable and the propellers had been secured. Harris received his fatal injuries shortly after dismantling operations had commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">Section 2(4) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Act provides that \u201cThe term \u2018employer\u2019 means an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment, in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock.)\u201d Section 3(a) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that \u201cCompensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">The questions incident to the permissive scope and jurisdictional limits of the states and the federal government with respect to the compensation coverage of amphibious workers have plagued the courts since the landmark case of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1916), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>which recognized the constitutional restrictions <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> upon the power of the states in this field. While the Longshoremen\u2019s Act was designed to ameliorate the situation of the employees by providing for federal compensation in those areas which the Court had held to be beyond the reach of the states, the provisory language of Section 3(a) left the jurisdictional controversy unresolved since Congress thereby accepted the Jensen line of demarcation between state and federal jurisdiction. Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, 314 U.S. 244, 62 S.Ct. 221, 86 L.Ed. 184 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The continuing problem under the Act was recognized and stated in Davis v. Department of Labor, etc., 317 U.S. 249, at 253, 63 S.Ct. 225 at 227, 87 L.Ed. 246 (1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cHarbor workers and longshoremen employed \u2018in whole or in part upon the navigable waters\u2019 are clearly protected by this Federal Act; but employees such as decedent here, occupy that shadowy area within which, at some undefined and undefinable point, state laws can validly provide compensation. This Court has been unable to give any guiding, definite rule to determine the extent of state power in advance of litigation, and has held that the margins of state authority must \u2018be determined in view of surrounding circumstances as cases arise.\u2019 Baizley Iron Works v. Span, 281 U.S. 222, 230 [50 S.Ct. 306, 307, 74 L.Ed. 819]. The determination of particular cases, of which there have been a great many, has become extremely difficult. It is fair to say that a number of cases can be cited both in behalf of and in opposition to recovery here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In that case the Court upheld an award of state compensation by the judicial expedient of recognizing a \u201ctwilight zone\u201d in which the state law might permissively operate despite the fact that federal jurisdiction would also have been appropriate had it been administratively asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">It would serve no useful purpose to review what Judge Soper characterized as \u201cthe confusion that beclouds the welter of decisions on the subject,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for in our opinion the decision of the Supreme-Court in Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1961), is dispositive of the case-at hand. There the Court upheld a federal award to an employee who at the time of his injury was engaged in the work of completing construction of a vessel on navigable waters. The Fifth Circuit had recognized what it assumed to be an accepted distinction between an employee engaged in repair work on a vessel which would fall within the federal statute and one engaged in construction of a vessel which would be covered by state compensation law. In reversing the Court of Appeals, the Court stated, 370 U.S. at 116, 82 S.Ct. at 1198, 8 L.Ed.2d 368:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 3(a) would, if correct, have the effect of excepting from the Act\u2019s coverage not only the injuries suffered by employees while engaged in ship construction but also any other injuries \u2014 even though incurred on navigable waters and so within the-reach of Congress \u2014 for which a state law could, constitutionally, provide compensation. But the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation is incorrect.. The history of the Act, and of \u00a7 3 (a) in particular, contravenes it; and our decisions construing \u00a7 3(a) have rejected it. Our conclusion is that Congress invoked its constitutional power so as to provide compensation for all injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters whether or not a particular injury might also-have been within the constitutional reach of a state workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>At the Circuit level in Calbeck the Court observed: \u201cWe know by now that nothing written in this field is the last word. All it can be is \u2018the latest word.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, since Harris received his injuries on navigable waters, we agree with the District Judge that Calbeck is controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-13\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-20\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\">.
