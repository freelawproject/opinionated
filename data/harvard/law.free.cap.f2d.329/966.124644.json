Brummitt, an Army officer, and his wife, Mary A. Brummitt were present in Taiwan. Their joint return for the year 1959 reported a taxable net income of $4,590.00 and an income tax liability of $929.80. The return further disclosed that $1,437.87 had been withheld from salaries paid to plaintiffs and requested a refund of $508.07. The claim for refund was denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">No question is here raised whether Mrs. Brummitt was \u201cpresent in a foreign country or countries during at least 510 full days\u201d during a period of 18 consecutive months. The only question to be decided is whether Mrs. Brummitt\u2019s wages were paid \u201cby the United States or an agency thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">It is well established that military nonappropriated fund activities, such as post exchanges, officers\u2019 messes, lunchrooms, and even bowling alleys, are instrumentalities of the United States, cf. Standard Oil Co. of California v. Johnson, 316 U.S. 481, 62 S.Ct. 1168, 86 L.Ed. 1611 (1942); Rizzuto v. United States, 298 F.2d 748 (C.A. 10, 1961); Pulaski Cab Co. v. United States, 141 Ct.Cl. 160, 157 F.Supp. 955 (1958); Borden v. United States, 126 Ct.Cl. 902, 116 F.Supp. 873 (1953); Bleuer v. United States, 117 F.Supp. 509 (E.D.S.C.1950); Nimro v. Davis, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 293, 204 F.2d 734 (C.A.D.C.1953) cert. denied 346 U.S. 901, 74 S.Ct. 229, 98 L.Ed. 401. While these cases establish that nonappropriated fund activities are <em>instrumentalities </em>of the United States for certain purposes, these cases do not construe \u00a7 911 of the Internal Revenue Act of 1954, and they do not establish the proposition that wages received from such a nonappropriated fund activity are \u201camounts paid by the United States or an agency thereof.\u201d On the contrary, it is established that employees of nonappropriated fund activities are <em>not employees of the United States.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In Borden, supra, a suit for salary withheld from an employee of the Army Exchange Service, a nonappropriated fund activity, pursuant to a contract of employment, this court held that the United States could not be sued on a contract of employment signed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>Army Exchange Service, cf. Bleuer, supra ; Gradall v. United States, Ct.Cl., 329 F.2d 960. It is scarcely arguable then that such employees are \u201cpaid by the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">But are nonappropriated fund-activity employees paid by \u201can agency\u201d of the United States ? The question whether a nonappropriated fund activity is an agency of the United States as contemplated by \u00a7 911 of the Internal Revenue Code Is interesting, but may not need definitive resolution here. The question presented to us by the parties is whether this officers\u2019 mess, USOOMT, was in fact a non-appropriated fund activity in 1959. If It was not, the status of nonappropriated fund activities vis-a-vis \u00a7 911 becomes a moot question, at least in this ease. Accordingly, we wil examine the nature of USOOMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">USOOMT was formed as a club on January 27, 1953, by 93 individuals. Though a stock issue was planned, and indeed subscribed to, no stock was ever issued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the necessary funds were obtained through issuance of $50.00 six percent bonds to the members. The club was constructed on land owned by the Bank of Taiwan with funds borrowed from that bank. From 1953 through 1959, the membership reserved to itself full authority over the club\u2019s constitution and by-laws. The membership was in no way limited to service personnel. The club consistently operated at a profit. Its funds were deposited in a Texas bank and its books were audited by an independent civilian Chinese certified public accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">On May 24, 1960, the Staff Judge Advocate of the Military Assistance Advisory Group issued a report entitled \u201cStatus of USOOMT\u201d which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">\u201c * * * The USOOMT is not a nonappropriated fund club, its employees are not paid with money belonging to the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities. As a private club the U.S.O.O.M.T. does not receive financial support from nonappropriated funds and neither the United States nor its Armed Forces have any right to supervise or audit the U.S.O.O.M.T. No right exists for the United States Armed Forces to force compliance with any regulations in that, in addition to being a private club, it is not located on a United States installation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">Subsequent to this report, on January 9, 1961, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Headquarters, MAAG requested \u201cthat the USOOMT be operated henceforth, generally in accordance with AR-230-60 as a nonappropriated fund open mess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Accordingly, the constitution was rewritten to <em>expressly </em>make USOOMT a <em>nonappropriated fund activity. </em>The new constitution was adopted in 1961 by the club membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">In determining whether the USOOMT was a nonappropriated fund activity prior to the new constitution which expressly made it so, we might first discuss the concept of control as exercised over the club by the military commandant of the area. Concededly, considerable control was exercised over USOOMT. But command of a military area requires that a certain degree of control be exercised over the personnel and activities within and related to the command. Compounding the problem of analyzing Governmental control exercised in regard to this club is the fact that the initial constitution of the club specified that operation and administration of the club would generally follow the principles set forth in Army Regulations which controlled <em>nonappropriated fund activities:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-13\">\u201cARTICLE III \u2014 OPERATING REGULATIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-14\">\u201cAlthough <em>this organization is not a nonappropriated fund it </em>will follow generally the basic principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>for administration and operation established by Army Regulations 230-60, dated 26 July 1956 and Air Force Regulations 176-11 dated 22 June 1956 as changed.\u201d [Italics supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Thus, by agreement among the members, the club took on some of the indicia or characteristics of a nonappropriated fund activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">But while USOOMT did possess some of the characteristics of a nonappropriat-ed fund activity by reason of both the command control it was subject to, and the regulations it was guided by; and while USOOMT did receive benefits from the military such as the loan of equipment and the assignment of personnel, other more convincing factors militate against a determination that the club was in fact, at that time, a nonappropri-ated fund activity. No nonappropriated funds were ever made available to the club. Though the club operated at a considerable profit, it was allowed to retain and accumulate its profits. Such retention and accumulation of profits by non-appropriated fund activities was proscribed by Army Regulations AR-230-60, \u00a71, 4, d, (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Though the club did employ a private civilian Chinese certified public accountant to audit its books, no official Governmental audit, as required by regulation, was ever performed (AR-230-60 \u00a7 I, 9, b). In short, no fiscal control over the club was ever exercised by the military command. Lending further weight to our conclusion that USOOMT was not a nonappropriated fund activity are the following factors \u2014 the club was not located on or in a military installation, but was constructed on land independently owned; the club negotiated its own construction loan, and its lease for which it alone was responsible. The club membership was not restricted in any way \u2014 officers, civilians, Government employees, foreign nationals \u2014 all were entitled to membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">The totality of all these factors leads us to the conclusion that the club was not established as a nonappropriated fund activity; was not treated as a nonap-propriated fund activity and was not. deemed to be a nonappropriated fund activity by either the membership or the military command. We are not prepared to say that despite all this, the club was. a nonappropriated fund activity. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Defendant urges, however, that the benefits received by the club from the Government \u2014 the use of Government equipment; the privilege of duty-free import of foods; use of Post Office and Post Exchange facilities; the assignment of personnel to the club \u2014 are sufficient to overcome the factors we discussed above. But we do not believe that these benefits received by the club should be given conclusive weight on whether the club was, or was not, a nonappropriated fund activity. Other organizations which are clearly not nonappropriated fund activities receive similar benefits. Quite recently, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that an overseas employee of the American Red Cross was entitled to the \u00a7 911 exclusion at issue here. In the course of that opinion, Revenue Ruling 60-36, 1960-1 Cum.Bull. 279, the Commissioner pointed out that Red Cross employees can be furnished transportation, meals, and quarters, office space, warehousing, wharfage and communications by the Government. Yet,, the Government-conferred benefits do not. make the Red Cross an agency of the' United States. We do not believe that similar benefits conferred on this club make it a nonappropriated fund activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">As we pointed out above, our determination that this club was not a nonap-propriated fund activity makes it unnecessary to consider whether a nonappro-priated fund activity is an agency of the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 911 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">From the foregoing, and upon the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact which are adopted as the findings of the court, we conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to recovei', and judgment is accordingly entered for plaintiffs in the amount of $544.40.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">. This section was amended by the Revenue Act of 1962 Pub.L. 87-834 ; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 911.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">. In fact, an additional assessment of $34.-31 plus $2.02 in interest was made on April 4, 1961. The assessment was paid. The parties have agreed that this additional sum should be treated as part of this claim. (If10 of Ans.; Tr. 6-7). The sum therefore claimed by plaintiffs is $544.40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1021-18\">. For certain limited purposes under certain statutes such employees may be considered employees of the United States.

United States, Ct.Cl., 329 F.2d 960.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">. In 1953, the U.S. Staff Advocate General opined <em>that a </em>club having a nonappropri-ated fund activity status could not issue stock under Army regulations.
