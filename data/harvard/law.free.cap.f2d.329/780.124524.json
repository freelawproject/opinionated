We conclude that the trial court erred in reversing the Secretary\u2019s determination, in that it is apparent that the findings were supported by substantial evidence and that the examiner applied the proper legal standards in his consideration of the case. See Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir., 323 F.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for entry of judgment for the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
