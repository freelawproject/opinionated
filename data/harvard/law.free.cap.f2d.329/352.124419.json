The district court decided the obligation did not arise until after the suits were filed, thereby limiting insured\u2019s right to attorney\u2019s fees to services rendered since that time. Attorney Thomas Hart Fisher\u2019s claim for fees and expenses was reduced, accordingly, below the jurisdictional amount. We agree with the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Hartford\u2019s policy covered construction work and bound Hartford to pay any sums for which the insureds would become \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d because of injuries; and to \u201cdefend any suit\u201d against insureds \u201ceven if * * * groundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-21\">An accident occurred on the property, covered by the policies, on August 18, 1957, injuring several persons. Two suits arising from the accident were filed against the insureds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hartford did not tender an unconditional defense, but reserved its right to withdraw its defense and to deny coverage under its policy. It later brought a declaratory judgment suit with respect to its obligations under the policy. It settled both personal injury suits before trial, and the declaratory judgment action was \u201cdismissed\u201d after trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">Plaintiffs then brought this damage suit for alleged breach of the defense clause by Hartford, and claimed expenses and attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered by Attorney Fisher in representing them in the three suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">The issue raised by the pleadings and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is whether the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter because of lack of jurisdictional amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-24\"> The statute conferring jurisdiction calls for strict construction and when plaintiffs\u2019 allegation was challenged by Hartford they had the burden of supporting the allegation by competent proof. Thomson v. Gaskill, 315 U.S. 442, 446, 62 S.Ct. 673, 86 L.Ed. 951, (1942). And if, on the record made before it, the district court should have been convinced \u201cto a legal certainty\u201d the claim is for less than the jurisdictional amount, the court did not err. Jones v. Drewery\u2019s, Ltd., 149 F.2d 250, 251 (7th Cir.1945), Berger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>v. Austin, Nichols &amp; Co., 170 F.2d 330, 332 (7th Cir.1948), Columbia Pictures Corp. v. Grengs, 257 F.2d 45, 47 (7th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Plaintiffs refer us to the Annotation at 43 A.L.R.2d 694 for Illinois cases to support the \u201cwell established * * * law\u201d that the district court erred in excluding from consideration fees of Attorney Fisher for services rendered prior to commencement of suit. The reference is unavailing. None of the cases support the theory, directly or indirectly. On the contrary, if any implication for the case at hand can be seen in the Illinois cases referred to it is that the court ruled properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We are not persuaded that the district court erred in applying the rule that it did, in excluding from consideration claims of Attorney Fisher for services rendered before the filing of suit. It follows, we think, that the court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">There is no merit in the argument that because the face amount of Hartford\u2019s policy exceeded $10,000.00, that amount was in controversy in this suit, brought for attorney\u2019s expenses and fees for alleged breach of the defense clause. Cases such as Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. v. Schantz, 178 F.2d 779 (5th Cir.1949), where the dispute was about coverage, are not pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Finally, we see no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they were erroneously denied the right to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs\u2019 amendment sought to increase the \u201cexpenses incurred\u201d by Attorney Fisher in the \u201cthree actions\u201d from $78.09 to $598.66, and thereby meet the jurisdictional requisite. Plaintiffs did not seek to amend until after the court had filed its opinion \u201cdismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint,\u201d and did not make any showing, outside of the bare increase in figures, to substantiate the increase. Since defendant had filed its answer prior to this attempted amendment, it was discretionary with the district judge whether or not to grant plaintiffs leave to amend. Rule 15(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. In view of the district court\u2019s observation in its opinion dismissing the complaint that plaintiffs used \u201cunorthodox means\u201d to show jurisdiction, there is a \u201cjustifying reason appearing for the denial\u201d of the leave to amend, Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), and nothing has been shown to the contrary to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">We have examined plaintiffs\u2019 other contentions and find no merit to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-14\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-15\">. Howard T. Fisher and Howard T. Fisher &amp; Associates, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-16\">. While this cause was pending before this court, a third personal injury action was filed against insureds. We have taken judicial notice of this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-17\">. Plaintiffs ask for $11,048.09 \u2014 $10,970.00 was for professional services rendered by Attorney Fisher, and $78.09 was for \u201cexpenses incurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-26\">Defendant asserted that the time spent by Attorney Fisher between the date of the accident and the date the first personal injury lawsuit was filed (34% hours) was not a proper element of damages, and that accordingly the damages asked should be reduced by $1,370.00\u2014 to $9,678.09.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
