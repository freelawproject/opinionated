Only one needs to be discussed. Appellant says the court erred in instructing in the language of the statute, telling the jury that one element of the offense was that the defendant \u201c[took], or attempted] to take\u201d indecent liberties. Appellant says taking and attempting to take are two separate offenses and that this should have been made clear to the jury. He cites People v. Crane.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But, in the first place, no objection was made in the trial court to the instruction. And, in the second place, the penalty under the statute for an attempt is the same as that for a taking, even if the two are regarded as separate offenses. The sentence given appellant was well within the statutory prescription. Thus no substantial right seems to have been affected in any realistic sense, even if the instruction was erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the third place, the evidence of guilt in this case was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\">. 62 Stat. 347 (1948), D.C.Code, \u00a7 22-3501 (a) (1961 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-11\">. 302 Ill. 217, 134 N.E. 99 (1922).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b312-25\">.
