Based thereon, he then entered his order and judgment granting appellee summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-29\">We are of the opinion that the findings, of fact are not shown to be clearly erroneous and that on the basis of these facts and the controlling decisions, his conclusions of law were correctly drawn. In support of his opinion, the district judge relied on Boston Printing Press<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>man\u2019s Union v. Potter Press, 141 F.Supp. 553, affirmed 241 F.2d 787, cert. denied 355 U.S. 817, 78 S.Ct. 21, 2 L.Ed.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"alx-dedup-0\">Here appellant vigorously attacks the Potter Press decision as incorrect and the decision appealed from here as wrong. We cannot agree with this view. On the -contrary, we are of the opinion that the Potter Press case was correctly decided and that on the findings and conclusions -of the district judge, which we approve, the judgment here appealed from must be -affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ALf\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-30\">.
