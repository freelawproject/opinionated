(No. 17608), Texaco, Inc. and other corporations and individuals (No. 17652), and Sun Oil Co. (No. 17700) for an order .granting leave to adduce additional evidence in a hearing now pending before the respondent, Federal Power Commission. Respondent has moved to dismiss the petitions on the ground that they are premature and that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider them at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The issue presented is whether this \u25a0court has jurisdiction to review, in an interlocutory fashion, the Commission\u2019s \u25a0exclusion of evidence in a hearing in which the Commission has not yet entered its final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The several petitioners before us are parties to a proceeding before the Federal Power Commission which involves petitioners\u2019 and others\u2019 applications for \u25a0certificates of public convenience and necessity under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f. Amerada Petroleum Corp., Docket CI 62-1544. In No. 17608, the petitioner seeks review of the Commission\u2019s refusal to reconsider its denial of petitioner\u2019s motion under 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.23 for production of various Commission records. In No. 17652 and No. 17700, the petitioners seek review of \u25a0the examiner\u2019s rulings sustaining Commission motions to strike certain testimony of petitioners\u2019 witnesses and exclude certain exhibits and they also seek review of the Commission\u2019s denial of a request for interlocutory appeals under 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Petitioners assert that unless they now apply to this court for leave to adduce additional evidence under Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r (b), during the pendency of the administrative hearing, i. e., take an interlocutory appeal, that, as they read the controlling law, their right to petition the court later for leave to offer additional evidence may be lost. They rely essentially on Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 403-405, 254 F.2d 314, 322-324 (1958); <em>Same, </em>107 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 281-282, 277 F.2d 78, 81 (1959), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 1, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 6 L.Ed.2d 625 (1961). In its motion to dismiss the petitions, the Federal Power Commission asserts that Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act confers jurisdiction on this court to pass on only \u201corders of a definitive character dealing with the merits of a proceeding before the Commission and resulting from a hearing upon evidence and supported by findings appropriate to the case.\u201d Federal Power Commission v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 304 U.S. 375, 384, 58 S.Ct. 963, 967, 82 L.Ed. 1408 (1938). See also, Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 201 F.2d 334, 337-338 (1st Cir. 1953); Texaco, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 301 F.2d 662 (5th Cir.), (per curiam) cert. denied, 371 U.S. 822, 83 S.Ct. 40, 9 L.Ed.2d 62 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act delineates the jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeals to review certain orders of the Federal Power Commission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\u201c(b) [1] Any party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain a review of such order * * * in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the order of the Commission upon the application for rehearing, a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part. [Sentence 2 omitted.] [3] Upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>filing of such petition such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record with it shall be exclusive, to affirm, modify, or set aside such order in whole or in part. [Sentence 4 omitted.] [5] The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. [6] If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceedings before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. [7] The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken * * *. [Sentence 8 omitted.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">This -statutory provision has virtually identical counterparts in the various statutes regulating judicial review of numerous other federal regulatory agencies. See Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Petitioners assert that sentence [6] of Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, <em>supra, </em>authorizes this court to review evidentiary rulings of the Commission in an interlocutory manner independent of the jurisdiction provided in sentences [1] and [3] of Section 19(b). Petitioners rely primarily on this court\u2019s opinions in <em>Communist Party </em>supra, which construed a similar statutory provision, <em>i. e., </em>Section 14(a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(a). Judge Prettyman, writing for the court in those cases, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">\u201cAs we read the opinion and decision in the Consolidated Edison case [Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U.S. 198, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)] it means that, when proffered evidence is denied receipt by the trial tribunal in a case in which a statute similar to Section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e)] applies, the profferor must apply to the appropriate United States Court of Appeals for permission to adduce the additional evidence; if he fails so to move he cannot successfully present the point on appeal.\u201d 102 U.S.App.D.C. at 404, 254 F.2d at 323. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">The legal significance of this language as precedent is better understood when it is put in the context of the history of the Communist Party litigation. The evidence with which the court was concerned there was the so-called \u201cGitlow memoranda.\u201d The first time the Party ease was before this court, we affirmed the order of the Control Board. 96 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 223 F.2d 531 (1954). At no time prior to that decision by this court did the Communist Party petition this court for leave to proffer the Gitlow memoranda either in an interlocutory fashion or by way of a petition ancillary to the general petition to review the final order of the Control Board. Our decision was reversed by the Supreme Court and the case was remanded to the Control Board. 351 U.S. 115, 76 S.Ct. 663, 100 L.Ed. 1003 (1956). Subsequently we reviewed the Control Board\u2019s new order and remanded the case. The language quoted above is found in that second decision by this court. 102 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 254 F.2d 314 (1958). At the time of this court\u2019s second decision, the Communist Party had not petitioned this court for leave to adduce the memoranda. After this court\u2019s second decision the Communist Party filed its petition for leave to adduce the memoranda, and the petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">When the case returned here a third time, we held the Party could not raise the issue relating to the Gitlow memoranda because that issue had been decided against them on the second appeal and their failure to petition this court for leave to proffer the evidence prior to that decision could not be cured <em>nunc </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>pro tunc </em>by their subsequent petition. 107 U.S.App.D.C. at 282, 277 F.2d at 81. On the third appeal we affirmed the Control Board\u2019s order and our decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 367 U.S. 1, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 6 L.Ed.2d 625 (1961). The Supreme Court explicitly refrained from deciding the applicability of the <em>Consolidated Edison </em>case to the <em>Communist Party </em>case. 367 U.S. at 30, 81 S.Ct. at 1376, 6 L.Ed.2d 625. This court\u2019s ruling on the Gitlow memoranda was sustained on another ground, namely that the Party\u2019s failure to raise the issue on its first appeal in the Supreme Court [351 U.S. 115, 76 S.Ct. 663, 100 L.Ed. 1003 (1956)] precluded it from raising the point on the second appeal. 367 U.S. at 30-32, 81 S.Ct. at 1376, 6 L.Ed.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The language and holding of this court in the second Communist Party appeal, when considered in light of the facts of that litigation and the <em>Consolidated Edison </em>case, is not to be read as standing for the proposition that a party whose proffer of evidence is rejected in an administrative hearing must then take an interlocutory appeal from the examiner\u2019s ruling or forever forego the opportunity of judicial review of that ruling. In the Communist Party litigation, the Communist Party failed to petition this court for leave to adduce the memoranda prior to this court\u2019s first review of the Board\u2019s order, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 223 F.2d 531 (1954), and the second review, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 254 F.2d 314 (1958). Therefore, when the case came here the second time, the Party was in the position of having failed to raise the issue of the Gitlow memoranda because it had not sought leave of this court to adduce that evidence when it could have done so under its original petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">This interpretation of the opinions in the second and third Communist Party appeals in this court is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938), and in keeping with sound concepts of orderly procedure of appellate review. In <em>Consolidated Edison, </em>the National Labor Relations Board had excluded certain testimony which was offered on behalf of the employer in the course of the Board\u2019s proceedings. On petition to review the Board\u2019s <em>final order on the merits, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the exclusion of the evidence was arbitrary but it did not remand to the Board for the taking of additional evidence because the petitioner had not petitioned the court for leave to adduce the excluded evidence. The opinion of that court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">\u201cHowever, the petitioners have not applied to this court for the taking of additional evidence, as they might under section 10(e), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e).\u201d 95 F.2d 390, 397 (2d Cir. 1938).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">The holding of the Second Circuit was sustained by the Supreme Court. 305 U.S. 197, 226, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). In neither the opinion of the Court of Appeals nor the Supreme Court is there any mention of the appropriate time to petition a court of appeals for leave to adduce evidence rejected by the Board. The Supreme Court did not say that that part of Section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, which provides for petitions to adduce evidence, gave jurisdiction to the Courts of Appeals independent of the first sentence of the section which provides for appellate review of final orders on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">Although the opinion is not free from ambiguity on this score, it should not be read as sanctioning interlocutory appeals to review rulings on exclusion of evidence; rather it should be read as saying that when a party petitions a court of appeals to review a <em>final </em>order of the Board on the merits, under the first sentence of Section 10(e), and fails at that stage to request leave to adduce the evidence, the court need not sua sponte remand the case for the taking of the additional evidence. See Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 313 U.S. 146, 154-56, 61 S.Ct. 908, 85 L.Ed. 1251 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The provision in the several statutes (e.g., sentence [6] in Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act) which provides for petitions to adduce evidence is not a basis of jurisdiction independent of the first sentences; rather it provides in effect a rule of pleading in the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the court rules on the petition favorably prior to argument of the petition to review the final order on the merits, it may remand at that time and eliminate the waste involved in briefing and arguing the case on the merits before the entire administrative record is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">An independent reading of Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act reveals that this court\u2019s power to require the Commission to take additional evidence to supplement the record of a hearing is a corollary of the preceding sentence in the statute which provides that the Commission\u2019s findings of fact shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. When read together the two sentences of the section demonstrate that the Courts of Appeals must sustain the Board\u2019s finding of fact against a challenge if the record contains substantial evidence in support; but the court may not sustain the findings of fact in the face of a petitioner\u2019s valid and timely contention that the Commission wrongfully excluded material, non-cumulative evidence. Wheeler v. National Labor Relations Board, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 255, 314 F.2d 260 (1963). Compare Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), with International Brotherhood of Operative Potters v. National Labor Relations Board, 11 U.S.App.D.C. 35, 320 F.2d 757, (1963). See National Labor Relations Board v. National Laundry Co., 78 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 138 F.2d 589 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In Wheeler v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, we remanded a ease to the Labor Board to allow the petitioner to adduce material evidence which we found to have been wrongfully excluded by the hearing examiner, that precise point having been raised by petitioner. The petitioner did not petition this court in an interlocutory manner for leave to adduce the evidence, but rather raised the point on review after the Board\u2019s final order. We considered the petition properly timed and decided the issue in petitioner\u2019s favor, remanding so that the excluded evidence could be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">There would' seem to be no escape from a holding that the petitions for leave to adduce additional evidence are premature. In the first place, none of the parties may be aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s final order. Again, if any of them think otherwise, they may under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(a) \u201capply for a rehearing within thirty days after the issuance of such order.\u201d The several rulings now complained of may be challenged, and so far as we know the Commission may then rule favorably to the several petitioners. If not, or if rehearing be denied, the jurisdictional prerequisite to a review of \u201cany order of the Commission\u201d will then have been satisfied. Thereupon, further proceedings may follow as provided in \u00a7 717r(b), and the rights of the parties may be fully considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In short, the appropriate time to petition this court for leave to adduce additional evidence under Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act is after this court has jurisdiction over a final order of the Commission on the merits, pursuant to sentences [1] and [3] of Section 19(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The several petitions to adduce evidence are dismissed without prejudice to their renewal in conjunction with a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tion to review the Commission\u2019s final order on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Statutes Similar to Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">Atomic <em>Energy </em>Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Hobbs Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1037(c)</p>\n<p id=\"apg-dedup-0\">Attorney-General:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Settlement of International Claims Act, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631g(f)*</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Civil Aeronautics Board:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21</p>\n<p id=\"AZGs\">Detention Review Board</p>\n<p id=\"apa-dedup-0\">Emergency Detention Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 821(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">Federal Communications Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21</p>\n<p id=\"Al4\">Hobbs Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1037(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">Federal Power Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 8251 (b)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">Federal Reserve Board:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">Federal Trade Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.

But it seems to me that we are bound by the ruling of the Supreme Court in the <em>Consolidated Edison case.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That case involved a petition to review an order of the National Labor Relations Board. In the course of the hearing before the Board the companies, which were the respondents, proffered the testimony of two witnesses, and the hearing examiner rejected the proffer. Before the Court of Appeals the companies contended that this rejection deprived the hearing of its necessary fairness. The contention was pressed in the Supreme Court. That Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0kV\">\u201cWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the refusal to receive the testimony was unreasonable and arbitrary. Assuming, as the Board contends, that it had a discretionary control over the conduct of the proceeding, we cannot but regard this action as an abuse of discretion. But the statute did not leave the petitioners without remedy. The court below pointed to that remedy, that is, to apply to the Court of Appeals for leave to adduce the additional evience; on such an application and a showing of reasonable grounds the court could have ordered it to be taken. \u00a7 10(e) (f).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioners did not avail themselves of this appropriate procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWp\">The Court declined to sustain the point.</p>\n<p id=\"AI1\">When the <em>Communist Party </em>ease was before us,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the point was made by the Party that the Board had denied production of certain memoranda to which the Party claimed it was entitled under the <em>Jencks </em>doctrine. In a memorandum filed in this court by the Board on August 2, 1957, and signed by its General Counsel, its Assistant General Counsel, and an attorney from the Department of Justice, one heading was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT7\">\n<em>\u201cPetitioner has waived its claim of error by failing to use the exclusive statutory remedy under section 14(a)\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Dl\">(Section 14(a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act corresponds to Section 10(e) (f) of the National Labor Relations Act and to Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> relating to adducing additional evidence.) In its argument under the foregoing heading the Government said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6np\">\u201cAssuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the failure to order production of the documents in question was error, petitioner is barred from relief because it has failed to invoke its statutory remedy, section 14(a) of the Act. Substantially the same provision in the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 160(e)) and the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(e)) has been held to be an exclusive remedy under circumstances analogous to those here presented. The Supreme Court and several circuits have so held. Not having invoked it, petitioner is now precluded from doing so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">The Government then discussed the Consolidated <em>Edison </em>case and named nine cases in which it said Circuit Courts of Appeals had so construed the <em>Consolidated Edison </em>case. The Government said that the petitioner\u2019s request in that case for production of the documents fitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>squarely into the purposes of the procedure set forth in the statutory provisions mentioned. The Government said, \u201cPetitioner is, therefore, barred from the relief sought on the document questions under <em>Consolidated Edison, </em>and the other eases cited, <em>supra, </em>to the same effect.\u201d We agreed with the argument thus made by the Government and so construed the <em>Consolidated Edison </em>case in our opinion in the <em>Communist Party </em>case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In so doing we pointed to the apparent results of the ruling and said:. \u201cThere is much force to these various suggestions, and perhaps we misconstrue the opinion of the Supreme Court. But we are bound by the opinion as we read it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Upon reexamination of the question and a re-reading of the cases cited, I am still of the same opinion. It seems to me that the Supreme Court said quite clearly that if proffered evidence is rejected the profferor has an exclusive remedy, which is a motion in the Court of Appeals for leave to adduce the evidence, and if he does not make that motion he cannot raise the point upon a petition to review the final order. In saying that the profferor of the evidence must make such a motion in the Court of Appeals, it seems to me that the Court must have meant that the Court of Appeals must pass upon the motion; it does not seem to me that the Court could have meant that the profferor should merely file the motion as an empty gesture for the record. This latter is the effect of the contention now made to us by the Commission. Its contention is that the motion to adduce additional evidence can only be made when there is both a final agency order and a petition to review that order filed in the Court of Appeals. The motion should then be made to the court, prior to submission of the case on the merits, the court to dispose of the motion either at that point or in reviewing the order of which review is sought. But, absent the specific motion following a petition to review the final agency order, and prior to submission of the case, the profferor of rejected evidence is forever precluded from raising the issue of the admissibility of that evidence. This suggestion on the part of the Commission seems to me to be the suggestion of a wholly meaningless gesture on the part of the profferor of rejected evidence, and I do not think the Supreme Court meant that it was necessary for such an empty gesture to be made. To say that a motion to adduce the evidence must be made to the Court of Appeals, that such a motion can be made only after a final order is entered by the Commission and a petition to review has been filed, but that the point cannot be part of the petition to review and cannot be argued unless a separate motion has been made in such manner and at such time, makes no sense to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Since I am writing for myself alone, I feel free to say that I hope the Supreme Court will agree with my brethren and will conclude that I misconstrue the opinion in the <em>Consolidated Edison </em>case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Akc\">\u201c5. 29 U.S.C. 160(e) (f) <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"agf-dedup-0\">.
