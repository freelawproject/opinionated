This, appellant alleged, amounted to unreasonable preference in violation of \u00a7 404(b) of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-27\">\u201cNo air carrier * * * shall make, give, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person * * in air transportation in any respect whatsoever or subject any particular person * * * in air transportation to any unjust discrimination or any undue or unreasonable prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201cAir transportation\u201d is defined in \u00a7 101(10) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(10), to mean (as relevant here) \u201cinterstate * * * air transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201cInterstate air transportation\u201d in turn is defined by \u00a7 101(21), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(21) to mean, in the context of this case, \u201cthe carriage by aircraft of persons or property as a common carrier for compensation or hire * * * in commerce between * * * (a) a place in any State of the United States, or the District of Columbia, and a place in any other State of the United States, or the District of Columbia; or between places in the same State of the United States through the airspace over any place outside thereof * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The district court ruled that a flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles did not fall within this definition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Appellant now suggests that the flight in question was one which originated outside the State of California. This was not alleged. The record shows that the district court offered appellant the opportunity to amend his complaint in \u25a0this respect and that the offer was rejected. It was not error, then, to dismiss without leave to amend. See Joy v. Hague (1 Cir. 1949) 175 F.2d 395, cert. denied (1949) 338 U.S. 870, 70 S.Ct. 147, 94 L.Ed. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">The district court also ruled that appellant had failed to establish diversity .jurisdiction, there being no reasonably foreseeable possibility that he could re\u2022cover at least $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">Although appellant challenged this portion of the district court\u2019s order in his statement of points on appeal, subsequently he failed to include any such challenge in the specification of errors in his brief, as is required by this court\u2019s Rule 18 with respect to \u201ceach error intended to be urged\u201d; nor did he argue the point in his brief. In view of this failure, the point is deemed abandoned, and accordingly the issue will not be considered on this appeal. See Everest &amp; Jennings, Inc. v. E &amp; J Mfg. Co. (9 Cir. 1958) 263 F.2d 254, 258, cert. denied (1959) 360 U.S. 902, 79 S.Ct. 1284, 3 L.Ed.2d 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-12\">. It has been held that this section gives to one who has been discriminated against in violation of its provisions a civil cause of action falling within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337. Fitzgerald v. Pan American World Airways, Inc. (2 Cir. 1956) 229 F.2d 499. That section confers on the district \u2022courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce * * * \u201d without regard to amount in controversy.
