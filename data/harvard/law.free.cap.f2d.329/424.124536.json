The present action, seeking an accounting, was originally filed in October of 1957; an amended complaint, adding a cause of action for alleged antitrust violations, was served the following month. In July <em>of </em>1959, Judge Palmieri dismissed the antitrust claim, and refused to permit Fleischer to appear in the capacity of \u201creceiver\u201d of Fleischer Studios, Inc., a long defunct Florida corporation, 180 F.Supp. 717 (S.D.N.Y.1959); plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, once again requesting an accounting, was finally dismissed on a motion for summary judgment by Chief Judge Ryan in September of 1963. 222 F.Supp. 40 (S.D.N.Y.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Apart from the merits of Fleischer\u2019s claims, several factors justify the dismissals below, which are hereby affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the conclusory allegations of the complaints are pierced, be they characterized as \u201cantitrust\u201d or \u201caccounting\u201d claims, it becomes apparent that plaintiff is simply asserting that Paramount has violated the express or implied terms of a 1941 contract. And since that agreement was not with Fleischer individually, but with Fleischer Studios, Inc., it is equally clear that Fleischer may not secure a personal recovery for an alleged wrong done to his corporation. While plaintiff attempts to invoke his statbs as \u201ctrustee in dissolution\u201d or \u201creceiver\u201d of the corporation, he is nonetheless barred. Under Florida law, corporate claims not dealing with Florida real estate abate three years after the corporation is dissolved, Fla. Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 608.29, 608.30 (1961); Walder v. Paramount Publix Corp., 132 F.Supp. 912, 917-919 (S.D.N.Y.1955), and the present suit was filed more than eleven years after the demise of Fleischer Studios.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Although it is not necessary to&gt; consider the point, most if not all of Fleischer\u2019s allegations are also foreclosed to him on grounds of collateral, estoppel. The rights and obligations of Paramount under the 1941 contract, as well as Fleischer\u2019s inability to recover for injuries suffered by his corporation, issues central to the instant case, were determined adversely to the plaintiff by the New York State courts in Fleischer v. W. P. I. X., Inc., 30 Misc.2d 17, 213 N.Y.S.2d 632, appeals dismissed, 14 A.D.2d 846 (1961), appeals dismissed, 11 N.Y.2d 876, 227 N.Y.S.2d 913, 182 N.E.2d 403, appeals dismissed, 371 U.S. 16, 83 S.Ct. 59, 9 L.Ed.2d 50 (1962). Although Paramount was not a party to the New York litigation, both this court and the New York Court of Appeals permit a prior judgment to be invoked defensively as against the unsuccessful party in the prior action, where the issues are the same and have been fully litigated. Zdanok v. The Glidden Co., 327 F.2d 944 (2nd Cir. 1964); First Congregational Church and Soc. of Burlington, Iowa v. Evangelical &amp; Reformed Church, 305 F.2d 724 (2nd Cir. 1962) Israel v. Wood Dolson Co., 1 N.Y.2d 116, 151 N.Y.S.2d 1, 134 N.E.2d 97 (1956).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Although critical of Fleischer\u2019s; attorney, Chief Judge Ryan denied Paramount\u2019s motion for an allowance of $15,000 counsel fees, and Paramount has; filed a cross-appeal from his decision in this regard. While the conduct of Fleischer\u2019s counsel was properly disapproved, we affirm Judge Ryan\u2019s refusal to tax Fleischer with Paramount\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>neys\u2019 fees. American courts have traditionally refused to include counsel fees in a losing party\u2019s bill of costs, except in the most extraordinary of instances, and have virtually never awarded such fees in an action at law. Every litigant, regardless of the seeming frivolity of his claims, is entitled to have them determined on their merits, and not to be \u201ctaxed out of court.\u201d When viewed in this light, the District Court\u2019s action was entirely proper.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-5\">. Fleischer's appeal from Chief Judge Ryan\u2019s award of summary judgment also brings up for review Judge Palmieri\u2019s earlier order, previously nonappealable, and interlocutory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\">. The New York suits, although consolidated for trial, were brought separately against W. P. I. X., Inc., and N. T. A. Pictures, Inc. Since <em>both </em>W. P. I. X, and U. M. and M. TV Corp., N. T. A.\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, are parties defendant to the present action, the case for invoking the earlier judgment is All the stronger.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
