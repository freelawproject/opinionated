This because certain of the appellees prosecuted or judicially acted upon a claim made in the State courts, based on \u00a7\u00a7 1650-1690 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, the \u201cUniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act,\u201d against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\"> Treating the judgment of dismissal of the complaint below (Tr. p. 35) as a dismissal of the appellant\u2019s cause of action (as appellant does), we affirm the district court\u2019s action, because it held, and we hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">(1) No claim is stated against any of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-19\">(2) The acts of the judicial defendants complained of were judicial acts, done by them in the exercise of their judicial functions, under an absolute immunity from civil liability. (Bradley v. Fisher, 1872, 13 Wall. 335, 80 U.S. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646.) The Civil Rights Act does not abrogate this immunity. (Johnson v. MacCoy, 9 Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 37; Sires v. Cole, 9 Cir. 1963, 320 F.2d 877.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-20\">(3) The acts of the \u201cprosecuting defendants\u201d complained of were \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d acts done by them in the exercise of their quasi-judicial functions, and under a similar, if not a same, immunity. \u201c[A] like immunity extends to other officers of government whose duties are related to the judicial process.\u201d (Barr v. Matteo, 1959, 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434; Sires v. Cole, supra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
