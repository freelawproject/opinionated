In United States v. Lawrence LeRoy Ramsey, Case No. 30201, Criminal, D.C., in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, Central Division, the defendant was charged with a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851, illegal possession of firearms. He moved for the return of certain seized property, and the suppression of that evidence, taken from his home on September 30, 1961, in the City of Hemet, California. He claimed the evidence had been taken from his premises after a search had been made without a valid search warrant, <em>i. e., </em>one insufficient on its face (Fed.R.Crim.Proc. 41(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">The district court on April 26, 1962, granted Ramsey\u2019s motion to suppress; denied the motion for return of the seized property, and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">Thereafter, and on May 7, 1962, the United States Attorney voluntarily dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>missed four counts against appellant in Case No. 30201 C.D.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The motion to suppress was granted, said the district court in its order of April 26, 1962, because the search and seizure was unauthorized by law, in that \u201cthe affidavit in support of the search warrant did not state probable cause for the issuance of said warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In the government\u2019s brief, in this case, with respect to the weapons, it was stated: \u201c * * * publication of notice of seizure was made pursuant to Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 7325,\u201d and, as we have seen, the summary judgment here granted recited appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 7325.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Upon oral argument, government counsel moved for leave <em>to twice </em>\u201ccorrect\u201d the government\u2019s brief, to allege (p. 2, lines 9 and 10, and p. 7, last If) that the publication of notice of seizure was made pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">Title 19, U.S.C. \u00a7 1607, provides for notice of seizure of certain articles, and the intention of the government to forfeit and sell them. The \u201ccertain articles\u201d are by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602, defined as \u201cmerchandise or baggage subject to seizure for violation of <em>the customs laws.\u201d </em>We cannot understand how the government can contend such custom laws are applicable in this case, and no explanation was given to this court on oral argument, save for one significant fact \u2014 that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires the services of but one appraiser; while 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7325 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires an appraisement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>property seized by three sworn appraisers. <em>Before </em>the publication of any notice, such appraisers must find the property to be of the value of $1,000 or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Appellant urges upon us the fact that three appraisers were never appointed;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that there was no compliance with \u00a7 7325, either with respect to the number of appraisers, notice, or public auction. This claim was not denied by government counsel on oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The requested motion to \u201ccorrect\u201d the appellee\u2019s brief will not aid appellee. To make the change in the brief would not change the procedure actually followed prior to the purported forfeiture. We have been advised of no reason why the seized articles can be claimed to have been seized under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 <em>et seg. </em>(customs), and not under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7302, <em>et seq. </em>(taxation), as charged and as alleged in defense of this suit, and as originally asserted in the government\u2019s brief. The motion to \u201ccorrect\u201d is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">If the seizure was under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 781, the guns were required to fall within the definition of \u201ccontraband articles\u201d in said section. This rests upon a violation of \u201cany provision of the National Firearms Act or any regulation issued pursuant thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">But neither in the motion for summary judgment, nor in any information supplied by answers to interrogatories, did the government assert the seizure occurred under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 781. The only sections relied upon in answer to interrogatories upon which to base the seizure were:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">(a) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5862 (Internal Revenue Code, Chapter 53, Machine Guns and Other Firearms); <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">(b) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7325 (provision for ap-praisement) ;</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">(c) 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618 (remission of penalties in customs\u2019 seizures).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The findings, however, as we have seen before, do not state or find the <em>weapons </em>were contraband articles under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 781; but only taxable items under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301 <em>et seq. </em>The <em>vehicles </em>were found contraband articles under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 781, but only under the theory they carried contraband weapons, a fact never established by proof, or found as a fact in the court below. Thus the basis for the legality (or illegality) of \u201ccontraband because carrying contraband\u201d was never the subject of a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">Nor do we believe it could be, on the record before us, and before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">In the \u201cMemorandum of Points and Authorities\u201d filed in support of the government\u2019s motion for a summary judgment, there appears the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-18\">\u201cAnother question of fact is whether the two weapons now in the possession of the United States come within the meaning of either contraband or \u2018firearms\u2019 under the Firearms Act, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5801 et seq.). Section 179.35 of Title 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Code of Federal Regulations, indicates that pistol does not include gadget devices, guns altered or converted to resemble pistols, or small portable guns * * * firing fixed shotgun or fixed rifle ammunition. This is important because Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848 which defines firearms, under the National (illegal) Firearms Act, excludes a pistol. Under \u00a7 179.35 of Title 26 C.F.R., the smoothbore chromed pistol is a \u2018gun altered or converted\u2019 to resemble pistols, or a gun \u2018firing fixed shotgun' ammunition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">\u201cAs for the cane gun, a perusal of this weapon will .indicate that it is clearly a weapon or device \u2018capable of being concealed on the person * * \u2019. Thus Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5848(5) would include plaintiff\u2019s cane gun as a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201cSince both weapons come within the National Firearms Act of 1954, it is necessary that they be registered pursuant to Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841. Patently, they have not been, and it is noted that plaintiff does not allege that these weapons have been registered under the Firearms Act in his Complaint. Since the issue is not raised in the pleadings, no affidavit has been presented by the defendant on this point, but plaintiff will undoubtedly concede that his client has not registered these two weapons under Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5841.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cThus it can be seen that the issues of fact which are unresolved can be readily disposed of as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Thus serious questions of fact are presented by the government, but <em>\u201cno affidavit has been presented by the defendant </em>[government] <em>on this point,\u201d </em>suggesting that perhaps the plaintiff would \u201cconcede\u201d the point. No concession was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>No affidavits of any hind were filed in support of the motion for summary judgment. </em>While this is not fatal (Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 56), we note appellant did file an affidavit opposing the motion. It relates largely to the question of exhaustion of remedies. Appellant did, however, in his opposition to the motion, directly raise the factual question which the government has suggested appellant might concede, <em>i. e., </em>whether either of the two weapons here involved <em>is </em>an illegal firearm as defined by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848. This issue of fact, as we have seen, went directly to the heart of plaintiff\u2019s case, and the government\u2019s defense. Neither of the weapons were introduced into evidence, or described in any detail. There is no proof or finding of one, or three, or any \u201cappraisements.\u201d There is no proof or finding of fact that either vehicle or either weapon was \u201ca contraband article.\u201d Finding of Fact I, that \u201cthe weapons * * * were seized under authority * * * of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301 et seq.,\u201d and Finding of Fact III that \u201cThe vehicles * * * were seized under authority * * * of * * * 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 781, et seq.,\u201d is a pure conclusion of law, and recites no fact to make a sufficient finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">We conclude therefore that the findings made in support of the summary judgment are not supported by the evidence ; the findings of fact must be, and are, vacated, and the judgment based thereon set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">There having been no proper forfeiture of the weapons proved, there was, on the record before us, no failure of the appellant to reasonably act to claim his rights, and no deadline affecting him was created by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">We think the kindest thing to say is that this whole proceeding is so shot through with slipshod procedures and carelessness that appellant is entitled to a new trial. We so rule. The cause is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">We take this opportunity to thank appointed counsel for appellant on his excellent performance as counsel for the indigent plaintiff, which we think is in accordance with the highest traditions of the American Bar.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-10\">. Five guns and a silencer were originally seized. Only the \u201c.410 cane shotgun\u201d and one \u201c.41 caliber chrome dueling pistol, without firing pin,\u201d are the weapons sought to be recovered by this litigation. The three other guns and the silencer have allegedly been destroyed by the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-20\">.
