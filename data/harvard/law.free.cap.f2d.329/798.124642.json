Garzot, 136 F.2d 453 (C.A.1, 1943), and from the denial by the court below of a petition for reconsideration of that order. This court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction is asserted under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 authorizing appeals to the courts of appeals from \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\"> \u201cFinality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.\u201d Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 324, 60 S.Ct. 540, 541, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940). And in 1883 the Supreme Court stated the rule that a decision is final for the purposes of appeal \u201cwhen it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.\u201d St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. R. R. v. Southern Express Co., 108 U.S. 24, 28-29, 2 S.Ct. 6, 8, 27 L.Ed. 638 (1883). This is the rule for the courts of appeals. Berman v. United States, 302 U.S. 211, 213, 58 S.Ct. 164, 82 L.Ed. 204 (1937); Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). This court, of course, adheres to the rule. See Parker v. United States, 153 F.2d 66, 69, 163 A.L.R. 379 (C.A.1, 1946). Indeed, in a comparable situation this court characterized a district court order determining liability but letting the case stand for determination of the amount thereof as an \u201cobviously unappealable interlocutory order.\u201d International Brotherhood, etc. v. W. L. Mead, Inc., 230 F.2d 576, 579 (C.A.1, 1956). See also Taylor v. Board of Education, etc., 288 F.2d 600, 602 (C.A.2, 1961), in which the court discussed the rule and said: \u201cAn order adjudging liability but-leaving the quantum of relief still to be determined has been a classic example <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of non-finality and non-appealability from the time of Chief Justice Marshall to our own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">An order will be entered dismissing this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-16\">. Section 119 of Title 28 U.S.C. constitutes Puerto Rico one judicial district, \u00a7 132 (a), id., provides that in each judicial district there shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district, \u00a7 1294(1), id., provides that appeals from reviewable decisions of the district courts shaE he taken, to the court of appeals for the circuit embracing the district, and \u00a7 41, id., places Puerto Rico in the First Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
