The case was tried to the court below upon the basis of a pre-trial stipulation, seven documentary exhibits, and portions of the deposition of one John D. O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">On July 1, 1959 Aetna executed and delivered to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad a Railroad Blanket Bond under the terms of which Aetna agreed to indemnify Boston and Maine up to $100,000 \u201cagainst any loss * * * for which the Insured is legally liable * * * through Culpable Negligence as defined in Section \u20224 on the part of, any one or more of the Employees. * * * \u201d Section 4, which is entitled \u201cDefinition of Culpable Negligence,\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201cThe words Culpable Negligence, as used in this bond, mean only gross carelessness in the performance or omission of duties, or the deliberate assumption of risk by an Employee in violation of printed or written instructions, rules or regulations of the Insured; but this bond shall not \u25a0cover (a) any loss through mistake or error of judgment in the exercise of discretion vested in an Employee, \u25a0or (b) any loss on account of injury to or death of any person or persons or damage to or destruction of property or (c) any loss through the failure properly to classify or compute freight or other charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The sole question presented is whether \"the loss which occurred to the plaintiff in the fashion hereinafter set forth was through the culpable negligence of O\u2019Connor, an \u201cEmployee\u201d of B &amp; M under the provisions of a 1948 joint facility agreement entered into between the New Haven Railroad and B &amp; M.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">The joint facility agreement permitted the plaintiff to make use of a joint freight facility at Worcester, Massachusetts, maintained by the New Haven. The agreement provided that the facility be manned and actually operated by employees of the New Haven with costs of the facility allocated according to a formula spelled out in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">During the period 1958 to 1960, the freight agent at the joint facility was O\u2019Connor, a New Haven employee for over twenty years. His duties included general supervision of the freight house and freight office, seeing to it that freight was handled properly, that freight cars were properly placed, and that freight was delivered to consignees pursuant to the terms of applicable shipping documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">One of the concerns to which freight was regularly shipped over the B &amp; M was the Gardner Beef Company. Gardner had its own siding near the freight facility. All shipments to Gardner were on order-notify bills of lading which provided for payment under the bill of lading prior to the release of any car to Gardner. Gardner, however, had posted a delivery bond in the amount of $125,-000. Under this bond it was permissible for the freight agents to release cars shipped on order-notify bills of lading without taking up the bill of lading at the time of placement on the siding, subject to two conditions: (1) that the aggregate value of shipments so placed should at no time exceed $125,000, (2) that each bill of lading should be surrendered within five days. The provision in Rule 7 of the Uniform Freight Classification made the bond inoperative if the railroad violated either of these two conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">In a letter dated August 19,1958, from one J. E. Hines of the B &amp; M Credit Bureau, O\u2019Connor was advised that Gardner was not complying with the five-day requirement on the surrender of bills of lading, and O\u2019Connor was instructed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u201cpolice this transaction very carefully.\u201d On October 22, 1958, by a letter from H. S. Harriman, Assistant Auditor of Revenue, B &amp; M, O\u2019Connor was again advised that the handling of shipments traveling to Gardner on order-notify bills of lading was \u201cvery unsatisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">O\u2019Connor \u201cshut off\u201d Gardner from receiving any additional freight in 1958 upon receipt of the letter from Hines, at which time unpaid-for shipments actually delivered to Gardner had reached a total of $195,000. After Gardner made appropriate payments, deliveries were resumed. Following receipt of the Harri-man letter, O\u2019Connor (who previous thereto had delegated to his assistants the responsibility for keeping track of the Gardner account) decided to personally police the account and thereafter he maintained a record book in which he entered the number of the car, the value of the car, and the date it was placed on Gardner\u2019s siding. From time to time O\u2019Connor \u201cshut off\u201d Gardner whenever the aggregate of unpaid freight exceeded or closely approached the sum of $125,000. Each time that this happened deliveries to Gardner were halted until it brought itself within the conditions of the bond. O\u2019Connor testified that this went on \u201cpretty steadily\u201d and that he would find out \u201cprobably every week or two weeks\u201d that Gardner had failed to comply with the conditions of the bond, at which time he would \u201cshut them off\u201d until Gardner complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In September 1960, O\u2019Connor discovered that with reference to Gardner \u201cthings were getting worse\u201d and that it owed approximately $135,000. On September 6, O\u2019Connor went to Isadore and Joseph Solomon, the two executives who operated Gardner Beef, told them that they were over their bond, and advised them that he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to have anything more to do with them until such time as they got down and wanted to operate the way they were supposed to operate.\u201d After this meeting O\u2019Connor returned to his office and called William Wedge who, according to the stipulation, was plaintiff\u2019s Regional Sales Manager in charge of freight traffic sales work for the Worcester, Fitchburg and Hol-yoke areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The introduction into evidence of that part of O\u2019Connor\u2019s deposition containing the telephone conversation with Wedge was objected to at the trial on the ground of hearsay. The lower court correctly allowed the conversation for the limited purpose of showing O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s state of mind and the condition upon which he acted subsequent to the telephone call. VI Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1729 (3d ed. 1940). Counsel stipulated that if O\u2019Connor appeared at the trial as a witness he \u201cwould testify as he has done so in this deposition and what he said is the truth to the extent it is admissible.\u201d O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony thus continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\u201cQ. You called up Wedge. A. The reason I called him was because of my shutting off this concern would result in the loss of traffic to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, and I thought he should know, and I was also pretty sure that if I notified him, he would also notify his people in Boston, and he told me that he was glad that I had called, because he said, \u2018I will call Mr. McGinnis and tell him that Solomon is coming in to see him.\u2019 The next night, about 20 minutes of 7, I got a call at home from Wedge, from Holyoke, and he said, \u2018John, I just got through talking to Mr. McGinnis, and he wants to keep these people in business until such time as he can straighten them out,\u2019 and I says, \u2018You can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he says, \u2018Well, it is out of your hands now. It is strictly my responsibility and you keep me informed so I can, in turn, keep Mr. McGinnis informed.\u2019 ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">\u201cQ. Now, after Wedge had told you that, what did you do, with reference to cars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-12\">\u201cA. Wedge told me that it was strictly his responsibility, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>says, \u2018You release these cars, and, in fact, right now, you give them three cars.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">\u201cQ. Did you? A. I said, \u2018You know he is up to $135,000.\u2019 He says, \u2018That has nothing to do with it,\u2019 so I released the three cars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">* * * * * <em>*\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjR\">Thereafter, O\u2019Connor made no attempt to keep Gardner in compliance with the terms of the $125,000 bond but he did continue to keep his running record of deliveries to and payments by Gardner and reported the status of the Gardner account to Wedge by telephoning him in Holyoke about once a week. This condition continued until about November 7, 1960, when according to O\u2019Connor \u2018things blew up,\u2019 i. e., Gardner Beef Company went into bankruptcy at this time owing order-no tify shippers of meat via B &amp; M a sum in excess of $160,000. By March 6, 1961, B &amp; M had made restitution to these shippers in an aggregate amount of over $130,000 and had conceded liability of $31,000 to one additional unpaid shipper. It then sought reimbursement from Aetna to the extent of the face of the Railroad Blanket Bond on the theory that O\u2019Connor, in acting as he did, committed culpable negligence as defined in the Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Culpable negligence, as defined in the Bond, includes two types of prohibited action. The first is \u201cgross carelessness in the performance or omission of duties,\u201d and the second is \u201cdeliberate assumption of risks by an Employee in violation of printed or written instructions. * * * \u201d To recover under the Bond, plaintiff must establish that O\u2019Connor\u2019s conduct fell within the prohibited types of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">\u201cGross carelessness\u201d is not a term common to the Massachusetts law and we have been unable to find a Massachusetts case defining its boundaries. That the term goes beyond the mere failure to use due care is obvious, but the extent of the proscribed inattentiveness is, so far, without description. Gross negligence, however, is a well-established concept in Massachusetts law. It was defined in Altman v. Aronson, 231 Mass. 588, 591, 121 N.E. 505, 506, 4 A.L.R. 1185 (1919) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">\u201csubstantially and appreciably higher in magnitude than ordinary negligence. It is materially more want of care than constitutes simple inadvertence. * * * It amounts to indifference to present legal duty and to utter forgetfulness of legal obligations so far as other persons may be affected. It is a heedless and palpable violation of legal duty respecting the rights of others. The element of culpability which characterizes all negligence is in gross negligence magnified to a high degree as compared with that present in ordinary negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">In Bagley v. Burkholder, 337 Mass. 246, 149 N.E.2d 143 (1958), it was held that to establish gross negligence the defendant\u2019s conduct must amount to an \u201caggravated degree of culpability,\u201d and in Duval v. Duval, 307 Mass. 524, 30 N.E.2d 543, 546 (1940) a \u201chigh degree of culpability and indifference to duty\u201d was deemed necessary. See also Pruzynski v. Malinowski, 338 Mass. 58, 153 N.E.2d 640 (1958); Massaletti v. Fitzroy, 228 Mass. 487, 118 N.E. 168, L.R.A.1918C, 264 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\"> Although \u201cgross carelessness\u201d is not necessarily synonymous with gross negligence, it seems to us that it goes as far as the latter in terms of the degree of departure from the standard of \u201creasonable care.\u201d It implies an indifference to consequences, a disregard of the cautions which would prevent a reasonable man from taking a specific course of action. The word \u201cgross\u201d is more than an epithet and adds to \u201ccarelessness\u201d the concept of \u201cout of all measure\u201d or \u201cbeyond allowance.\u201d See State Board of Dental Examiners v. Savelle, 90 Colo. 177, 8 P.2d 693, 82 A.L.R. 1176 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">Following receipt of the letters from Hines and Harriman, O\u2019Connor took personal charge of the Gardner account and sought to keep Gardner within the terms of its bond. On September 6, he spoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>to the Solomons and warned them that unless they operated correctly he would \u201cnot have anything more to do with them.\u201d He was determined to discontinue delivery of cars to Gardner and felt obligated to telephone Wedge so that the B &amp; M would know what was happening. But Wedge, who said he was speaking on behalf of McGinnis, the president of B &amp; M, telephoned O\u2019Connor the following evening and brushed aside O\u2019Connor\u2019s protests that the cars should not be released. Wedge said that he had just finished talking to McGinnis, who wanted to keep the Solomons in business. O\u2019Connor was told that the matter was \u201cout of your hands now\u201d and \u201cstrictly my responsibility.\u201d He was told to keep Wedge informed so that he, in turn, could keep McGinnis informed. In response to O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaint that Gardner was up to $135,000, Wedge replied \u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\u201d and O\u2019Connor was ordered to release the cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\">\u201cGross carelessness\u201d is not made \u25a0out by these facts. The release of the \u25a0cars was a breach of contract between the B &amp; M and the shippers, and an unwarranted exercise of discretion by Mc-Ginnis, but it did not constitute \u201cgross \u2022carelessness\u201d on the part of O\u2019Connor. O\u2019Connor took stringent precautions to keep Gardner in line but believed he was overruled by higher authority. Even if he could be said to be less than thorough in taking Wedge\u2019s word for what Mc-Ginnis had said, it could not be said that it was grossly careless, or that O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s actions reflected an indifference to consequences. On the contrary, he repeatedly inferred the consequences to Wedge, but his pleas of \u201cYou can\u2019t do that\u201d went unheeded. The Bond was not \u2022designed to protect B &amp; M against its employees doing what they honestly believed the president had told them to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Nor could O'Connor\u2019s action be \u25a0considered a \u201cdeliberate assumption of risk.\u201d \u201cDeliberate\u201d as used in the Bond indicates that the offending employee must be the actor. O\u2019Connor\u2019s action was \u201cdeliberate\u201d only in the sense that he knew what he was doing, but his actions were not the result of careful consideration on his part. He acted as he did because he was ordered to do so. The responsibility for releasing the cars, he was told, was to be Wedge\u2019s. O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s participation continued after his protestations to Wedge because \u201cI figured I had no right to cross Mr. McGinnis. He was the President. He was giving the orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
