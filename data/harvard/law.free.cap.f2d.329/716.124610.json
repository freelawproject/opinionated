Causes of action based on the Fourth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments were dismissed as to all defendants by Judge Metzner, pursuant to Rule 12(b) (6), F.R.Civ.P.; and plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claim, seeking relief as against defendants Lefkowitz and Siegel under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for a purported conspiracy to incarcerate them in Bellevue Hospital which had not been dismissed by Judge Metzner, subsequently was dismissed by Judge Muzphy upon defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Rule 56, F.R. Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-20\"> Defendant Lefkowitz is Attorney General, and defendant Siegel, Assistant Attorney General, of the State of New York. Insofar as plaintiffs complain of defendants\u2019 failure to investigate and act upon reports of an underworld plot to injure them, the defendants\u2019 conduct is clearly privileged as in the exercise of their official, quasi-judicial functions. Gregoire v. Biddle, 2 Cir., 177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>F.2d 579 (1949); see also Blitz v. Boog, 328 F.2d 596 (2d Cir. 1964). While plaintiffs vaguely assert that the defendants departed from the scope of their official duties in a conspiracy to incarcerate them illegally in a mental institution, Judge Murphy\u2019s award of summary judgment as to this allegation was clearly proper. Defendants\u2019 detailed affidavits, categorically denying the existence of such a conspiracy \u2014 and, in the case of defendant Lefkowitz, denying knowledge of the plaintiffs\u2019 very existence \u2014 were sufficient to require the plaintiffs to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d under the recent amendments to Rule 56(e); this they failed to do. We find that summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Judgments of dismissal affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
