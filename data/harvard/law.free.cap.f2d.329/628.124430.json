Vidal, brought this action in the District Court pursuant to the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 et seq. After-a trial before the court without a jury, the District Court, Cooper, J., dismissed the complaint in an opinion incorporating the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, reported at 220 F.Supp. 922.</p>\n<p id=\"ABVJ\">Plaintiff testified that, while engaged in sewing strips of heavy duty carpet in defendant\u2019s upholstery shop, a clamp holding together the two portipns of the carpet being sewn slipped and caused him to fall backwards, whereupon he sustained the injuries of which he eom-plains.</p>\n<p id=\"aox-dedup-0\">The District Judge found that the plaintiff failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was negligent in failing to furnish appellant either a safe place to work, sufficient assistance or proper equipment. We cannot say these findings were clearly erroneous. Neither the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>nor the District Court\u2019s prior denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case compelled any other result.</p>\n<p id=\"AlBx\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
