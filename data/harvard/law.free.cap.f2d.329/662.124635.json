No. 76,377, filed June 24, 1959, on the mai-k \u201cAIRLON\u201d for \u201cflexible foam cut to size for cushioning, mattresses, and upholstery.\u201d The first use of the mark claimed was April 9, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-26\">Petitioner-appellee, Aireloom Bedding Company, took testimony and also relies, on two registrations granted prior to appellant\u2019s date of first use, as follows: Reg. No. 568,299, Dec. 23, 1952, of <em>\u201cAireloom </em>Bedding\u201d for mattresses, box springs and bed bolsters, Principal Register; Reg. No. 570,013, Feb. 3, 1953, of <em>\u201cAirloom\u201d </em>for mattresses, box springs, and bed bolsters, excluding rubber mattresses, Principal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-27\">In addition to its registrations, appel-lee proved use and promotion of its \u201cAire-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>loom\u201d mark which the board summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s record shows that it has continuously, since about the fall of 1951, used the mark \u2018AIRE-LOOM\u2019 on and in connection with the sale of mattresses, box springs, and upholstered furniture such as sleepers, chairs, and sofas of its manufacture. The mark \u201cAIRE-LOOM\u2019 is applied to silk labels which are attached to the mattresses and box springs and to the decking under the cushions of the upholstered furniture. In addition the mark is applied to guarantee cards which are affixed to petitioner\u2019s bedding products and upholstered furniture. Petitioner has, since 1951, expended a sum in excess of one hundred and forty-five thousand dollars in advertising \u2018AIRELOOM\u2019 products through such media as radio and television, magazines, newspapers, directories, and folders of various types mailed through dealers to prospective customers. \u2018AIRELOOM\u2019 products are sold directly to department stores, furniture stores, and decorator shops located primarily throughout eleven Western States. Sales of \u2018AIRELOOM\u2019 mattresses and box springs exceeded sixty thousand dollars for the fiscal year 1951 and approximated a half million dollars for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1961.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Appellant has presented its case for reversal of the board as involving two issues: (1) whether, in view of the differences in the marks, the board erred in finding likelihood of confusion; and (2) whether the board erred in considering evidence relating to use of appellant's \u201cAIRLON\u201d mark in association with finished mattresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Assuming, arguendo, that the marks of both parties are applied to mattresses, that is to say to identical goods, we have no doubt about the correctness of the board\u2019s holding that confusion as to the origin of the products sold under the marks \u201cis reasonably likely to occur\u201d by reason of the similarity of the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">On the second point, appellant argues that the lower tribunal made an unlawful and unjustified excursion into the \u201ctrade practices\u201d of appellant instead of restricting itself to the goods named in the registration. The gist of the argument is that appellant\u2019s goods consist of \u201cfoam cut to size\u201d and do not include mattresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Appellant made similar arguments before the board. They were held to be not well taken for several reasons. The description of goods, noted above, is not merely foam cut to size but cut to size for particular purposes, among others, \u201cfor * * * mattresses * * At least that is one way to read the description of goods. Appellee seems to ask us to read that description as designating mattresses per se. There seems to be some ambiguity but we doubt the latter is a correct reading. We need not resolve this problem. One of the speci-ments accompanying appellants application to register the mark sought to be cancelled is a rectangular label on which are the words</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">\u201cEnglander</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">THE FINEST NAME IN SLEEP AIRLON\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">The label appears to be a mattress label and was submitted as \u201cshowing the trademark, as actually used in connection with its goods,\u201d meaning the goods named in the application and registration. There is also in the application file another label which reads</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">\u201cEnglander</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">Airlon</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-15\">MATTRESS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-16\">THE FINEST NAME IN SLEEP\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acl-dedup-1\">Appellant\u2019s only comments about this label are that while it is in the file nobody knows how it got there and that it is this label which \u201cgot the Patent Office off on the wrong track.\u201d It seems to us to be sufficient, however, to remove any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>doubt about the first label above noted being a mattress label and to show that the manner of use of the registered mark in connection with at least some of the goods named in the registration is to apply it to mattresses containing \u201cflexible foam cut to size for * * * mattresses,\u201d that being the way in which those goods are marketed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\"> The board was quite right, in our judgment, in saying that the question of likelihood of confusion cannot be determined in a vacuum but must be based on facts as they appear in the marketplace. There is ample additional evidence of record to show that the foregoing uses of the \u201cAIRLON\u201d mark were not exceptional and that its use on mattresses extended into retail stores where appellee\u2019s witnesses saw it. It seems to us that appellant is asking us to restrict the plain import of its registration in an unrealistic manner and to pretend that it is not used in connection with mattresses at all? but merely on foam which might be sold', to mattress manufacturers, a different group than the purchasers of mattresses.. The record fails to support this position.. The evidence shows that appellant\u2019s manner of using the registered mark in connection with the sale of goods enumerated? in the registration carries it into the-same channels of trade, on the same-goods, and before the same potential purchasers as those where appellee\u2019s registered marks appear. Appellant took no-testimony to show the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Both of the issues posed by appellant, on this appeal are, for the foregoing reasons, decided against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The decision of the board is affirmed..</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
