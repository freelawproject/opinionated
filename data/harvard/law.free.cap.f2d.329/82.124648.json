The dispositive question is whether the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court in Fawcett Publications, Inc. v. Morris, 377 P.2d 42, has made the joinder of the co-defendant Mid-Continent News Company fraudulent in law so as to now vest complete diversity jurisdiction in the federal court. The Morris ease, the case at bar, and eleven other pending eases all arise from a single identical factual incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">In March, 1958, Fawcett Publications, Inc., published in its magazine <em>True </em>an article entitled \u201cThe Pill That Can Kill Sports\u201d wherein reference was made to the 1956 University of Oklahoma varsity football team. Alleging the article to be libelous per se, thirteen members of the Oklahoma team, each being a citizen of that state, filed separate actions for damages in the Oklahoma state court naming Fawcett, a foreign corporation, and Mid-Continent as co-defendants.. Mid-Continent is a Delaware corporation with principal place of business located in Oklahoma City and is a distributor of <em>True </em>and other magazines. An attempt at that time by the co-defendants, to remove the actions to federal court failed, it appearing that each plaintiff and the defendant Mid-Continent, since its principal place of business was at. Oklahoma City, were citizens of Oklahoma, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(c), and that plaintiffs were each seeking a joint judgment against the co-defendants. The orders of remand were entered and the actions were severally returned to the jurisdiction of the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The Morris case proceeded to trial before a state district court sitting with a jury. At the conclusion of the evidence-the trial judge instructed the jury to-return a verdict against Fawcett leaving only the amount of damages to be determined. The trial court also directed a verdict in favor of the co-defendant Mid-Continent. The jury returned a verdict for $75,000 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in favor of plaintiff Morris and against defendant Fawcett. Both Fawcett and Morris appealed the judgment to the Oklahoma Supreme-Court, Morris\u2019 appeal being limited to a claim of error in the trial judge\u2019s directed verdict in favor of Mid-Continent. The Oklahoma high court affirmed the-judgment in all respects, 337 P.2d 42,. and its judgment is now final as it. affects Mid-Continent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is against, this background of the Morris case that the co-defendants in the case at bar bottomed their instant petition for removal and upon which, after pertinent inquiries made of counsel at a hearing, the federal district court based its denial of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel were also plaintiff\u2019s, counsel in the Morris case. As indicated by the .noted colloquy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>court and counsel occurring at the hearing on motion to remand, the court concluded that plaintiff Dodd\u2019s evidence affecting the liability of Mid-Continent would have the same legal substance as that given in the Morris case and that the non-liability of Mid-Continent had thus been judicially established to that extent. And upon appeal, present plaintiff\u2019s argument in opposition to the ruling of the court is largely the same as advanced in the noted discussion in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The determination of the non-liability of Mid-Continent made in the Morris case cannot be applied in the case at bar under either the doctrine of res judicata or estoppel, for, as plaintiff Dodd properly asserts, the eases lack identity of parties. In fact, the judgment in the Morris ease, as such, is in no way binding upon the parties in this action. However, the law of Oklahoma as determined in the Morris case is binding upon the federal court not only in this case but in any diversity case. Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188. And, although, as plaintiff Dodd again correctly contends, the opinion in Morris does not spell out the liability of a distributor of magazines containing libelous matter, nevertheless the case does determine that Mid-Continent was not liable under the evidence produced in that case. Whatever the liability of a magazine distributor may be in Oklahoma such liability is not established by evidence having only the legal substance contained in Morris. To such extent Morris is pertinent to and binding upon the federal court in the instant case and the trial court did not err in so holding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>In many cases, removability can be determined by the original pleadings and normally the statement of a cause of action against the resident defendant will suffice to prevent removal. But upon specific allegations of fraudulent joinder the court may pierce the pleadings, Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. v. Cockrell, 232 U.S. 146, 34 S.Ct. 278, 58 L.Ed. 544; Nunn v. Feltinton, 5 Cir., 294 F.2d 450; Morris v. E. I. DuPont DeNemours &amp; Co., 8 Cir., 68 F.2d 788, consider the entire record, and determine the basis of joinder by any means available, McLeod v. Cities Serv. Gas Co., 10 Cir., 233 F.2d 242. The joinder of a resident defendant against whom no cause of action is stated is patent sham, Parks v. New York Times Co., 5 Cir., 308 F.2d 474, and though a cause of action be .stated, the joinder is similarly fraudulent if in fact no cause of action exists, Lobato v. Pay Less Drug Stores, Inc., 10 Cir., 261 F.2d 406. This does not mean that the federal court will pre-try, as a matter of course, doubtful issues of fact to determine removability; the issue must be capable of summary determination and be proven with complete certainty. McLeod v. Cities Serv. Gas Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Applying these rules to the case at bar it seems clear that the trial court properly refused to remand. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has judicially determined that unreeited but specific proof occurring in the Morris case was insufficient to impose liability upon Mid-Continent. Without material addition that same proof appears with complete certainty to be the sole basis of present plaintiff\u2019s claim against the same defendant in a case having identical origin. Mid-Continent\u2019s non-liability is thus established as both a matter of fact and law, and its continued joinder serves only to frustrate federal jurisdiction. In such case the joinder is fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Finally, appellant contends that to retain jurisdiction in the federal \u2022court is, in effect, \u201csaying that this Appellant, or plaintiffs in companion cases, cannot <em>possibly </em>produce sufficient evidence on trial of the cases to establish liability against [Mid-Continent] * * (Emphasis added.) This court is, of course, not concerned with possibilities that discord with the record. The trial court had the power to compel appellant to disclose his evidence affecting Mid-Continent\u2019s liability, see Berger v. Brannan, 10 Cir., 172 F.2d 241, cert. denied, 337 U.S. 941, 69 S.Ct. 1519, 93 L.Ed. 1746; Holcomb v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., 10 Cir., 255 F.2d 577, and we consider the legal effect of such evidence only.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">.

They are bound to know they were selling it. Would that add any strength to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201cMr. Grove: Your Honor, I don\u2019t know whether it would actually add much to the lawsuit but it would show it is a continuing thing with them. I think what we have in the first case is enough so that this Court would know there was no fraudulent joinder of defendants. That is the thing I am concerned about, and I think the Court is concerned with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u201cThe Court: There is not fraudulent joinder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">\u201cMr. Grove: That is right. Your Hon- or, I frankly haven\u2019t been estopped by judgment or res judicata because you have before this Court at this time the very same petition of the plaintiff that the Court had to review before, and pursuant to the authorities which his Honor cited in the Opinions which he had written in these cases before, and another case I had up there, that was comparable wherein the Court can look only to the petition to determine whether or not there is one cause of action and/or fraudulent joinder, under those actions, Your Honor, and the evidence that is in this case-made, X submit that these matters are properly in the state court and should be remanded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\"><em>\"* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">\u201cThe Court: I imagine Midcontinent is an agent because they\u2019d be liable other\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay2\">\u201cMr. Grove: Yes, sir. I think the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma, without ever saying so in words, held Mid-continent to be an agent. At least my interpretation of their opinion is that they held Midcontinent to be an agent of Faw-cett Publications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7M\">\u201cThe Court: Aren\u2019t you in effect arguing that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma was wrong under the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7B7\">\u201cMr. Grove: Yes, sir, I sure am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARX\">\u201cThe Court: I can\u2019t see any difference in the evidence even if you showed that there was a retail outlet. I don\u2019t think that makes any difference because if there was \u2014 -was notice, knowledge under the rule that the Oklahoma Court followed, that wouldn\u2019t add anything to the notice or knowledge because it seems to me that you are relying on what was in the newspapers, and the evidence there was that the man read the newspapers and that he was aware of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-18\">.
