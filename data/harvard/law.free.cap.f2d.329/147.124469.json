After some disagreement as to the terms of a submission, the following text was agreed on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">\u201cUnder the terms and provisions of the current labor agreement and other written agreements, does the Company have the right to schedule and require employees to work sufficient and reasonable amounts of overtime and to discipline individual employees for refusing to work such overtime ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">The arbitrator\u2019s award was couched in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">\u201cUnder the terms and provisions of the current Labor Agreement and other written agreements, the Company has the right to schedule and require employees to work sufficient and reasonable amounts of overtime and to discipline individual employees for refusing to work such overtime, unless in any particular instance the individual employee has a justifiable, valid reason to excuse him from working the required overtime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">The union moved in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to vacate the award on grounds of partiality, bias, etc, and because the arbitrator exceeded the terms of the submission. The District Court, Irving Ben Cooper, District Judge, denied the motion and the union appeals. We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">The claim appears technical in the extreme that the arbitrator, who might have answered the question submitted simply \u201cyes\u201d could not, out of an apparent excess of caution, add the limitation for the benefit of the employees, not objected to by the employer, \u201cunless in any particular instance the individual employee has a justifiable, valid reason to excuse him from working the required overtime.\u201d Any bizarre application of the ruling in individual cases is of course subject to the review provided in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
