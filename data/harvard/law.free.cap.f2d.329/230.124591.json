His employment was terminated, and this action was reviewed by the courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then claimed reemployment rights. This claim was denied, the final administrative action being taken in March, 1956. The present suit, seeking review of that action, was filed in February, 1960. Several considerations dictate affirmance of the judgment of the District Court. First, the denial of reemployment rights occurred before the suit which terminated in the decision of this court in Harshaw v. Hollister was filed. The issue could have been litigated in that proceeding. Second, the doctrine of laches applies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-14\">. Harshaw v.
