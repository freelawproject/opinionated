The manufacturer relied upon a printed \u201ccondition\u201d included in certain papers which it alleged were part of the contract. The \u201ccondition\u201d limited the seller\u2019s liability for defective material to the contract price. The defendant maintained that the papers containing the limitation of liability were not a part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-18\">There is no dispute as to what papers passed between the parties or as to the provisions they contained; the controversy is solely as to the legal conclusion to be drawn from the undisputed facts. The District Court concluded that the limitation of liability was a part of the contract, and accordingly dismissed the counterclaim for damages resulting from the defects. However, it granted a credit to the defendant for the purchase price of the defective material.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-19\">We agree with the court\u2019s reasons, which are set forth in a full and satisfactory opinion, and need not be repeated. 226 F.Supp. 842. The judgment in favor of the plaintiff is</p>\n<p id=\"b207-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
