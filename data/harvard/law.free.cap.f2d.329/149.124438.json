The complaint goes on to state that the taxpayer was convicted of the first charge, but was acquitted of conspiracy, and that notice of a federal tax lien was filed against her in September, 1959, for excise taxes assessed on the distilled spirits iixvolved in the conspiracy \u2014 a much larger amount than was involved in the possession count. Further allegation is made that the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service demanded payment of the assessed taxes and threatened foreclosux-e of the tax lien by sale of the taxpayer\u2019s home and farm, a consequence which, according to the taxpayex*, would deprive her of her main source of income and sustenance and leave her \u201cutterly destitute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-21\">In her claim for an injunction the taxpayer invokes the \u201cgeneral equity jurisdiction\u201d of the federal court. She asserts, that the tax sought to be collected is \u201cclearly illegal,\u201d that the prospect of' severe economic hardship constitutes the-type of special and extraordinary circumstances recognizable by a court of equity, and that there is no adequate remedy at law. These contentions are advanced despite the statutory prohibition contained in section 7421(a) of the Internal Rev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>enue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7421 (a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1eY\">\u201cExcept as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c) and 6213(a), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqvn\"> While it is true that courts in the past have exercised their equitable powers in situations where the taxpayer has made a clear showing both that the tax is illegal and that special circumstances exist,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has recently ruled that an injunction against collection of a tax can be granted only where \u201cit is clear that under no circumstances can the Government ultimately prevail,\u201d even if a refund suit is an inadequate remedy \u201cbecause collection would cause an irreparable injury, such as the ruination of the taxpayer\u2019s enterprise.\u201d Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Nav. Co., 370 U.S. 1, 6-7, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 1129, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962). Thus, even though the complaint alleges hardship and oppression, it is inadequate to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on the court unless it appears that \u201cunder the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim.\u201d Id. at 7 of 370 U.S., at 1129 of 82 S.Ct., 8 L.Ed.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"A1zc\">Relying upon the case of Coffey v. United States, 116 U.S. 436, 6 S.Ct. 437, 29 L.Ed. 684 (1886), and its holding that an acquittal in a criminal case is conclusive in later civil actions based upon the same acts and facts, the taxpayer argues that the tax sought to be collected is illegal because it is an attempt to impose a penalty for a criminal offense of which she stands acquitted. The court below disagreed, concluding that reliance on Coffey was misplaced because it has been \u201cseriously impaired\u201d as authority and, thus, the standard of Enochs had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"AoU\"> The legality of the tax is not automatically undermined because the assessment followed acquittal of a crime. \u201cThat acquittal on a criminal charge is not a bar to a civil action by the Government, remedial in its nature, arising out of the same facts on which the criminal proceeding was based has long been settled.\u201d Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 397, 58 S.Ct. 630, 632, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938). Thus, the Coffey doctrine, much criticized by lower courts, but never expressly repudiated by the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is limited to those situations where the Government seeks to impose a punishment which, though civil in form, is penal in nature and is based upon the same facts as the criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ours is not a case where Coffey, if it still survives, might be applicable. A tax on distilled spirits is not a penalty, but is imposed on the commodity irrespective of the legality of its origin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Collection of such a tax would thus be \u201cremedial\u201d and not punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"AsX\">Accordingly, the District Court correctly concluded that it was without jurisdiction to grant the injunctive relief and that the complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"Af0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ayi-dedup-0\">.
