He graduated from the law school and was admitted to the bar in Ohio. Thereafter, he continued to work for the same employers. The deduction was claimed as an ordinary and necessary business expense of carrying on a trade or business under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">We regard the issue in this case as one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">The Tax Court found that taxpayer\u2019s primary purpose in enrolling in the law school was to qualify to meet the minimum standards of the legal profession and not to improve or maintain skills required or used by him in his employment. See Section 1.162-5 of Treasury Regulations on Income (1954 Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">We think there was substantial evidence including inferences properly deducible therefrom to support this finding of fact. In our judgment, it was not clearly erroneous. It is binding upon us. Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">The decision of the Tax Court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
