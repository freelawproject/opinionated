MOORE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AHh\">Plaintiffs-appellants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and defendant-appellee are \u201cconverters\u201d of textiles. Their businesses consist generally of purchasing uncolored cloth or greige goods, arranging to have the greige goods dyed or printed with ornamental designs, and selling the goods as thus processed to ladies garment manufacturers and other users.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Appellants brought this action for in-junctive relief and for damages arising out of appellee\u2019s infringement of a textile print design for which appellants had obtained a copyright. Appellee consented to summary judgment and a permanent injunction was entered in appellants\u2019 favor. The critical problem presented on this appeal is whether the measure of recovery under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b), is \u201ccumulative,\u201d encompassing both net profits of the in-fringer and damages of the copyright holder, or \u201calternative,\u201d allowing either profits or damages, whichever is greater. Closely allied is the question of the purpose and design of the \u201cin lieu of\u201d clause in relation to the rest of \u00a7 101(b). That section provides that any person who infringes the copyright in any work protected under the copyright law shall be liable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201c(b) Damages and profits; * * * To pay to the copyright proprietor such damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as all the profits which the infringer shall have made from such infringement, * * * or in lieu of actual damages and profits, such damages as to the court shall appear to be just * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The District Court, pursuant to Rule 53, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, referred the determination of appellants\u2019 recovery to a Special Master. The Master found that appellee\u2019s net profit from the sale of 78,492\u00bc yards of the infringing fabric was $6,464.09. Further, adopting the \u201ccumulative\u201d theory, the Master calculated that appellants\u2019 sales would have increased by the amount of yardage sold by appellee, and that at their profit margin of eleven cents per yard appellants were damaged to the extent of $8,683.65. In so calculating the damage element of the \u201ccumulative\u201d award, the Master reasoned that since appellants had a lawful monopoly, it was reasonably probable that but for the infringing sales an equal number of sales would have accrued to them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, this conclusion was merely an assumption and was not supported by any proof whatsoever. Cf. Fruit of the Loom, Inc. v. Andris Fabrics, Inc., S.D.N.Y., 227 F. Supp. 977. Indeed, appellants professed their inability to prove sales lost due to the infringement, declining to offer \u201cevidence of supposition, opinions and all that business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">The District Court rejected the Master\u2019s recommendation to the extent that the Court disallowed the $8,683.65 award of appellants\u2019 damages. The Court thought that the question of whether copyright damages were \u201calternative\u201d or \u201ccumulative\u201d was entirely academic since in any event appellants had offered no proof to justify the damage element of a \u201ccumulative\u201d award. However, in limiting appellants to appellee\u2019s net profits, the Court did not consider the propriety of awarding statutory damages under the \u201cin lieu of\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">The language of \u00a7 101(b) is reasonably plain. As a practical matter it may be divided into two related parts: the first proviso permits the recovery of proven damages and profits; the second, or \u201cin lieu of\u201d clause, allows \u201cthe owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of a copyright some recompense for injury done him, in a case where the rules of law render difficult or impossible proof of damages or discovery of profits.\u201d Douglas v. Cunningham, 294 U.S. 207, 209, 55 S.Ct. 365, 366, 79 L.Ed. 862 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The statutory language \u201cdamages * * * as well as all the profits which the infringer shall have made,\u201d would seem to contemplate a \u201ccumulative\u201d recovery. However, confusion has been engendered by the House Report accompanying the bill which indicated that the drafters envisioned recovery in the alternative in a manner similar to that under the Patent Statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although this theory has met with judicial approval,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Supreme Court in F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc., 344 U.S. 228, 73 S.Ct. 222, 97 L.Ed. 276 (1952), holding that the Trial Court had discretion to grant recovery under the \u201cin lieu of\u201d clause where plaintiff had shown the amount of the infringer\u2019s profits, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201c[A] rule of liability which merely takes away the profits from an infringement would offer little discouragement to infringers. It would fall short of an effective sanction for enforcement of the copyright policy. The statutory rule, formu-Iated after long experience, not merely compels restitution of profit and reparation for injury but also is designed to discourage wrongful conduct.\u201d 344 U.S. at 233, 73 S.Ct. at 225, 97 L.Ed. 276.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">The \u201ccumulative\u201d recovery and not the \u201calternative\u201d would therefore seem to be appropriate under \u00a7 101(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">Although we are cognizant of the onerous burden of proof placed on the holder of an infringed copyright, particularly where he must show as damages loss of sales and perhaps good will, we agree with the District Court that the assumption by the Special Master of identical sales by plaintiff, unsupported by proof, is not permissible as a basis for an award of damages. It may well be that in some cases the formula adopted by the Special Master will be entirely appropriate. But in this case, as the District Court noted, the evidence indicated that the parties sold fabric of different quality at different prices in what appeared to be a different market. Common sense suggests that a converter who sells his copyrighted fabric for use in the relatively few copies of an expensive dress cannot reasonably expect to sell the same number of yards as the infringer who caters to the bargain basement market. Without some supporting evidence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>conclusion that a copyright holder is deemed to be deprived of his profit on the total sales made by the infringer falls outside the \u201cconsiderable latitude in speculation\u201d sometimes necessary in these cases. Gross v. Van Dyk Gravure Co., supra, 230 F. at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">If the only theory of recovery contemplated by the statute were premised on proof of actual damages and the infringer\u2019s profits, we would be compelled to affirm the Trial Court\u2019s limitation of its award to appellee\u2019s net profits. However, the statute anticipates precisely that situation which plagued appellants here by empowering the Trial Court, in its discretion, \u201cin lieu of actual damages and profits\u201d to award damages as appear just. See F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc., supra, 344 U.S. at 234, 73 S.Ct. at 226, 97 L.Ed. 276; Douglas v. Cunningham, supra; Ball, op. cit. supra, \u00a7 275. Since the statute is clear that lack of proof of damages and profits does not preclude the recovery of a larger amount where warranted, we hold that it was error for the Trial Court not to consider as within its discretion the propriety of a statutory award, if any, for damages suffered even though incapable of exact proof in addition to the actual profits shown to have been made by the infringer. The F. W. Woolworth case is plain that proof of one element of the award does not, as appellee contends, curtail the exercise of discretion under the \u201cin lieu of\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We see no error in the award of counsel fees, a matter largely within the Trial Court\u2019s discretion. See Orgel v. Clark Boardman Co., 301 F.2d 119, 112 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 817, 83 S.Ct. 31, 9 L.Ed.2d 58 (1962) ; B &amp; B Auto Supply, Inc. v. Plesser, 205 F.Supp. 36, 41 (S.D.N.Y.1962). And, under these circumstances, it was not error to split the Special Master\u2019s fee between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Reversed and remanded so that upon such remand the District Court may consider an award, if any, of such damages as to the Court shall appear to be just.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\">.
