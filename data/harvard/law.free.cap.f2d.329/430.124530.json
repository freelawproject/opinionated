F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Riley v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 428 [No. 20064, February 13, 1964], [CCH 1964 Stand.Fed.Tax Rep. (64-1 U.S. Tax Cas.) par. 9254].</p>\n<p id=\"b485-18\">Taxpayer has been in the residential construction business since 1937. He buys unimproved realty, subdivides the land into residential lots, builds houses on the lots, and sells the houses together with the lots to <em>the </em>general public. His building and selling activities<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from 1952 through 1957 resulted in the sale of 128 houses. The 41 lots sold to a single purchaser <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in 1954 which are here involved spring from Taxpayer\u2019s subdividing of a 14-acre tract of unimproved land purchased in 1953. By September of 1953 he had water lines and taps installed on 20 of the lots; by October he had sewers installed; in November he had curbs, gutters, paving and street excavations completed. Sales were slow because of an inability of potential purchasers to finance new homes, resulting from an increase in mortgage rates, and by December only 7 of the 20 completed houses had been sold. Taxpayer then found a purchaser for the 41 lots on which no homes had been built. The terms of the sale are not important except as part of the deal Taxpayer agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>to and did install, in addition to improvements already in existence, water lines and taps, sewer lines, and additional paving. Despite an asserted need to ease up on business activities as the result of medical advice, Taxpayer wildcatted for oil in Oklahoma and engaged in other house construction as a partner during the balance of 1954. From the viewpoint of substance, the only difference was that houses were not being sold. There was nothing to compel the trier to conclude that, as to these lots, Taxpayer had changed character from a real estate subdivider. Under these circumstances, the District Court was justified in holding that the lots were held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-11\">.
