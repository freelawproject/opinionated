At the time this permission was granted an existing ordinance of the town provided that \u201c in case any person or persons shall desire to lay a private sewer through any street or portion of a street in which there is no public sewer, he or they must first obtain written permission from the commission, which permission .shall be subject to the following condition (whether the same \u2022be specified in the written permit or not), to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201c 1. That the license to lay such sewer be revocable by the \u2022commission at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">On June 27th, 1899, the commission (the municipal body) passed an ordinance revoking the permission to lay the private \u2022sewer granted to the prosecutor and his associates, and subsequently provided for the construction of a public sewer in its place. Due notice of the intended passage of this ordinance was given to the prosecutor and all others interested in the subject-matter thereof, and a public hearing had.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The prosecutor now seeks to set aside the ordinance of June 27th, on the ground that the commission was without power to revoke the license which it had granted to lay the private sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">By section 8 of \u201cAn act to incorporate the Hackensack Improvement Commission,\u201d approved April 1st, 1868, authority is conferred upon the commission to l\u00e1y sewers through the \u2022various streets within its limits; but it is at least doubtful \u2022whether under this charter provision the commission had power to license the prosecutor and his associates to lay a <em>private </em>sewer in one of the public streets of the town. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>12 <em>Stew. Eq. </em>569.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Assuming, however, the existence of the power, the granting of such a license is necessarily revocable (even when the \u2022right to revoke is not expressly reserved) whenever the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>good requires it, and of this the municipality is the sole judge. Much more is such a license revocable when, as in this case, the power is expressly reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The ordinance under review is affirmed, with costs to the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
