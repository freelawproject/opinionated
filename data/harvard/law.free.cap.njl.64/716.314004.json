J.\u201d\u2014 the house so referred to was, and thence until the fire continued to be, used as a combined store and dwelling and not as a simple dwelling?</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b751-9\"><em>Second. </em>Was said policy forfeited or made void by reason of the fact that at the time the same was purchased ^ portion of the property covered thereby was encumbered by the chattel mortgage given by Kate Dougherty to Ludwig Baumann, provided that at the time such policy was purchased the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u2022sured had neither notice nor knowledge of the existence of such mortgage?</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b752-4\">Being in doubt as to the above questions, I hereby certify .the same to be argued at the bar of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b752-5\">Dated January 18th, 1898.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b752-6\">B.

Co., April 23, 1892. _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-17\">\u201cThis insurance is transferred to cover similar property contained in the frame dwelling-house, No. 211 Delaware street, Elizabeth, N. J.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-18\">\u201c \u00a5m. Adams,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-19\">\n<em>\u201cAsst. Sec\u2019y.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The effect of this endorsement, in our judgment, was this: The original insurance ceased upon the removal of the furniture, but the contract to insure was revived and renewed upon the property in its newly-described location for the consideration originally paid and for the unexpired term. It became \u25a0exactly equivalent to a new policy on the property in the locality described in the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Upon the removal of this furniture the insured opened, and \u2022thereafter continued to keep, a <em>\u201c </em>store \u201d in the front room of the first floor of the building, and the rest of the building was used by him as the <em>\u201c </em>dwelling-house \u201d of himself and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The legal question presented is not affected by the fact that the premium paid was for a risk to the furniture in a building occupied as a store and dwelling, and therefore no increased hazard calling for any greater premium was incurred by its transfer to the new building similarly occupied. For if the description \u201c contained in the frame' dwelling-house, No. 211 Delaware street,\u201d <em>ex m termini, </em>excludes any other use of the building than as a dwelling, it is a warranty against any such use, and for falsity of that warranty the contract would be void, although no injury was thereby done to the insurer. <em>Dewees </em>v. <em>Manhattan Insurance Co., </em>6 <em>Vroom </em>366.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Many forms of policies of insurance contain, either in references to the application or in the statement of peculiar hazards, sufficient notice to the insured that a description excluding hazardous uses would avoid the contract, and if this contract \u00a1gave any indication that property was insured in a building in which a store was kept, at an increased premium, as for a more hazardous risk, it might perhaps be contended that the insured avoided his policy by concealing a material fact. But we find no provisions in this policy relating to this particular increase of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">There are cases in which the description is not necessarily false, so as to avoid the contract as matter of law, but the question, rather, is whether, as applied to the facts, it is in fact false, or only partial and incomplete, like that contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>in a somewhat similar policy considered by this court in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>State Insurance Co., </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>485. Such cases-are probably confined to descriptions where the undisclosed use is not incompatible with the described use, such as billiard-rooms in a building occupied as a boarding-house, a. dentist\u2019s room in a dwelling-house, or janitor\u2019s apartments in a banking-house.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AO-C\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>Edward A. &amp; William T. Day.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A5S\">For the defendant in error, <em>Sherrerd Depue </em>and <em>Richard V. Lindabury.</em></attorneys>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">If the description before us were \u201c contained in the dwelling-house in which he resides,\u201d or similar description, we think such a case would be presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">But description of the place as the frame dwelling-house,. No. 211 Delaware street, in our judgment, amounts to an assertion that the building bearing that number was in use as a dwelling-house, and not used for any purpose incompatible therewith. The use of part of the building as a grocery store was an inconsistent and incompatible use with that described.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The result is that the first question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">As this result will require a new trial, and upon such trial the undisputed facts will necessitate a nonsuit, it seems unnecessary to deal with the second question, which is by no means free from difficulty.</p>\n<author id=\"b754-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">The issue in this action was once tried in the Union county Circuit, and upon a rule to show cause why a new trial should not be granted the Circuit Court certified certain questions to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, in response, advised that the rule to show cause should be made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">Upon the next trial the Circuit Court followed the opinion-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>of the Supreme Court and nonsuited the plaintiff. That is the sole error urged against the judgment now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">We think the nonsuit was rightly granted, for the reasons stated in the-opinion in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014Magie (Chancellor), Garrison, Lippincott, Gummere, Ludlow, Bogert, Adams. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014Collins, Hendrickson, Vredenburgh, Voorhees. 4.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
