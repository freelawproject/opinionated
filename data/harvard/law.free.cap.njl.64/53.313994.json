Baker, whereby the said locomotive engine of the said Charles L. Baker was then and there overturned and said Charles L. Baker thereby then and there killed. By reason of the premises a right of action did then and there accrue to the personal representative of the said Charles L.

And whereas, also, before the making of the promise and undertaking of the said defendant hereinafter next mentioned, to wit, on the thirteenth day of March, A. D. eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, to wit, in the township of Mansfield, in the county of Warren aforesaid, one Charles E.

Baker, an action at law to be brought within one year from his said death against the said defendant, for the death of the said Charles L.,Baker, for the benefit of plaintiff, his widow, and the next of kin of the said Charles L. Baker. And thereupon the said defendant afterwards, to wit, on the first.day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>May, in the year last aforesaid, at the township of Mansfield aforesaid, in consideration that the said plaintiff would not bring, as administratrix of said Charles L. Baker, suit against the said defendant for the death of the said Charles L. Baker as aforesaid, within the said one year from the day of his death, undertook and faithfully promised the said plaintiff that he, the said defendant, would pay to her henceforth, to wit, from the day of the death of the said Charles L. Baker, during her natural life and widowhood, the sum of fifty dollars a month, payable each and every month during said time, which proposition the said plaintiff did then and there accept. And the said plaintiff avers that she, confiding in the said-promise and undertaking of the' said defendant, did accordingly forbear to bring suit as administratrix of said Charles L. Baker as aforesaid, for the benefit of herself as his widow and his next of kin, within one year from the day of his death as aforesaid, and plaintiff avers that she has been since the death of the said Charles L. Baker and is now his widow, and that the said defendant did perform and keep their said promise and undertaking with the said plaintiff until the month of September, A. d. eighteen hundred and ninety-eight. Since which time the said defendant has not performed, fulfilled and kept their said promise and undertaking as aforesaid, to wit, at the township of Mansfield aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">\u201cAnd whereas, also, the said defendant heretofore, to wit, oh the eighth day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, in the county of Warren aforesaid, was indebted to the plaintiff in five hundred dollars, for the price and value of goods sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant at their request; and in like sum of money for the price and value of goods bargained and sold by the plaintiff to the defendant at their request; and in like sum of money for the price and value of work done, and materials for the same provided by the plaintiff for the defendant at their request; and in like sum of money for money lent by the plaintiff to the defendant at their request; and in the like sum of money for money received by the defendant at their request; and in like sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>money for money received by tlie defendant for the use of the plaintiff; and in the like sum of money for money paid by the plaintiff for the use of the defendant at their request; and in the like sum of money for interest due from the defendant to the plaintiff for the plaintiff\u2019s having forborne moneys due from the defendant to the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s request, for a long time then elapsed; and in the like sum of money for money found to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff on an account then and there stated between them; and in the like sum of money for the prevention of litigation by the plaintiff against the defendant at their request; and in the like sum of money for the forbearance of litigation by the plaintiff against the defendant at their request, and the defendant afterwards, to wit, on the day and year last aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, in consideration of the premises, respectfully promised to pay the said several last-mentioned moneys respectively to the plaintiff on request, yet the said defendant not regarding their said several promises and undertakings, but contriving and fraudulently intending craftily and subtilely to deceive and defraud the said plaintiff in this behalf, hath not paid the several sums of money herein mentioned before, or any part thereof, to the said plaintiff, although the said defendant was often requested so to do; but the defendant to do this hath hitherto wholly refused, and still refuses; wherefore the said plaintiff says that she is injured and hath sustained damages to the amount of five hundred dollars, and therefore brings suit, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">\u201c Sir\u2014Please to take notice, that the following is a specification of the causes of demurrer to the first and second counts of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration in the above-named cause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\"><em>\u201c </em>(Ms <em>to First Count.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">\u00abI.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">\u201c It fails to disclose a legal consideration for the contract sued on, in that,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201c 1.

The second count states that she claimed to have, as administratrix of her husband, an action at law for his death. The fact that she was at any time his personal representative is therefore not established by the demurrer. Indeed, one of the causes for demurrer specified by the defendant is that neither count of the declaration contains any allegation that the plaintiff was, at the time of the alleged promise, or at any time within one year, the administratrix of her husband. This being so, I can see no reason for sustaining this demurrer. The <em>narr. </em>discloses a cause of action under the Death act. The promise of the widow not to bring a suit in a capacity that she did not possess was a legal injury to no one. Whether there was any substantial benefit to the defendant in such a promise, is immaterial. There was a possible detriment to the plaintiff, and that is consideration enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The demurrer should be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
