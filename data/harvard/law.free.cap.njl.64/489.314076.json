The-complaint complied in all respects with the requirements of the pertinent statute approved March 25th, 1885 <em>(Gen. Stat., p. </em>1534), and of the rules of the police department, but the-board refused to entertain it, on the ground that it involved-a criminal offence, and therefore \u201cas a matter of right to the-policeman \u201d the offence must first be passed on by the grand jury, before the board had authority to consider the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">The relator now asks for a <em>mandamus </em>commanding the-board to hear, try and determine the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Under the Fire and Police act of May 2d, 1885 <em>(Gen. Stat., p. </em>1551), the board is \u201centrusted with the government, control and management of the police department,\u201d and has-\u201cfull power and right to suspend -and to expel or discharge any person employed or appointed in or under the department * * * provided good cause shall be shown for such suspension, expulsion or discharge after an investigation by such board.\u201d The trust thus confided, the power thus-delegated, carries with it a corresponding duty to exercise the power in all proper cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">The complaint of the relator appears to us to have stated a proper case. It charged an abuse by the policeman of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>official power which he possessed for the protection of persons- and the upholding of law. It charged a course of conduct which, if generally pursued by police officers, would defeat the end for which their department of government is-organized. If proved, good cause would be shown for the-suspension or expulsion of the delinquent, within the meaning of the statute. That his conduct might likewise involve an indictable misdemeanor, formed no reason for refusing to-discipline him as a policeman. The object of such discipline is to secure fit men for the performance of police duty, and surely a thief is none the less unfit to protect citizens against theft because he has not yet been convicted of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Clearly the board had power to investigate the charge, and as they declined to exercise their jurisdiction on an erroneous opinion that they were without authority, a <em>mandamus </em>should be awarded. <em>King </em>v. <em>Justices of Kent, </em>14 <em>East </em>395; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Leicester, </em>15 <em>Q. B. </em>671; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Mayor of Monmouth, L. R., </em>5 <em>Q. B. </em>251; <em>Stryker </em>v. <em>Skillman, </em>2 <em>Gr. </em>189.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Let a peremptory writ issue, pursuant to the rule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
