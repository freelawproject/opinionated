The only authority asserted for improvement or assessment is the act entitled \u201cAn act to provide for the permanent improvement of public roads of this -state,\u201d approved March 22d, 1895. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>424. Section 13 of that act declares that on confirmation of the Circuit Court the report of the commissioners shall be final and conclusive. The defendants therefore challenge our right of review. It is sufficient to sustain such right in this case that the defect alleged is fundamental, avoiding jurisdiction to make .any assessment upon the land assessed. <em>Benedictine Sisters </em>v. <em>Elizabeth, </em>21 <em>Vroom </em>347. The act itself recognizes review by <em>-certiorari </em>and limits the time within which after confirmation -a writ may be allowed. The prosecutrix purchased her writ \u25a0within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Th\u00e9 defect alleged is that the land on which the challenged \u25a0assessment has been -imposed is outside the territorial range of assessment permitted by the act, namely, \u201c lands and real \u25a0estate'fronting or bordering on the road or section thereof improved.\u201d The land of the prosecutrix that has been assessed \u2022is a farm'of one hundred and ninety-six acres, bordering upon the public road leading from Columbus to Jobstown. A lane .or private road, obstructed by gates, runs through this farm .and tire adjoining one of a Mr. Harvey to the public road that has been improved. The two public- roads are more -than a mile apart, and the land of the prosecutrix comes at .no point nearer to the one improved than half a mile. Her farm buildings are three-quarters of a mile away and face towards the lane and not towards the improved road.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The defendants argue that the words \u201cfronting\u201d and \u2022\u201c bordering on \u201d in the statute are not synonymous in meaning, and that their disjunctive use makes assessable any land that fronts a road improved, although it may not border on it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and they claim that the farm of the prosecutrix fronts the road in question, because it can be reached by means of the lane-running through Mr. Harvey\u2019s farm. This claim .of frontage-is scarcely plausible and the argument derived therefrom is eutirely unsound. If the phraseology quoted is not merely redundant the difference intended is not that suggested. It seems to me that in the legislative mind it was assumed that some land might border on a given road or section, although its frontage, in a narrow sense, was elsewhere\u2014perhaps upon across road-\u2014and to make sure that such land should be assessable for benefits arising from the improvement, phraseology apt to include it was adopted. Be that as it may, it is quileplain that the interpretation contended for by the defendants-is inadmissible. By section 8 of the act the jurisdictional petition required must be signed \u201cby the owners of at least-two-thirds either in lineal feet or in area of the lands and \u25a0real estate fronting or bordering on\u201d the road or section of road to be improved, and it is declared that in the estimate-of area there shall be taken \u201c all the lands of every owner which are assessed for taxes in said county and which lie-together in any farm, tract or lot of which a part has a frontage on said road or section of road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The inherent ambiguity of the word \u201cfront\u2019\u2019and its derivatives is resolved by this self-interpreting statute. To come' within its provisions land must adjoin at- some point of the-road or section of road involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The assessment against the prosecutrix is set aside, with-costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
