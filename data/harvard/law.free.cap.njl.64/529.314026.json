Blazer was called by plaintiff, and on direct examination testified that he had authority from Stokes-to license the cutting by plaintiff. On cross-examination Blazer admitted that the authority had been conferred by a writing signed by Stokes and in Blazer\u2019s possession. The writing was not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">A motion to strike out Blazer\u2019s evidence as to authority to-license plaintiff to cut was denied by the judge sitting as a Circuit judge, on the ground that the objection came too late..</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">This was erroneous. Assuming that authority conferred! by parol upon Blazer would justify the license to plaintiff to-cut wood on the principal\u2019s land, as soon as it appeared that the authority was conferred by writing and that' the writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>was in existence and could be produced, the writing was the sole evidence by which plaintiff\u2019s case could be supported. It was error to admit evidence of its purport.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
