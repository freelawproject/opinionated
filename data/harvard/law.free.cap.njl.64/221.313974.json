A bill of exceptions signed by such judge presents no reviewable questions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-8\">On error.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-9\">Before Magie, Chief Justice, and Justices Van Syckel, Garrison and Lippincott.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-10\">For the plaintiff in error, <em>George A.

The assignments of error are solely directed to errors in the trial. These alleged errors are only exhibited by bills of exception sealed by \u201cAllen B. Endicott, Judge.\u201d We take judicial notice that there is no such Circuit Court judge. There is nothing in the record to indicate any request or appointment of Judge Endicott to hold that Circuit Court, under the provisions of the supplement to the \u201cAct relative to the supreme and circuit courts,\u201d approved April 2d, 1891. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>276.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">It is obvious that no reviewable question is presented by such bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">The defendant in error would therefore be entitled to a dismissal of the writ or an affirmance, but it is possible that the record is imperfect, and without expressing any opinion of the validity of the act above referred to, we are disposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>permit the plaintiff in error to take such steps to remedy such imperfection, if any, as he may desire to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Application for relief in this respect must be speedily made, or defendant in error may apply to dismiss or affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
