Negligence, \u00a7 90<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when contributory negligence bars recovery. It is not the law that contributory negligence is no defense where the defendant by the exercise of ordinary care could have avoided the injury. The settled law in this State is that where the negligence of the plaintiff contributes to the injury he cannot recover unless the act of the defendant resulting in the injury is wilful.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b453-9\" pgmap=\"453\">2. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1410<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when findings of jury or trial court will not be set aside. It is well settled in this State that the finding of a jury or a trial court will be set aside by the Appellate Court only when it is clearly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence. The fact that upon close consideration the weight or preponderance of the evidence would seem to be contrary to the verdict is not sufficient to warrant a reversal of the judgment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b453-10\" pgmap=\"453\">3. Street railroads, \u00a7 97<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when street car company not liable for collision with wagon crossing trade in front of car. In an action against a street railway company to recover damages to a wagon by being struck by a street car when the driver of the wagon attempted to cross the track in front of an approaching car, at other than a street intersection, held that the evidence showed that the defendant was not negligent and that the driver was guilty of contributory negligence, it appearing that the driver with knowledge of the approaching car attempted to cross the track about sixty feet distant from the car, which was running seven or eight miles an hour, and that the motorman was unable to stop the car before the collision.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-4\" pgmap=\"453\">Alden, Latham &amp; Young, for plaintiff in error; T.
