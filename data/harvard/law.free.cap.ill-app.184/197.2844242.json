S. c. 79, \u00a7 15, J. &amp; A. f 6976, so as to give County Court jurisdiction of subject-matter of an appeal from a justice, where there is no certificate or pretended certificate of the justice attached to or accompanying the transcript.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A0f\" pgmap=\"222\">3.

On appeal from a justice of the peace where no certificate of the justice is attached to or accompanying the transcript, the court to which such appeal is taken has no jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal for failure of appellant to comply with a rule to pay the docket fee, and for want of prosecution.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AChs\" pgmap=\"222\">4. Justices of the peace, \u00a7 162<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014jurisdiction on appeal when insufficient transcript filed. Where insufficient transcript is filed on appeal from a justice of the peace, the court to which the appeal is taken has no jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and is without power to make any order affecting the rights of the parties as to the merits of the cause. In such case the court would have power to order a perfect transcript to be filed, and enter any other order necessary to the preparation of the case for trial, but its power is limited to preliminary -orders.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AbA\" pgmap=\"222\">5.

Fact that appellant appeared in court and entered a motion to set aside an order of the court, held not to give the court jurisdiction of the subject-matter, where no sufficient transcript is on file.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b222-11\" pgmap=\"222\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
