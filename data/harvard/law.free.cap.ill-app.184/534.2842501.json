In an action for malpractice in dentistry, refusal of court to strike out testimony of plaintiff as to pain and suffering both while and after the work was performed, held not error where other testimony tended to show that immediate intense pain and conditions causing additional and unnecessary pain would result from negligence of the character charged.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AqUU\" pgmap=\"559\">4.

Permitting an expert witness to testify in a suit for malpractice as to the condition of the bore in plaintiff\u2019s teeth the following year, without requiring plaintiff to show that no one else had bored into the tissues subsequent to the treatment by defendant, held not error, since whether or not the conditions complained of were caused or aggravated by anything done by either of the dentists who testified was a matter for the jury upon which cross-examination was afforded.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ALC\" pgmap=\"560\">6.

In an action for malpractice in dentistry, where interrogatories were given asking whether any of plaintiff\u2019s teeth were lost and whether any were injured as a result of the conduct of defendant, held that neither of the interrogatories nor both together called for all the ultimate and controlling facts, where the declaration alleged and the evidence tended to show other results of the alleged negligence, such as unnecessary anguish and distress and shock and injury to the nervous system.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A19S\" pgmap=\"560\">7. Tbial, \u00a7 276<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when interrogatory does not call for an ultimate and controlling fact. In an action for malpractice in dentistry, an interrogatory whether boring holes into the roots of certain teeth for the purpose of fixing pegs therein for fastening and attaching bridges was improper dentistry does not call for an ultimate and controlling fact, where the claim was not that such method was improper but that the boring through the teeth into the bony tissues of the jawbone was negligence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"ANaN\" pgmap=\"560\">8.

In an action for malpractice in dentistry, an interrogatory whether plaintiff afforded the defendant a reasonable opportunity to cure the alleged soreness and pain does not call for all the ultimate and controlling facts, where the evidence tends to show not only the causing of unnecessary pain and soreness but also ruination of the teeth for permanent bridge work.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AK-\" pgmap=\"560\">9.
