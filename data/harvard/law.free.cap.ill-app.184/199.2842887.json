In an action to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate while deceased was employed as a trapper and a switchman in defendant\u2019s mine, the declaration alleging that death resulted from large quantities of gob on either side of the track, where deceased met with the accident, which created a dangerous condition and that defendant was guilty of negligence in failing to have said dangerous condition examined and marked, as the statute requires, held that court\u2019s refusal to exclude all of plaintiff\u2019s evidence and to direct a verdict for defendant was error, there being no evidence to prove that the place was made dangerous by the accumulation of gob or that the absence of gob at such place would have prevented the accident, nor any evidence in the record to show that deceased could not have secured his safety by stepping off the track.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\" pgmap=\"223\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Macoupin county; the Hon.
