Where a person employed to repair signboards is charged with the duty to inspect the framework, to detect any dangers from decay, and to repair and report such defects, and is injured while removing panels from the signboard by reason of a defect in a timber nailed to the post of the framework as a foot-board, he cannot recover if the footboard was defective on account of decay and such defect was the sole proximate cause of the injury, but where the injury was also caused by a defect in a timber at the top of the signboard, which was a concealed knot and a fault in the original construction, the plaintiff may recover where both defective timbers are the proximate cause of the injury and there is no other intervening cause.</headnotes><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-3\" pgmap=\"479\">Statement of the Case.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-4\" pgmap=\"479\">Action by Owen Murphy against Gunning System to recover for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff by falling from the top of the framework of one of defendant\u2019s signboards while employed by defendant in removing panels therefrom.
