In an action by a beneficiary on a policy of insurance where the defense is that the insured had been suspended for failure to pay certain monthly assessments in the time required by the provisions of the policy, a verdict in favor of plaintiff held to be sustained by the law and the evidence, it appearing that plaintiff had made payments to an agent of the defendant having apparent authority to make collections and that plaintiff had money to her credit in the hands of the defendant in excess of the amount necessary to pay all assessments for the months in question when they became due.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622\">2.
