The discretion vested in a trial judge in not requiring a more specific statement of claim was not abused where interrogatories and answers, as permitted under the practice of the Municipal Court of Chicago, were filed by the defendant.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-6\" pgmap=\"61\">2. Evidence, \u00a7 164<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when letter is not self-serving. Where an attorney writes to his client a letter in the nature of a demand for payment of his fees and disbursements and the client replies promising payment, his letter is not a self-serving declaration and both letters are admissible in evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-7\" pgmap=\"61\">3. Limitation of actions, \u00a7 117<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence is sufficient to show promise. Where in an action upon an account stated the plaintiff testifies he presented the account and was promised payment in part at a certain time and the balance later and is corroborated by another witness, which testimony is denied by the defendant, there is sufficient proof of the admission of the debt and a promise to pay so that the statute of limitations does not apply.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-8\" pgmap=\"61\">4.
