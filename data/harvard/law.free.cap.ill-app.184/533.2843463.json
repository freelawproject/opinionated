In an action to recover the value of railroad ties alleged to belong to plaintiffs and to have been taken and used by defendant, evidence held insufficient to establish a prima facie case for plaintiffs, it appearing from the evidence that both parties had separate piles of ties at a certain place, and that the ties were distinguished by private marks, but the evidence to connect the defendant with the taking of the ties was largely circumstantial, which considered with other evidence did not fairly tend to show that defendant took the ties.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b558-7\" pgmap=\"558\">3.

In an action to recover the value of railroad ties alleged to have been taken and used by defendant, a statement by an employe of defendant made some two years after the event amounting to an admission that he took the ties, held inadmissible for the reason that it was no part of the res gestae.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b558-8\" pgmap=\"558\">4.
