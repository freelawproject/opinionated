Baum to the amount of $1,000, the plaintiff, the mother of the insured, being mentioned in the policy as beneficiary. Plaintiff\u2019s amended statement of claim alleged that said sum was due her under a term insurance contract issued in connection with an endowment policy. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $1,091.67, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b643-7\" pgmap=\"643\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b643-8\" pgmap=\"643\">1. Insurance, \u00a7 113<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when delivery of policy to agent completes contract of insurance. A delivery of an insurance policy to the agent is sufficient to complete the contract of insurance only where there is an unqualified acceptance of the application and a completed policy has been placed in the hands of the agent for delivery without condition.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b643-9\" pgmap=\"643\">2. Insurance, \u00a7 704<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when exclusion of testimony as to instructions given agent when policy was delivered to him is prejudicial error. In an action to recover on a term insurance contract where it appears that the insured never made application for term insurance and that the policy together with the term insurance contract were delivered to an agent of the insurance company, refusal of court to permit defendant\u2019s witnesses to testify as to what instructions were given to the agent when the policy was placed in his hands, held prejudicial error.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b643-10\" pgmap=\"643\">3.

In an action to recover on a term insurance contract, where the defense is that the insurer made application only for a twenty-year endowment policy, the giving of an instruction which assumes that the insured made application for term insurance held prejudicial error.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-4\" pgmap=\"643\">Hoyne, O\u2019Connor &amp; Irwin, for appellant; Carl J.
