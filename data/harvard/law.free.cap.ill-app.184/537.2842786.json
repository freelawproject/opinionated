Architects entered into a contract with a partnership for commissions to be based upon $80,000 as the cost of a building. The contract contemplated that the defendants as partners should jointly let the contract for the building, but the contract was let for the erection of the building, to cost $130,000, by one of the defendants after the architects\u2019 services were discontinued and after defendants had dissolved partnership. Held, in an action by the architects against the defendants jointly for commissions on the basis of the $130,000 costs, that a direction of a verdict for defendants was proper on the theory that the contract imposed no joint liability to pay commissions on the actual cost of the building in view of the fact that the contract for the structure was not a joint undertaking.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b561-5\" pgmap=\"561\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
