In insurance contracts a representation is a statement relating to a material matter and is only required to he substantially true, while a warranty must be literally true. Warranties enter into and are a part of the contract, while representations are mere inducements to it.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AlE\" pgmap=\"400\">3. Insurance, \u00a7 209<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when statements in an application for insurance will he construed representations rather than warranties. Statements in an application for insurance will be construed as warranties only when the language is so clearly and unequivocally expressed as to leave the court no other alternative. If the language is ambiguous and doubtful, or if there is another reasonable construction that may be placed upon it, and thus avoid the consequence of a warranty, courts are inclined to adopt the latter'construction.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A7yX\" pgmap=\"400\">4.
