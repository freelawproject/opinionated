The declaration was in the common form of a declaration upon a -bond for payment of money. Plea, conditions performed, and issue. The jury found a verdict in these words: \u201cWe of the jury find for the plaintiffs the debt in the declaration mentioned, to be discharged by the payment of- 651. 11s. 3d. with interest from the 21st day of Eebruary, 1775; if the <em>Court </em>shall be of opinion that an action of debt can be maintained by the plaintiffs in this Court in this cause, it being a three months\u2019 replevy bond, taken under an execution on a judgment obtained in the County Court of Halifax, under an act of Assembly, entitled, an act, declaring the law concerning executions, and for relief of insolvent debtors, passed in the year 1748: but, if the Court shall be of a contrary opinion, we then find for the defendants.\u201d The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs; and the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-21\">M\u2019Craw, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-22\">The executors had no remedy by motion under the act of Assembly; and, therefore, they were obliged to resort to an action upon the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-23\">Washington, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-24\">In several instances in this Court, it has been decided, I admit, that where a forthcoming or replevy bond was void as a statutory bond, that the obligee might, nevertheless, maintain an action at the common law, upon the bond. Hewlett v. Chamberlayne, [1 Wash. 367,] Meriwether v. Johnson, [3 Call, 523,] and Bibb v. Cawthorne, [1 Wash. 91,] were of that kind. But where the bond is good as a statutory bond, the party must pursue the remedy by statute. [Hollingworth v.
