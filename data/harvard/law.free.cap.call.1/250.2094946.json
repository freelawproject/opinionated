By which means he has been necessitated to resign his office or calling as a lumber-inspector as aforesaid; and says, that he is damaged one thousand pounds.\u201d Plea, not guilty, and issue.

In one part of the declaration, the plaintiff says, that the defendant forged the certificate or certificates which were on 252 *board the sloop; but in another he says, that he brings into Court two certificates which he believes were forged by the defendant. This either qualifies the first charge of forgery into a belief only, or else there were two sets of certificates; and then it will not appear, for which of them, damages were given. The special damage should have been stated with precision, for three reasons: 1st. To prevent surprise upon the defendant, and to put it in his power to come prepared to defend himself. 2d. To authorize the jury to enquire into it as a matter comprized within the issue; and, therefore, properly falling under their consideration. 3d. To enable the Court to decide whether the matters stated as constituting the damage, were in themselves the grounds of an action. But, it does not appear how' the loss of office came to pass; for, it is not a clear consequence of the forgery. It ought therefore to have been stated, as it was the gist of the action, and for want of it no presumption will be admitted, that the proper proof was given on the trial: Because the declaration does not contain the averments necessary to introduce it. The omission, therefore, is fatal, and the verdict does not cure the defect. Chichester v. Vass, [ante, p. 83,] in this Court. Office, means public employment under government; and, therefore, the plaintiff must have been an inspector of lumber under the law. If so, the act of Assembly, R. C. 249, prescribes the remedy; and no other could have been pursued. 11 Co. 89, (b).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-8\">Call, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-9\">The plaintiff alleges an occupation which was beneficial to him, and that he has lost it in consequence of an illegal act of the defendant: Which must upon principle be the ground of an action. 1 Bac. Abr. 55, cites Poph. 144 ; 1 Com. Dig. 230. Although the manner of losing the office is not stated, 3Tet the Court will intend that it was proved, after verdict. Suppose a woman brings an action of slander, and alleges that she thereby lost her marriage, without 253 shewing *how, this will be good after verdict: Which in principle is the same with the case at bar; for, it would be necessary to set forth the manner of the loss in that case, as it can be in this. The decision in Chichester v. Vass, was only that, where there was nothing in the declaration, to warrant the introduction of the testimony which constituted the cause of action, that there, it would be bad after verdict. But here, the declaration covered the evidence, and, therefore, it will be intended, after verdict, that the cause of action was actually proved. Office may be an employment under a private person, as well as under government; Cowell\u2019s Interp. tit. Office; and consequently the argument drawn from the act of Assembly does not apply; because, the declaration states that his salary was paid by the merchants.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b98-20\">Amendments and Jeofails \u2014 Necessary Averments\u2014 Distinction. \u2014 A verdict cures, where the necessary facts are imperfectly stated, but not where they are entirely omitted.

A proper declaration would have set forth, that the plaintiff was duly appointed inspector of lumber at Smith-field, and entitled to the legal fees 254 *of that office; to be paid to him, by all such as exported lumber from the said town; who were compelled by law to obtain his certificate of such inspection, before the lumber could be exported. By which fees the said plaintiff received from the merchants of Smithfield, an income of 501. a year for the better support of himself and family; yet, the defendant not ignorant of the premises, but contriving and fraudulently intending to render the employment aforesaid of the said plaintiff unnecessary, and thereby deprive him of his legal fees aforesaid, forged the certificate ; whereby the plaintiff was deprived of his fees of office aforesaid to his damage, &amp;c. And we are to examine if the essential parts are pursued in the present declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-19\">I throw out of the case the latter part of the declaration relative to the two certificates : Which I consider as different from the part first particularly stated, and take the declaration as stopping at the end of the averment as to the first. Thus, viewing the other as a separate count, or rather as a profert in curia of other papers which he meant to use in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-20\">The declaration states the plaintiff to be an inspector of lumber at Smithfield, by which he obtained an honest livelihood at the salary of 501. per annum, which was paid him by the merchants of that town. That he had been used to inspect lumber from time to time, and to grant certificates purporting that the lumber was good and merchantable, which was alwa3's signed with his own hand. That the defendant, a merchant in that town, having knowledge of the premises, and with intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiff in his calling of a lumber-inspector, did, some time in January, 1794, send down to. Norfolk a sloop loaded with lumber, to the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>thirteeii or fourteen thousand staves, including heading of good merchantable lumber, which sloop had on board a certificate or certificates under the signature of the plaintiff, purporting that there was 255 on board *the lumber before described. It then avers, that all and every certificate or certificates for the lumber on board the sloop were forged by the defendant, and further, that he never inspected any lumber for the plaintiff since October, 1792. That the certificate or certificates aforesaid, were dated in January, 1794, and that the forgery of the defendant, in those certificates, is a great fraud.upon the plaintiff, insomuch that he has been compelled thereby to leave off his business as an inspector of lumber, whereby he obtained a salary of 501. a year, to his damage, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">It is objected, that the plaintiff should have stated specially, how the act of the defendant operated to produce the loss in his employment; and if, as the counsel insisted, it was impossible to draw the conclusion from what is set forth, that such was the effect of the defendant\u2019s act, the objection would have been good; although, it is alleged it was done by the defendant, with intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiff in his office, with an averment, that he was thereby compelled to leave off his office, by which he obtained a salary of 501. a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The difficulty arises from an idea impressed by the word salary; which, in common acceptation, imports a certain annual stipend, payable to an officer for performing his whole duty, and if those for whom he was to act, excused him from the duty, no' matter how, by forgery or otherwise, if he continued to receive his annual stipend, he could have no reason to complain. But, when we recur to the act of Assembly, [c. 124, R. C. ed. 1803,] and find no salary annexed to the office, but that the profits were fees to be paid for each inspection and certificate ; the term salary, explained by what follows, that it was paid by the merchants of Smithfield, must mean an income arising either from the fees to be paid by those merchants, when his services were required, or (which the charge might mean) from a commutation of those fees, by a gross sum paid annually by the merchants; In either case, if he lost the income by the forgery, his right of action was equally sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"AGi\">*CIpon the general charge, that he lost his salary or income by the forgery of the defendant, made with intent to cheat and defraud him in his office, the defendant could not be surprised. He knew the act of Assembly gave fees, and not a salary; and, if there was a commutation, changing them into a certain sum, which had been paid, notwithstanding the forger3T, the defendant who is stated to be one of the body who made it, ought to have been prepared, and I presume was, to meet the proof of the plaintiff, on the loss to him by the forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">On this view of the declaration, and recurring to the act of Assembly, which requires the certificate of inspection, to be produced to the captain of a vessel, before lumber can be received on board for exportation, the consequential damages alleged, are so far from being impossible, that the3r are obvious. The forging of the certificate, rendered his employment unnecessary, and so deprived him of his fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">The penalty spoken of, as the remedy which should have been pursued, is upon the captain who receives lumber on board, without a certificate of inspection; from which, this certificate would exempt him, unless he knew it to be forged. Besides, it is given to the informer, and not a party grieved: who is left to the common law remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">So, that I think, upon the whole, this declaration would be sufficient after a verdict, if we are not restrained by the precedent in this Court, in the case of Chichester v. Vass.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">I have revised my notes in that case, and as far as concerns the present question, I believe.m3' opinion accorded with that of the other Judges. My note is this, \u2018 \u2018The promise as laid, does not upon the marriage, give the action; but, other things are to happen to entitle the plaintiff, which may be considered as the gist of the action, and ought to : have been averred; that is, that the defendant had given to another daughter such a sum; for, on that, his 257 right of action accrued upon *the promise to do equal justice to all his daughters. I concur in thinking this defect not cured by the verdict under the act of Assembly, presuming proof to have been given of facts imperfectly laid in the declaration, but not such as are not laid at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">That case establishes the distinction between necessary facts being not stated at all, and being imperfectly stated; and, the latter appears to be the present case. The loss of profit is alleged, but imperfectly; and, we presume, under the act, that the defect was supplied by proof to the jury. Rone of the cases cited appear to destroy this distinction, and</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
