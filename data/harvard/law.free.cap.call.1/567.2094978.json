Nevertheless, the said dfefendant, though often requested, did not pay to the said Cuthbert, in his life-time, the aforesaid sum of money, or any part thereof, but the same to pay refused, and still refuses to pay the same to the plaintiffs, to the damage of the plaintiffs 2001., and therefore they bring suit, &amp;c.\u201d Plea, conditions performed; and the plaintiff took issue. The suit was then referred; and afterwards, at a subsequent Court, the record proceeds thus: \u201cOctober, 1795, - order reference set aside and continued.\u201d On the trial of the issue, the defendant filed a bill of exceptions to the Court\u2019s opinion, which stated, that the plaintiffs offered in evidence to the jury an agreement in these words: \u201cAgreement between Mr. John Hammitt and Cuthbert Bullett: Cuthbert Bullett sells Mr. Ham-mitt lot number thirteen, in the town of Newport, with the improvements, 568 \"'for one hundred and twenty-five pounds, specie, payable with interest \u25a0from the first day of January, on the first day- of next April, and rents him both his ferries during the said Bullett\u2019s life, at fifteen pounds, specie, per annum, for the first four years, and after, during the remainder of the term, at the annual rent of twenty-five pounds per annum; the said Bullett is to have and retain the rent for the present year.

The breach laid is, that the defendant had not paid the aforesaid sum of money; without distinguishing, whether it was the 1251. only, or that sum with interest: and, therefore, the declaration in that respect is uncertain. The issue is taken on a plea of conditions performed, . and the verdict is, that the plaintiff had not performed the conditions in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration mentioned ; which is senseless and immaterial, as there was nothing like a condition stated in the declaration ; but, a charge .569 founded on a positive ^stipulation; and therefore, the issue being immaterial, the judgment is erroneous. The order \u25a0of reference appears to have been set aside, upon the motion of the plaintiff merely, and without any consent thereto obtained from \u2022the defendant; although no reason for this extraordinary interference appears on the record. This was an assumption of power which did not belong to the Court, who ought to have suffered the order of reference to stand until it was acted on; unless the parties had consented to rescind it, or \u25a0some other proper cause had been shewn for their interposition. But, there is a further variance between the writing produced and that declared on : For, the declaration is, that the defendant would pay, on or before the 1st day of April, whereas the agreement produced was, that the money was payable with interest from the first day of January on the first day of next April. Besides, the writing contains other stipulations, of which no notice is taken in the declaration ; and, therefore it does not necessarily appear to be the same, on which the suit is brought. The judgment varies from the verdict; for, the latter finds damages only: whereas, the judgment is for the 1251. and the damages also.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Pleadings \u2014 Errors\u2014When Objection Not Allowed.\u2014 The defendant will not he allowed to ohj ect to errors in pleading which are for his benefit.

Whether he was mistaken or not, is doubtful ; though the practice is, to claim and recover the interest with the principal.
