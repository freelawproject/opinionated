Craig.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b179-13\">[Thursday, April 11, 1799.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-14\">Bonds -Collateral Condition \u2014 Assignability\u2014Statute.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014Bond, with a collateral condition, was not assignable before the act of Dec. 1795 : and, therefore, the assignee of such a bond, could not maintain an action on it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-21\">This was a supersedeas to a judgment of the District Court, where an action of debt was brought, in Oct. 1792, by the assignee of a bond, with a collateral condition, and the declaration assigned the breaches. The defendant craved oyer of the bond and condition, and pleaded conditions performed. The plaintiff took issue, and obtained a verdict and judgment. There was a bill of exceptions, which stated the bond and endorsement, with the defendant\u2019s objection to the admissibility of the evidence. The petition for the supersedeas assigned two errors: 1. That the bond was not assignable. 2. That no material issue was joined.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-22\">Wickham, for the plaintiff in the supersedeas.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARU1\">I shall not trouble the Court with any observations upon the last error, because I deem the first sufficient to reverse the judgment. The present act of Assembly, [Dec. 1795, c. 125, \u00a7 5, R. C. ed. 1819,] allows bonds pf this nature to be assigned, and permits the assignee to sue in his own name. But this bond was made anterior to that act; and, therefore, is not affected by it. So, that it stands upon the old act altogether; which merely relates to bonds for payment of money.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-16\">Bonds \u2014 Collateral Condition \u2014 Assignability.\u2014In tile principal case It was held that a bond, with a collateral condition, was not assignable before' the act of Dec. 1795 ; and, therefore, the assignee of such a bond, could not maintain an action on It. On this question the principal case is cited in Meredith v. Duval, 1 Munf. 85 ; Gallego v. Quesnall, 1 H. &amp; M. 204; Burns v. Hays, 44 W. Va. 505, 30 S. E.

The judgment must be reversed; because \u201cthe bond on which the suit is brought, not being for the payment of money or tobacco, but with a condition for performance of covenants, was not, by law, assignable at the time the suit was commenced; which was, therefore, not maintainable by the assignee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-26\">Judgment reversed, with costs ; and judgment entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
