At November rules, there was a conditional order; at December rules, the conditional order was confirmed, \u201cunless the defendant should appear at the next quarterly sessions to be held for the said County, and answer the bill .afores&amp;id. \u201d On the 23d of March, he gave special bail; but, did not plead. On the 24th of March, the bait surrendered him to the Sheriff, who .gave a certificate that he had him in custody. On the 25th of March, a writ of habeas corpus cum causa, issued from the District Court of Richmond (but it does not appear that it was ever presented to the Court, or delivered to the Sheriff:) And on the 26th of March, being the last day of the term, the Court on the motion of the plaintiff confirmed the conditional judgment. The District Court' awarded a procedendo. To which order, the plaintiff prayed a writ of supersedeas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-17\">Duval, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-18\">The act of 1792, R. C. 98, [ed. 1794, 13 Stat. Larg. 465,] only, restrained the removal of the suit to cases, where there is an issue or demurrer joined, and does not extend to those where there is no appear.ance. There is good sense in the distinction too. Ifor, it is reasonable that a man who is sued in a Court, and has submitted to the jurisdiction by pleading, or otherwise referring- the cause to their decision, should not be allowed to translate the suit into another Court, until a final hearing; but, it is otherwise, where he has never submitted at all, as in the present case.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b80-15\">See monographic <em>note </em>on \u201cHabeas Corpus\u201d appended to Ex parte Pool, 2 Va.
