I suspect that the Courts below proceeded upon the ground, that the inquisition was taken by the deputy Sheriff; but that has been decided to be good by this Court. However, as there might have been matter dehors, as misconduct in the Sheriff, jurors, or party, and nothing is stated in the record to exclude that idea, we must presume that something of that kind appeared to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">PER CUR.
