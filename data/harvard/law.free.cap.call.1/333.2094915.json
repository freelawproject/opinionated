The Spottsylvania Justices, to decide, that before a suit could be brought against the security to an administration bond, it was necessary for the plaintiff, in the first place, to convict the executor or administrator, by an actual suit previously brought against him, of having committed a devastavit. But, that decision is founded upon principles of law, which only apply to the case of executors and administrators; and, therefore, it has no influence in the present case; which is an;ac-335 tion on a \u00abguardian\u2019s, and not on an executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">CARRINGTON, Judge. It was decided in Claiborne\u2019s ex\u2019rs v. The Spottsylva'nia Justices', that before a suit can be maintained upon an administration bond, a devastavit must be first established by a suit against the executor or-administrator. But the reasons for that decision, only apply to the case of executors and administrators; and, therefore, they do not affect the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">LYONS, Judge. The case of Claiborne\u2019s ex\u2019rs v. The Spottsylvania Justices, was confined to administration bonds. Eor, an executor or administrator cannot be charged de bonis propriis, until a suit has been brought against him, in order to establish the demand and ascertain the disposition of the assets; and as the bond is only intended as an ultimate security against a devastavit, the devastavit ought to be established, before any action can accrue upon it. But, this can only be done by a previous suit; which, therefore, is indispensably necessary. \u2022 It is evident though, that_these principles only apply to the case of 'executors and administrator; and that they, have no relation to a suit upon a guardian\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"A2MP\">Cur. adv. vult.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">PENDLETON, President. Delivered the resolution of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">There is no difficulty upon the two reasons assigned in the District Court, for arresting the .judgment. On the judgment now to be given though, a difficulty has occurred. The bond is dated in Nov. 1779, for 50,0001. subject to the scale; which at thirty-six for one, reduces it to 13881. l7s. 9d. sufficient to cover the plaintiff\u2019s demand: But, there are * two orphans, whose interests are to .be secured by this penalty; beyond which, the security cannot be made liable; and this judgment may exhaust too much of the fund to admit of justice to the other orphans. .On consideration of this subject, since the claims of- the orphans may be different, and the remainder 336 \u00abof the fund amounting to 4881. Os. 3d. may not be equal to the claim of the other; we give judgment for the whole penalty to be discharged by the plaintiff\u2019s demand. If, in consequence thereof, the judgment, with what the securitjr has paid or shall be obliged to pay the other, should exceed the penalty of the bond, the security may be relieved in equity; where both claims will be reduced to the aggregate of the penalty, and the penalty proportioned between the orphans.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">The judgment, after reversing that of the District Court, proceeded thus: \u2018 \u2018It is considered, ' that the reasons assigned by the appellee in arrest of judgment be overruled; and, that the appellant recover against the appellee 13881. 17s, 9d. being the amount of the penalty of. the bond in the proceedings mentioned, reduced to specie according to the legal scale of depreciation, and his costs by him in the said District Court expended. But, this judgment is tobe discharged by the payment to the aforesaid Samuel Peniston of 9101. 17s. 6J\u00a3, the damages by the jurors in their verdict assessed,. and the costs aforesaid in the District Court, and such other damages as may be hereafter assessed upon a scire facias, being sued out thereon and new breaches assigned.\u201d\u2019</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
