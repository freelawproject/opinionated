That Love &amp; Co. assigned this note to the plaintiff, before the day for payment thereof; of which Skinker had notice. That the said note was not paid according to its tenor and effect; but the payment thereof had been wholly neglected and refused; of which Love &amp; Co. had notice. Whereby, and by reason of the act of Assembly, in such cases made, Love &amp; Co. became liable to pay the said 1030 dollars to the plaintiff; and being so liable, &amp;c. assumed, &amp;c. There was a second count for money had and received, by the defendants, to the use of the plaintiff; and the third count for money paid, laid out and advanced. Plea, non assumpsit, and issue. The jury found a special verdict, setting forth the note in these words: \u201cPrince William county, October 19, 1793. On the 19th day of April, in the year 1794, at the counting-house of Josiah Watson in Alexandria, I promise to pay John Love &amp; Co. or order, one thousand and thirty dollars, negotiable at the bank of Alexandria, for value received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-21\">Wm.

They also find a letter from John Love, one of the defendants, to the plaintiff, stating, that he is sorry he has determined to sue him, instead of Skinker. That if the plaintiff would sue Skinker, the said John Love would give security, that if the money could not be made on the execution, that he the said John Love would pay it. That by suing Skinker in Eauquier, where he had large property, the plaintiff might immediately get judgment; and that he John Love would see to the business. That if this was refused, he should procrastinate the suit as long as he could. That a compliance on the part of the plaintiff would prevent trouble to the said John Love in recovering the money of Skinker after-wards. That, he did not consider himself bound to make extraordinary sacrifices for discharging this debt, under the circumstances of the case; and, therefore, if sued, should consult his own convenience in the payment, which he might be able to put off longer than Skinker. That if the plaintiff brought a suit against Skinker, that he John Love, gave him his honor he would endeavor to have judgment got as soon as possible against Skinker; which he should consider as necessary for his own safety. The jury further find, that no suit was ever brought by the plaintiff against Skinker; and conclude, that if the law be for the plaintiff, then they find for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>plaintiff, and if for the defendant, then they find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB6\">*The District Court gave judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\">Marshall, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-7\">Contended, that the endorsement supported the count for money had and received. That, the assignee was not bound to sue the maker before he resorted to the endorser; for, there was an implied contract in such cases, that the assignor would pay the money, if the maker did not. And, finally, that, as this bill was negotiable at the bank of Alexandria, it stood upon the same footing with notes payable to the bank; and, therefore, that the endorser was liable, without suit against the maker.

That, there was no analogy betwixt this case and that of a note payable to the bank; because that was a contract betwixt the bank and debtor, but this was an engagement between the endorser and endorsee merely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">Cur. adv. vult.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-16\">Assignments \u2014 Recourse to Assignor \u2014 Diligence.\u2014 The principal case is cited in Dunlop v.
