No. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4 (2005) (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.), from the district court\u2019s order granting Plaintiff-Appellee Leslie Miedema\u2019s motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, Maytag contends that the district court erred by placing the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction on Maytag and resolving all doubts in favor of remand. Maytag further objects that, even if it did have this burden, the district court applied too high a standard of proof with respect to CAFA\u2019s amount in controversy requirement. Finally, Maytag claims that the district court erroneously relied upon a post-removal amended complaint in reaching its decision. After careful review of the record and the briefs, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-15\">In October of 2005, Leslie Miedema filed a class action suit against Maytag in Florida state court, alleging that various \u201cranges/ovens\u201d designed and manufactured by Maytag contained a defective motorized door latch assembly that allowed heat to escape and damage other range/ oven components. Specifically, Miedema pleaded that she brought her action \u201con behalf of herself and all other similarly situated consumers of [Maytag] ranges/ ovens that incorporate the defective motorized door latch assembly, as a statewide class action, pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(2) or (b)(3).\u201d She included in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>putative class \u201c[a]ll purchasers of Maytag ranges/ovens, in the State of Florida, bearing [certain model numbers],\u201d and stated her belief that there were \u201cthousands of members of the above-described class.\u201d Miedema asserted causes of action for negligence, breach of express warranty, and violation of Florida\u2019s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, demanding \u201ccompensatory damages, [] pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and any and all such further relief to which she is entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\">Within a month of being served with Miedema\u2019s complaint, Maytag filed a notice of removal in federal district court, invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332, 1441, 1446, and 1453. According to Maytag, the class action was removable under CAFA because Miedema and Maytag were of diverse citizenship, the putative class consisted of thousands of Floridians, and the amount in controversy exceeded, in the aggregate, $5,000,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(d), 1453(a), (b). In support of its claim regarding the amount in controversy, Maytag submitted a declaration by its information analyst Jodi Jarrett. Jarrett declared that she had researched those range/oven models identified in Miedema\u2019s description of the putative class, that a total of 6,729 ranges/ovens bearing the alleged model numbers had been sold in Florida, and that the total value of those ranges/ovens was $5,931,971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">Miedema responded by moving to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. She argued that Maytag had the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, and that Maytag had failed to carry that burden with respect to the amount in controversy. For example, Miedema stated, Jarrett\u2019s declaration did not specify whether each of the 6,729 ranges/ovens sold incorporated the allegedly defective motorized door latch assembly at issue, what Maytag meant by \u201ctotal value,\u201d or how that \u201ctotal value\u201d was calculated. Maytag opposed the motion to remand, arguing, among other things, that any vagueness in its determination of the amount in controversy was due to the breadth of Miedema\u2019s complaint. The district court, noting the existence of disagreement among courts as to which party bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction under CAFA, ordered additional briefing on the issue, as well as on whether the requisite amount in controversy had been established. Miedema then proceeded to depose Jodi Jarrett, and submitted this deposition as additional evidence of Maytag\u2019s failure to establish that more than $5,000,000 was in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\">After receiving the parties\u2019 additional submissions, the district court issued an order granting Miedema\u2019s motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court adhered to the traditional rule in the CAFA context that a removing defendant bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction. The court then determined that Maytag did not satisfy that burden, finding that the Jarrett declaration and deposition were \u201cflawed\u201d in this regard. Although Miedema also contributed to the uncertainty surrounding the amount in controversy, the court noted, it must ultimately resolve all doubts in favor of remand. We granted Maytag\u2019s subsequent petition for permission to appeal the remand order, <em>see </em>28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c), and now reach the merits of that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Evans v. Walter Indus., Inc., </em>449 F.3d 1159, 1162, No. 06-11974, 2006 WL 1374688, at *2 (11th Cir. May 22, 2006); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1) (notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), court of appeals may review remand order where case was removed under CAFA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">\n<em>A. CAFA Review of Remand Orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQJf\">\n<em>1. 7-Day Application Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-8\">The CAFA permits a court of appeals to accept an application to appeal if the application is made to the court of appeals <em>\u201cnot less than </em>7 days after entry of the [district court\u2019s] order\u201d granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which It was removed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1) (emphasis added). Several circuits have declined to read the \u201cnot less than\u201d language literally, concluding that it was a typographical error, or that such a reading would be illogical. <em>See Pritchett v. Office Depot, Inc. </em>420 F.3d 1090, 1093 n. 2 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe statute should read that an appeal is permissible if filed \u2018not more than\u2019 seven days after entry of the remand order.\u201d); <em>Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1309, AFL-CIO v. Laidlaw Transit Servs., Inc., </em>435 F.3d 1140, 1146 (9th Cir.2006) (following <em>Pritchett </em>and also excluding, in calculating the 7-day period, intermediate weekends and holidays under Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2)); <em>cf. Patterson v. Dean Morris, L.L.P., </em>444 F.3d 365, 368 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006). While we have not addressed this issue directly, it is clear that we did not read \u00a7 1453(c)(1) literally in <em>Evans, </em>where we stated that \u00a7 1453(c)(1) \u201cprovides for an \u2018application\u2019 to the court of appeals ... <em>within </em>7 days of the district court\u2019s remand order.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>449 F.3d at 1162, 2006 WL 1374688, at *2 (emphasis added). We now reaffirm that construction of \u00a7 1453(c)(1), for to read it literally would produce an absurd result: there would be a front-end waiting period (an application filed 6 days after entry of a remand order would be premature), but there would be no back-end limit (an application filed 600 days after entry of a remand order would not be untimely). When applying the plain and ordinary meaning of statutory language \u201cproduces a result that is not just unwise but is clearly absurd, another principle comes into the picture. That principle is the venerable one that statutory language should not be applied literally if doing so would produce an absurd result.\u201d <em>Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., </em>120 F.3d 1181, 1188 (11th Cir.1997). Here, the district court\u2019s remand order was entered on April 4, 2006. Maytag filed its petition for permission to appeal (i.e., its \u201capplication\u201d) with the circuit clerk on April 12, 2006\u2014 six days later, when the intervening weekend is excluded under Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2). Accordingly, there was no violation of \u00a7 1453(c)(1) when we granted Maytag\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\">\n<em>2. 60-Day Review Limit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">The CAFA requires us to \u201ccomplete all action on [this] appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which such appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>filed, unless an extension is granted .... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In granting Maytag\u2019s petition for permission to appeal, we directed the parties to address the question of \u201cwhether the sixty-day period is measured from the date the petition is filed, or instead is measured from the date of entry of this order.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>however, has now decided that issue, holding that \u201cthe 60-day period begins to run from the date when the court of appeals granted the appellants\u2019 application to appeal and thus filed the appeal.\u201d 449 F.3d at 1162, 2006 WL 1374688, at *2. We granted Maytag\u2019s petition for permission to appeal on April 25, 2006. Thus, so long as our ruling on this appeal is issued within 60 days of that date (assuming no extension is granted), our ruling is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">\n<em>B. Burden of Establishing Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">The CAFA authorizes removal of a \u201cclass action\u201d in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cwithout regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the State in which the action is brought, except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(b). A \u201cclass action\u201d includes a civil action which, like Miedema\u2019s, is filed under a \u201cState ... rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by 1 or more representative persons as a class action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1332(d)(1). \u201cUnder CAFA, federal courts [ ] have original jurisdiction over class actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 and there is minimal diversity (at least one plaintiff and one defendant are from different states).\u201d <em>Evans, </em>449 F.3d at 1163, 2006 WL 1374688, at *3 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">Maytag contends that the district court, in evaluating Miedema\u2019s motion to remand, erred by applying the traditional rule that the removing defendant bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction. Maytag concedes \u201c[t]he text of CAFA does not address which party has the burden of proof in establishing federal jurisdiction when a class action is removed to federal court,\u201d but argues the legislative history expresses a clear intent to require that an objecting plaintiff demonstrate removal was improvident, i.e., that all applicable jurisdictional requirements were <em>not </em>met. Specifically, Maytag points to language in the Senate Committee Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-11\">If a purported class action is removed pursuant to these jurisdictional provisions, the named plaintiff(s) should bear the burden of demonstrating that the removal was improvident (i.e., that the applicable jurisdictional requirements are not satisfied). And if a federal court is uncertain about whether \u201call matters in controversy\u201d in a purported class action \u201cdo not in the aggregate exceed the sum or value of $5,000,000,\u201d the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>should err in favor of exercising jurisdiction over the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">S.Rep. No. 109-14, at 42 (2005), as <em>reprinted in </em>2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 40; <em>see also </em>151 Cong. Rec. H728, H727 (2005) (statement of Rep. Sensenbrenner) (\u201cIf a purported class action is removed under these jurisdictional provisions, the named plaintiff(s) should bear the burden of demonstrating that removal was improper. And if a federal court is uncertain about whether the $5 million threshold is satisfied, the court should err in favor of exercising jurisdiction over the case.\u201d). Thus, Maytag concludes, the district court should have placed the burden on Miedema to prove that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">We disagree. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have, in detailed opinions, rejected the very kind of argument Maytag now presents. <em>See Brill v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>427 F.3d 446, 448 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that CAFA\u2019s \u201cnaked legislative history\u201d does not alter the well established rule that a proponent of subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of persuasion on the amount in controversy); <em>Abrego Abrego v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>443 F.3d 676, 686 (9th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\u201cCAFA\u2019s silence, coupled with a sentence in a legislative committee report untethered to any statutory language, does not alter the longstanding rule that the party seeking federal jurisdiction on removal bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction.\u201d). In <em>Evans </em>\u2014 which was decided after the instant case was fully briefed-this Circuit agreed with the Seventh and Ninth Circuits that \u201cCAFA does not upset the traditional rule that the removing party bears the burden of proof with regard to establishing federal court jurisdiction.\u201d 449 F.3d at 1164, 2006 WL 1374688, at *4. Moreover, this Circuit previously explained that, \u201c \u2018[wjhile a committee report may ordinarily be used to interpret unclear language contained in a statute, a committee report cannot serve as an <em>independent statutory source having the force of law.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Thigpen, </em>4 F.3d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc) (quoting <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local Union No. 474 v. NLRB, </em>814 F.2d 697, 712 (D.C.Cir.1987)); <em>cf. Rural Electrification Admin. v. Cent. La. Elec. Co., </em>354 F.2d 859, 865 (5th Cir.1966) (\u201cCertainly, the demands of Congressional Committees do not have the force of law.\u201d). Thus, \u201c \u2018courts have no authority to <em>enforce </em>principles gleaned <em>solely </em>from legislative history that has no statutory reference point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thigpen, </em>4 F.3d at 1577 (quoting <em>Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>814 F.2d at 712).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">For similar reasons, we also reject Maytag\u2019s argument, based on the legislative history described above, that the district court should have resolved any doubts about the amount in controversy in favor of finding jurisdiction. As with the burden of proof, CAFA itself is silent on the matter. The rule of construing removal statutes strictly and resolving doubts in favor of remand, however, is well-established. <em>See, e.g., Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number><em>Sheets, </em>313 U.S. 100, 108, 61 S.Ct. 868, 872, 85 L.Ed. 1214 (1941) (\u201c[T]he policy of the successive acts of Congress regulating the jurisdiction of federal courts is one calling for the strict construction of [removal statutes].\u201d); <em>Syngenta Crop. Prot., Inc. v. Henson, </em>537 U.S. 28, 32, 123 S.Ct. 366, 369, 154 L.Ed.2d 368 (2002) (\u201c[Statutory procedures for removal are to be strictly construed.\u201d); <em>Burns v. Windsor Ins. Co., </em>31 F.3d 1092, 1095 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[Removal statutes are construed narrowly; where plaintiff and defendant clash about jurisdiction, uncertainties are resolved in favor of remand.\u201d); <em>Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 411 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[A]ll doubts about jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of remand to state court\u201d). Statements in CAFA\u2019s legislative history, standing alone, are a insufficient basis for departing from this well-established rule. <em>See Thigpen, </em>4 F.3d at 1577; <em>cf. Abrego, </em>443 F.3d at 686; <em>Brill, </em>427 F.3d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Maytag contends that adherence to \u25a0these well-established rules runs contrary to \u201cone of the overriding purposes\u201d of CAFA, which Maytag characterizes as \u201cfixfing] the flaw in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and throwing] open the doors of the federal judiciary to defendants who are sued in state court class actions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the text of CAFA plainly expands federal jurisdiction over class actions and facilitates their removal, \u201c[w]e presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of established principles of state and federal common law, and that when it wishes to deviate from deeply rooted principles, it will say so.\u201d <em>United States v. Baxter Int'l, Inc., 345 </em>F.3d 866, 900 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see White v. Mercury Marine, Div. of Brunswick, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1428, 1434-35 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cCongress is assumed to act with the knowledge of existing law and interpretations when it passes new legislation.\u201d). For example, Congress inserted language into CAFA that clearly suspends the well-established rule of unanimity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for purposes of class action removals. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(b) (stating that a class action \u201cmay be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants\u201d); <em>Abrego Abrego, </em>443 F.3d at 681 (noting that \u00a7 1453 overrides the judicially developed requirement that each defendant consent to-removal). Likewise, Congress expressly imposed a special \u201crule of construction\u201d on CAFA\u2019s provisions requiring that certain state and federal officials be notified of proposed class action settlements. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715(f) (\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to expand the authority of, or impose any obligations, duties, or responsibilities upon, Federal or State officials.\u201d). Thus, Maytag\u2019s generalized appeals to CAFA\u2019s \u201coverriding purpose\u201d are unavailing in the face of CAFA\u2019s silence on the traditional, well-established rules that govern the placement of the burden of proof and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>resolution of doubts in favor of remand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-3\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err by placing the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction on Maytag, or by invoking the rule that doubts are to be resolved in favor of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">\n<em>C. Amount in Controversy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">\n<em>1. Standard of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">Maytag contends that, in order to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the amount in controversy (minimal diversity is not in dispute), the district court erroneously required it to \u201cprove with certainty\u201d the following: (1) \u201chow many of the ovens listed in [Miedema\u2019s] complaint were actually defective\u201d; (2) \u201cthe number of ovens located in Florida\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe price that each Florida customer paid for their Maytag oven.\u201d Such a high standard of proof, Maytag argues, essentially renders it impossible for manufacturers to meet CAFA\u2019s amount in controversy requirement. The district court, however, did not purport to require that Maytag prove the requisite amount in controversy \u201cwith certainty.\u201d To the contrary, the district court properly invoked the rule that \u201c[w]here, as here, the plaintiff has not pled a specific amount of damages, the removing defendant must prove by a <em>preponderance of the evidence </em>that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Williams v. Best Buy Co., Inc., </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis added). To determine whether this standard is met, a court first examines whether \u201cit is facially apparent from the complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the district court recognized, it is not facially apparent from Miedema\u2019s complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1320 (generalized claims for various types of damages did not establish \u201cthat the amount in controversy more likely than not exceeds $75,000\u201d). \u201cIf the jurisdictional amount is not facially apparent from the complaint, the court should look to the notice of removal and may require evidence relevant to the amount in controversy at the time the case was removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1319. The district court likewise performed this inquiry, and resolved the matter in favor of remand. Thus, Maytag\u2019s real dispute is not with the \u201cstandard of proof\u2019 per se, but the district court\u2019s assessment of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">\n<em>2. Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">In order to establish the amount in controversy, Maytag\u2019s notice of removal relied upon Jodi Jarrett\u2019s declaration that \u201ca total of 6,729 of the models of ranges/ovens identified in paragraph 22 of the Complaint were sold in Florida,\u201d and \u201c[t]he total value of those ranges/ovens is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>$5,931,971.\u201d The district court identified several problems with these claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-5\">Paragraph 21 of the complaint makes clear that Plaintiff is only pursuing relief \u201con behalf of herself and all other similarly situated consumers of Maytag ranges/ovens <em>that incorporate the defective motorized latch assembly, </em>as a statewide class action.\u201d (Emphasis added). Contrary to Defendant\u2019s contention, Plaintiff did not claim that all of the ranges/oven[s] of the models identified in paragraph 22 contained the defect. The affidavit attached to the Notice of Removal fails to confirm that each of the 6,729 units had the defective motorized door latch assembly. Instead, the affidavit only claims that \u201c6,729 of the models of ranges/ovens identified in paragraph 22 of the Complaint were sold in Florida.\u201d Paragraph 22 of the complaint is a list of the model numbers at issue. Further, the affidavit fails to define what is meant by the \u201ctotal value\u201d of those ranges/ovens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">Maytag challenges this analysis, noting that paragraph 22 of Miedema\u2019s original complaint simply identifies the putative class as <em>\u201c[afll </em>purchasers of Maytag ranges/ovens, in the State of Florida,\u201d that bear any of the listed model numbers, (emphasis added). When considered in conjunction with paragraph 21 of the original complaint, Maytag argues, paragraph 22 necessarily implies that <em>every </em>range/ oven which bears one of the listed model numbers and was purchased in Florida contains the motorized latch assembly alleged to be defective. The district court, Maytag suggests, must have confused paragraph 22 of Miedema\u2019s original complaint with paragraph 22 of her post-removal amended complaint, which identifies the putative class as <em>\u201call </em>purchasers of Maytag ranges/ovens, in the State of Florida, <em>which contain the allegedly defective motorized door latch assembly\u201d </em>and bear any of the listed model numbers, (emphasis added). This new class definition would better support the district court\u2019s reasoning, but may not be considered for purposes of determining subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Burns, </em>31 F.3d at 1097 n. 13 (\u201cJurisdictional facts are assessed on the basis of plaintiffs complaint <em>as of the time of removal.\u201d); Williams, </em>269 F.3d at 1319 (\u201c[A] district court may properly consider post-removal evidence in determining whether the jurisdictional amount was satisfied <em>at the time of removal\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">While we are not persuaded that the district court did in fact rely upon paragraph 22 of the post-removal amended complaint, we agree that, under the most logical reading of the original complaint, Miedema was alleging that all of the listed range/oven models sold in Florida contained the alleged defective motorized latch assembly. Thus, the district court should not have faulted Maytag for \u201cfail[ing] to confirm that each of the 6,729 units had the defective motorized door latch assembly.\u201d Notwithstanding this error, we agree with the district court that Maytag did not establish the requisite amount in controversy by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">As the district court pointed out, Jarrett\u2019s declaration offered no explanation as to how she arrived at the conclusion that the 6,729 range/oven units had a \u201ctotal value\u201d of $5,931,971. It appears from Jarrett\u2019s deposition that she was provided with the most recent manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (\u201cMSRP\u201d) for each model type at issue, but it is unclear whether those MSRPs would in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>reflect the compensatory damages, interest, and costs that Miedema seeks. Furthermore, Jarrett\u2019s statement that 6,729 of the range/oven models at issue were \u201csold\u201d in Florida is not based on actual sales data. As Jarrett\u2019s deposition reveals, that figure is merely a guess based on (1) Maytag\u2019s receipt of a total of 2,943 product registrations from Florida consumers for the range/oven models at issue, and (2) Maytag\u2019s estimate that, nationwide, only about 43.6% of the units it manufactures are registered by consumers. Even if we assume that this kind of estimation is reliable, it presumes that the rate of registration by Florida consumers closely parallels Maytag\u2019s national average.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">Given the particular facts and circumstances of the instant case, the district court did not err when it found that \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d remained about the amount in controversy, resolved that uncertainty in favor of remand, and concluded that Maytag had not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeded $5,000,000. Accordingly, remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">In resolving the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, the district court properly placed the burden of proof on the Maytag, the removing party, and did not err by applying the principle that doubts about jurisdiction are to be resolved in favor of remand. Furthermore, the district court did not err when it concluded Maytag had not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeded $5,000,000, as required by CAFA. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">Unless held by an active judge of this court, the mandate shall issue on June 22, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">.

Maytag cites <em>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>417 U.S. 188, 195, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 2228, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) (\"Although the [Equal Pay] Act is silent on this point, its legislative history makes plain that the Secretary has the burden of proof on this issue, as both of the courts below recognized.\u201d). <em>Corning Glass Worlcs, </em>however, does not actually stand for the proposition Maytag urges-that legislative history, coupled with statutory silence, is sufficient to <em>ovemde </em>an <em>already existing, </em>well-established rule allocating the burden of proof to a removing defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">. In fact, \u00a7 2(b) of CAFA describes its purposes as follows: (1) \"[to] assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members with legitimate claims\u201d; (2) \"[to] restore the intent of the framers of the United States Constitution by providing for federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance under diversity jurisdiction\u201d; and (3) \"[to] benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering consumer prices.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">. \"The unanimity requirement mandates that in cases involving multiple defendants, all defendants must consent to removal.\u201d <em>Russell Corp. v.

Notably, the standards urged by Maytag would leave courts with lingering doubts about the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. The mere fact that a plaintiff failed to prove that subject matter jurisdiction did <em>not </em>exist, for example, would not necessarily mean that subject matter jurisdiction <em>did </em>exist. As a result, class actions could conceivably proceed through removal, an initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c) appeal, discovery, and perhaps even summary judgment or trial before it became apparent that subject matter jurisdiction was in fact lacking. Such a result is difficult to reconcile with CAFA's apparent concern for the swift resolution of disputes over federal jurisdiction, as evidenced by the 7-day and 60-day deadlines imposed by \u00a7 1453(c). <em>Cf. Brill, </em>427 F.3d at 447 (\"[I]t is not enough to file a pleading and leave it to the court or the adverse party to negate jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">. The district court also found it significant that Maytag's calculation of the amount in controversy did not account for the effect of any applicable statutes of limitations. When determining the amount in controversy for jurisdictional purposes, however, courts cannot look past the complaint to the merits of a defense that has not yet been established. <em>See Johns-Manville Sales Corp. v. Mitchell Enters., Inc., </em>417 F.2d 129, 131(5th Cir.1969) (although state statute of limitations might in fact bar plaintiff from recovering a sum sufficient to trigger the jurisdictional threshold, \"this is a factual issue requiring an adjudication on the merits of this case,\u201d and the availability of the defense, even if apparent on the face of the complaint, \"does not operate to deprive the federal court of jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
