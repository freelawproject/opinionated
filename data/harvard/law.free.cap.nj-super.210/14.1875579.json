Arnold in his oral decision of June 21, 1985 on the cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">These are the material facts and circumstances: Allstate\u2019s policy provided PIP coverage for four cars owned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Petties family. Clark Petties, a son of Luther Petties, Sr. and Takuko Muto Petties, died of carbon monoxide by running one of the car\u2019s engines while it was parked in the garage of the bi-level, single-family home of the Petties. The father of decedent and a brother, Luther Petties, Jr., were asleep in separate bedrooms above the garage. Carbon monoxide seeped into the bedrooms, causing the death of Luther Petties, Sr. and personal injuries to Luther Petties, Jr. The incident causing Clark Petties\u2019 death occurred on January 12, 1984 when <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 provided coverage for family members like the Petties</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">... who sustained bodily injury as a result of an <em>accident </em>while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, or as a <em>pedestrian ... </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Prior to October 4, 1983 the statute provided coverage for \u201c... bodily injury as a result of an <em>accident involving </em>an automobile, ...\u201d [Emphasis added], Allstate recognizes that the term \u201caccident\u201d in this statute includes intentional suicide as determined in <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Co. v. Miller Est., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>183 (App.Div.1982), and plaintiffs concede that Luther Petties, Sr. and Luther Petties, Jr. were not \u201coccupying, entering into, alighting from or using\u201d the car. <em>Cf. Mondelli v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>167 (1986). Plaintiffs contend, however, that they are covered under the statute as \u201cpedestrians\u201d being struck by the fumes from the car. They rely upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(h) which defines a pedestrian as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">... any person who is <em>not </em>occupying, entering into, or alighting from a vehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed primarily for use on highways, rails and tracks. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">While the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act is to be construed liberally, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-16, and PIP coverage given the broadest application consistent with the statutory language, <em>Amiano v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>85 (1981), interpretations of legislation which lead to absurd or unreasonable results are to be avoided. <em>State v. Gill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>441, 444 (1966). Pedestrians are ordinarily understood to be persons travelling on foot, although they may be on roller skates, ice skates, stilts or crutches. <em>Cf. Eichinger v. Krouse, </em>105 <em>N.J.L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>402 (E. &amp; A. 1929); <em>Pekter v. Price, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355 (App.Div.1985). We agree with Judge Arnold\u2019s conclusion, however, that the Legislature did not intend that persons sleeping in their beds would be considered pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Finally, although the prior language of the statute providing coverage for bodily injury as a result of an accident \u201cinvolving an automobile\u201d might be broad enough to cover the present situation, the provision in force at the time of the incident here involved was more limited as to classes of persons protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
