We now affirm for the reasons given by him in his written opinion filed in the Law Division. By this affirmance we note that we disapprove of the opinions of the Law Division in <em>State v. Rowland, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558 (Law Div.1982), and <em>State v. Meisler, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307 (Law Div.1974), and approve of Judge Haines\u2019 opinion in <em>State v. Siris, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261 (Law Div.1983). We also note that we are aware of the recent rule amendment to <em>R. </em>4:73-1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adopted by the Supreme Court, effective January 2, 1986. The rule amendment adopts very broad disclosure requirements upon filing the complaint by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>State but does not deal with prelitigation statutory disclosure requirements. In the field of condemnation, \u201cgovernment has an overriding obligation to deal forthrightly and fairly with property owners.\u201d <em>F.M.C. Stores, Co. v.

The complaint shall include a statement showing the amount of compensation offered by the condemnor and a reasonable disclosure of the manner in which the amount has been calculated. Unless the court for good cause orders otherwise, reasonable disclosure by the condemnor shall include furnishing the condemnee with the map and description of land to be acquired and identity of improvements to be acquired, if any; a statement of the full fair market value including a description of the appraisal valuation method or methods relied upon as well as a breakdown of the appraised value allocated to the land to be acquired, and improvements to be acquired, if any; and data concerning comparable sales or leases relied upon in determining the amount of compensation offered which shall include names of seller and purchaser or landlord and tenant, location of property by block, lot, street, street number, and municipality, date of sale or date and duration of lease, the consideration for the sale or amount of rent, and book and page number of the recording of the deed; and any unusual factors known to the condemnor which may affect value.
