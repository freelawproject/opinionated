We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Certain facts are pertinent. On December 19, 1986, the defendant was involved in an automobile accident in Hartford. Hartford Patrolman Charles M. Allen was called to the scene of the accident. At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, Allen testified that at the scene of the accident the defendant had shown signs of intoxication and that he had required the defendant to perform a series of roadside sobriety tests. Those tests confirmed the officer\u2019s suspicions of intoxication. The defendant was arrested and transported to the state police barracks where he remained for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes before chemical tests for alcohol consumption were given. Allen testified that he had advised the defendant of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), including his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>consult with an attorney, \u201cwithin minutes\u201d before the defendant\u2019s test for alcohol consumption was given by the state police. The defendant testified that he had been told he had the right to refuse to take the tests and could opt to take a different test. He further testified that he understood the consequences of refusing to take the tests. The defendant had then submitted to two breath alcohol tests. The defendant also testified, however, that he had not been given <em>the Miranda </em>warnings and had not signed the form advising him that he had the right to consult with an attorney until <em>after </em>the tests were performed. The defendant subsequently filed a motion to suppress the results of the chemical breath tests performed after his arrest. After a hearing, the motion was denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The issue to be resolved is whether the results of the tests were obtained in compliance with the governing statutory requirements for ensuring that such tests are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sets forth six elements that must be satisfied for the admissibility of the results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of chemical analysis tests of a defendant\u2019s blood, breath or urine in a criminal prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a). The defendant\u2019s challenge relates to the first element, which provides that chemical analysis results are inadmissible unless the \u201cdefendant was afforded a reasonable opportunity to telephone an attorney prior to the performance of the test and consented to the taking of the test upon which such analysis is made . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (1). The defendant also claims that the state failed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (b), which essentially duplicates the requirements of \u00a7 14-227a (c) (1), in that they both require that the defendant be afforded a reasonable opportunity to telephone an attorney prior to the performance of the test. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The trial eourt found, from the evidence adduced at the hearing on the motion to suppress, that the defendant was afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with an attorney prior to submitting to the breath alcohol tests, that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given to the defendant were sufficient to advise the defendant of his right to consult with an attorney prior to taking the tests, that the defendant was advised of his right to refuse to take the breath test and of his option to take a different test, that the defendant understood the consequences of his refusal to take any test, that the defendant signed a waiver of rights form indicating consent, and that the defendant consented to the breath alcohol tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The defendant argues, however, that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given informed him only that he had a right to an attorney before answering any <em>questions, </em>not of his right to telephone an attorney prior to deciding whether or not to consent to take the chemical breath tests. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In interpreting the meaning or requirements of a statute, we rely on the traditional rules of statutory construction. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>194 Conn. 312, 320, 481 A.2d 31 (1984). It is a fundamental principle of construction that a statute such as \u00a7 14-227a (a), which imposes criminal liability, is to be strictly construed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983). This rule of strict construction, however, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>require that the most narrow, technical and exact meaning be given to the language of a statute in frustration of an obvious legislative intent. Id. The application of common sense to the language of a penal statute should not be exercised so as to result in absurdity or frustration of the evident design of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>7 Conn. App. 326, 334, 509 A.2d 518, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 807, 512 A.2d 231 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The language of \u00a7\u00a7 14-227b (b) and 14-227a (c) (1) indicates that their purpose is to ensure that the defendant is afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with an attorney before he submits to breath alcohol tests. A determination of what constitutes a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d is a question of fact for the trial court. See <em>Phillipe </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Conn. App. 471, 475, 489 A.2d 1056 (1985). It is not within this court\u2019s province to find facts or draw conclusions therefrom. As an appellate court, we review the factual findings of the trial court to ensure that they could have been legally, logically and reasonably found, thereby establishing that the trial court could reasonably conclude as it did. <em>Ruwet-Sibley Equipment Corporation </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>15 Conn. App. 21, 25, 542 A.2d 1171, cert. dismissed, 209 Conn. 806, 548 A.2d 437 (1988). The trial court reasonably could have concluded that the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing amply supported a finding that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to consult with an attorney prior to taking the breath alcohol tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a allows a defendant to enter a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search and seizure or from the denial of a motion to dismiss. That section provides: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure or motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law. The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In this case, the ground for the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, namely, that the results of the breath alcohol tests were obtained without compliance with applicable state statutory requirements, \u201cis not included within the statutory language [of General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a] allowing appeals from an illegal search or seizure in violation of the fourth amendment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>[198 Conn. 92, 99, 503 A.2d 136 (1985)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 43, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987). Jurisdiction arises however, from a rule of practice. Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Section 4003, which became effective October 1,1986, provides in pertinent part: \u201cappeals of RULINGS ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS OR SUPPRESS FOLLOWING JUDGMENTS ENTERED UPON CONDITIONAL PLEAS OF NOLO CONTENDERE</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\u201c(b) With the approval of the court, after a hearing to consider any objections thereto, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the judgment, to review of the adverse determination of any motion made prior to the close of evidence, which motion must be specified in such written reserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tion. If the defendant prevails on appeal, the judgment shall be set aside and the defendant shall be allowed to withdraw the conditional plea of nolo contendere after the case has been remanded to the trial court. The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to this subsection where the adverse determination of the specified motion would not have significant impact on the disposition of the cas\u00e9 in the trial court. The court shall also decline to accept such a nolo contendere or guilty plea where the record available for review of the ruling upon the specified motion is inadequate for appellate review of the court\u2019s determination thereof.\u201d See also general principles of jurisdiction set forth in <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 37, 355 A.2d 49 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>166 Conn. 501, 514, 353 A.2d 723 (1974); <em>In re Appeal of Dattilo, </em>136 Conn. 488, 492, 72 A.2d 50 (1950); <em>Walkinshaw </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 Conn. 122, 142, 32 A.2d 547 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201coperation while under the influence.
