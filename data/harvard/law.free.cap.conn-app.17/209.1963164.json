J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAz\">The defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction, rendered upon his conditional plea of nolo contendere, of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of failing to maintain a reasonable distance between vehicles in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-240. The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress two toxicological reports which contained the results of two blood tests administered on the evening of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Certain facts are pertinent. On November 7, 1986, at about 5:21 p.m., the defendant was operating his motor vehicle on Whitney Avenue in Hamden. Two vehicles, apparently preparing to make left turns, were stopped in front of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The defendant struck the vehicle in front of his car, and this vehicle collided with the vehicle in front of it. The officers who appeared on the scene noticed an odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath and asked him to perform a series of field sobriety tests. These tests confirmed the officers\u2019 suspicions of intoxication, and the defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The defendant consented to the administration of two blood tests that were performed at a hospital in New Haven. The first test was administered at approximately 7:34 p.m., and showed the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content to be above the allowable limit set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2). The second test was administered at 8:08 p.m., and also showed the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ant\u2019s blood alcohol level to be above the allowable limit. The results of both tests were reported in toxicological laboratory reports issued by the department of health services. These reports unequivocally indicated that the blood samples given by the defendant were sealed. The name of the officer who sealed the samples, however, was illegible in the first report and not given in the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the toxicological reports because (1) the reports did not meet the statutory conditions for admissibility under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c), and (2) the reports did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e) of the department of health services regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Before turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we must decide whether the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable. The defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere, conditional on the right to appeal the court\u2019s adverse determination of his motion to suppress the toxicological reports. In this case, the grounds for the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress are \u201c \u2018not included within the statutory language [of General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a] allowing appeals from ... an illegal search or seizure in violation of the fourth amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>16 Conn. App. 172, 173-74 n.1, 547 A.2d 77 (1988), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 43, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987). Jurisdiction arises, however, under Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (b) provides that the trial court must refuse to accept a conditional plea of nolo contendere \u201cwhere the adverse determination of the specified motion would not have a significant impact on the disposition of the case\u201d and \u201cwhere the record available for review of the ruling upon the specified motion is inadequate for appellate review . . . .\u201d In this case, the court accepted the plea without objection by the state. Implicit in the court\u2019s decision to accept the plea was the determination that the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress would have a significant impact on the outcome of the case. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 4003 (b) requires a formal statement by the court, on the record, that the adverse determination of the motion would have a significant impact on the case before it accepts a plea of conditional nolo contendere. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the toxicological reports because the general statutory conditions precedent contained in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>sibility of such reports were not met. The transcript of the proceedings on the motion to suppress indicates that the defendant\u2019s counsel was expressly asked by the court whether the basis for his motion to suppress was limited to the admissibility of the toxicological reports pursuant to \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e) of the department of health services regulations. The defendant\u2019s counsel agreed that this was the sole basis for the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, however, the defendant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>that an evidentiary hearing should have been held on whether the reports met the requirements of \u00a7 14-227a (c). The defendant may not seek appellate review of an evidentiary claim that was not distinctly raised in the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>16 Conn. App. 358, 362, 548 A.2d 718 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of sobriety tests contained in the two toxicological laboratory reports. These reports indicated that the signature of the officer who sealed the blood alcohol sample was not legible on the first report, and was omitted from the second report. General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) sets forth the six elements that must be satisfied before the results of chemical analysis tests of a defendant\u2019s blood, breath or urine are admissible in a criminal prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a). The defendant\u2019s challenge relates to the third element, which provides that chemical analysis results are inadmissible unless \u201cthe test was performed by or at the direction of a police officer according to <em>methods </em>. . . approved by the department of health services . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The \u201cmethod\u201d at issue in this case is -allegedly prescribed by \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e), a regulation promulgated by the department of health services in order to maintain the integrity of samples that are used to analyze the percentage of alcohol in a subject\u2019s blood. Section 14-227a-9 (e) states that: \u201cContainers and other equipment for sample collection shall be of a type which will preserve the integrity and suitability of the sample from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the time of collection until it is subjected to testing. The container for each sample shall be of a type which permits application of a seal for the closure. Only those samples which have been properly sealed shall be subjected to testing.\u201d The toxicological report forms that are prepared by the department of health services indicate that the officer who seals the samples should be identified. The defendant contends that this form is \u201cpart and parcel of the methods\u201d of sobriety testing mandated by \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e) of the department of health services pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (3). In essence, the defendant argues that because the forms were incomplete, the samples were not \u201cproperly sealed.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It is evident from the language of \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e) that the purpose of requiring a sealed container is to ensure that the sample reliably reflects the percentage of alcohol in the subject tested. The defendant does not argue that the containers that held his samples were unsealed. Rather, his concern is that the toxicological reports do not indicate <em>who </em>sealed the containers. This concern does not address the reliability of the samples taken, but is an attempt to exact form over substance. Moreover, the regulation at issue requires only that the sample be \u201cproperly sealed.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e). The regulation does not require that the form issued by the department of health services be signed by the officer who sealed the sample. As regulations that are promulgated under express legislative authorization have the force of law, we decline to read this requirement into \u00a7 14-227a-9 (e). <em>State </em>v. <em>Desso, </em>16 Conn. App. 165, 167-68 n.3, 547 A.2d 74 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) operation while under THE influence.
