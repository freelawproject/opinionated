The defendant challenges the constitutionality of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 54-47, which authorized a Superior Court judge to act as a grand juror. The defendant claims that the appointment of a member of the judiciary as a grand juror violated the separation of powers doctrine and deprived him of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">This court rejected identical claims raised by this same defendant in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rado, </em>14 Conn. App. 322, 541 A.2d 124, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 813, 546 A.2d 282, cert. denied, U.S. , 109 S. Ct. 311, 102 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1988). In that case, this court held that because the existence of an investigation by the grand jury is not generally violative of individual rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>and because the defendant did not establish that the investigation violated any of his personal rights, he lacked standing to challenge General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 54-47, authorizing such investigations. Furthermore, this court added that even if he had standing the defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that because General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 54-47 authorized a judge to perform the functions of a grand juror it was unconstitutional. That decision is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
