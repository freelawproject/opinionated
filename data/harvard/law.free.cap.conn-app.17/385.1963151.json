Police obtained four search warrants authorizing searches of (1) the defendant\u2019s residence, building 5, apartment 305, of the'P. T. Barnum Apartments in the city of Bridgeport, (2) a tan and orange Ford van without license plates located at the P. T. Barnum Apartments, (3) the person of the defendant\u2019s son, Dayomas Hamilton, and (4) the person of the defendant, Daisy Hamilton. Items listed in the warrants were cocaine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>paraphernalia used in the cutting and packaging of cocaine, money and records pertaining to sales of cocaine, and firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The police had applied for the warrants on the basis of information given to them by an informant that crack was being sold from the defendant\u2019s apartment and on the basis of their own observations of a subsequent \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d involving the defendant\u2019s son conducted with the participation of the informant. While conducting the controlled buy, Detective Richard DeReiso had observed the defendant\u2019s son escort the informant from the defendant\u2019s apartment to an unregistered Ford van located outside, which the defendant\u2019s son unlocked and entered. DeReiso observed the defendant\u2019s son exit the van and deliver the drugs to the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On February 18,1987, DeReiso and other police officers executed the warrants. Detective Thomas Russell was assigned to search the defendant\u2019s bedroom. In the course of searching the bedroom for narcotics, Russell came across a set of keys on a shelf. He did not seize the keys at that time. Shortly thereafter, when DeReiso entered the apartment and asked whether anyone had found keys to a Ford vehicle, Russell then took the keys and gave them to DeReiso. The keys, in fact, opened the Ford van described in the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, defense counsel argued that the keys should be suppressed because they had not been listed in the search warrant and, therefore, the seizure of the keys was illegal. The state argued that the keys were admissible under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, holding that the seizure of the keys was not legal under the plain view exception because the keys had not been discovered inadvertently. Thereafter, because the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>represented that it had planned to show the defendant\u2019s complicity in the crime by proving that the keys to the van had been found in her apartment, the court agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice and granted the state permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The sole issue presented to us is whether the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the Ford van keys on the ground that the keys were seized in violation of the defendant\u2019s right under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. The state argues that the seizure was reasonable under the plain view exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Generally, police executing a search warrant may seize only those items specified in the warrant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pepe, </em>176 Conn. 75, 79, 405 A.2d 51 (1978), citing <em>Marron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U.S. 192, 196, 48 S. Ct. 74, 72 L. Ed. 231 (1927). An exception to this general rule has been recognized, however, in certain circumstances. Where a police officer has a warrant to search a given area for specified objects, and in the course of the search comes across some other article of incriminating character, the property may be seized under the plain view exception. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pepe, </em>supra, 79. The plain view exception will thus validate a seizure of items not specified in a warrant where (1) the initial intrusion is lawful, (2) the discovery of the evidence is inadvertent, and (3) the seizing officers have reason to believe that the seized items are evidence of a crime. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>DiStefano, </em>7 Conn. App. 726, 730, 510 A.2d 995 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In this case, the trial court found that the keys to the Ford van seized by the police during the search had not been discovered inadvertently within the meaning of the plain view exception and that the seizure was therefore not lawful under that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">On appeal, the function of this court is limited to determining whether the decision of the trial court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 79, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984). The evaluation of the credibility of witnesses testifying at a hearing on a motion to suppress is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 80. This court cannot find facts or draw conclusions from primary facts found, but can only review such findings to determine whether they could legally, logically and reasonably be found. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>3 Conn. App. 359, 364, 488 A.2d 837 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">For a discovery to be inadvertent within the meaning of the plain view exception, police must not have anticipated the discovery or have known in advance the location of the evidence. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 739,103 S. Ct. 1535, 75 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1983); <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 470-71, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971). A discovery is inadvertent if it occurs \u201cwithout premeditation or prior intention.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>$10,000 in U.S. Currency, </em>780 F.2d 213 (2d Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Our review of the testimony presented in this case reveals ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the discovery of the van keys was not \u201cinadvertent\u201d within the meaning of the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. DeReiso\u2019s testimony indicated that he had reason to believe, prior to the procurement of the warrants, that the van was ordinarily locked<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the keys were kept in the defendant\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was also evidence from which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>trial court could conclude that DeReiso had entered the defendant\u2019s apartment with the specific purpose of locating the keys.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the basis of DeReiso\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the trial court could reasonably conclude that the keys were not inadvertently discovered in the course of the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment within the meaning of the plain view exception and that seizure of the keys was therefore not justified by that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> In describing what he observed when the defendant\u2019s son and the informant were at the Ford van under his surveillance, DeReiso testified: \u201cThey went to a van that\u2019s parked right outside. The son went to the door. <em>1 believe it was locked, </em>because he was at the door for a little while. Then he opened the door.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> DeReiso testified on cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">\u201cQ. [Y]ou had some reasonable assumption that the keys were in the apartment because your investigation indicated the son of the defendant had the key. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b412-5\"> DeReiso testified on cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201cQ. Now let\u2019s go to the search at Daisy Hamilton\u2019s apartment. . . . You walked in \u2014 were you the first person in, that you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">\u201cQ. You were the first person to talk to Daisy Hamilton. Weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cA. Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">\u201cQ. And you said to Daisy Hamilton, if the keys to a van parked outside were in the apartment, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I probably asked her if they were there, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. If the keys to a van \u2014 I\u2019m quoting from the discovery \u2014 if the keys to a van parked outside were in the apartment. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">\u201cA. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">\u201cQ. And her answer was, I don\u2019t know who the van belongs to, nor do I know where the keys are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-15\">\u201cA. That I can recall, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-16\">\u201cQ. Now that was done seven days more or less after you saw the controlled buy on February 11th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-17\">\u201cA. The 6th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-18\">\u201cQ. Ultimately, you called out to the men in the apartment has anybody found keys to a Ford van. Didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-19\">\u201cA. I doubt if I yelled out, but I probably did talk to the guys and asked them. I asked if anybody had located keys to a Ford van. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-20\">\u201cQ. As these men were searching, did you ask, have any of you found Ford keys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-21\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-22\">\u201cQ. So it\u2019s a fair statement that when you went into the apartment, you were looking for the keys to the Ford van. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-23\">\u201cA. Later on, yes. When she didn\u2019t give up any keys, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-24\">\u201cQ. When you went into the apartment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-25\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-26\">\u201cQ. \u2014you had some reasonable assumption that the keys were in the apartment because your investigation indicated the son of the defendant had the key. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-27\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-28\">\u201cQ. And there was a search warrant for the orange Ford van. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-29\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-30\">\u201cQ. And when you went in, you did immediately ask Mrs. Hamilton if she had the keys to the Ford van. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-31\">\u201cA. Probably not immediately, but in our first conversation, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-32\">\u201cQ. And then after the search went underway, you then alerted by asking the men, have any of you found Ford van keys. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-33\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cQ. So that they were then directed to go looking specifically for Ford van keys. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">\u201cA. I asked them if they had found any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-14\">\u201cQ. And that was if you found any, and if not, you will look to see if there were. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-15\">\u201cA. If they came across them while they were searching, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
