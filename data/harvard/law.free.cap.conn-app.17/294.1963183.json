After the pleadings were closed, the case was referred to an attorney trial referee pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the trial referee issued a report that included his recommendation that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The trial court accepted the trial referee\u2019s findings of fact, but rejected his conclusions of law and rendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment and claims that the trial court erred (1) in rendering its decision in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>with Practice Book \u00a7 546J, rather than Practice Book \u00a7 443, (2) in accepting a particular fact found by the trial referee, and (3) in rejecting the trial referee\u2019s legal conclusions. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The following facts were found by the attorney trial referee and accepted by the court. The plaintiff is a licensed real estate brokerage company. The defendants, Alan and Keith Weiner, are business partners, and Keith Weiner owned a parcel of commercial real estate in Brookfield. The plaintiff, through its agent, Jerome Kovacs, approached the defendants to lease this property for a client. On or about November 18,1983, Alan Weiner signed a real estate listing agreement prepared by the plaintiff, which left blank the designated space for entry of the dollar amount of the plaintiff\u2019s commission. The contract was then forwarded to the plaintiff who signed it and filled in some of the missing information, including its address and commission rate which was stated as \u201cfive dollars per square foot with escalation.\u201d A photocopy of the agreement, containing the additions and an attached rate schedule, was returned to the defendants. Among the attachments were provisions for the payment of interest on overdue accounts and attorney fees for the collection of a commission. After two months of negotiations between the defendants and the plaintiff\u2019s client, the parties executed a lease agreement. Kovacs was an active participant in those negotiations, and the lease named the plaintiff as broker for the property. In February, the plaintiff sent the defendants a bill for its commission in the amount of $27,400. The defendants refused to pay that amount, and the plaintiff brought this action to recover its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The plaintiffs first claim is that the trial court erroneously referred to Practice Book \u00a7 546J<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ity for its decision and, as a result, treated the attorney trial referee as a \u201cfact-finder.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While we agree that the trial court\u2019s reference to Practice Book \u00a7 546J was improper, we conclude that it nevertheless acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">It is undisputed that the attorney trial referee in this case was appointed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and not General Statutes \u00a7 52-549n.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>These two statutes authorize the appointment of qualified members of the bar to sit as adjuncts to the trial bench in nonjury cases for the purpose of accelerating the disposition of cases. While attorney referees appointed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434a (4) are authorized to hear a broader assortment of disputes involving greater monetary value, those appointed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-549n are referred to as \u201cfact-finders\u201d and possess less authority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-549n; Practice Book \u00a7 546D. Proceedings before attorney trial referees appointed in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4) are governed by the procedures set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 434 through \u00a7 444. <em>Ruhl </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>5 Conn. App. 104, 105, 496 A.2d 994 (1985). \u201cIn like manner, Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 546B-546K control the referral of cases to the newly created factfinders under General Statutes \u00a7 52-549n . . . .\u201d <em>E. I. Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scinto, </em>12 Conn. App. 348, 352, 527 A.2d 1195 (1987). Therefore, the plaintiff is correct that because the attorney trial referee in this case was appointed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4), the trial court should have cited Practice Book \u00a7 443<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as the authority for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The plaintiff argues that Practice Book \u00a7 443 provides no authority for the action taken by the trial court in this case. Instead, it claims that Practice Book \u00a7 443 required the trial court to remand the matter to the same or a different trial referee when it determined that the attorney referee made a \u201cmaterial error.\u201d The question for us to decide, therefore, is whether the trial court had the authority, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 443, to reject the attorney trial referee\u2019s legal conclusions and render judgment for the defendant contrary to the trial referee\u2019s recommendation. We conclude that the trial court was authorized to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">While the two referral programs differ in name, source of appointment and scope of authority, under both programs the referees \u201cshare the same function of factfinders \u2018whose determination of the facts is reviewable in accordance with well established procedures prior to the rendition of judgment by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>E. I. Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Scinto, </em>supra, quoting <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 502, 508 A.2d 415 (1986). Under either program, there is no authority to render judgments. <em>Health Planning Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Whitlock, </em>12 Conn. App. 190, 193, 529 A.2d 1352 (1987). Thus, \u201chaving no power to render a judgment, an attorney referee is <em>simply a factfinder . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Our rules of practice outline the functions and duties of attorney referees and factfinders and place an affirmative obligation on them to report to the court the \u201cfacts found and the conclusions drawn therefrom.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 434; see also Practice Book \u00a7 456g. Although the rules make no reference to any additional duties, they <em>permit </em>attorney referees to express their views on questions of law. Practice Book \u00a7 434; Practice Book \u00a7 546g; <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 509-10. Our Supreme Court has concluded that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>fact that the attorney referee went beyond the bare statutory requirement of reporting the facts found by including his opinion upon the legal issues involved in the case did not transform his role into a judicial one. The views of a committee upon the law carry no more force than those of the parties in their arguments at the hearing before the court that is to enter judgment. See <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>98 Conn. 393, 396, 119 A. 361 (1923); <em>Stehlin-Miller-Henes Co. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>97 Conn. 657, 665, 117 A. 811 (1922).\u201d <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 510.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 443 specifically provides that \u201c[t]he court shall render such judgment as the law requires upon the facts in the report as it may be corrected.\u201d \u201cThe reviewing court is the effective arbiter of the law and the legal opinions of a committee, like those of the parties, though they may be helpful, carry no weight not justified by their soundness as viewed by the court that renders judgment.\u201d <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra; see also <em>Rowan Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Hassane, </em>17 Conn. App. 71, 549 A.2d 1085 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Our case law is clear that under either referral program the attorney referee is simply a factfinder whose legal conclusions are merely advisory, and the trial court therefore has the inherent authority to reject legal recommendations. We conclude that the language in Practice Book \u00a7 443 that requires the trial court to remand a case to the original referee or a different one where it finds the referee \u201cmaterially erred in its rulings,\u201d refers to the attorney referee\u2019s findings of fact and <em>not </em>to his or her conclusions of law. Therefore, since attorney trial referees appointed under General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4) are factfinders whose conclusions of law are not binding on the trial court, it was not error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>for the trial court to reject the trial referee\u2019s conclusions of law. Although the trial court referred to the incorrect rule of practice in rendering its decision, we will not reverse that decision because we find the trial court reached the correct result. <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to consider its objection to a particular fact as found by the attorney trial referee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not file a motion to correct the findings of the attorney trial referee<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or object to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the report<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as required by our rules of practice. Instead of filing its own objection, the plaintiff now relies upon its memorandum in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>opposition to the defendants\u2019 objections to the attorney trial referee\u2019s report in which it merely stated its disagreement with the trial referee\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s notation in its memorandum opposing the defendants\u2019 objections is not a substitute for filing a proper motion in accordance with our rules of procedure. Since the plaintiff has failed to follow the appropriate procedural guidelines as required by the rules, we are precluded from reviewing its claim. <em>Dorsen </em>v. <em>Kay, </em>13 Conn. App. 645, 650, 538 A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 805, 545 A.2d 1102 (1988); <em>LiVolsi </em>v. <em>Pylypchuk, </em>12 Conn. App. 527, 528, 532 A.2d 593 (1987). \u201c \u2018A litigant cannot wholly ignore established procedures for the protection of [its] rights, as [the plaintiff] has done, and hope to receive on appeal the same treatment accorded to those who follow the rules of practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorsen </em>v. <em>Kay, </em>supra, 650, quoting <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 518. We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim of error is that the trial court erred in rejecting the attorney trial referee\u2019s recommendations and finding that the listing agreement signed by the defendants did not comply with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>was, therefore, invalid. The attorney trial referee found, and the trial court agreed, that the listing agreement signed by the defendants did not include the amount of the plaintiffs commission or any attachments with respect to the plaintiffs rate schedule. On December 1, 1983, the plaintiff sent the defendant a photocopy of the agreement. This copy contained a number of additions which were inserted by the plaintiff including, the plaintiffs signature, the amount of its commission and an attached rate schedule. In addition to these factual findings, the attorney trial referee made a number of legal conclusions and recommended that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff. In rejecting the trial referee\u2019s legal conclusions, the trial court found that the attorney trial referee erred as a matter of law in concluding (1) that the plaintiff \u201creformed\u201d the agreement when it attached the commission schedule and sent it to the defendant on December 1, 1983, and (2) that the defendants were \u201cestopped\u201d from denying responsibility under the altered instrument by accepting the plaintiff\u2019s services. The trial court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 20-235a (b), by omitting the amount of its commission from the contract when it was signed by the defendants, rendered the contract unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that no legal contract was created is erroneous for two reasons.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> First, the plaintiff argues that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>erred in accepting the trial referee\u2019s factual finding that the listing agreement signed by the defendants on November 18, 1983, did not contain any attachments with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s commission. As we concluded above, the plaintiff\u2019s claim for review of this factual determination is precluded because the plaintiff failed to file the proper objections to the factfinder\u2019s report as required by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 438 and 440.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This factual conclusion, therefore, must stand. <em>Suppa Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Structures, Inc., </em>12 Conn. App. 675, 677, 533 A.2d 901 (1987); <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra; see also <em>Midland Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Technology, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 518, 521-22, 508 A.2d 427 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s second argument is that, even if there were no attachments to the agreement when it was signed by the defendants, the original document and the December 1,1983 photocopy of that document with the insertion of the plaintiff\u2019s commission rate and attached rate schedule, read together, created a valid contract pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201c \u2018On appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. [Practice Book \u00a7 4061]. [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u2019 <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); <em>Cookson </em>v. <em>Cookson, </em>201 Conn. 229, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>242-43, 514 A.2d 323 (1986).\u201d <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 246, 242-43, 524 A.2d 610 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Our Supreme Court has found that listing contracts are governed exclusively by General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a. <em>William Pitt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>186 Conn. 82, 84, 438 A.2d 1206 (1982). That statute provides that a licensed real estate broker may bring an action to recover a commission, only if he enters into a contract that complies with the requirements enumerated in the statute. <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>184 Conn. 228, 230, 439 A.2d 946 (1981); <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Schweir, </em>7 Conn. App. 709, 713, 510 A.2d 215 (1986). To comply with the requirements of that section, the contract must include a number of essential terms including \u201cthe conditions of such contract.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b) (4). The rate of a broker\u2019s commission is an essential term of a broker\u2019s contract that must be included in the contract. See <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>189 Conn. 52, 453 A.2d 771 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u201cThis statute has been viewed by our courts as being mandatory and subject to strict construction. See, e.g., <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>supra (signature by owner\u2019s agent not in compliance with statute as then worded); <em>Hossan </em>v. <em>Hudiakoff, </em>178 Conn. 381, 383, 423 A.2d 108 (1979) (lack of address of broker [fatal to claim]); <em>Arruda Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Doyon, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 617, 620, 401 A.2d 625 (1978) (lack of address of owner [fatal to claim]). \u2018A broker who does not follow the mandate of the statute does so at his peril.\u2019 <em>Thornton Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>supra, 230-31.\u201d <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Schweir, </em>supra, 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The plaintiff is correct that \u201cseparate documents will be deemed to constitute a valid contract under \u00a7 20-325a (b) if they collectively satisfy the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>requirements <em>and relate to the same agreement. [Good </em>v. <em>Paine Furniture Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 24, 27, 391 A.2d 741 (1978)]. It is not within the power of courts to create new and different agreements. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>164 Conn. 369, 375, 321 A.2d 444 (1973).\u201d <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>supra, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">There is no merit to the plaintiffs claim that the combination of the original November contract, signed by the defendant, which made no reference to the plaintiffs commission, and the subsequent photocopy of that document in which plaintiff filled in its commission and attached a rate schedule, was sufficient to satisfy the strict requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b). In this case, neither document \u201cpoints unquestionably to the other document so as to create a consistent contract.\u201d <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahern Development Corporation, </em>supra, 56. The original contract does not refer to a subsequent document. Nor does the December 1 letter with its attachments refer unequivocally to the original contract. Furthermore, this statute requires not only that the contract contain all the essential terms of the agreement but also specifically requires that the document \u201cbe signed by the owner . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b) (5). Although the defendant signed the original document, he did not sign the later document in which the plaintiff inserted the price of its commission. We agree with the trial court that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs subsequent efforts to create a valid contract by attaching the rate schedule cannot legally alter the terms of the contract <em>after </em>it was signed by the defendant.\u201d We will not attribute to the owner a commission price inserted at a later time by the broker, especially under the circumstances of this case, in which the amount of the commission was the disputed issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that the listing agreement was not a valid contract in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4) provides: \u201cIn addition to the state referees who are appointed pursuant to subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this section, the chief justice may appoint, from qualified members of the bar of the state, as many state referees as he may from time to time deem advisable or necessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 546J. \u2014action by court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">\u201cAfter review of the finding of facts and hearing on any objections thereto, the court may take the following action: (1) render judgment in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>with the finding of facts; (2) reject the finding of facts and remand the case to the fact-finder who originally heard the matter for a rehearing on all or part of the finding of facts; (3) reject the finding of facts and remand the matter to another fact-finder for rehearing; (4) reject the finding of facts and revoke the reference; (5) remand the case to the fact-finder who originally heard the matter for a finding on an issue raised in an objection which was not addressed in the original finding of facts; or (6) take any other action the court may deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\u201cThe court may correct a finding of facts at any time before accepting it, upon the written stipulation of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201cThe fact-finder shall not be called as a witness, nor shall the decision of the fact-finder be admitted into evidence at another proceeding ordered by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\"> The objectionable portion of the trial court\u2019s decision is as follows: \u201cAccordingly, the court sustains the defendants\u2019 objections to acceptance of the Fact-finder\u2019s report.

In light of these concessions we consider these arguments waived. We note, however, that this court decisively held in <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Marano, </em>13 Conn. App. 527, 530-31, 537 A.2d 1036, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 809, 541 A.2d 1238 (1988), that the theory of equitable estoppel does not apply to actions brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a. Furthermore, we agree with the trial court\u2019s well reasoned opinion that reformation is an equita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ble remedy <em>\u201cgranted by a court </em>to reform a written agreement to mirror the parties\u2019 intentions.

As such, one of the parties cannot reform it; the changes made by the plaintiff constitute an alteration of the contract.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> See footnotes 8 and 9 supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
