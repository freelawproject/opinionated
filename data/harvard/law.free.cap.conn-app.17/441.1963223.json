The administrator found that the claim was valid and awarded benefits, charging the account of Birdseye, a previous employer. Birdseye appealed and an appeals referee conducted a hearing, made findings of fact, affirmed the decision of the administrator and dismissed the appeal. Birdseye then appealed to the Superior Court which rendered judgment dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">On an appeal from a decision of the board of review, the trial court does not try the matter de novo but is bound by the finding of subordinate facts and reasonable factual conclusions made by the appeals referee where the board of review has adopted those findings and affirmed the decision of the referee. <em>Valley Surgical Group, P.C. </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>6 Conn. App. 588, 589-90, 506 A.2d 1075, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 802, 509 A.2d 516 (1986). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s function is to determine, on the record, whether the referee acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally. Conclusions of law reached by the referee must stand if they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d Id., 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The appeals referee found the following facts. Charges were assessed as a result of an award of benefits commencing March 11, 1984. The claimant was employed as a security guard by Birdseye from November, 1982, until he was removed by Birdseye from this employment effective June 4, 1983. He worked for Birdseye on a part-time basis and was simultaneously employed on a part-time basis as a security guard by Executive House Corporation. Birdseye and Executive House are distinct corporate entities, although the same individuals are involved in the management of each. Miller put in forty hours during each week of his joint employment, and his salary was charged to each company according to the services he provided to it. As of June 4, 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the management of the companies decided to assign Miller exclusively to guard property and premises of Executive House, with no change in his duties or hourly rate. Miller became a full-time employee of Executive House as of June 5, 1983, and was removed from the payroll of Birdseye for that reason. No act of impropriety on the part of Miller was a factor in the employer\u2019s decision to assign him exclusively to the Executive House payroll; this decision was prompted entirely by the needs of the employer. Subsequent to the termination at issue but prior to the initiation of a claim for benefits, Miller worked elsewhere and earned covered wages in an amount exceeding ten times his weekly benefit rate. The appeals referee con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>eluded that the circumstances surrounding the termination do not permit a denial of benefits and that an award of benefits subsequent to the termination requires imposition of merit rating charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Birdseye challenges the conclusion that the circumstances surrounding Miller\u2019s termination do not permit the denial of benefits on two grounds. Birdseye claims first that Miller was not eligible for benefits because when he left Birdseye he was not unemployed. Second, Birdseye claims that its account should not have been charged because Miller was <em>\u201ca </em>person who leaves part-time work to accept full-time work\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) (iv).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>We agree with the trial court that Miller\u2019s eligibility for benefits from Birdseye after separation from a subsequent employer is not an issue, and that the only relevant issue is Birdseye\u2019s chargeability as a base year employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-225a (b) (2) provides in pertinent part: \u201cWith respect to each benefit year commencing on or after July 1,1978, regular and additional benefits paid to an individual shall be allocated and charged to the accounts of the employers who paid him wages in his base period . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-230 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn individual\u2019s benefit year shall commence with the beginning of the week with respect to which he has filed a valid initiating claim and shall continue through the Saturday of the fifty-first week following the week in which it commenced .... The base period of a benefit year shall be the first four of the five most recently completed calendar quarters prior to such benefit year . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Birdseye was clearly an employer during the base period and subject to charge for an award of benefits paid upon separation from a subsequent employer. A base period employer is relieved of charges upon separation from a subsequent employer and ensuing unemployment only if separation from the base period employer occurred under the conditions specified in General Statutes \u00a7 31-225a (c) (1) (E). <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Miller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>termination by Birdseye did not occur under any of the conditions specified. Birdseye claims that because Miller was not unemployed when he was terminated by Birdseye, he was not eligible for benefits and Birdseye should not have been charged. That is not a valid claim for relief from chargeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The second claim made by Birdseye is also without merit. Birdseye asserts that it is protected from charge-ability because Miller left part-time work to accept full-time work within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) (iv). The appeals referee found that the management of Birdseye and Executive House decided to assign Miller exclusively to guard property and premises of Executive House, that Miller then became a full-time employee of Executive House and was removed from the Birdseye payroll, and that the decision was prompted entirely by the needs of the employer. We agree with the trial court that on these facts the appeals referee and the board of review could reasonably conclude that Miller did not leave part-time work to accept full-time work. The construction placed upon \u00a7 31-236 (2) (B) (iv) by the agency responsible for administration of the unemployment compensation laws is entitled to deference from us. <em>Fellin </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 440, 448, 493 A.2d 174 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We cannot say that the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous. Its decision was logically correct and in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> The referee\u2019s finding was that as of June 4,1984, management decided to assign the claimant exclusively to guard property and premises belonging to the Executive House. It is obvious from the record that the actual date was June 4, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-236 provides in part: \u201cdisqualifications.
