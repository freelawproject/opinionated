On March 11, 1985, the defendant was sentenced to a prison term of not less than ten nor more than twenty years. On this appeal, he claims that the trial court erred (1) in denying his motion to dismiss which he based on the state\u2019s failure to effect a timely arrest, (2) in not instructing the jury on the defense of self-defense with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree, (3) in refusing to admit certain prior convictions of the victim, (4) in refusing to admit descriptions of the victim\u2019s violent habits, specific acts and reputation for carrying a gun, and (5) in refusing to instruct the jury on criminally negligent homicide. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following: On January 27, 1981, the defendant was involved in an altercation with James \u201cBro\u201d Robinson at the VIP Lounge in Hartford. The fight inside the bar moved outside where the defendant fired six gunshots into Robinson in rapid succession. The entire incident occurred within a few moments, the shots were fired almost at the instant Hall and Robinson exited the VIP Lounge, and there was no evidence presented as to which of the shots were the fatal ones. The defendant left the scene immediately after the shooting. Other facts relevant to the issues in this appeal will be discussed, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Before reaching the principal claim of error relating to the defendant\u2019s trial, we address his contention that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the murder charge because of prearrest delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The defendant argues that the three and one-half year period required to locate him violated both his due process rights and his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that his sixth amendment right arose as of the date the arrest warrant issued, and that his fourteenth amendment due process rights were violated by the unavailability of witnesses due to the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The undisputed facts relevant to this claim are as follows. Shortly after the shooting on January 27, 1981, the defendant drove to Hartford Hospital to obtain emergency medical care for lacerations. He immediately left the hospital without giving any substantive information about his wounds and without paying. He and his girlfriend then drove to her home in New Britain where the defendant had been living. The defendant packed and left for another friend\u2019s house in New Britain. Several weeks later, he moved to Oregon where he resided until his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is clear that although the police asked the defendant\u2019s mother to have him contact them, the defendant never did so; nor did he ever inquire about the extent of Robinson\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>At trial, several Hartford police officers testified as to the efforts made to locate the defendant after the shooting. The immediate efforts of the police included the following: (1) interviews with the victim\u2019s girlfriend and the defendant\u2019s mother; (2) a surveillance of the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s residence and the housing project where the defendant was reported to have been living with his girlfriend; (3) a records check on the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s surname, Vandeberg, that revealed the alias \u201cHall\u201d; (4) the distribution of the defendant\u2019s mug shots to Hartford police officers; (5) the entry of all vital information on the defendant and his vehicle into the National Crime Information computer; and (6) the acquisition of an arrest warrant for the defendant on January 28, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Additionally, the principal investigating officer, Peter Darby, checked with the state police of each of the New England states and requested that they run checks on any of the defendant\u2019s relatives living there. The police also conducted periodic surveillances of a Bloomfield residence where it was believed the defendant\u2019s father lived. In April, 1981, the police discovered the defendant\u2019s car being driven in New Britain by a man who had purchased the vehicle from the defendant\u2019s girlfriend. Thereafter, Darby followed many leads in the New Britain area in an attempt to locate the defendant. All efforts were unsuccessful, and the police then considered the case \u201cinactive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In the summer of 1984, the defendant\u2019s employer, a bus company in Oregon, conducted a background check on him through the National Crime Information computer. The Hartford police were alerted, and the defendant was arrested on June 15, 1984. Waiving extradition, he was returned to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s claim that his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial was violated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>delay in arresting him. The issuance of an arrest warrant in and of itself does not trigger the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial of a person not yet arrested. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>202 Conn. 443, 452 n.13, 521 A.2d 1034 (1987). \u201cAbsent a formal charge, the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial does not extend to the period prior to the arrest. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 321, 92 S. Ct. 455, 30 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>supra, 453 n.13. The delay in this case relates to the period of time before the defendant was arrested or formally charged by information or indictment. Accordingly, the sixth amendment provides no basis for his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s alternative claim that the prearrest delay violated his fourteenth amendment due process rights, we again disagree. \u201cIn order to establish a due process violation because of preaccusation delay, the defendant must show both that actual substantial prejudice resulted from the delay and that the reasons for the delay were wholly unjustifiable, as where the state seeks to gain a tactical advantage over the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 522, 498 A.2d 76 (1985). \u201c[T]he due process inquiry must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 790, 97 S. Ct. 2044, 52 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1977); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>supra. \u201cIn considering whether an excessive delay requires the dismissal of an indictment, a court must first determine whether the defendant suffered <em>actual </em>prejudice because of the delay. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carrath, </em>699 F.2d 1017, 1019 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1038, 104 S. Ct. 698, 79 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1984).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Horowitz, </em>756 F.2d 1400, 1405, (9th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 822, 106 S. Ct. 74, 88 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>From our careful review of the record before us, we find nothing from which we can conclude (1) that the reasons for the delay were unjustifiable or occasioned by the police so as to give them a tactical advantage over the defendant, or (2) that the delay resulted in prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s arguments relating to this claim ignore the obvious role the defendant himself played in the delay about which he so vigorously protests. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the three and one-half year delay between the incident and the defendant\u2019s arrest did not violate his right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We now turn to the dispositive issue in this case. The defendant argues that he was entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of self-defense with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree, and that the trial court erred in refusing to give his requested instruction. The court did submit manslaughter in the second degree to the jury as a lesser included offense, but specifically instructed the jury that the defense of self-defense did not apply to that offense. The state contends that the trial court did not err and bases its claim on the following grounds: (1) there was insufficient evidence at trial to warrant a self-defense instruction; (2) the self-defense instruction is inconsistent with the elements of manslaughter in the second degree; (3) the court\u2019s instruction on self-defense for murder and manslaughter in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>degree was sufficient in that the jury\u2019s rejection of self-defense, as evidenced by the defendant\u2019s conviction of manslaughter in the first degree, renders the failure to instruct on manslaughter in the second degree academic; and (4) the defendant\u2019s requested instruction was an erroneous statement of Connecticut law. We will address these issues in the order in which the state has presented them.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">A defendant is entitled to the requested instruction of self-defense under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whenever there is sufficient evidence at trial to raise a reasonable doubt concerning justification. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassino, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>188 Conn. 237, 243, 449 A.2d 154 (1982); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Folson, </em>10 Conn. App. 643, 646-47, 525 A.2d 126 (1987). The state has the burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We first review the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to the instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>supra, 275; <em>State </em>v. <em>Folson, </em>supra, 647. We find that the evidence provided a sufficient basis for the self-defense instruction. At trial, there was evidence presented to the jury that the defendant, confronted with an acknowledged violent person during a rapidly escalating verbal and physical altercation, fired six gunshots into the victim as that altercation spilled into the street. The defendant testified that the victim was armed with a gun, that he was fearful for his life, that he was trying to protect himself and that he did not intend to kill the victim. \u201c \u2018[A] defendant is \u201centitled to have instructions presented related to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>435 F.2d 789, 792 (2d Cir. 1970), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>237 F.2d 466, 474 n.8 (2d Cir. 1956).\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alfonso-Perez, </em>535 F.2d 1362, 1365 (2d Cir. 1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>supra, 278; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Folson, </em>supra, 646. Against this standard, the evidence of justification was sufficient for the trial court to have presented the theory of self-defense for consideration by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">INCOMPATIBILITY OF MANSLAUGHTER IN THE SECOND DEGREE AND SELF-DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Our next inquiry focuses on the state\u2019s claim that the defense of justification is inconsistent with the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of manslaughter in the second degree. The state\u2019s argument evinces the difficulty involved in determining the defendant\u2019s state of mind regarding two interrelated concepts, the justifiability of action required for the defense and the unjustifiability of risk required for commission of the crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court has dealt with a similar problem regarding a jury\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s state of mind for the purpose of establishing lesser included offenses in homicide cases. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 399-407, 429 A.2d 919 (1980), the court recognized the extremely difficult task a jury has in distinguishing among the elusive concepts of the culpable states of mind required for the various levels of homicide. To address this situation, the court dispensed with the requirement of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), that an instruction on a lesser included offense need be given only when \u201cit is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser.\u201d The court in <em>Rodriguez </em>concluded that, in a homicide prosecution, an offense that would be a lesser included offense but for its requirement of a less culpable state of mind than that required for the greater, will be deemed a lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>supra, 280, our Supreme Court considered the issue of whether the defense of duress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>was inconsistent with the element of intent required for robbery in the first degree. The court stated that the inconsistency argument \u201craises broad philosophical issues concerning the nature of voluntary action for purposes of criminal responsibility and the appropriate conditions for holding a person morally blameworthy.\u201d Id. Focusing again on the elusive concept of the accused\u2019s state of mind, the court held that \u201c[a] jury should not be called upon to resolve such an esoteric philosophical question at the expense of the defendant\u201d without an appropriate instruction on duress. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the court recognized a jury\u2019s difficulty in determining the culpable state of mind of the defendant from among those required for the various levels of homicide, and in <em>Fuller </em>the court recognized the jury\u2019s difficulty in determining the voluntariness of action required for criminal responsibility for purposes of determining the defense of duress. In this case, we similarly recognize the difficulty a jury has in weighing the justifiability of risk and action inherent in the crime of manslaughter in the second degree and the concept of self-defense. Our Supreme Court resolved the difficulty in <em>Rodriguez </em>by eliminating the second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>in homicide prosecutions, and in <em>Fuller </em>by requiring that the court instruct the jury on the defense of duress. The gravamen of the reasoning in these cases is that, in matters involving such esoteric concepts, the jury should have the benefit of as much information and instruction as will aid them in arriving at a just verdict. We find that the nature of the evidence in this case that entitled the defendant to an instruction on self-defense; part A, supra; involves the same difficulties addressed in <em>Fuller </em>and <em>Rodriguez. </em>We conclude, therefore, that the trial court should have instructed the jury on self-defense with respect to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTION ON</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">SELF-DEFENSE TO MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER IN THE FIRST DEGREE</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We next address the question of whether the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on self-defense to manslaughter in the second degree is academic because the instruction on self-defense for murder and manslaughter in the first degree was sufficient. We begin our analysis of this argument by noting that the trial court specifically instructed the jurors that they were not to consider self-defense for manslaughter in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The state contends, however, that the question of whether the court should have instructed the jury on self-defense for manslaughter in the second degree is academic because the jury presumably followed the court\u2019s instructions to consider the lesser offenses only if it found the defendant not guilty of each of the greater offenses. Thus, it argues, in finding the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the first degree, the jury rejected self-defense without even considering the lesser offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Monte, </em>131 Conn. 134, 136-37, 38 A.2d 434 (1944), our Supreme Court rejected the principle that, in a case in which the evidence warrants an instruction on a lesser included offense, the failure to give such an instruction is harmless error when the jury found the defendant guilty of the greater offense. The court recognized that jury verdicts are often the product of \u201copen-minded discussions and an honest weighing of the opinion of others\u201d; id., 136; which necessitates the giving of the whole panoply of possible verdicts. The crux of the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Monte </em>was that \u201c[i]n the effort of a jury to reach a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>with which each member can conscientiously agree, the situation presented where the alternative is between finding a defendant guilty as charged or not guilty may be quite different from one where, under the charge of the court, they have the further choice of finding him guilty of some lesser offense embraced within the information. From the standpoint of the actual process by which juries arrive at verdicts, a failure to submit to them the lesser offense as a permissible basis for their verdict may work a very serious harm to the defendant.\u201d Id., 136-37. Therefore, when the jury has been denied the opportunity to consider all the possibilities of lesser included crimes, conviction of the greater offense does not render the failure to give the lesser included offense academic or harmless. Id. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Given this precedent, we must determine whether the failure to instruct the jury on self-defense for a lesser included offense is academic or harmless when the jury has convicted the defendant of the greater offense and has thereby rejected the defense that was raised as a justification for the defendant\u2019s actions. Analyzing this question pursuant to the <em>Monte </em>and <em>Whistnant </em>reasoning, we conclude that the jury should have been given the opportunity to consider self-defense with regard to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree. Because it is settled that a jury should be given the entire range of possible verdicts in a case in which the evidence warrants the giving of the lesser included offenses, it follows that defenses that are supported by a reasonable construction of the evidence should be given along with those same lesser charges. We are not persuaded by the argument that, in cases in which the defendant is convicted of the greater offense, the failure to give warranted instructions on the lesser included offenses is not harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>less, while the failure to give similarly warranted instructions on corresponding defenses is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Additionally, \u201c[t]he defense of self-defense is raised by way of justification, and when such defense is asserted \u2018the state shall have the burden of disproving such defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>11 Conn. App. 665, 670, 528 A.2d 1176 (1987). By refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense, the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the state\u2019s burden of disproving the defense on the charge of manslaughter in the second degree, and, accordingly \u201cleft the jury without a knowledge of the law which it could apply to the facts relevant to that charge.\u201d Id., 671. A specific offense and its justification, if any, must be considered together. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavros, </em>196 Conn. 519, 528-29, 494 A.2d 550, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 904, 106 S. Ct. 233, 88 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1985). In this case, the state bore the burden of proof on the charge of manslaughter in the second degree and the burden to disprove the defense of self-defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 663; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>10 Conn. App. 697, 707-708, 525 A.2d 535 (1987). We conclude that, under the facts of this case, the trial court erred in failing to provide the jury with the proper instructions, thus precluding it from determining whether the state met these burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">defendant\u2019s erroneous instruction REGARDING SELF-DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Because we have found error that requires a new trial, we limit our examination of the next claim of error to whether the trial court erred in rejecting the defendant\u2019s requested instruction on self-defense that was based on <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>256 U.S. 335, 41 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Ct. 501, 65 L. Ed. 961 (1921).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this regard, we conclude, for the purposes of the new trial, that the trial court did not err. In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389 n.13, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984), our Supreme Court rejected the \u201cheat of passion\u201d or \u201cexcessive force\u201d type of charge that was at issue in the <em>Brown </em>decision, in favor of a subjective-objective test. The trial court was correct in refusing to give the defendant\u2019s requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We discuss the remaining issues raised by the defendant as they also are likely to arise in the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of prior convictions of the victim. At trial, in order to support his self-defense claim, the defendant offered a list of the victim\u2019s convictions, dating from 1957 through 1980, and ranging in severity from breach of peace to manslaughter. After examining the record of convictions, the trial court ruled that only a few could be described as crimes of violence. The court further ruled that the convictions were lacking in probative value and were too remote in time and too dissimilar in nature to the events at issue to be admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ble. In deciding to exclude this evidence, the court paid particular attention to the victim\u2019s 1967 conviction for manslaughter, and concluded that even this conviction was too remote and cumulative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In Connecticut, when an accused has claimed self-defense, he \u201cmay show that the deceased was the aggressor by proving the deceased\u2019s alleged character for violence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>176 Conn. 107, 114, 405 A.2d 622 (1978); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 21, 438 A.2d 867 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>13 Conn. App. 139, 149, 535 A.2d 371 (1987). The defendant may prove the victim\u2019s character by evidence of the deceased\u2019s crimes of violence, but \u201cthe accused is not permitted to introduce the deceased\u2019s entire criminal record into evidence in an effort to disparage his general character . . . . \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra. \u201cThe trial court has very broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987); and \u201c \u2018[t]he determination of the relevancy and remoteness of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>193 Conn. 350, 365, 478 A.2d 581 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling on an evidentiary matter unless the court has clearly abused its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>197 Conn. 595, 601, 500 A.2d 551 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Our review of the record reveals that during the course of the trial, the jury heard extensive testimony regarding Robinson\u2019s violent, aggressive nature, independent of his criminal record. A great part of that testimony came from police officers as well as from the defendant. The trial court was correct in finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Robinson\u2019s violent nature was undisputed, and that evidence of his manslaughter conviction was cumulative. There was ample other evidence from which the jury could have inferred that Robinson was the aggressor and that the defendant\u2019s fear of him was reasonable. Because we have determined that the evidence was cumulative, we need not reach the issue of whether the trial court was correct in finding that the conviction was too remote to be probative. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence of Robinson\u2019s manslaughter conviction was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of error is somewhat related to the prior convictions claim. He contends that the. trial court erred in excluding evidence of the victim\u2019s violent habits,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> reputation for carrying a gun, and specific violent acts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">It is axiomatic that in a homicide prosecution in which the accused has claimed self-defense, \u201c[ejxcept where character is directly in issue, a person\u2019s violent character may not be established by evidence of specific acts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 112. In the present case, the undisputed violent character of Robinson was not in issue. We find from our review no basis upon which we should recognize an exception to the rule precluding admission of evidence of the victim\u2019s specific acts of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The defendant also contends that the trial court erred in prohibiting him from questioning police officers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>other witnesses as to whether the defendant had a reputation for carrying a gun. The defendant claims that the victim\u2019s reputation for carrying a firearm was clearly relevant to his self-defense claim. The trial court ruled that the proffered testimony would be cumulative to the already abundant evidence before the jury demonstrating that Robinson was a violent man. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">At the trial, the defendant testified that Robinson owned a gun, had fired it at a gambling game on another occasion, and had a gun on the night of the incident in question. The defendant\u2019s girlfriend also testified that Robinson had a gun on the night he was shot. If a claimed error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling that was probably harmful to him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). We conclude that the defendant has not carried this burden and, therefore, it was not error for the court to exclude testimony relative to Robinson\u2019s general reputation for carrying a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in denying his request to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent homicide in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>defendant filed a timely request to charge prior to closing arguments, and he duly took exception to the court\u2019s refusal to give his requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">A lesser included offense instruction must be given when: \u201c(1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without first having committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s requested instruction because it found that the <em>Whistnant </em>requirements were not met. On appeal, the defendant contends that he established all four prongs of <em>Whistnant, </em>while the state argues that the requested instruction failed to satisfy the first and third prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The state first argues that our review of this claim should go no further than an examination of the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>because the defendant\u2019s requested instruction failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 852 (now \u00a7 854). This section requires that a request to charge set forth \u201cthe facts supported by the evidence to which the proposition would apply.\u201d The state contends that the defendant\u2019s request failed to refer to any facts whatsoever. The first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>requires that the defendant request \u201can appropriate instruction\u201d in compliance with the rules of practice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>201 Conn. 534, 558, 518 A.2d 915 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>199 Conn. 155, 158, 506 A.2d 104 (1986). Our Supreme Court has defined an appropriate instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>tion under <em>Whistnant </em>as one containing \u201c \u2018 \u201ca complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>155 Conn. 406, 410, 232 A.2d 326 (1967), quoting Dwyer v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>103 Conn. 678, 680, 131 A. 838 (1925).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Killenger, </em>193 Conn. 48, 57, 475 A.2d 276 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The defendant\u2019s requested instruction made only one reference to the facts in the following language: \u201cThe situation referred to in this case is only the situation commencing with the fight inside the VIP Lounge between Mr. Hall and Mr. Robinson and ending with the shots outside the VIP Lounge. Of course, again, if you find that the risk that Mr. Hall took in firing the shots at that time was justifiable as self-defense or was not a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would use, then you must find Mr. Hall not guilty of criminally negligent homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The defendant\u2019s request drew the trial court\u2019s attention to the crucial, relevant factual scenario so that the court could justifiably have given the requested instruction. The request is not the type of \u201comnibus request,\u201d absent any factual basis, that our Supreme Court has recently condemned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>supra, 558-59; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>supra, 159; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>15 Conn. App. 58, 65, 544 A.2d 231, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 806, 548 A.2d 440 (1988). From our review of the record, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s instruction satisfied the first prong of <em>Whistnant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Our next inquiry is whether the trial court erred in finding that the defendant did not meet the remaining <em>Whistnant </em>requirements. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c) provides in pertinent part that the \u201cjury before which any person indicted for murder . . . is tried may find him guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.\u201d \u201c \u2018Whether an accused may avail himself of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>this statutory privilege by means of a jury instruction is governed by the principles set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>[supra], 399-400, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>[supra].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 28, 444 A.2d 213 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 188, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986). Under <em>Rodriguez, </em>for the purposes of satisfying the second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>in a homicide case, \u201can offense that would be a lesser included offense but for its requirement of a less culpable state of mind than that required for the greater, will be deemed a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 407. Our Supreme Court adopted this reasoning in <em>Rodriguez </em>because, in a homicide prosecution, the state of mind of the accused is often \u201cthe most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged.\u201d Id., 404. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that it need not give an instruction on criminally negligent homicide because the defendant\u2019s testimony excluded the state of mind required for the commission of the crime constituted a determination that the defendant had not met the second prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>This conclusion was erroneous because it is just such a situation that is covered by the <em>Rodriguez </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The <em>Rodriguez </em>court did not hold, however, that a lesser degree of homicide than that charged will always be the subject of a lesser included offense instruction because the third and fourth prongs of <em>Whistnant </em>must still be satisfied. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 407-408. Thus, unless there was no disputed evidence at trial reasonably susceptible to a conclusion that the defendant could have committed the lesser crime, the defendant was entitled to an instruction on criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In resolving the matter of the defendant\u2019s requested instruction on the lesser included offense, the question before the trial court should have been limited to whether the evidence at trial was such that a jury rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>sonably could have found that the defendant acted with criminal negligence in causing Robinson\u2019s death by failing to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk of the occurrence of that death from his actions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burge, </em>195 Conn. 232, 244, 487 A.2d 532 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>182 Conn. 66, 73, 437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1981). Considering the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to the accused; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 609, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980); we conclude that the evidence could have permitted the jury to find that the defendant acted with criminal negligence, as opposed to recklessness or intent to kill, in causing Robinson\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s testimony regarding his actions during the altercation with Robinson was but one piece of a puzzle from which the jury, after accepting or rejecting it, could have concluded that he was guilty of criminally negligent homicide. It was error for the trial court to take this consideration away from the jury by failing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In this opinion Borden, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> Although the defendant\u2019s statement of the issue alleges violations of both the state and federal constitution, he does not advance any argument for the treatment of the issue under the state constitution. We therefore consider only the federal claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 67 n.9, 544 A.2d 611 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\"> In August, 1981, the defendant was issued a valid Oregon driver\u2019s license.

Therefore, it is not a condition of self-defense that one in that situation should pause to consider whether a reasonable man might think it isn\u2019t possible to retreat or disable his assailant rather than to kill him. Neither is it necessarily a condition of asserting self-defense that a person in such position must stop after each shot to survey the situation to determine if another shot is necessary. Self-defense may be found in this case, even when six shots were fired by Mr. Hall at Mr. Robinson, if you find that the six shots followed close upon each other while the heat of conflict was on, and if Mr. Hall believed that he was fighting for his life.

The jury was not required to find the defendant either guilty as charged or not guilty, but was given the further choice of finding him guilty of some lesser offense embraced within the information. <em>State </em>v. <em>Monte, </em>131 Conn. 134, 137, 38 A.2d 434 (1944). The jury was instructed on self-defense as applied to both murder and manslaughter in the first degree, but was instructed not to consider self-defense as to manslaughter in the second degree. Because the defendant was found guilty of manslaughter in the first degree, the jury necessarily rejected his claim of self-defense. When the jurors were instructed that they might consider manslaughter in the second degree, the defendant received the full benefit of the principle which permits the jury to consider lesser offenses in the open-minded discussion and honest weighing of opinion which lead to a verdict with which each member can conscientiously agree. <em>State </em>v. <em>Monte, </em>supra, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">It does not seem to me that the defendant would have benefited by an instruction that if they reached consideration of manslaughter in the second degree, which they did not do, the jurors might then find the defendant not guilty of that offense by reason of self-defense. They might well have been reluctant to find him not guilty if their only choices were between guilty as charged or not guilty. The benefit to the defendant is derived from the alternative given the jury to find him guilty of a lesser charge. Accordingly, I conclude that any error in failing to instruct the jurors that they might consider self-defense to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
