The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in finding that the state\u2019s attorney did not breach the plea agreement. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The facts are not in dispute. On July 2,1985, the petitioner withdrew his prior pleas and elections and entered pleas of guilty to a charge of being an accessory to larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-122 (a) (2), and to a charge of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). During the canvassing of the plea, the state\u2019s attorney represented that as a condition of the plea, he would not recommend a specific sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contrary to this agreement, however, at the petitioner\u2019s sentencing the state\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>adopted the probation officer\u2019s recommendation, made in the presentence report, that the maximum sentence be imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The petitioner was sentenced to a term of twenty-five years; twenty years on the charge of robbery in the first degree and a five year term on the charge of being an accessory to larceny in the first degree, the two terms to run consecutively. The plaintiff did not take a direct appeal from his convictions, but instead filed a habeas corpus petition claiming that the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding the presentence report violated the plea agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court denied the petition, ruling that there had been no breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">When a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is \u201cinduced by promises arising out of a plea bargaining agreement, fairness requires that such promises be fulfilled by the state.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>199 Conn. 631, 644, 508 A.2d 1376 (1986), citing <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 261, 92 S. Ct. 495, 30 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1971). In this case, the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was conditioned on the prosecutor\u2019s promise that he would not recommend a particular sentence, and that promise was not fulfilled. The concurrence of the state\u2019s attorney with another person\u2019s recommendation that the maximum sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>be imposed was tantamount to the state\u2019s attorney, himself, recommending a specific term. \u201cWhat the state\u2019s attorney cannot do directly, he must not do indirectly in abridgement of the accused\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartino, </em>7 Conn. App. 292, 295, 508 A.2d 809 (1986). The state concedes, and we agree, that in making these remarks, the state\u2019s attorney breached his promise not to recommend a specific term of years at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Under the circumstances presented here we conclude that the habeas corpus petition should have been granted. The petitioner is entitled to resentencing before a different judge in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">There is error, the judgment denying the plaintiff\u2019s petition is vacated and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> The following exchange took place between the court and the assistant state\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">\u201cThe Court: Is there a plea agreement in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">\u201cMr. McMahon: <em>There\u2019s an agreement, Your Honor, that there wi\u00fc be no agreement other than the state will not make any specific recommendation of years. </em>It will be free to argue, but the state will not state any specific time at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-12\">\u201cThe Court: All right. In other words at the time of sentencing the state will not make any recommendations as to the time that the gentlemen should serve; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-13\">\u201cMr. McMahon: To the number of years. We\u2019ll be free to argue the merits, freely argue the merits and facts of the case, the prior criminal record, any mitigating factors relative to these defendants, but we\u2019ll not state specifically so many years, etc.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\"> At the sentencing, the state\u2019s attorney made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u201cI would note that the victims have all recommended to the court that the maximum sentence be given, and the presentence by Miss Cronin indicates that \u2014 she describes him as a rather devious, hardened criminal who is dangerous in the community and should be incarcerated for the maximum penalty by the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u201cMiss Cronin is a very experienced, very capable and very competent probation officer, and I have not had many dealings with her, but I don\u2019t think she ordinarily makes such a recommendation. That\u2019s her reaction to this defendant, <em>which is much the same reaction as my self to this defendant and how his sentencing should he conducted.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-11\"> The court found that the defendant was not specifically advised of his appellate rights and therefore determined, and the state does not contest, that there has been no deliberate appellate bypass.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
