We find error on the defendant\u2019s first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. Acting on information supplied by an informant, Detective Michael Manzi of the Hartford Police Department dialed a phone number from a public telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>in Hartford, which activated a message center beeper. A moment later, a male voice, later identified as the defendant\u2019s, returned his call and asked Manzi what he wanted. Manzi replied that he was interested in buying a gram of cocaine. The defendant instructed Manzi to proceed to the intersection of Broad and Russ Streets in Hartford, where another pay phone was located, and to redial the phone number. When the second call was made, the message center beeper was again activated and the defendant called back. The defendant informed Manzi that the gram of cocaine would cost \u201ca yard,\u201d which is street parlance for one hundred dollars. After Manzi agreed to pay this amount, he was told to proceed to the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant at 475 Park Street in Hartford to await delivery. When Manzi arrived at the restaurant, a young Hispanic female, later identified as Sonya Hernandez, approached his car, tapped on the window and asked if he had \u201cthe money.\u201d At Manzi\u2019s request, Hernandez got into his car. While in the car, Hernandez produced a lottery ticket folded in the shape of a pyramid that contained a white powder which was later tested and found to be cocaine. As planned, Manzi signaled Detective Jose Morales, who approached the vehicle, identified himself as a police officer and arrested Hernandez. Hernandez stated that she was only delivering a package for a black man who was parked three or four cars behind Mansi\u2019s car. Both detectives proceeded to this automobile where the defendant was seated in the driver\u2019s seat. When the defendant got out of his car, Manzi performed a pat-down search and discovered a message center beeper in the defendant\u2019s right front pants pocket. Seized from a compartment on the inside of the driver\u2019s door, was a ziplock bag containing a white powder later identified as cocaine. The officers then arrested the defendant. The defendant\u2019s car was seized and towed to police headquarters. An inventory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>search of the vehicle produced a loaded .38 caliber handgun, and a Deering precision scale kit, which included a scale, a grinder, a funnel and rotating sifters.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is that the state presented insufficient evidence on the issue of whether the defendant had obtained a state weapons permit and therefore, failed to prove an essential element of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">A person violates General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 when he or she \u201cknowingly has, in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by him, any weapon for which a <em>proper permit has not been issued </em>as provided in section 29-28 or section 53-206, or has not registered such weapon as required by section 53-202 <em>. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The term \u201cweapon\u201d is defined under this section and includes any \u201cpistol or revolver . . . and any other dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 29-28<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> describes the procedure for obtaining a pistol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>permit, and conditions the issuance of a state permit to the holder of a locally issued permit. The defendant argues that the state failed to produce any evidence that he did not have a state permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">It is fundamental that any person accused of a crime is presumed innocent unless and until the state has proven his guilt by establishing each essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 708-709, 539 A.2d 561 (1988). Our Supreme Court has concluded that the lack of a proper permit is an essential element of the crime of having a weapon in a vehicle pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 and, therefore, the state is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant did not have a proper permit for the weapon as provided in \u00a7 29-28. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beauton, </em>170 Conn. 234, 240, 365 A.2d 1105 (1976); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Conn. App. 330, 338, 518 A.2d 956 (1986). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Beauton, </em>supra, the only evidence of a permit introduced by the state was that the defendant did not have a permit from the city of New Haven, the city in which he was arrested. The court held that this evidence alone was insufficient to determine whether the defendant had a valid state permit. The court found that the state should have introduced evidence as to whether the defendant had a permit from the state of Connecticut. The defendant was not a resident of New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Although the state concedes that the only evidence it produced at trial on whether the defendant had a permit was that the defendant had not been issued a permit by the city of Hartford, it argues that the facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>Beauton. </em>The state argues that the defendant is a Hartford resident and, because no local permit existed, no state permit could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>exist, as the state permit is preconditioned upon the issuance of a local permit. We disagree with the state\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In this case, no evidence was presented at trial indicating how long the defendant had lived in Hartford, whether he had a place of business elsewhere, or whether he ever had a Hartford permit other than at the time of the offense. Although it is necessary to obtain a local permit before a state permit may issue, it is not necessary to renew a local permit after having obtained a state permit. Therefore, it is possible for a person to have a state permit and not to have a current local one. During oral arguments, this court queried the state as to three possible permit scenarios and, as to each, the state conceded that the evidence produced at trial would have been insufficient to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 29-38. The first situation involves a person who, at one time, was a resident of Hartford and has a place of business other than Hartford. He obtains a local permit in the town of his business and then obtains a state permit which is in effect at the time of trial. The second scenario involves a person who, while living in a town other than Hartford, obtains a local permit from that town, followed by a state permit, and then moves to Hartford, with the state permit in effect at the time of the offense. The last scenario involves a person who had obtained a Hartford permit some years ago, and then a state permit, and who does not renew his local permit, but has a valid state permit on the date of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">It is evident from these examples that it was possible for the defendant to have a state permit without having one from the city of Hartford. In light of this fact, we conclude that the state did not present sufficient evidence to establish a violation of \u00a7 29-38 as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>did not establish that a proper state permit did not exist as of the date of the offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The defendant next claims the trial court erred in usurping the jury\u2019s function by permitting a police officer to testify as a narcotics expert on the issue of whether the defendant intended to sell the cocaine. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">During its case-in-chief, the state called Sergeant Robert J. Cagianello of the Hartford police as an expert witness. Cagianello is a thirteen year veteran of the Hartford police department and supervisor of that department\u2019s narcotics division. Cagianello testified that he had been involved in the field of narcotics investigation for approximately three and a one-half years and had worked on hundreds of narcotic cases that resulted in arrests and convictions. The trial court concluded that Cagianello qualified as an expert in the field of narcotics investigation, and permitted him to testify that the combination of the items seized, which included bullets, a gun, pyramid paper, a scale, and a grinder established behavior consistent with drug sales.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The defendant does not contest the trial court\u2019s finding that Cagianello qualified as an expert with respect to narcotics, but argues that the trial court erred in permitting the witness to testify about the ultimate issue of intent to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">As a general principle, \u201c[a]n expert witness may not express an opinion on an ultimate issue of fact, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>must be decided by the trier of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>141 Conn. 656, 667, 109 A.2d 364 (1954), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 349 U.S. 926, 75 S. Ct. 775, 99 L. Ed. 1257 (1955). \u2018Experts can [however,] sometimes give an opinion on an ultimate issue where the trier, in order to make intelligent findings, needs expert assistance on the precise question on which it must pass. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>140 Conn. 560, 563, 102 A.2d 359 (1954).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 41, 540 A.2d 42 (1988). A trial court has broad discretion in admitting \u201cexpert testimony concerning the sale of illicit drugs.\u201d Id., 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Our resolution of this case is controlled by <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>supra, which set forth guidelines for determining to what extent an expert witness may offer opinions on the issue of a defendant\u2019s intent to sell narcotics. According to <em>Vilalastra, </em>it is improper for the state to elicit testimony from an expert as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>the defendant </em>was a seller or user. It is permissible, however, for the state to ask the expert whether the items seized are commonly used by drug dealers generally. Therefore, under <em>Vilalastra, </em>it is improper to solicit a particularized opinion as to the defendant\u2019s use and possession of items or drugs found; however, it is wholly appropriate to inquire into the custom and practice of narcotics traffickers generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The court in <em>Vilalastra, </em>supra, provided a number of examples of permissible inquiry which are helpful in understanding the distinction. \u201cExpert witnesses may testify that certain behavior by a defendant or his possession of particular items is conduct similar to that engaged in by the typical drug dealer.\u201d Id., 45. In addition, \u201c[a] police officer, who is qualified as an expert witness, may . . . testify that, in light of the officer\u2019s personal observations of [the defendant\u2019s] conduct, it appeared that a defendant was engaged in narcotic sales.\u201d Id. Furthermore, it is proper for the state\u2019s attorney to ask the police officer whether, in his expert opinion it is the common practice of drug sellers, to work with the items found. Id. An expert may give his opinion about the quantity of narcotics that a drug dealer might possess. Id., 42. By contrast, the state\u2019s attorney may not ask \u201c[w]hether or not the items found . . . were possessed for either personal use and consumption or with intent to sell or dispense.\u201d Id., 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The defendant argues that although some of the questions do not appear to be improper under <em>Vilalastra, </em>they are improper, when viewed individually, and examined in the respective nature and manner in which they were asked. We find this argument unpersuasive. The questions posed to the witness by the state, and allowed by the court, satisfied the standard set forth in <em>Vilalastra. </em>The state did not ask the witness a question framed to elicit a response that the items seized conclusively established that the defendant was a drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>seller or that invited the witness to improperly speculate that the items seized were conclusively possessed for either consumption or sale. Each question sought permissible answers as to whether the items seized were those commonly used by drug dealers. The witness never expressed his opinion as to the ultimate issue of intent or that the defendant was either a user or a seller of narcotics. We conclude, therefore, that the state\u2019s inquiry was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The defendant next claims that the court erred in admitting the hearsay statements of the declarant, Sonya Hernandez, during the testimony of Officer Jose Morales. Morales was permitted to testify, over the defendant\u2019s objection, regarding statements Hernandez made after she was arrested.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that the testimony was admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule. Although the state concedes that Morales\u2019 testimony was inadmissible under this exception because the statements were not made in furtherance of a conspiracy; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Vessichio, </em>197 Conn. 644, 500 A.2d 1311 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S. Ct. 1642, 90 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1986); it argues that the error was harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>because the evidence was merely cumulative of Hernandez\u2019 own testimony concerning the same events. Since the error is evidentiary, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the error was harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 174, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The defendant concedes that Morales\u2019 testimony was cumulative. He argues, however, that Morales\u2019 testimony was far inore damaging to his case than that given by Hernandez herself because as a police officer, Morales\u2019 testimony had a greater aura of truth to it. We find this argument unpersuasive. The trial court charged the jury that the testimony of a police officer is not to be given greater weight than the testimony of any other witness and is to be scrutinized in the same manner as any other witness. We presume that the jury follows the instructions as presented to them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavros, </em>196 Conn. 519, 528, 494 A.2d 550, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 904, 106 S. Ct. 233, 88 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u201c \u2018An \u00a1erroneous ruling should not be considered reversible error if the evidence admitted thereby has already properly entered the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 455, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>190 Conn. 576, 589-90, 462 A.2d 1011 (1983). Although it was error to permit this evidence under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, we conclude that the error was harmless. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fiocchi, </em>17 Conn. App. 326, 338-39, 553 A.2d 181 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the trial court violated his state and federal<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>be free from unreasonable warrantless searches in denying his motion to suppress certain evidence seized from the trunk of his car. The trial court found that the items were properly seized under the inventory exception to the warrant requirement. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The following facts were established during the evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. When the defendant was arrested, his vehicle was parked near a busy intersection on the corner of Park and Lafayette Streets in Hartford. Manzi testified that the arrest occurred at approximately 4:15 p.m. during rush hour traffic. As the arrest was occurring, a large crowd gathered. When the detective conducted a pat-down search of the defendant for weapons, he felt a hard object in the defendant\u2019s pocket which turned out to be a message center beeper. The search of the car incident to the arrest uncovered a ziplock type bag containing white powder which was in a compartment on the driver\u2019s door. After the officers took the defendant to police headquarters, they notified a private towing company to remove the defendant\u2019s car from the street. The vehicle was towed to the Morgan Street police station and was subjected to a routine inventory search. A search of the trunk of the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>uncovered a .38 caliber handgun, and a Deering narcotics kit which included a scale and other drug paraphernalia. When asked whether the impoundment and search were conducted pursuant to established police procedures, Manzi testified that it is routine practice to impound vehicles incident to an arrest and that in conducting the search he used a standardized state form.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Because it is uncontested that the search of the defendant\u2019s car at police headquarters was performed without a search warrant, and therefore was per se unreasonable; <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); in order to uphold this search, the state must demonstrate that the warrantless search was nevertheless reasonable under one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 423-24, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>6 Conn. App. 394, 396, 505 A.2d 1251 (1986). The principal theory put forth by the state is that the warrantless search was the product of a routine inventory of the contents of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The United States Supreme Court has approved routine inventory searches of motor vehicles performed for purposes other than investigation and pursuant to standardized police procedures. <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 96 S. Ct. 3092, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1000 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\u201cIn order to determine the reasonableness of a routine inventory search, a court is required to weigh \u2018the governmental and societal interests advanced to justify such intrusions against the constitutionally protected interest of the individual citizen in the privacy of his effects.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 397, quoting <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>supra, 378. \u201cIn applying this balancing test, the Supreme Court identified three governmental and societal interests [that] support . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>inventory searches: (1) protection of the police from danger; (2) protection of the police against claims and disputes over lost or stolen property; and (3) protection of the owner\u2019s property while it remains in police custody. <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>supra, 369. When these interests singly or together comprise the reason for invading a citizen\u2019s expectation of privacy in his automobile, the Supreme Court has concluded that the limited intrusion into an individual\u2019s privacy interest caused by an inventory search is outweighed by the legitimate governmental interests embodied in the \u2018community caretaking functions\u2019 of the police. Id., 368-69; <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 93 S. Ct. 2523, 37 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1973); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>supra, 136-37.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 397-98. \u201cWhether a search is reasonable is to be determined on a case by case basis, depending upon the particular fact situation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 400, citing <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>supra, 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The defendant argues that the inventory search of his vehicle was improper for a number of reasons. First, the defendant asserts that the car should not have been impounded because there was no evidence that it was illegally parked or that he had expressed concern for securing its contents. The absence of such evidence does not necessarily render impoundment improper. The trial court expressly found, on the basis of Manzi\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, that the reason for towing the defendant\u2019s car was to remove it from a busy public street and, in light of the fact that a crowd had gathered during the course of the defendant\u2019s arrest, to avoid vandalism and theft. We find persuasive a recent federal case that explicitly found that the impoundment and towing of an arrestee\u2019s car from a public parking lot was reasonable. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>864 F.2d 992 (3rd Cir. 1988). The facts of the present case are even more compelling than those pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>sented in <em>Frank, </em>supra. In this case, the defendant\u2019s car was left on a busy public street during rush hour traffic. Moreover, in light of the volatile nature of the neighborhood where the car was left, by securing the property the police were protecting it from any theft or vandalism; a reason expressly recognized in <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 107 S. Ct. 738, 93 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1987). Under these circumstances, the decision to impound the vehicle and inventory its contents was reasonable. The fact that a defendant does not express concern for its vehicle or contents does not affect this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The defendant also asserts that the inventory search of his car was unreasonable because he should have been permitted to make arrangements to move his car by other means. In support of this argument, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra. For a variety of reasons, such reliance is misplaced. First, <em>Murphy </em>is factually distinguishable from the.present case. In <em>Murphy, </em>this court held that under the federal and state constitutions an inventory search of a car conducted on the street was unreasonable when the defendant requested to make his own arrangements to tow his car one and one-half miles to his residence. In this case, no such request was made by the defendant. Moreover, to the extent that <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, relied on the federal constitution in finding the search in that case unreasonable, its holding is overruled by <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Bertine, </em>supra, which was decided after <em>Murphy. </em>Although the defendant made no request to move his car, he nevertheless argues that under the circumstances presented here, he \u201ccould\u201d have made other arrangements. The defendant appears to be arguing that the police should have asked him if he wished to make such arrangements. The theory that the police must use the \u201cleast intrusive\u201d means possible, which was adopted by this court in <em>Murphy, </em>supra, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>expressly rejected in <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Bertine, </em>supra. In <em>Bertine, </em>the court found that \u201cwhile giving [the defendant] an opportunity to make alternative arrangements would undoubtedly have been possible . . . \u2018[t]hereal question is not what \u201ccould have been achieved,\u201d but whether the Fourth Amendment <em>requires </em>such steps . . . the reasonableness of any particular governmental activity does not necessarily or invariably turn on the existence of alternative \u201cless intrusive\u201d means.\u2019 (Emphasis in original.) <em>[Illinois </em>v. <em>Lafayette, </em>462 U.S. 640, 647, 103 S. Ct. 2605, 77 L. Ed. 2d (1983)]. . . . [Reasonable police regulations relating to inventory procedures administered in good faith satisfy the Fourth Amendment, even though courts must as a matter of hindsight be able to devise equally reasonable rules requiring a different procedure.\u201d <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Bertine, </em>supra, 373-74. Therefore, the touchstone under the federal standard is the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the search. In light of this pronouncement in <em>Bertine, </em>the defendant\u2019s argument that he should have been allowed to make other arrangements to tow his car is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The defendant\u2019s final challenge to the inventory search is that it was not conducted pursuant to a formal written policy. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>supra, 366, mandates that an inventory search be conducted \u201cusing a standard inventory form pursuant to standard police procedures.\u201d The reason for requiring such procedures is to avoid arbitrary determinations by police with respect to an inventory search. Id., 383. While it is clear that a search must be conducted according to established procedures, neither <em>Opperman, </em>nor any subsequent case, expressly requires such procedures to be written. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The record discloses that Manzi testified that it is the policy of the Hartford police department to impound cars upon the driver\u2019s arrest. Manzi explained that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>impoundment of the car was necessary in this case because the car was parked on a busy street and in a volatile neighborhood. In addition, he testified that he conducted the search pursuant to the department\u2019s policy and utilized a standard form in doing so. We find that under the federal standard this was sufficient. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The defendant\u2019s fifth claim challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen so that he could testify on his own behalf. On July 31,1987, the defense rested its case without calling any witnesses or presenting any evidence. On August 3,1987, the next court date, the defendant moved to reopen his case. In the absence of the jury, defense counsel claimed that over the weekend he had learned from the defendant about an affidavit that Hernandez had allegedly signed recanting her previous testimony. The defendant explained that he sought to reopen his case for the purpose of recalling Hernandez and calling the defendant to testify about this alleged statement. The trial court conducted a preliminary hearing, during which Hernandez took the stand, but invoked her fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to all questions pertaining to her previous trial testimony and to the alleged affidavit. The defendant then requested that he be permitted to recall Hernandez to the stand and permit her to invoke her fifth amendment privilege in front of the jury. This request was denied on the basis that her testimony was ambiguous, nonprobative, highly prejudicial and untrustworthy. The defendant did not pursue his request that he be allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s ruling as to Hernandez, and we therefore decline to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>this issue. Instead, he claims that the trial court erred in denying his request to reopen so that he could testify on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">It is well established that a trial court enjoys wide discretion in permitting the reopening of a case after either side has rested. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>209 Conn. 622, 634, 553 A.2d 589 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>205 Conn. 370, 380, 533 A.2d 559 (1987). This request to reopen involves the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present evidence. \u201cThe sixth amendment has been said to include \u2018a compact statement of the rights necessary to a full defense\u2019 which is part of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process of law. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 818, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). One of these rights is \u2018to offer testimony . . . \u2019; see <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 18, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); \u2018through the calling and interrogation of favorable witnesses . . . .\u2019 <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra. . . . \u2018For a court\u2019s refusal to reopen and receive new evidence after the parties have rested to constitute a sixth amendment violation . . . greater prejudice must be shown than in refusals to receive evidence offered in the regular course of a trial. . . . [A] trial judge must be allowed a fair degree of discretion in ruling upon motions to reopen the defense. And for his adverse ruling to violate the sixth amendment, it must be shown that the proffered evidence was of such importance to the achievement of a just result that the need for admitting it overrides the presumption favoring enforcement of the state\u2019s usual trial procedures. . . . \u2019 <em>Blaikie </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>691 F.2d 64, 67-68 (1st Cir. 1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>191 Conn. 564, 580, 469 A.2d 397 (1983). \u201cIf the motion to reopen is denied, we must, in determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, look to see if an injustice has occurred by the omission of the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 635. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>reviewing the claimed error, we will give every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. Id., 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The trial court was not presented with any circumstances that would justify the reopening of the defendant\u2019s case. While the defendant did not proffer the exact nature of his testimony, he did state that he wished to explain the circumstances surrounding the newly discovered evidence. The fact that he did not request to take the stand after the court ruled Hernandez\u2019 testimony was inadmissible, demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s only purpose in testifying involved Hernandez\u2019 testimony. His testimony would only be relevant, however, if Hernandez testified. Because the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s ruling with respect to Hernandez, it is unnecessary for us to review it. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">YI</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the defendant could be convicted of violating General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) if it found that he \u201cdispensed, distributed or transported\u201d cocaine. The defendant, however, did not raise an objection to this portion of the charge at trial nor does he even argue that his claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). In addition, in support of his claim the defendant merely states this issue without presenting this court with any legal analysis whatsoever. In light of these briefing failures, we decline to review this claim.
