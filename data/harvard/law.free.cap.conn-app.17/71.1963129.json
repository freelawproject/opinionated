The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in denying its motion for a mistrial, (2) in accepting the report of the attorney trial referee, and (3) in assessing the amount of damages sustained by the defendant. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>On or about July 10, 1981, the parties entered into a written contract under which the plaintiff agreed to purchase property of the defendant on or before April 1, 1982, for the price of $370,000. A deposit of $25,000 was given to the defendant\u2019s counsel to be held in escrow in an interest bearing account for the benefit of the plaintiff until the scheduled closing. The transfer was contingent on the plaintiff\u2019s obtaining zoning approval for the construction of a minimum of twelve dwelling units on the premises. The plaintiff unsuccessfully applied for zoning approval of fifteen units. When the defendant refused to return the deposit, the plaintiff commenced this action. The defendant counterclaimed for unspecified damages. After the pleadings were closed and the case was claimed for trial, the court, without obtaining the consent of the parties, assigned the action to an attorney trial referee for hearing. The trial was completed on October 25, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The trial referee filed his first report on January 8, 1986. He found that the plaintiff had breached its contract by seeking zoning approval for a development in excess of the number of dwelling units specified in the contract and refusing to reduce its size to meet that contract condition. As to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, although the referee expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s evidence regarding the difference in value of the real estate between its contract price and fair market value, he found that the defendant was damaged otherwise in the amount of $55,682.93. This damage consisted of payments by the defendant, between the contract closing date of April 1,1982, and the subsequent transfer to another party on October 1, 1984, for interest on two mortgages and property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Both parties moved to correct these findings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 441.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the same time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>plaintiff filed a motion for mistrial on the ground that the \u201cstate trial referee represented a party in an adversarial position to that of the plaintiff on an occasion prior to the commencement of trial .... Specifically, the trial referee represented a party ... on a purchase of real estate from the plaintiff on or about 1976.\u201d After a hearing, the motion for mistrial was denied by the court. A hearing was held by the referee on the two motions to correct the referee\u2019s findings on April 8, 1987, at which time the parties \u201cstipulated and agreed that the fair market value of the premises on April 1, 1982, was $305,000 and the contract price was $370,000.\u201d On the basis of this stipulation, the trial referee filed a corrected finding on May 21,1987, amending his prior decision \u201cto add to the damages suffered by the defendant on the counterclaim the amount of $65,000, being the difference between the contract price and the fair market value of the property.\u201d By this correction, the attorney trial referee increased his award of damages on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim to $120,682.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">On May 28,1987, the plaintiff filed an \u201cobjection to state trial referee reference\u201d on the sole ground that the matter had been referred without its express consent. When the defendant moved for judgment in accordance with the corrected finding of the trial referee, the plaintiff, on June 15, 1987, objected to the acceptance of the report for this same reason, as well as for grounds specified in Practice Book \u00a7 440. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This objection to the report was overruled on August 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>1987, when the court accepted the referee\u2019s report and rendered judgment for the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint and for the defendant to recover damages of $120,682.93 on his revised counterclaim. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">There is no merit to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by denying its motion for a mistrial filed on the ground that the attorney referee should have disqualified himself from the proceedings because he had had a professional position adversarial to that of the plaintiff in a real estate transaction ten years earlier. For the first time in a reported decision, we review the standard of conduct applicable to attorney state trial referees in the exercise of their duties under the statewide program supplementing our limited judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">This program was officially inaugurated on February 1, 1984, by the Honorable John A. Speziale, formerly Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Conn. L. J., Jan. 31,1984, p. 12C. In the official announcement of this auxiliary judicial resource, the Chief Justice, under the powers of his office,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cdesignated the Chief Court Administrator to implement and administer this experimental project.\u201d On January 31, 1984, guidelines for attorney state trial referees were promulgated by the Chief Court Administrator. These provided, inter alia, that the following oath of office be taken by each referee upon appointment: \u201cYou do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that you will support the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tion of the State of Connecticut, so long as you continue a citizen thereof; that you will faithfully discharge, according to law, the duties of the office of state trial referee to the best of your ability; <em>and that you will, </em>in addition to complying with the provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility, <em>comply with the provisions of Canons 1, 2 and 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct concerning the matters in which you serve as a state trial referee. </em>So help you God.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Canon 3 C of the Code of Judicial Conduct, as relevant here, provides: \u201cC. Disqualification. (1) A judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (a) he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The plaintiff is correct in his assertion that this court should apply to an attorney state trial referee the same code of conduct that it uses to determine whether a judge should have been disqualified from hearing a matter. The standard applied to determine whether the trier should be disqualified goes beyond a finding of actual bias. \u201cThe controlling standard is whether a reasonable person who is aware of all the circumstances surrounding the judicial proceeding would question the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>13 Conn. App. 330, 334, 537 A.2d 157 (1988). We find that the present circumstances do not raise such a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">At the court hearing on the motion for mistrial, the referee testified that he had no recollection, after the lapse of ten years, of the real estate closing involving the plaintiff. Furthermore, he was unfamiliar with the plaintiff or its name at the time of the trial, except for the evidence presented to him. The plaintiff did not show any business or other relationship between the referee and the plaintiff that would give cause for the referee\u2019s disqualification. We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that the real estate closing related by the plaintiff was, in any event, too remote to create, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>or even to suggest, a real or apparent conflict of interest by the referee, or color of personal bias or prejudice against the plaintiff. The trial court did not err in denying the plaintiffs motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court erred in accepting the referee\u2019s original and corrected reports because the plaintiff never expressly consented to a trial before an attorney state trial referee. This claim is a correct expression of the law: a case may not be referred to an attorney state trial referee without the consent of the parties. <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 514-15, 508 A.2d 415 (1986). \u201cThe [parties, however,] are deemed to have given their implicit consent to the referral by failing to raise their objection in a timely fashion.\u201d <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 246, 251, 524 A.2d 610 (1987). \u201cThe fact that the [plaintiff] did not <em>expressly </em>consent to the referral did not deprive the referee of authority to hear and decide the case.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. In the case before us, the plaintiff failed to object to the referral of the case until the trial was completed and the report of the referee\u2019s findings and decision was filed in court. \u201cThe appropriate time to object in this case would have been at the time of the referral, or at least prior to the commencement of the hearing before the referee.\u201d Id. We find that the trial court did not err in accepting the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining claim of error attacks the referee\u2019s findings and the judgment thereon assessing the amount of damages sustained by the defendant on his revised counterclaim. The referee filed his original findings on January 8,1986. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> both parties moved to correct the findings. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>referee granted the motions and filed additional findings on May 21, 1987. Each party then had the right to object to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report within two weeks of its filing. Practice Book \u00a7 441.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">On May 28,1987, the plaintiff filed an \u201cobjection to state trial referee reference\u201d of the case without its consent, and requested that the matter be restored to the trial docket for hearing before a judge. The objection was not acted on until August 6,1987, when it was implicitly overruled on the rendering of judgment in accordance with the referee\u2019s reports. The first question we must resolve is whether the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cobjection\u201d of May 28, 1987, was an objection to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report within the terms of Practice Book \u00a7 440. If it was, the objection was timely, having been made within two weeks of the filing of the referee\u2019s supplemental report. The second objection of the plaintiff, dated June 15,1987, was clearly untimely because it was not filed within two weeks of the date of the referee\u2019s report, as mandated by Practice Book \u00a7 441. The plaintiffs second objection included substantive objections to the report, and reiterated the sole ground of its May 28,1987 objection, namely, that the report should not be accepted because the plaintiff had not consented to the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The basic purpose of objecting to the acceptance of a trial referee\u2019s report is to demonstrate that the conclusions of fact stated within it are not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the subordinate facts, or that the referee erred in rulings on evidence or in other rulings. Practice Book \u00a7 440; <em>Dorsen </em>v. <em>Kay, </em>13 Conn. App. 645, 649, 538 A.2d 1080 (1988). Although there may be \u201cother reasons why the report should not be accepted\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 440; we conclude that one of these reasons cannot be an untimely objection to the reference itself for lack of consent made after the trial is over. Our conclusion follows the holding of <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, released on April 29, 1986, thirteen months before the plaintiffs objection to the reference. After the filing of the referee\u2019s report, without objection to the reference prior to trial, it is too late to attack the reference solely on the ground of a lack of consent. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The second question that justice compels us to discuss is the correctness of the referee\u2019s assessment of damages. Although we find that the objection of May 28,1987, cannot serve as a valid objection to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report, we conclude, nevertheless, that the trial court erred substantially when it rendered judgment in the amount of $120,682.93. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 443,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 4185.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>court\u2019s judgment for the defendant to recover $120,682.93 additionally allowed the defendant to retain the deposit of $25,000, making the total damages awarded, in effect, $145,682.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The measure of damages for breach of a contract is the actual loss sustained by reason of the breach, which is the monetary value of what the promisee would have made if the contract had been performed, less the proper deductions. 22 Am. Jur. 2d, Damages \u00a7 45. The award of damages in such a case is designed to place the injured party, so far as can be done by money, in the same position in which he would have been had there been no breach. <em>West Haven Sound Development Corporation </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>201 Conn. 305, 319, 514 A.2d 734 (1986); <em>Loda </em>v. <em>H.K. Sargeant &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 69, 81, 82, 448 A.2d 812 (1982). \u201c \u2018The measure of damages for breach of contract of sale [of real estate] is the difference between the <em>contract price </em>and the value of the property at the time of the breach of the contract. These damages represent the loss of the bargain.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) (Citations omitted.) <em>Loda </em>v. <em>H.K. Sargeant &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">It was within the referee\u2019s purview to find, as a fact, that the contract was breached. The determination of whether a deficiency for a breach of contract exists and the valuation of the components of that deficiency are also questions of fact for the trier. <em>Beckman </em>v. <em>Jalich Homes, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 299, 309-10, 460 A.2d 488 (1983). Here, there is no dispute that the defendant suffered a loss or deficiency, nor is there a dispute that the defendant paid mortgage interest and property taxes in the amount of $55,682.93 from the date of the breach to the date of another sale, that the agreed contract price was $370,000, that the fair market value of the property on the date of the breach was $305,000, and that the property was later sold to another pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>chaser for $375,000. The only dispute as to the amount of damages due the defendant relates to the method of their assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The ultimate question is whether the defendant has been awarded damages that exceed the amount necessary to put him in the position in which he would have been had the plaintiff not breached the contract. The parties agree that the date of the breach was April 1, 1982, and that the fair market value of the property on that date was $305,000. If the measure of damages enunciated in <em>Loda </em>is used, the defendant is entitled to damages of $65,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The defendant cannot <em>also </em>receive the mortgage interest and tax payments he made after April 1,1982, because the date as of which he is to be made whole is that date, the time of the breach. If the law were otherwise, the repudiating purchaser could be held liable for mortgage interest and tax payments indefinitely, depending upon when, if ever, the seller sold the property. At the same time, the seller would not be required to give the breaching purchaser a credit should he sell the real estate at a price greater than the contract price, or a credit for use of the property in the intervening years. The court, therefore, erred when it further assessed the damages due the defendant as of a time other than the date of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">There is error, the judgment on the defendant\u2019s revised counterclaim is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant on his counterclaim in the amount of $65,000, less a credit in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of the deposit held in the escrow account, with its accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In this opinion, Dupont, C.
