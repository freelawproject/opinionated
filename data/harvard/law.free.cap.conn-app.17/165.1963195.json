In <em>Donis, </em>the Supreme Court held that the department of health services was a party of record to the administrative proceeding and was therefore required to be cited and served as a defendant in the appeal. In this case, the only \u201cservice\u201d upon the department of health services was personal service to a planning analyst. Moreover, that service was beyond the thirty day statutory period. This is improper service upon the department, who was a party of record within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b). The appeal provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 are jurisdictional in nature, and, if not complied with, render the appeal subject to dismissal. <em>Donis </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 683. The trial court did not err in granting the motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
