We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The parties agree that on July 9, 1987, the defendant was arrested in a parking lot at a 7-Eleven store in Vernon and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The defendant moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that \u201cjsjection 14-227a prohibits the operation of motor vehicles in parking lots for more than <em>ten </em>vehicles which are \u2018open to public use\u2019 . . . .\u201d The defendant relied on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>11 Conn. App. 644, 528 A.2d 1165 (1987), in which we agreed with the trial court that a parking lot used exclusively by Midas Muffler employees and customers was not \u201copen to public use\u201d as that term is used in General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>supra, was reversed and the case was remanded with direction to reinstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the information. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>207 Conn. 612, 619, 541 A.2d 865 (1988). The Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] place is \u2018public\u2019 to which the public is invited either expressly or by implication to come for the purpose of trading or transacting business.\u201d Id., 616. It concluded that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a and 14-212 (5), intended to extend the prohibition against operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor to any parking area for ten or more cars which \u201cthe public\u201d is invited or permitted to use. Id., 619. This conclusion is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The defendant suggests that the parking area in front of the 7-Eleven store was for six vehicles and separate from the balance of the parking area, and therefore that the rationale of the Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>supra, is not applicable to this case. Aside from the fact that he did not present this as an alternate ground for sustaining the decision of the trial court, see Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1), the facts upon which this claim is based have not yet been presented to and determined by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to reinstate the information charging the defendant with a violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) and to proceed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a. \u201coperation while under the influence OF LIQUOR OR DRUG OR WHILE IMPAIRED BY LIQUOR, (a) OPERATION WHILE under the influence.
