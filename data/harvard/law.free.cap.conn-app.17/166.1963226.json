The plaintiffs press three claims of error: (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 application was arbitrary, capricious and a deprivation of constitutional due process; (2) the trial court erroneously refused to admit certain testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness; and (3) the trial court erroneously refused to admit testimony on the defendant\u2019s use of differing definitions of \u201crehabilitation.\u201d We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The trial court could reasonably have found the fol-. lowing facts. Some time before 1986, the predecessor in interest to the named plaintiff purchased the dilapidated Orange Street Armory building in New Haven from the state with the intention of converting the building into twenty condominium units. The plaintiffs\u2019 plan called for the demolition and removal of the entire building, except for the building\u2019s facade and portions of two side walls. Only two of the twenty condominium units would incorporate any part of the old wall; the eighteen other units would consist wholly of new construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In November, 1986, the plaintiffs submitted to the New Haven department of assessment an application for a deferral of the assessment increase. The application was filed pursuant to a program conducted by the city of New Haven under the authority of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-65 through 12-65f.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the deferral program, property owners who rehabilitate structures on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>their property for use as housing can secure a deferral of the tax assessment increase that would result from the improvements to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The defendant\u2019s department of assessment (department) denied the application on two grounds: first, that the project contained \u201cmore new construction than rehabilitation\u201d; and, second, that the armory building was never declared to be abandoned. The plaintiffs appealed to the defendant\u2019s assessment deferral appeals committee (appeals committee), which heard the matter de novo. The appeals committee rejected the appeal on the sole ground that the building contained more new construction than old. On appeal to the Superior Court, the plaintiffs moved for a trial de novo. In addition to the record developed before the department and the appeals committee, the plaintiffs presented testimonial evidence. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s decision denying the application. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The plaintiffs first claim that the original decision of the defendant\u2019s department was arbitrary, capricious and a violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right to due process. This claim is grounded on the department\u2019s use of certain internal, unpublished criteria in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application. This claim evinces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>a misunderstanding of the appellate process in property tax assessment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We note at the outset that both the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the department to the appeals committee, and their appeal from the appeals committee to the trial court were heard de novo. Thus, the plaintiffs were afforded the opportunity to present their case on the merits anew before both the appeals committee and the trial court. They did in fact present their case on the merits before each of those bodies, even presenting testimony at the trial court hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The defendant concedes that the department arrived at its original decision to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 application by following the guidelines contained in an unpublished, internal memorandum, and that such reliance on criteria that were not known to the public may have resulted in a deprivation of the plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights. See, e.g., <em>Helbig </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>185 Conn. 294, 307-10, 440 A.2d 940 (1981) (to pass constitutional muster a zoning ordinance must \u201cbe as reasonably precise as the subject matter requires and as reasonably adequate and sufficient to guide the commission and to enable those affected to know their rights and obligations\u201d). Both the appeals committee and the trial court, however, were made amply aware of this defect in the department\u2019s decision making procedure, and both found that any reasonable interpretation of the definition of \u201crehabilitation\u201d found in General Statutes \u00a7 12-65c (b) compelled the conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 project contained too much new construction to be considered rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Before reviewing the trial court\u2019s judgment on this issue, we consider the appropriate scope of that review. Although General Statutes \u00a7 12-65d does not define the type of appellate review the trial court is to provide in tax deferral appeals, the trial referee conducted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>trial de novo. Other statutes authorizing appeals to the trial court of municipal tax questions closely related to the issue in the present case have been held to require a trial de novo. See <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>179 Conn. 342, 426 A.2d 311 (1979) (General Statutes \u00a7 7-250 requires trial de novo of appeal from assessment decision of sewage control authorities); <em>Yale University </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>169 Conn. 454, 363 A.2d 1108 (1975) (General Statutes \u00a7 12-118 mandates de novo review by the trial court of decisions of city board of tax review); see also <em>Hutensky </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>163 Conn. 433, 311 A.2d 92 (1972). We conclude similarly that review in the Superior Court of an assessment deferral decision pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-65 et seq. is by trial de novo, and that the trial court\u2019s conduct of the appeal as a trial de novo was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Were this case an administrative appeal, the process by which the municipality reached its decision would be more pertinent. The trial court\u2019s review in such an administrative appeal would be limited to an examination of the administrative record to determine whether the decision of the administrative body was reasonably supported by facts in the record; see, e.g., <em>Daughters of St. Paul </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>17 Conn. App. 53, 56, 549 A.2d 1076 (1988); and whether it was arrived at by proper procedure; see <em>Altholtz </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>4 Conn. App. 307, 313, 493 A.2d 917 (1985); and was free of other significant error of law. See <em>Plastic Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>5 Conn. App. 219, 225, 497 A.2d 1005 (1985). In a trial de novo, however, \u201cthe court, without reference to an administrative record, receives evidence and acts as a finder of fact.\u201d <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 345; <em>Hotchkiss Grove Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>161 Conn. 50, 56-57, 282 A.2d 890 (1971). It follows that in a trial de novo, the trial court\u2019s decisions of fact and of law are regarded as independent of those determined before the municipal authorities involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>In the present case, the trial court had before it the record of the municipal administrative proceedings and the testimonial evidence presented at the trial. Upon this record, the court found that \u201cthe so-called rehabilitation [was] a trivial portion of a 4 million dollar new development.\u201d Relying upon General Statutes \u00a7 12-65c, which defines \u201crehabilitation\u201d as \u201cthe improvement or repair of a structure or facilities appurtenant thereto, exclusive of general maintenance or [minor] repairs\u201d; see footnote 2, supra; the court ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 project did not come within the statutory definition of \u201crehabilitation.\u201d We agree with the trial court. The statutory definition clearly implies the <em>preservation </em>of a preexisting structure, albeit in an \u201cimproved\u201d or refurbished state. \u201cImprovement or repair\u201d is not the equivalent of \u201creplacement.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 project, while returning a dilapidated property to a productive state, cannot be said to be a rehabilitation of the structures that stood upon the property before the plaintiffs\u2019 project began.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">That the earlier decision of the department may have been marred by reliance on the unpublished criteria contained in the internal memorandum is of no moment in our review of the trial court\u2019s decision. Unless the procedural or legal error that flawed the earlier decision is repeated in or otherwise taints the trial de novo, the decision arising from the de novo hearing may not be attacked on the basis of errors that occurred at the earlier procedure. Because the appellant is afforded the opportunity to present its case anew, any error occurring in the course of a prior adjudication that is not repeated presents a moot question.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 witness on the issue of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 project qualified for the deferral. This claim has no merit. The plaintiffs\u2019 witness was an attorney. The plaintiffs asked the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ness whether, in his opinion, the plaintiffs qualified for the deferral. The defendant objected, claiming that the question elicited opinion testimony and that the plaintiffs had not presented foundation evidence to qualify the witness as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The trial court sustained the objection on the basis of the witness\u2019 lack of qualification to testify as a witness on the subject. Although we sustain the ruling of the trial court, we do so on a different ground. The question called for a legal conclusion and was therefore improper. <em>Madison </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>85 Conn. 55, 65-66, 81 A. 1046 (1911); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 7.12.3, 7.17.2. A witness is incompetent to offer a legal opinion; <em>Turner\u2019s Appeal, </em>72 Conn. 305, 316, 44 A. 310 (1899); except on the issue of foreign law. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the court erred when it refused to allow the plaintiffs\u2019 witness to testify as to the defendant\u2019s use, in other cases, of certain definitions of \u201crehabilitation\u201d that were different from the definition contained in General Statutes \u00a7 12-65c (b). The plaintiffs contend that the city\u2019s selective use of other definitions was relevant evidence of the arbitrary, capricious and unlawful way in which the defendant decided to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 application in this case. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim erroneously assumes that the trial court reviewed the action of the city as if this were an administrative appeal. That simply is not the case. The trial court determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 project did not fall within the definition of \u201crehabilitation\u201d found in General Statutes \u00a7 12-65c (b). The trial court\u2019s decision, which we review, was properly based on the definition of \u201crehabilitation\u201d contained in the enabling statute. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that we should reverse the trial court\u2019s decision because of the possible arbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>use by the city of other definitions in other cases, therefore, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-15\"> Large Egg Development Associates is the predecessor in interest to Orange Street Armory Associates, the named plaintiff.
