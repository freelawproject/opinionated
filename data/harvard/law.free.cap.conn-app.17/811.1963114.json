The plaintiff wife appealed to this court and the defendant husband cross-appealed. Issues of custody and financial awards were decided by this court and reported in <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>5 Conn. App. 649, 502 A.2d 933 (1985), cert. dismissed, 200 Conn. 804, 510 A.2d 192 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">During the pendency of the prior appeal, the plaintiff relocated permanently to Brazil with the minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>child. The defendant has filed numerous postappeal and postjudgment motions involving claims for modification of custody, financial awards, counsel fees and in defense of contempt orders regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with financial orders of the dissolution court. The trial court\u2019s rulings on those motions constitute the basis of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\">After a complete examination of the record, transcripts and the defendant\u2019s brief,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and after affording each of the defendant\u2019s claims of error the appropriate scope of review, we conclude that the trial court did not err in any of its rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-12\"> The plaintiff did not file a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
