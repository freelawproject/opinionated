Mayor, brought this action against his wife, Mariaelana Sparano Mayor, requesting a judgment dissolving their marriage and custody of their minor child, Matthew. The defendant filed a cross complaint, requesting a judgment dissolving the marriage, attorney\u2019s fees, custody of the minor child, child support and alimony. The matter was heard as uncontested on December 23,1987. At the hearing, the plaintiff, over the defendant\u2019s objection, requested that the court change the surname of the parties\u2019 minor child from Sparano to Mayor. The defendant testified that her son was born on September 29,1986, and that she gave his name on the birth certificate as Matthew Vincent Sparano. Sparano was the defendant\u2019s maiden name. The only other evidence presented to the court was the testimony of the defendant that she listed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>own name on the child\u2019s birth certificate as Mariaelana Mayor and that she failed to state the name of the child\u2019s father. After brief argument by counsel, the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s request that the child\u2019s surname be changed to Mayor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and later included an order to that effect in the judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The question for our consideration is whether, in the context of an action for dissolution of marriage, the trial court had jurisdiction to change the name of the parties\u2019 minor child upon the request of one of the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The jurisdiction of our courts is defined by statute and by the Connecticut constitution. Conn. Const., art. V, \u00a7 1; <em>Farricielli v. Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 210, 440 A.2d 286 (1982). The jurisdiction of Connecticut courts to effect changes of names has been carefully delineated by statute. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-11 and 46b-1 (6) (jurisdiction of Superior Court over complaints praying for change of name); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-63, 46b-l (4) (jurisdiction of Superior Court to grant change of name to either spouse incident to dissolution of marriage); General Statutes \u00a7 45-3b (concurrent jurisdiction of Probate Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>grant changes of name); General Statutes \u00a7 45-66a (jurisdiction of Probate Court to change the name of an adopted person incident to approval of agreement to adopt or declaration of intention to adopt). The statutes that are relevant to our analysis of the jurisdictional question presented in this case are \u00a7\u00a7 52-11,46b-l (4) and (6), and 46b-63.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude, on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>our review of these statutes, that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction to effect a change of name of a nonparty minor child incident to the dissolution of a marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We note initially that no statute is addressed specifically to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to change the name of a minor child. General Statutes \u00a7 52-11, however, confers jurisdiction upon the Superior Court to effect changes of name generally. Section 52-11 provides that \u201c[t]he superior court . . . shall have jurisdiction of <em>complaints praying for a change of name, </em>brought by any person residing in the judicial district, and may change the name of <em>the complainant. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The jurisdiction of the Superior Court in family relations matters is expressly defined in \u00a7 46b-l (6) as extending to <em>\u201ccomplaints </em>for change of name.\u201d (Emphasis added.) These statutes are consistent in expressly limiting the court\u2019s jurisdiction to change a name to the situation in which the interested individual petitions the court for the change by filing a complaint. When the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, we need look no further for interpretive guidance because we assume that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature. <em>Capalbo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>208 Conn. 480, 486, 547 A.2d 528 (1988); <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>207 Conn. 441, 451, 541 A.2d 1226 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 428, 538 A.2d 193 (1988); <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986); <em>Lundgren </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>12 Conn. App. 138, 142, 530 A.2d 183, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 808, 532 A.2d 76 (1987). We will not assume that the statutory language granting the court jurisdiction of <em>\u201ccomplaints </em>praying for a change of name\u201d is meaningless or superfluous. (Emphasis added.) See <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Petrazzuoli Bros., Inc., </em>10 Conn. App. 22, 31, 521 A.2d 212 (1987). It is apparent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the clear words of \u00a7\u00a7 52-11 and 46b-1 (6) that the legislature contemplated that a court should effect a change of name only in the context of an action brought for that purpose by the person desiring the change of name. We note that procedures for the initiation and prosecution of such an action on behalf of a minor child are set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 105.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the basis of the express terms of \u00a7\u00a7 52-11 and 46b-l (6), we conclude that the trial court was without jurisdiction to change the name of a nonparty minor child incident to the dissolution of the parents\u2019 marriage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Our conclusion is supported by the fact that, when the legislature has seen fit to confer jurisdiction upon a court to change a name incident to its exercise of jurisdiction in the context of a proceeding other than one brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-11 or \u00a7 45-3b, it has expressly done so. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-l (4) and 46b-63<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> give the court the power to change the name of either spouse incident to the dissolution of a marriage. General Statutes \u00a7 45-66a gives the Probate Court jurisdiction to change the name of an adopted person as part of its approval of an agreement of adoption or declaration of intention to adopt. In examining the various statutes concerning changes of name, we must consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984). Where more than one statute is involved, we presume that the legislature intended them to be read together to create a harmonious body of law. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>supra; <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mike, </em>184 Conn. 352, 362, 439 A.2d 1026 (1981); <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>182 Conn. 40, 46, 438 A.2d 1 (1980); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 642, 410 A.2d 475 (1979). Having examined all the statutes bearing on changes of name, we conclude that the legislature did not choose to grant the court jurisdiction to effect changes in the names of nonparty minor children incident to dissolutions of parents\u2019 marriages. A parent who wishes to effect a change of name for a minor child in the Superior Court must invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction by proceeding under \u00a7 52-11 and must comply with the procedures established by Practice Book \u00a7 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">There is error, that part of the judgment ordering a change of name of the minor child is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the request to change the minor child\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\"> The court stated, \u201cI shall order that the child\u2019s name henceforth be Matthew S. Mayor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"> Although counsel for the defendant did argue against the requested change of name by informing the trial court that \u201cwe do not feel that [the name change] should be granted at this time,\u201d no jurisdictional challenge was explicitly raised. The defendant\u2019s objection that the court was without jurisdiction to change the name of the minor child is made for the first time on appeal. Ordinarily, we decline to review matters that were not distinctly raised at trial. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. It is a settled principle of law, however, that a claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and may be raised at any time, even on appeal. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 177, 413 A.2d 819, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979); <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>181 Conn. 463, 468, 435 A.2d 1016 (1980). We therefore address the jurisdictional question presented, despite the parties\u2019 failure to raise it in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b652-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-11. complaints for change of name. The superior court in each judicial district shall have jurisdiction of complaints praying for a change of name, brought by any person residing in the judicial district, and may change the name of the complainant, who shall thereafter be known by the name prescribed by said court in its decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-l. family relations matters defined. Matters within the jurisdiction of the superior court deemed to be family relations matters shall be matters affecting or involving: (1) Dissolution of marriage, contested and uncontested, except dissolution upon conviction of crime as provided in section 46b-47; (2) legal separation; (3) annulment of marriage; (4) alimony, support, custody and change of name incident to dissolution of marriage, legal separation and annulment; (5) actions brought under section 46b-15; (6) complaints for change of name; (7) civil support obligations; (8) habeas corpus and other proceedings to determine the custody and visitation of children; (9) habeas corpus brought by or in behalf of any mentally ill person except a person charged with a criminal offense; (10) appointment of a commission to inquire whether a person is wrongfully confined as provided by section 17-200; (11) juvenile matters as provided in section 46b-121; (12) all rights and remedies provided for in chapter 815j; (13) the establishing of paternity; (14) appeals from probate concerning: (a) Adoption or termination of parental rights; (b) appointment and removal of guardians; (c) custody of a minor child; (d) appointment and removal of conservators; (e) orders for custody of any child; (f) orders of commitment of persons to public and private institutions and to other appropriate facilities as provided by statute; (15) actions related to prenuptial and separation agreements and to matrimonial decrees of a foreign jurisdiction; (16) custody proceeding brought under the provisions of chapter 815o; and (17) all such other matters within the jurisdiction of the superior court concerning children or family relations as may be determined by the judges of said court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-63. (Formerly Sec. 46-60). restoration of birth name or former name of spouse, (a) At the time of entering a decree dissolving a marriage, the court, upon request of either spouse, shall restore the birth name or former name of such spouse, (b) At any time after entering a decree dissolving a marriage, the court, upon motion of either spouse, shall modify such judgment and restore the birth name or former name of such spouse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 105. change of name by minor child</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\u201cIn all proceedings for change of name under Gen.

We note that, if the legislature had wished to grant the court jurisdiction to change the name of a minor child of the parties to a dissolution\u2019 action, it could have done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
