The defendant was found guilty, by a jury, of burglary in the third degree, unlawful restraint in the second degree, and attempted robbery in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The jury could reasonably have found certain relevant facts. The victim, upon hearing noises while she was upstairs in her home, went downstairs to investigate, leaving her twenty month old daughter asleep in a nursery on the second floor. The defendant, a stranger to her, was downstairs. She ran upstairs to the nursery and the defendant followed. He tied her hands behind her back with an article of the baby\u2019s clothing, and forced her into the master bedroom. She untied her hands and he tried to tie them again with a strap he found in the bedroom. He tried to pull her rings from her fingers and asked for money. She escaped from him and ran back to the nursery. There she struggled with the defendant and kicked him in the groin. He fell to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>his knees, and then she kicked and pushed him toward the stairs, causing him to fall down the stairs. He then ran out of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The defendant relied on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (c) in his written request to charge, and sought a charge which basically tracked the language of the statute, claiming that \u201che abandoned his effort to commit the crime . . . under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.\u201d The facts do not indicate that there was a voluntary renunciation of a criminal purpose. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
