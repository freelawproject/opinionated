J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVZk\">The plaintiffs, Richard E. Mahoney, individually and in his capacity as administrator of his son\u2019s estate, and Barbara Mahoney, individually, brought this action against the commissioners of mental health, state police and mental retardation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>alleged that the death of their son, while a patient at Norwich Hospital, was caused by the defendants\u2019 negligent, wanton, and willful misconduct, and that the defendants deprived their son of his personal, property and civil rights in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 17-206b, and of his right to receive humane and dignified treatment in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 17-206c. In addition to claims made on behalf of the estate, the plaintiffs sought, as individuals, to recover for funeral and probate expenses incurred, as well as for the loss of consortium they claim to have suffered as a result of their son\u2019s death. The defendants moved to dismiss, asserting that the plaintiffs are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity from bringing the action against the state or its commissioners, and that, accordingly, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The motion to dismiss was granted and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The amended complaint, to which the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is addressed, contains twelve counts and alleges that the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent, Richard Mahoney, Jr., while a voluntary admission patient at Norwich Hospital, was killed when he jumped from an oil tank reserve located on the grounds of the hospital. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal concerns counts ten, eleven and twelve of the amended complaint. Count ten alleges that the defendants violated the decedent\u2019s rights in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c. Counts eleven and twelve allege that as a result of the violation of these statutes the plaintiffs have incurred funeral and probate expenses and have suffered a loss of consortium with their son. The statutory claims are based on various allegations as to the defendants\u2019 conduct, including failure to supervise the decedent, fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ure to take suicide precautions, failure to provide proper counseling and medication, and failure to report timely the decedent missing. These counts allege that General Statutes \u00a7 17-206k is the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The case before us is one of first impression. The controlling issue is whether the legislature intended General Statutes \u00a7 17-206k to waive the sovereign immunity of the state and impose direct liability for violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c on the state and its commissioners, and, if so, whether the allegations of the complaint sufficiently allege a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The trial court, in granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, found that \u00a7 17-206k does not constitute legislative consent to a suit for damages against the state or its commissioners. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that \u00a7 17-206k operates as a waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity and permits state mental health facility patients aggrieved by violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c to bring an action directly against the state or its commissioners, rather than pursuing a claim to the claims commissioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u201cThe state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued may be waived by the legislature, provided clear intention to that effect is disclosed \u2018by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 228, 464 A.2d 45 (1983), quoting <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 298, 294 A.2d 290 (1972). The defense of sovereign immunity is not allowed where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the legislature has consented to being sued. <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>15 Conn. App. 297, 300, 544 A.2d 246 (1988), cert. granted on other grounds, 209 Conn. 807, 548 A.2d 438 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In analyzing the statute at issue, well established rules of statutory construction control. \u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that statutes are to be construed so that they carry out the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 561, 429 A.2d 960 (1980). In construing a statute, this court will consider the language of the statute, its legislative history and previous judicial construction. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Silverberg, </em>200 Conn. 367, 371, 511 A.2d 336 (1986). Since there is neither a judicial construction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor any pertinent legislative history of \u00a7 17-206k,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we are left with the language of the statute in determining whether it was intended to act as a waiver to the state\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Section 17-206k provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a violation of sections 17-206a to 17-206j, inclusive, may petition the superior court within whose jurisdiction the person is or resides for appropriate relief, including temporary and permanent injunctions, or may bring a civil action for damages.\u201d The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>claims to have been aggrieved by violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c. Section 17-206b provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o patient hospitalized or treated in any public or private facility for the treatment of the mentally disordered shall be deprived of any personal, property or civil rights, including the right to vote, hold or convey property, and contract, except in accordance with due process of law, and unless he has been declared incompetent pursuant to Chapter 779.\u201d Section 17-206c provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery patient treated in any facility for treatment of the mentally disordered shall receive humane and dignified treatment at all times, with full respect for his personal dignity and right to privacy. Each patient shall be treated in accordance with a specialized treatment plan suited to his disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The language \u201cany public or private facility\u201d and \u201cevery patient treated in any facility\u201d indicates that the legislature intended patients of state, municipal and private mental hospitals to be guarantied the rights provided by \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The defendants do not contest the conclusion that patients of state mental health facilities are entitled to the rights afforded by \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c. They argue, however, that state patients aggrieved by violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c are required to pursue their claims in a different forum than private mental hospital patients, that is, through the commissioner of claims. See footnote 2, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">It is a basic rule of statutory construction that a statute is to be construed as a whole and each part reconciled. <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>Fusari, </em>163 Conn. 401, 411, 311 A.2d 65 (1972). Section 17-206k must be construed in light of the rights for which it provides remedies. Section 17-206k provides remedies for \u201cany person aggrieved by a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206a to 17-206j, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>inclusive.\u201d The remedy is by petition to the Superior Court and includes <em>\u201ca </em>civil action for damages.\u201d Patients in state mental health facilities are included among the class of individuals potentially aggrieved by violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c, the sections on which the plaintiffs\u2019 claims rely. Section 17-206k does not distinguish between remedies available to state facility patients and those available to private facility patients. No reference is made to chapter 53 of the General Statutes and its provisions for prior authorization by the claims commissioner for suits against the state. <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 230. We conclude that \u00a7 17-206k was intended by the legislature to authorize direct civil actions against the state or its commissioners by patients of state mental health facilities aggrieved,by violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Having concluded that \u00a7 17-206k permits direct civil actions against the state, we must determine whether the allegations of the complaint sufficiently allege a cause of action for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c. When the state waives its sovereign immunity by statute, <em>\u201ca </em>party attempting to sue under the legislative exception must come clearly within its provisions . . . . \u201d <em>Berger, Lehman Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>178 Conn. 352, 356, 422 A.2d 268 (1979). The defendants contend that the plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action under either \u00a7 17-206b or \u00a7 17-206c and that, accordingly, the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u201cA motion to dismiss properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff <em>cannot </em>as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>194 Conn. 635, 640, 484 A.2d 934 (1984). \u201cThe motion to dismiss like a \u2018motion to erase admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>be decided on that alone.\u2019 <em>Perrys, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury Redevelopment Agency, </em>157 Conn. 122, 124, 249 A.2d 256 (1968).\u201d <em>Barde </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>207 Conn. 59, 62, 539 A.2d 1000 (1988). Accordingly, in evaluating the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, we presume the validity of the allegations contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not distinguish between \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c, but instead, claims that the defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct amounts to a violation of both statutes. We find it necessary, however, to distinguish between the statutes in determining the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Section 17-206b provides that \u201c[n]o patient hospitalized or treated in any public or private facility for the treatment of the mentally disordered shall be deprived of any personal, property or civil rights, including the right to vote, hold or convey property, and contract, except in accordance with due process of law, and unless he has been declared incompetent pursuant to chapter 779. Any finding of incompetency shall specifically state which civil or personal rights the patient is incompetent to exercise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The statute guaranties that a mental health facility patient cannot be deprived of the opportunity to exercise certain rights, such as the right to vote, contract, or hold property, unless due process has been afforded and unless the patient has been declared incompetent. Thus, the statute requires that due process be afforded when suspending a patient\u2019s rights, and mandates that he or she may not be deprived of those rights without a finding that a patient is in fact incompetent to exercise them.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The rights to which the plaintiffs claim the decedent was entitled are not susceptible to the due process guaranties of \u00a7 17-206b. Section 17-206b guaranties that hospitalization or treatment in a mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>facility may not serve as the basis for the deprivation of a right that a patient may have held absent hospitalization or treatment. See comment, \u201cThe Mentally 111 in Connecticut \u2014 A Survey,\u201d 6 Conn. L. Rev. 303, 330 (1973-74). The rights to which the plaintiffs claim the decedent was entitled, that is, proper counseling, medication and suicide precautions, are not rights held absent hospitalization, but instead arise, if at all, as a <em>result </em>of his hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We conclude from the language of the statute that the \u201cpersonal, property or civil rights\u201d contemplated by \u00a7 17-206b consist of those rights that a patient might conceivably be unable to exercise due to incompetence, and, thus, that might properly be suspended if due process is provided. We, therefore, find that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to state a cause of action for violation of the decedent\u2019s rights under \u00a7 17-206b.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, however, fare better when analyzed under \u00a7 17-206c. The language of the statute indicates generally that a patient in a mental health facility is entitled to humane and dignified treatment, and specifically that a patient is entitled to a treatment plan tailored to his particular disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The defendants argue that the guaranties of humane and dignified treatment provided by \u00a7 17-206c contemplate only the protection of personal dignity and privacy, such as the right to refuse medication and other treatment. The statute, however, clearly provides that a patient is entitled to a specialized treatment plan tailored to his particular disorder. Thus, under \u00a7 17-206c, a patient has a positive right to treatment, rather than simply a negative right to refuse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The plaintiff has alleged that the decedent suffered from a mental illness that included suicidal tendencies, and that the defendants failed to provide proper counseling, medication, supervision or suicide precautions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>so as to prevent the decedent from acting on his suicidal tendencies. Viewing the allegations broadly, as we must on a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint can be read to allege that the defendants failed to provide the decedent with a treatment plan suited to his mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The defendants also contend that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based solely in negligence, and, as such, do not amount to a cause to action under \u00a7 17-206c. The defendants rely on federal cases decided under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which authorizes a civil action for deprivations of \u201crights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d under color of state law or custom. Federal courts have recognized, to varying extents, that a failure to provide treatment and personal safety to patients institutionalized in state mental health facilities may amount to a violation of a patient\u2019s rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See, e.g., <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Cserr, </em>544 F.2d 1121 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Aderholt, </em>503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Philipp </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>517 F. Supp. 513, (N.D.N.Y. 1981). In formulating standards by which to evaluate claims based on a right to treatment, federal courts have held that a \u201cmere negligent failure to afford proper treatment\u201d does not amount to a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Cserr, </em>supra, 1122. The defendants contend that \u00a7 17-206c similarly requires allegations rising above negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 1983 cases, however, is misplaced. The right to treatment recognized by federal courts is grounded in substantive liberty interests secured by the federal due process clause. <em>Philipp </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>supra, 516. The United States Supreme Court has held, in the context of \u00a7 1983 cases, that acts of negligence do not violate an individual\u2019s rights under the due process clause of the United States constitution. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S. Ct. 662, 88 L. Ed. 2d 662 <em>(1986);Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>344, 106 S. Ct. 668, 88 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1986). Thus, the limits on the right to treatment recognized by the federal courts are based on constitutional considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Section 17-206c, however, is not tied to constitutional rights. The statute simply gives a statutory right to humane and dignified treatment to patients treated in mental health facilities. Therefore, the right to humane and dignified treatment provided by \u00a7 17-206c is not subject to the limits imposed on the right to treatment as recognized under the federal constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-FC\">Section 17-206c creates a new tort liability based upon a specified course of conduct that is not dependent upon common law negligence. See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 341, 348-49, 493 A.2d 184 (1985). The allegations that the defendants violated the terms of the statute stand alone and suffice to state a cause of action. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Gartenhaus Cafe, </em>15 Conn. App. 392, 394 n.1, 546 A.2d 284 (1988), cert. granted on other grounds, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 437 (1988). Therefore, an evaluation of claims made under \u00a7 17-206c does not require a determination that the plaintiffs have alleged negligent, reckless, wanton or intentional conduct on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Viewing the allegations of the complaint and reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, we conclude that the allegations of count ten, which solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>relate to claims on behalf of the decedent\u2019s estate,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are sufficient to state a cause of action under \u00a7 17-206c. These allegations, therefore, come within the sovereign immunity waiver provisions of \u00a7 17-206k.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims for funeral expenses and loss of consortium, as alleged in counts eleven and twelve, however, require a different analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">A legislative waiver of sovereign immunity waives the state\u2019s immunity only as to the actions specified. See <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 229. A party who wishes to sue under a legislative waiver of sovereign immunity must come within its provisions. Id., 232. The plaintiffs, as individuals, do not belong to the class of persons to whom rights are afforded under \u00a7\u00a7 17-206b and 17-206c, the sections on which their claims are based, and therefore are not members of the class authorized to bring suit under \u00a7 17-206k. Although funeral expenses may be obtainable as an element of damages sought by the decedent\u2019s estate, the plaintiffs\u2019 individual claim for funeral expenses against the defendant commissioners is not authorized by \u00a7 17-206k and is thus barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim for loss of consortium fails for the same reason as does their claim for funeral expenses. Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s consortium claim is for loss of filial, rather than spousal consortium. The right to consortium is said to arise out of the civil contract of marriage and as such, does not extend to the parent-child relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>176 Conn. 485, 487, 408 A.2d 260 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Finally, a claim for loss of consortium exists only as to antemortem loss of consortium. <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Douglas Trucking Co., </em>203 Conn. 187, 523 A.2d 1301 (1987). The plaintiffs\u2019 claim for loss of consortium is framed in terms of postmortem loss of consortium. Thus, even if an action for loss of filial consortium were said to exist, and even if the plaintiffs individually acquired a cause of action pursuant to \u00a7 17-206c, the decision in <em>Ladd </em>forecloses the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was error, in part, as to count ten, but not error as to counts eleven and twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">There is error in part, the judgment of dismissal as to the allegations of count ten relating to a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 17-206c is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-14\"> This appeal was withdrawn as to the defendant Brian Lensink, commissioner of mental retardation. The plaintiffs have alleged that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>missioner of state police is responsible for certain security personnel at Norwich Hospital and, as such, he is included as a defendant in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-142 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThere shall be a claims commissioner who shall hear and determine all claims against the state except ...

App. 493, 537 A.2d 527 (1988), the plaintiff brought suit against the commissioner of mental retardation for injuries sustained by the plaintiff while she was a client in a department program. Although the plaintiff\u2019s complaint included a count based on General Statutes \u00a7 17-206c, the plaintiff did not allege jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 17-206k. The defendant conceded that \u00a7 17-206c provided a direct cause of action against him and that sovereign immunity was waived by virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-24, which authorizes civil actions for damages against the commissioner of health services and the commissioner of mental retardation. As to the substance of the \u00a7 17-206c count, the trial court and the plaintiff treated the \u00a7 17-206c claims as essentially identical to the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claims. We expressed no opinion as to the correctness of that position. <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>supra, 502 n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> See Conn.
