J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4e\">In two companion cases, the defendant appeals from the denial by the trial court of his motions to withdraw his pleas entered pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">In the first case, the defendant was charged with one count of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of risk of injury to a minor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state claimed that the defendant had sexual intercourse with the minor victim on a regular basis, from 1980, when she was eight years old, to 1986. In the second case, the defendant was charged with one count each of a violation of the same statutes. This charge concerned the five year old cousin of the first victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>After the trial court was satisfied that there was a sufficient factual basis for the pleas; Practice Book \u00a7 713;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and had canvassed the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 711 and 712,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it accepted the defendant\u2019s pleas. The court entered findings of guilty as to each count and set a sentencing date. Prior to the sentencing date, the defendant secured new counsel and filed written motions to withdraw his pleas pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 720 and 721,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>denied. The defendant was sentenced on all four counts to a total effective sentence of ten years, to be suspended after six years, with five years probation. A condition of his probation was that he receive psychiatric counseling and sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying the motions to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>pleas because (1) he was not informed of the precise amount of the fines that could be imposed for violations of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, and therefore the court failed to determine that he fully understood the maximum possible sentence on the charge, (2) the trial court failed to elicit anything more than simple \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses from the defendant during the plea canvass, (3) the trial court refused to find that the defendant\u2019s pleas resulted from the denial of effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 721 (4), (4) the pleas were not knowingly and intelligently made because they were entered without the knowledge that a potential witness for the state was in custody, and (5) the trial court failed to permit the pleas to be with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>drawn although there was no evidence that the state would have suffered any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">A guilty plea, once accepted, cannot be withdrawn except with the permission of the court, within its sound discretion, and a denial of a motion to withdraw a plea is reversible only if it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 23, 355 A.2d 49 (1974). The defendant bears the burden of showing a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 475-76, 365 A.2d 1100 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>169 Conn. 38, 46, 362 A.2d 499 (1975). A trial court is required to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty upon proof of any of the grounds set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 721. <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>207 Conn. 590, 597, 542 A.2d 1131 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasher, </em>190 Conn. 259, 265, 460 A.2d 970 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in denying the motions to withdraw his guilty pleas entered pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine because the court failed to inform him of the precise amount of the fines that could be imposed for violations of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, and therefore failed to ensure that the defendant fully understood the maximum possible sentence on the charge, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 721 (1) provides that a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty may be granted if \u201c[t]he plea was accepted without substantial compliance with [Practice Book] Sec. 711.\u201d Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00a7 711 (4) requires that the defendant be advised of the maximum possible sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In the present case, the court informed the defendant that fines could be imposed in addition to a maximum penalty of forty years. The court also explicitly reviewed with the defendant the precise sentences that could be imposed in accordance with the parameters of his plea bargain. In addition, the court informed the defendant that if the plea agreement were not followed he would be allowed to withdraw his pleas. Nothing in the plea bargain contemplated a fine. Accordingly, the failure of the trial court to inform the defendant of the precise amount of the fines that could have been imposed, on the facts of this case, does not constitute defective compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The defendant next claims that the court\u2019s failure to elicit responses other than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d from the defendant during the canvass of the pleas invalidates his guilty pleas entered pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. This claim was not raised in the trial court. Ordinarily, the defendant\u2019s failure to raise a timely claim of error to the trial court renders the claim unreviewable on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 417, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). \u201c \u2018Only in the most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised or decided in the trial court.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We have recognized, however, as an \u2018exceptional circumstance\u2019 within this doctrine, certain claims involving colorable deprivations of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra. To the extent that the defendant\u2019s claim implicates the failure of the trial court to ensure that the defendant\u2019s pleas were entered voluntarily; see <em>Boykin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); his claim is properly reviewable despite the absence of a timely claim of error before the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 418; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em>5 Conn. App. 378, 381, 498 A.2d 134 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Single word responses to court questions at plea taking do not ordinarily render the plea involuntary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 178-84, 438 A.2d 46 (1980). <em>State </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>161 Conn. 531, 536, 290 A.2d 332 (1971), explicated the standards for reviewing whether single word responses demonstrate that a defendant\u2019s plea was entered intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily. \u201cTo insulate from attack convictions obtained after a plea of guilty, the trial court is best advised to conduct an on-the-record examination of the defendant which will disclose, inter alia, a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence and which will demonstrate that the plea of guilty was entered intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Id. \u201cIf a fair reading of the record satisfies the standards set down in <em>Bugbee, </em>the guilty plea will withstand a constitutional attack based on facial invalidity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 182. The transcript of the trial court\u2019s plea canvass unequivocally <em>demonstrates that the </em>requisite constitutional standards for the acceptance of guilty pleas were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The defendant mistakenly relies on rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the cases decided thereunder for the proposition that single word responses invalidate guilty pleas. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dayton, </em>604 F.2d 931, 941-43 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 904, 100 S. Ct. 1080, 63 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1980), however, makes it clear that single word responses do not necessarily render guilty pleas constitutionally infirm. Moreover, federal cases construing and applying rule 11 \u201care of persuasive . . . not controlling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>authority.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 359, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motions to withdraw his guilty pleas entered pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine because it refused to find that the defendant\u2019s pleas resulted from the denial of the effective assistance of counsel without holding an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Citing Practice Book \u00a7 721 (4), which provides for withdrawal of guilty pleas on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant urges this court to remand this issue to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Generally, \u201c \u2018a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is more properly pursued on a petition for new trial or on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus rather than on direct appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 541, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 578-79, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982). \u201cIt is preferable that all of the claims of ineffective assistance, those arguably supported by the record as well as others requiring an evidentiary hearing, be evaluated by the same trier in the same proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>supra. <em>Leecan, </em>however, did not address the precise issue in this case, namely, whether the trial court erred in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether a defendant\u2019s pleas entered pursuant to <em>the Alford </em>doctrine resulted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the denial of effective assistance of counsel under the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 721 (4). The transcript of the hearing on the motions to withdraw the pleas indicates that the trial court was aware of the distinction between the <em>Leecan </em>preference and the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis for withdrawal of guilty pleas pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 721 (4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">At the hearing on the motions to withdraw his pleas, the defendant argued that his attorney did not inform him of the collateral consequences of entering guilty pleas pursuant to <em>the Alford </em>doctrine, thereby rendering his pleas involuntary. Cf. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, 400 U.S. </em>25, 29 n.3, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). The defendant contends that his attorney should have informed him that his <em>Alford </em>pleas would constitute admissions against interest in collateral civil proceedings initiated by the victims\u2019 families, whereas pleas of nolo contendere would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Although the defendant\u2019s attorney may not have informed the defendant of the collateral consequences, if any, of entering guilty pleas pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, as opposed to pleas of nolo contendere, only where \u201csuch allegations furnish a basis for withdrawal of the plea under \u00a7 721 and are not conclusively refuted by the record of the plea proceedings and other information contained in the court file, [is] an evidentiary hearing . . . required.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 185-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The defendant\u2019s allegation that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel did not inform him of the collateral consequences of his pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>in a civil proceeding does not constitute a basis for withdrawal of the plea under \u00a7 721 (4). A guilty plea under <em>the Alford </em>doctrine is a \u201cjudicial oxymoron in that the defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea nevertheless.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 169 n.3, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985). In <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court treated such guilty pleas as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a plea of nolo contendere. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra n.3; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>16 Conn. App. 518, 533, 548 A.2d 445 (1988). \u201cA plea of nolo contendere has the same legal effect as a plea of guilty on all further proceedings <em>within the indictment. . . . </em>The only practical difference is that the plea of nolo contendere may not be used against the defendant as an admission in a subsequent criminal or civil case.\u201d (Emphasis added; citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>197 Conn. 17, 20-21 n.7, 495 A.2d 1028 (1985). As a guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a plea of nolo contendere, an <em>Alford </em>plea may not be used against the defendant as an admission in a subsequent civil case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>supra. Accordingly, as a matter of law, the defendant cannot maintain the foregoing as a basis for withdrawal of the plea under \u00a7 721 (4). <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 185-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Further, the record of the plea proceeding conclusively establishes that the defendant\u2019s pleas pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine were entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. \u201c[F]or a plea to be knowing and intelligent, the record must show that the federal constitutional standards were satisfied . . . and that there was substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711. . . . There is no requirement, however, that the defendant be advised of every possible consequence of such a plea.\u201d (Footnote and citations omitted.) <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 383, 521 A.2d 547 (1987). The record of the plea proceedings demonstrates that the federal constitutional standards were satisfied and that there was substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711. The defendant\u2019s claim that his pleas were not knowing and voluntary because counsel failed to inform him of the nonexistent collateral consequences of his <em>Alford </em>plea is therefore without merit. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The defendant next argues that his pleas of guilty entered pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine were involuntary because the state failed, before the defendant entered his pleas, to disclose information about a potential state\u2019s witness, namely, that the witness was in state custody and therefore any testimony by him could have been subject to state influence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The crux of the defendant\u2019s claim appears to be that, but for the omission of this information, the defendant would not have pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine because this information could have been used to impeach the state\u2019s witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d \u201cImpeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence falls within <em>Brady\u2019s </em>definition of evidence favorable to an accused. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985); <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 87; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Polizzi, </em>801 F.2d 1543, 1553 (9th Cir. 1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 142, 531 A.2d 125 (1987). \u201c[E]vidence required to be disclosed must be disclosed at a time when it can be used.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>199 Conn. 399, 414, 508 A.2d 1 (1986), on remand, 205 Conn. 132, 531 A.2d 125 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The defendant is not entitled to impeachment evidence about a state\u2019s witness <em>until </em>the witness has been called by the state and has testified on direct examination. Practice Book \u00a7 744.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, the witness was obviously never called to testify by the state, and therefore the defendant was not entitled to information about the criminal \u201ccharges pending against the witness known to the prosecuting attorney.\u201d Id. The claimed <em>Brady </em>material sought by the defendant could not have been used unless, and until, the witness was called to testify. Accordingly, the state had no obligation to disclose the information before the defendant entered his pleas of guilty pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. As the defendant was not entitled to this information until trial, the unavailability of the information did not render the defendant\u2019s pleas involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Relying on federal cases, the defendant finally claims that the trial court should have permitted the with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>drawal of his pleas because the state would not have suffered any prejudice from their withdrawal. The federal standard for presentence withdrawal motions, derived from dictum in <em>Kercheval </em>v. <em>United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 224, 47 S. Ct. 582, 71 L. Ed. 1009 (1927), is any \u201cfair and just\u201d reason. The fair and just reason test has received different interpretations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The prevailing view in the federal courts, however, as stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Saft, </em>558 F.2d 1073, 1083 (2d Cir. 1977), is that there is no occasion to inquire into the matter of prejudice unless the defendant first shows a sufficient reason for being allowed to withdraw his plea.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are persuaded by that view. Although a trial court may, in the exercise of its discretion, consider whether the state will suffer any prejudice in the event that the plea is withdrawn, that consideration does not eliminate the requirement that the defendant must first show a basis for withdrawing the guilty plea under Practice Book \u00a7 721. As demonstrated by parts I through IV of this opinion, the defendant failed to make that showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\"> A plea of guilty pursuant to <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
