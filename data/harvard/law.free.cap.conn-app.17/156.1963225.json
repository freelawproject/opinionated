The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s relevancy objection and admitting evidence of a witness\u2019 arrest for an unrelated incident. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">Facts dispositive of this appeal show that the defendant was on trial for disorderly conduct arising out of his activities on the picket line at a strike. The court found that the defendant had spit into the face of a plant supervisor who was waiting in a car for an opening in the picket line so that he could enter the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>On cross-examination, a defense witness admitted that he had been arrested the morning of trial for spitting at someone while on picket duty at another plant of the same employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The full transcript of the objection and ensuing colloquy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201c[State]: You got arrested for what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor, relevancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u201c[State]: Your Honor, it\u2019s to show bias on the part of this witness in this testimony, that he had a reason why he would come to court and not tell the truth if he felt it would exonerate someone in the same position and also might cause consternation of people in the management. That\u2019s why I asked that question. I think it shows bias on his part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\u201cThe Court: The same incident, the same kind of activity. It\u2019s not an unrelated activity. If he shows that he himself was in confrontation with the authorities, doesn\u2019t that bear on his veracity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">\u201c[State]: He\u2019s not a defendant, so the rule is slightly different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Very well, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">It is elementary that to appeal from the ruling of a trial court there must first be a ruling. The transcript discloses that although there was a brief colloquy between the court and the state\u2019s attorney, the court never ruled on the objection nor did the defendant take an exception. A reasonable interpretation of the transcript is that, after hearing the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney and the court, defense counsel conceded that the evidence was admissible and withdrew his objection. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>194 Conn. 438, 446, 479 A.2d 1209 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Our rules of practice require trial counsel to take a timely exception to a ruling on the admission of evidence in order to make it a ground of appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 288;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 Conn. App. 132, 134-35, 485 A.2d 934 (1985). The purpose of this requirement is to alert the trial court to a possible error while there is still time to take action to correct it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>8 Conn. App. 376, 379, 513 A.2d 168, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 813, 517 A.2d 631 (1986). Here, an exception would have advised the court of defense counsel\u2019s assumption that it had ruled on his objection and permitted it to remedy the situation and create a clear record for review. The absence of such exception supports our conclusion that the trial court did not make a ruling. To find otherwise would amount to a trial by ambuscade. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>178 Conn. 427, 436, 423 A.2d 72 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Even if we were to assume that the court did rule on the defendant\u2019s objection, the lack of an exception precludes our review. Furthermore, it cannot be raised under the constitutional exception of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 67, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), because evidentiary rulings of relevancy are matters for the trial court\u2019s discretion, not issues of constitutional dimension. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 14, 24, 505 A.2d 690 (1986). Nor do we find that it reaches the magnitude required for review under the plain error doctrine. <em>Nisbet </em>v. <em>Olmeda, </em>15 Conn. App. 6, 14-15, 544 A.2d 642 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 288: \u201cobjections to evidence.
