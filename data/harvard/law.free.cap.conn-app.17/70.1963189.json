A settlement was negotiated by the attorneys for the shareholders, but the plaintiff would not agree to it. The settlement went to the trial court for approval, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-572j, and, after a lengthy examination of the settlement by the court, it was approved. On appeal, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>claims that the trial court erred in approving the settlement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Section 52-572j does not require the assent of each individual shareholder in order for a settlement to be approved by the court. Moreover, the cause of action in a derivative suit belongs to the corporation, not to the nominal plaintiff. We find it persuasive that the federal courts that have considered this issue have held that the assent of the nominal plaintiff is not essential to the settlement. See <em>Saylor </em>v. <em>Lindsley, </em>456 F.2d 896, 899 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>494 F.2d 799, 803 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 900, 95 S. Ct. 184, 42 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1974); <em>Flinn </em>v. <em>FMC Corporation, </em>528 F.2d 1169, 1174 (4th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 967, 96 S. Ct. 1462, 47 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1976); <em>Pettway </em>v. <em>American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>576 F.2d 1157, 1216 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1115, 99 S. Ct. 1020, 59 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1979). We have reviewed the evidence and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate. See <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>698 F.2d 61, 73 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 818, 104 S. Ct. 77, 78 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
