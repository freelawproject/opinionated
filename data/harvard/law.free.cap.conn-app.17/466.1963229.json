The court entered a finding of guilty and set a sentencing date. Two days prior to sentencing, new counsel appeared for the defendant and filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 720 and 721. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 19,1988, the trial court denied the motion and thereafter sentenced the defendant to a term of seven years imprisonment, suspended after three years, with three years probation, in accordance with the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. He argues that the court failed to inform him of the maximum fine that could be imposed for a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-112 and therefore failed to personally ensure that he fully understood the maximum possible sentence on the charge as required by Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4), thereby denying him due process of law as secured by the Connecticut and United States constitutions. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">This court recently held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rish, </em>17 Conn. App. 447, 451-52, 553 A.2d 1145 (1989), that the failure of the trial court to inform the defendant of the precise amount of the fine that could have been imposed as a result of his <em>Alford </em>plea did not constitute defective compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>207 Conn. 590, 596, 542 A.2d 1131 (1988), our Supreme Court was unpersuaded by the argument that the trial court erred when it accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas without informing him of the minimum sentences mandated by each charge to which he pleaded guilty. The defendant\u2019s appellate argument was unavailing because the sentence imposed was not different from that of the plea bargained agreement. Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>17 Conn. App. 307, 312, 552 A.2d 442 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Finally, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 360, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981), the court held that the failure of the trial court to advise the defendant of the right to a trial by a judge, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 711 (5), did not require the vacating of the defendant\u2019s plea. The trial court had complied with every other facet of \u00a7 711; accordingly, the Supreme Court held that there was substantial compliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00a7 711, such that none of the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected rights had been abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 711 was promulgated to ensure that guilty pleas are made voluntarily and with full knowledge of the waiver of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>194 Conn. 223, 226, 478 A.2d 1008 (1984), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>supra, 357. In <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969), the United States Supreme Court identified the three constitutional rights which are waived by a plea of guilty: \u201cFirst, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and applicable to the states by reasons of the Fourteenth [Amendment]. . . . Second, is the right to a trial by jury. . . . Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In the present case, the trial court complied with every provision of Practice Book \u00a7 711 except that it failed to inform the defendant of the maximum fine that could be imposed for a violation of \u00a7 53a-112. Our review of the proceedings indicates that a fine was not contemplated in the plea bargain. Accordingly, we hold that the failure of the trial court to inform the defendant of the maximum fine that could have been imposed does not constitute defective compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711 (4) and that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
