Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973), accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 79, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blevins, </em>13 Conn. App. 413, 417, 536 A.2d 1002 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>3 Conn. App. 359, 364, 488 A.2d 837 (1985). The voluntariness of the consent is normally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>decided by the trial court based on the evidence it deems credible along with the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>189 Conn. 461, 469, 456 A.2d 1191 (1983). \u201cThe ultimate question \u2018is whether the will of the consenting individual was overborne, or whether the consent was his unconstrained choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blevins, </em>supra, 417, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>7 Conn. App. 656, 659, 510 A.2d 213 (1986). The conclusions of the trial court will stand on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 244, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The evidence presented at the suppression hearing amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the search of the defendant was consensual. The trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
