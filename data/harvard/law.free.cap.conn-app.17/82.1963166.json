J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYF\">The plaintiff, AMAX, Inc., is a multistate corporation with its principal place of business in Connecticut. The issue in this case is whether the plaintiff owed an additional Connecticut corporation business tax arising out of capital gain and dividend income received by it in 1975, as assessed by the defendant, the commissioner of revenue services. The resolution of this issue necessitates an interpretation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The commissioner assessed a tax of $1,604,746, plus interest at the statutory rate, against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This assessment was based on the defendant\u2019s treatment of the plaintiff\u2019s income as allocated to Connecticut, resulting in its being subject in its entirety to the Connecticut corporation business tax pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-237, appealed to the Superior Court from the defendant\u2019s determination, asserting that it was entitled to apportionment of the dividend and capital gain income under the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, and ordered that the defendant\u2019s assessment of additional tax be set aside and the case remanded to the defendant for an apportionment of the capital gain and dividend income received by the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (3) (a), (b) or (c). We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The stipulated facts are as follows. The plaintiff, a New York corporation, has been engaged for many years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>in the mining, refining and sale of metals, including copper, throughout the world. In 1975, the plaintiff owned an interest in two mining companies in South Africa, O\u2019okiep Copper Company Limited (O\u2019okiep) and Tsumeb Corporation Limited (Tsumeb). O\u2019okiep was formed in 1937 and has been continuously engaged in copper mining in South Africa since that time. Tsumeb was formed in 1947 and, since that time, has been continuously engaged in copper mining in southwest Africa.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In December, 1975, the plaintiff transferred its interests in O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb to a Bermuda corporation in exchange for 100 percent of its stock. For federal income tax purposes, that transfer was a taxable transaction and the plaintiff reported capital gains of $10,261,039 and dividends of $5,769,964 attributable to the transfer on its 1975 federal income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The parties disagree on two issues. The first issue includes a number of related claims. The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 12-218 of the General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) is ambiguous, that it concerns the imposition of a tax, that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute is not entitled to any deference, and that the plaintiff was entitled to a de novo review upon its appeal to the trial court. Conversely, the defendant argues that the statute is not ambiguous, that it concerns an exemption from the Connecticut corporation business tax, that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-218 is entitled to special deference, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to a de novo review. Second, the plaintiff claims that the income received from the 1975 sale of its stock in O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb was \u201cintegral\u201d to its business and thus apportionable pursuant to \u00a7 12-218 (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>defendant would allocate the entire gain to Connecticut, claiming that \u00a7 12-218 (1) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in concluding that \u00a7 12-218 was ambiguous and therefore to be construed in favor of the plaintiff and against the taxing authority. We disagree. The law in this state is clear that, if a taxing statute is ambiguous, the taxpayer is entitled to a construction in its favor. <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 423, 521 A.2d 569 (1987). We conclude that \u00a7 12-218 was ambiguous, given the legislative history that accompanied the statute\u2019s amendment in 1981 from an allocation or apportionment formula to a straight apportionment formula.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the meaning of \u201cintegral parts,\u201d the statutory language at issue in this case, is not readily discernible from the face of the statute. The statute is sufficiently ambiguous, thereby entitling the plaintiff to a construction of \u00a7 12-218 in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The defendant also argues that the trial court erred in concluding that \u00a7 12-218 concerns the imposition of a tax and, therefore, must be strictly construed against the taxing authority and in favor of the taxpayer. In <em>B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 6, 490 A.2d 991 (1985), however, the court concluded that \u00a7 12-218 concerned the imposition of a tax. The statute must, therefore, be strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer and against the taxing authority. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>583, 588, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 420-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The defendant further argues that the trial court erred in concluding that no deference should be given to his interpretation of \u00a7 12-218. \u201c[T]he construction of a statute on an issue that has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny is a question of law on which an administrative ruling is not entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 423. Furthermore, the appellate review accorded to a taxpayer after an adverse ruling by the commissioner of revenue services is a plenary one; <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra, 583; and the taxpayer is entitled to a trial de novo. <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 421. The trial court was, therefore, correct as to the first set of claims raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in concluding that the acquisition, management and disposition of the stock of the plaintiffs subsidiaries (O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb) constituted income that was an \u201cintegral [part] of [the plaintiffs] regular trade or business operations,\u201d thereby compelling the application of \u00a7 12-218 (2). The defendant relies on \u00a7 12-218 (1), arguing that since the plaintiff has its principal place of business in Connecticut, the entire income must be allocated to this state. In effect, the defendant reads \u00a7 12-218 (2) as an exception to \u00a7 12-218 (1), claiming that the income was not \u201cintegral\u201d to the plaintiffs business and, therefore, that \u00a7 12-218 (2) does not apply. Section 12-218 (2) states that income accrued by an integral business shall be apportioned and not allocated. We agree with the trial court that the income was integral to the plaintiffs business and thus was apportionable under \u00a7 12-218 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The crucial question in this case is the meaning of the term \u201cintegral.\u201d Since there is no Connecticut authority that directly addresses the question of what constitutes an \u201cintegral\u201d part of a business,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we, like the trial court, use United States Supreme Court cases for guidance. Although these leading cases relied on by the trial court to determine whether the plaintiff and its subsidiaries constitute an integral business do not address the standard to be used to interpret the meaning of \u201cintegral parts\u201d income, they are relevant to the interpretation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (2). See <em>Container Corporation of America </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>463 U.S. 159, 103 S. Ct. 2933, 77 L. Ed. 2d 545, reh. denied, 464 U.S. 909, 104 S. Ct. 265, 78 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1983); <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Department, </em>458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819, reh. denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982); <em>ASARCO, Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Commission, </em>458 U.S. 307, 102 S. Ct. 3103, 73 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1982); <em>Exxon Corporation </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Department of Revenue, </em>447 U.S. 207, 100 S. Ct. 2109, 65 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1980); <em>Mobil Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, </em>445 U.S. 425, 100 S. Ct. 1223, 63 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1980). All of these cases concern the constitutionality of state apportionment statutes under the due process and commerce clauses of the United States constitution. U.S. Const., amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 and art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. The constitutional nexus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>explicated by the Supreme Court in these cases is the unitary business principle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">This principle provides that apportionment is constitutionally permissible only if the income being taxed was earned in the course of activities that are part of a unitary business conducted by the corporate taxpayer within the taxing state. See <em>Mobil Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes, </em>supra, 439. In order to determine whether it is constitutionally permissible for a state to tax corporate income, the unitary business principle requires a review of certain factors. These factors are \u201cfunctional integration, centralization of management, and [other] economies of scale.\u201d Id., 438. Since these \u201cfactors of profitability\u201d are derived from the operation of the business in its entirety, it would be deceptive to characterize such income as having a particular origin. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The unitary business principle is similar to the concept of \u201cintegral parts\u201d income under \u00a7 12-218 (2). Since the statute does not define the term \u201cintegral\u201d we accord the term its commonly understood meaning. <em>B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 5. The word \u201cintegral\u201d is commonly understood to mean \u201centire,\u201d and the term \u201cunitary\u201d generally means \u201cwhole.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary (2d Ed. 1985). Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court cases that delineate the unitary business principle concern state apportionment statutes that likewise employ the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>statutory language at issue in this case. See, e.g., <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Department, </em>supra, 357 n.2; <em>ASARCO, Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Commission, </em>supra, 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cunitary cases,\u201d as previously noted, describe the significant factors that support a conclusion that a corporation is part of a unitary business. In addition, the trial court must find that these factors demonstrate the actual exertion of control by a corporation over its subsidiaries, as opposed to potential control. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Department, </em>supra, 362-63. The first factor, functional integration, is present here. The trial court found, and we agree, that the plaintiff was functionally integrated with its subsidiaries, O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb. This finding is amply supported by the record. The parties stipulated that O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb were engaged in the business of mining copper. The trial court also found that the plaintiff and its predecessors have been engaged for many years in the business of mining, refining and selling a variety of metals, including copper, throughout the world. \u201cWhen a corporation invests in a subsidiary that engages in the same line of work as itself, it becomes much more likely that one function of the investment is to make better use \u2014 either through economies of scale or through operational integration or sharing of expertise \u2014 of the parent\u2019s existing business-related resources.\u201d <em>Container Corporation of America </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>supra, 178. Moreover, two of the plaintiff\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries had exclusive rights as sales agents for the copper produced by Tsumeb and O\u2019okiep, and a substantial portion of the copper refined at one of the plaintiff\u2019s refineries was supplied by Tsumeb and O\u2019okiep.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We next consider whether the trial court could reasonably conclude that there was centralization of management or other economies of scale between AMAX <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and its subsidiaries, O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb. Through its stock ownership in the two corporations,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> AMAX controlled five of the ten seats on the O\u2019okiep board of directors. Two of the ten O\u2019okiep directors were AMAX directors and three other O\u2019okiep directors were AMAX employees. Eleven of the fifteen Tsumeb directors were either AMAX directors or employees. Further, the parties stipulated that AMAX, together with an unaffiliated corporation, controlled, managed, and made all policy decisions regarding O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb. The trial court could reasonably find that AMAX not only had the \u201cpotential\u201d to control O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb but actually exerted such control. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Department, </em>supra, 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Having found functional integration, centralization of management and other economies of scale, and actual control by AMAX over O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff operated its subsidiaries as part of a unitary business. See <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Taxation &amp; Revenue Department, </em>supra, 364. Accordingly, the dividends and capital gain income received by the plaintiff from the sale of its O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb stock constitutes business income, \u201cincome . . . derived from . . . intangible property, the acquisition, management and disposition of which constitute integral parts of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (2). Such business income \u201cshall not be allocated . . . but shall be apportioned\u201d in accordance with the apportionment scheme of \u00a7 12-218 (3). On appeal, we review the factual findings of the trial court to ensure that they were legally, logically and reasonably found, thereby allowing the trial court reasonably to conclude as it did. <em>Ruwet-Sibley Equipment Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>poration </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>15 Conn. App. 21, 25, 542 A.2d 1171, cert. dismissed, 209 Conn. 806, 548 A.2d 437 (1988). Our review of the record discloses ample support for the court\u2019s findings and its conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s dividend and capital gain income from the sale of its O\u2019okiep and Tsumeb stock was integrally related to its business and thus apportionable under General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\"> In addition to being taxed in Connecticut, all or part of the disputed income was also subject to taxation by California, Colorado, New York and Wisconsin and gave rise to an additional aggregate tax liability in those states of approximately $150,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (1) provided in pertinent part: \u201cInterest, taxable dividends and net gains or losses either from sales or book write-offs of intangible assets, less related expenses, of a company having its principal place of business within the state shall be allocated to the state . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-218 (2) provided in pertinent part: \u201c[Income] derived from tangible or intangible property, the acquisition, management and disposition of which constitute <em>integral parts </em>of the taxpayer\u2019s regular trade or business operations, shall not be allocated . . . but shall be apportioned . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.)

U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. Because we agree with the trial court that the commissioner\u2019s assessment of a tax on the plaintiffs income by allocation was improper, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>address this issue. It is noteworthy, however, that \u201c[a]t least in the interstate commerce context . . . the antidiscrimination principle has not in practice required much in addition to the requirement of fair apportionment.\u201d <em>Container Corporation of America </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>463 U.S. 159, 171, 103 S.
