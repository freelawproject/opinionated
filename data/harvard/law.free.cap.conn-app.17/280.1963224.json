We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On or about May 3, 1984,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the parties entered into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>agreement providing that the defendant would prepare a scale model and interior design plan for a home to be constructed by the plaintiffs in New Canaan. The agreement provided that all disputes arising under the agreement would be subject to binding arbitration under the rules and auspices of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Pursuant to the agreement, the plaintiffs filed a demand for arbitration. The parties later executed a general submission to have the dispute decided by the AAA under.the commercial arbitration rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Hearings were conducted on October 16, 1986, November 20, 1986, and January 13, 1987. The parties had until February 16, 1987, to file written briefs with the arbitrator. On March 17,1987, the arbitrator awarded the plaintiffs $21,130 and ordered the return of a deposit made by the plaintiffs to a carpet company.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Subsequent to the award, the plaintiffs filed an application with the Superior Court for an order confirming the award; General Statutes \u00a7 52-417;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the defendant filed an application with the court to vacate or correct the award. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-418, 52-419.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These matters were heard by the trial court in a single proceeding. The trial court denied the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>cation to vacate, but corrected the award by excluding the order requiring the return of the deposit held by the carpet company. The court confirmed the balance of the award to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The defendant claims that the arbitrator engaged in improper conduct and procedures by receiving evidence after the termination of the final hearing. The defendant also claims that the award exceeded the general submission executed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u201c \u2018Arbitration is favored by courts as a means of settling differences and expediting the resolution of disputes.\u2019 Wolf <em>v. Gould, </em>10 Conn. App. 292, 296, 522 A.2d 1240 (1987). \u2018There is no question that arbitration awards are generally upheld and that we give great deference to an arbitrator\u2019s decision since arbitration is favored as a means of settling disputes.\u2019 <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local 760, </em>6 Conn. App. 11, 13, 502 A.2d 429 (1986). \u2018The party challenging the award bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient to invalidate or avoid it, and only upon a showing that it \u201cfalls within the proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 of the General Statutes, or procedurally violates the parties\u2019 agreement\u201d will the determination of an arbitrator be subject to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>inquiry.\u2019 <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Limited Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 145-46, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987).\u201d <em>Vincent Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Application Systems, Inc., </em>16 Conn. App. 486, 488, 547 A.2d 1381 (1988). \u201cIt is axiomatic in this jurisdiction that any challenge to an award based on General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers ... is limited to a comparison of the award with the submission.\u201d <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 296. Our review on appeal is limited to an examination of the submission and the award; we then determine whether the award conforms to the submission. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The trial court found that all of the parties had signed the submission to the arbitration board. The issue submitted was: \u201c[Cjlaim by Alwin K. and Lillian L. Fraund, and counterclaims by Design Ideas, Inc., arising out of [a] written agreement dated May 2 and May 3, 1984.\u201d The court further found that the award conformed to the submission, except with respect to the deposit held by the carpet company. The court modified the award accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The scope of the matter to be considered by the arbitrator is limited by the submission. <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>171 Conn. 613, 621, 370 A.2d 1076 (1976). \u201cThe submission defines the scope of the entire arbitration proceeding by delineating the issues to be decided.\u201d <em>Naugatuck </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>190 Conn. 323, 326, 460 A.2d 1285 (1983). The issue submitted was simply the claim and counterclaims arising out of the written agreement between the parties. The trial court did not err in confirming the award, as the modified award clearly conformed to the parties\u2019 submission. Moreover, the trial court did not err in confirming the award despite the claim that the arbitrator engaged in improper conduct by receiving evidence after the close of the hearings, in violation of the AAA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>rules. The court found that both parties, and not just the plaintiffs, had submitted posthearing evidence to the arbitrator as part of their respective briefs. The court also found that the parties agreed to conduct the arbitration under the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA. The court concluded that, because the defendant agreed to be bound by those rules, which included Rule 38,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the defendant failed to object to the submission of the evidence, the defendant had waived its right to object. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not err in finding that the defendant had waived any objection to the posthearing submission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\"> Both applications were consolidated by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\"> The contract was signed on May 2, 1984, by Alwin K.
