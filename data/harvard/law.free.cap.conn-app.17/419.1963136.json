On April 18, 1985, Domenico Maccione and Lisa Ellen Maccione were divorced by a decree of a court of the state of Florida. The Florida court awarded primary residency of the couple\u2019s minor child, Amber, to Lisa Ellen Maccione. On July 25,1987, Domenico Maccione, a resident of Florida, petitioned the Florida court for a modification of the dissolution decree in order to gain primary residency of Amber. On August 31, 1987, before the Florida court ruled on the defendant\u2019s petition, Amber Maccione\u2019s maternal grandparents, Bernice and Burt Glassman of New Haven, brought this action against Domenico Maccione and Lisa Ellen Maccione<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in New Haven Superior Court, alleging that Amber had been living continuously in their home since March, 1987, and requesting that custody of Amber be awarded to them. Thereafter, on September 9, 1987, the Florida court granted Domenico Maccione\u2019s petition for modification of the dissolution decree and awarded primary residency of Amber to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">On motion of the defendant Domenico Maccione, the trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that the Florida court had jurisdiction with respect to custody of Amber and that, under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-96, the court should refrain from exercising jurisdiction. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Both Connecticut and Florida have adopted the provisions of the UCC JA, which is intended to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict between the courts of different states in matters of child custody. <em>Agnello </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>184 Conn. 421, 426, 440 A.2d 172 (1981). The UCCJA seeks to assure that only one state make cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tody decisions. Id., 430. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-96 (a) specifically provides that a Connecticut court <em>\u201cshall not </em>exercise its jurisdiction ... if at the time of filing the petition a proceeding concerning the custody of the child is pending in a court of another state exercising jurisdiction substantially in conformity with [Connecticut law], unless the proceeding is stayed by the court of the other state . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The record is clear that, at the time the plaintiffs filed their custody petition in New Haven Superior Court, a \u201cproceeding concerning the custody of the child\u201d initiated by the child\u2019s father, the defendant Domenico Maccione, was pending in Florida, the state in which the original custody decree was rendered. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and declining thereby to exercise jurisdiction, the trial court acted in accordance with the clear language and purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-96 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> Lisa Ellen Maccione did not file an appearance and is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
