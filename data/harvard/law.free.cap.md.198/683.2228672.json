He now complains that the trial court refused to appoint counsel for him, and stated that he should provide his own counsel. It is not shown that the request was renewed at the time of trial, or that his case was not fully presented. Judge Johnson, who heard the application for <em>habeas corpus, </em>found his rights were not violated \u201cdue to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>age and prior experience, as well as taking into consideration the degree of the crime\u201d. As we said in <em>Loane v. Warden, </em>196 Md. 651, 75 A (2) 772, \u201cthe matter was in the discretion of the trial judge, unless the circumstances were such as to require the appointment of counsel under provisions of the State or Federal Constitution. The petition does not indicate that the petitioner was deprived of any of his fundamental rights.\u201d Cf. <em>Raymond v. State, ex rel. Szydlouski, </em>192 Md. 602, 65 A (2) 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
