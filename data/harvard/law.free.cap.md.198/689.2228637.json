He does not allege any circumstances that required the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>appointment of counsel for him, or that he asked for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">As he has failed to show any circumstances that would justify the granting of the writ, his application will be denied. <em>Walker v.
