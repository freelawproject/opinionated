He offers to produce a picture of the man who, he alleges, committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The writ of <em>coram nobis </em>has been fully discussed in the cases of <em>Keane v. State, </em>164 Md. 685, 166 A. 410, and <em>Bernard v. State, </em>193 Md. 1, 4, 65 A. 2d 297, 298. In the last mentioned case, we said: \u201cThe writ will not lie to correct an issue of fact which has been adjudicated even though wrongly determined; nor for alleged false testimony at the trial; nor for newly discovered evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">If we treat the application as one for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>it is well settled that no relief in a case such as this can be given under that writ. <em>Copeland v. Wright, </em>188 Md. 666, 53 A. 2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The appropriate remedy in such a case is an application to the executive department. <em>Keane v.
