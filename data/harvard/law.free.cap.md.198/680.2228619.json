Each defendant received an indeterminate sentence of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">The applicant alleges that he was unable to employ counsel, but admits that he was represented by counsel appointed by the court. He plead guilty to the charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>He complains that the other defendants subsequently obtained \u201cacts of mitigation\u201d, presumably reduction of sentence, but he does not state what the mitigation was, through what agency it was obtained, or any facts that would entitle him to similar relief. Cf. <em>Coleman v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 678, 81 A (2) 460. As we said in that case, \u201ca prisoner can always seek a reduction in sentence by applying to the Division of Parole and Probation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
