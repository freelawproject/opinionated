The applicant was tried and convicted in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on a charge of theft of an automobile. He contends that he was illegally convicted because the arresting officers at one trial (apparently of someone else) testified before Judge France in Baltimore that they could not identify him as one of the men who got out of a stolen automobile, but, at petitioner\u2019s trial in Prince George\u2019s County, they did testify that he was one of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>men. The legal sufficiency of the evidence, or the question of guilt or innocence, or the commission of perjury by witnesses, cannot be made a basis for the issuance of a writ of <em>habeas corpus. Copeland v. Wright, </em>188 Md. 666, 53 A. 2d 653. <em>Walker v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 290, 55 A. 2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\n<em>Application denied with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
