Northern Mining &amp; Trading Co. v. Alaska Gold Recovery Co., 20 F.(2d) 5. On the former review we held that the' purpose for which the property was sought to be taken was not authorized by law, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-18\">\u201cIt is quite manifest to us that these statutes do not authorize the taking of private property for any such use as is here contemplated. The statutes only authorize the taking of private property for rights of way for pole and transmission lines and rights incidental thereto, or, in other words, \u2018for the setting of poles or the construction of towers upon which to string wires for telephone and telegraph lines, and lines for the transmission of electric light or power for the operation of aerial trams and to permit of-maintaining the same and keeping it in repair.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">We were further of opinion that the entire purpose of the appropriation was unauthorized, saying :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-21\">\u201cThe decision of this question would seem to be decisive of the case and we deem it unnecessary to consider other questions discussed in the briefs of counsel, such as the right of an administrator to maintain an action of this kind. However, if the plaintiffs should elect to claim only such rights as they are entitled to claim under the law, after the ease is remanded, the latter question is worthy of serious consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-22\">The judgment was thereupon reversed and the case remanded to the court helow for further proceedings, permitting the plaintiffs to claim only such rights as they were entitled to claim under the law as construed by this court, if so advised. After the remand, the court entered a second order authorizing the appropriation of the identical property described in the former order and for practically the same' purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-23\">The only question with which we are concerned at this time is: Did the court below carry out the mandate of this court? Manifestly, it did not. The property appropriated consisted of approximately an acre, described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-24\">\u201cCommencing at the S. E. Cor. of Hunter Beach or Sweet Marie placer at Cor. No. 2 of U. S. mineral survey No. 333 of said claim; thence N. 3\u00b0 23' E. 175 feet along line 2-1 of said survey; thence N. 77\u00b0 32' W. 200 feet; thence S. 3\u00b0 43' W. 125 feet; thence N. 77\u00b0 32' W. 85 feet; thence S. 3\u00b0 43' W. 50 feet; thence S. 77\u00b0 32' E. along line 2-3 of said survey 285 feet, to the place of beginning, containing an area of 90/100 of one acre.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-25\">Erom the foregoing description and from, the entire record it becomes at once apparent that the property is not sought or appropriated as a right of way \u201cfor the setting of poles or the construction of towers upon which to string wires for telephone and telegraph lines, and lines for the transmission-of electric light or power for the operation of aerial trams and to permit of maintaining the same and keeping it in repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-26\">The order of the court below is therefore reversed, and' the cause is remanded, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>directions to restore the property to the plaintiff in error and to dismiss the proceeding's.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b135-5\">DIETRICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AD_\">I concur only in the view that the second order is not materially different from the first, and must therefore be reversed. But, adhering to the views expressed in my former dissent, I do not think the cause should be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
