S. U. S. (26 USCA \u00a7 404; Comp. St. \u00a7 6038). The indictment charged the defendant with removing from a distillery distilled spirits upon \u2018which the tax imposed by law had not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-21\">The only point relied upon by the defendant is that section 3296 could not be violated, because the government would not allow the tax on such spirits to he paid, or issue a license for distilling the same, even though the tax was offered to be paid. On the authority of United States v. Stafoff, 260 U. S. 477, 43 S. Ct. 197, 67 L. Ed. 358, which expressly holds that section 3296 was re-enacted by the Supplemental Prohibition Act of November 23, 1921 (27 USCA \u00a7 3), and where the eourt says, \u201cOf course, Congress may tax what it also forbids,\u201d we hold that there is nothing in the point raised by defendant, and the judgment of the eourt below is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"AkCv\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
