The lease called for $800 per month; at the time of filing the petition in bankruptcy, one month\u2019s rent was due, another month accrued while the bankruptcy receiver was in possession, and nine months of the term remained after the estate moved out. The claimant prayed a lien for this eleven months\u2019 rent pursuant to the Kentucky statute. Section 2317, Ky. Stats.; Courtney v. Fidelity Co. (C. C. A. 6) 219 F. 57. The referee approved the claim of lien until the time the receiver took possession and allowed the elaim during the possession of the receiver as an expense of administration; but disallowed the remainder. On review, the District Judge reversed the referee\u2019s order and allowed the full claim with full lien for the eleven months\u2019 period. The decision turns upon the precise language of the lease. One paragraph says, \u201cShould the lessee become bankrupt or go into involuntary liquidation, then, in such event, this lease shall become immediately forfeited, and all payments' made thereon shall be forfeited to the lessor.\u201d There is the following \u201cadditional stipulation\u201d: \u201c(10) This lease, at the option of the lessor, shall be void in case of any violation of any agreement or covenant herein contained.\u201d It is the contention of the lessee that, because he had become bankrupt, the lease thereupon came to an end and imposed no further obligation upon him; the lessor contends that \u201cshall become immediately forfeited\u201d moans that it was forfeited at her election.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-25\">Two considerations lead us to agree with the District Judge. One is that ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>narily <em>the </em>party for <em>whose </em>benefit a condition is provided has an election whether or not to insist upon the condition; and this principle applies to leases as well as to other contracts. \u201cLeases which * * * declare that on the happening of the contingency the demise shall thereupon become null and void [mean] that the forfeiture may be enforced * * * at the option of the lessor.\u201d Ewell v. Daggs, 108 U. S. 143, 149, 2 S. Ct. 408, 412 (27 L. Ed. 682). See, also, Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant (8th Ed.) \u00a7 492. We must look upon this condition as being dominantly for the benefit of the landlord. She had normally a complete legal right to the rent for the full term, and would not naturally yield it up; in the ordinary case of bankruptcy, it may or may not be in the interest of-the lessor to have a forfeiture, and the right to elect would not naturally be given up. Nor was it seemingly for the benefit of the lessee to have the lease terminated. Often, an existing lease is an asset most valuable to the lessee, and he would not naturally intend an advance to deprive himself of that asset. Another aspect of the same reason is found in the correlative rule that a condition will not unnecessarily be interpreted so as to permit one of the parties, by his own default, to bring about his release. Whatever might be thought of involuntary bankruptcy or liquidation, it is clear that\u2018a voluntary bankruptcy would satisfy this condition and that such bankruptcy would be at the wish of the lessee. It cannot be assumed that the lessor would have acquiesced in the acquiring by the lessee \u00f3f a right by which the lessee could, at his own election, defeat all further obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">It is true that, if the rule is the same in Kentucky as in Ohio, and if therefore a claim for further rent is not provable in bankruptcy nor dischargeable therein (Wells v. Twenty-first St. [C. C. A. 6] 12 F.[2d] 237), the lessee might look forward to a benefit by providing that th(5 lease should be by bankruptcy absolutely '\"\"ended; but such possibility is not strong enough to be impressive as an aid to determining the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The other controlling x*eason is that \u201cforfeited\u201d and \u201cterminated\u201d are not synonymous ; it would have been easy to say \u201cterminated.\u201d A thing is hardly \u201cforfeited\u201d unless it has previously been \u201cforfeitable\u201d or \u201cforfeit.\u201d These words strongly imply an election by the person who is to take the thing forfeited. The Century Dictionary definition of the verb, used in the applicable form, is that the owner by his own act has \u201cbecome liable to be deprived of\u201d the article. See Small v. Clark, 97 Me. 304, 54 A. 758. Different considerations prevail when a statute declares things forfeited to the government because they have been used in crime; the officers of the government can have no election in such ease. U. S. v. Stowell, 133 U. S. 1, 16, 10 S. Ct. 244, 33 L. Ed. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The further clause (10), which expressly provides that the lease shall be void at the option of the lessor in certain events, shows, it is true, that the parties knew how specifically to make the option of the lessor the controlling element when they wished to; but this consideration alone is not persuasive that they did not intend the lessor to have another option, othex*wise appropriate, merely because the option clause was not also there contained. Indeed, since there is at least an implied agreement contained in the lease not to become bankrupt, the express option of clause 10 might well be extended to the contingency of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Our attention is called to Elliott v. Marrs, 222 Ky. 642, 1 S. W. (2d) 1049. Since what was there involved was practically a mere license, we do not think that decision applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
