P. T. Varney the following certificate of deposit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-19\">\u201cThe Day &amp; Night National Bank of Pike-ville.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-20\">No. 220.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-21\">\u201cThis certifies that <em>W. P. T. Varney </em>has deposited in this bank <em>thirty-five hundred </em>dollars payable to <em>himself </em>order <em>twelve months </em>after date on the return of this certificate properly indorsed. This bank may request thirty days\u2019 notice of the time when payment will be required to meet the requirements of Federal Reserve Board regarding time deposits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-23\">\u201cWith 4 per cent, interest if left twelve months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-24\">\u201cNo interest after 12 months unless renewed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-25\">\u201cNot subject to check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-26\"><em>\u201c0. 0. Graham, </em>Cashier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-27\">The words above italicized are typewritten ; the others were printed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-28\">The defendant in error, George W. Coffey, purchased the certificate before maturity, without notice of any existing equity between the bank and Varney, from the latter, who indorsed the certificate. When the certificate became due, Mr. Coffey presented it for payment, and payment was refused. He then brought suit against the hank for recovery of the amount named in the certificate, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-29\">The hank admitted liability upon the certificate, but pleaded a set-off, on the ground that Varney was indebted to it in the sum of $5,000. Its contention was, and is, that the defendant in error is not a holder in due course, because (a) the instrument is not negotiable, (b) the instrument is not complete, and (e) the instrument is not regular. Contentions (b) and (c) are in essence contained in contention (a) that the instrument is not negotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-30\">To this pleading the defendant in error demurred, and the demurrer was sustained by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-31\">The substance of the contention of plaintiff in error is that the certificate was payable only to Varney (himself).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-32\">The theory of defendant in - error is that the words \u201cpayable to himself order\u201d are equivalent to \u201cpayable to himself <em>or </em>order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-33\">The plaintiff in error maintains that there is a conflict between the typewritten .word \u201chimself\u201d and the printed word \u201corder,\u201d and that the conflict must be resolved in favor of the written word.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-34\">Admitting this rule of construction, the position of the defendant in error is that\u2014 taking the whole instrument into consideration \u2014 there is no conflict to be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-35\">By the\u2019 Kentucky Statutes, a negotiable instrument must \u201cbe payable to the order of a specified person or to bearer.\u201d Section 3720bl. An instrument is \u201cpayable to order where it is drawn payable to the order of a specified person, or to him or his order.\u201d Section 3720b8, Kentucky Statutes. The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>strument \u201cneed not follow the language of this act, but any terms are sufficient which clearly indicate an intention to conform to the requirements thereof.\u201d Section 3720bl0.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Laying aside consideration of the words of the instrument which follow \u201cpayable to himself order,\u201d viz. \u201con the return of this inT strument properly indorsed,\u201d what is the construction which would be reasonably placed on \u201cpayments to himself order?\u201d The plaintiff in error contends it means simply \u201cpayable to himself.\u201d In other words, the court must do for the bank what it did not do for itself, strike out the word \u201corder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In Williston on Contracts, vol. 2, pp. 1205, 1206, it is said: \u201cOf course if the written and printed matter can by any reasonable construction be reconciled, this will be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">It is not unreasonable to construe \u201cpayable to himself order\u201d as equivalent to, or meaning \u201chimself or order.\u201d Otherwise a word npist be stricken \u201cfrom the four corners of the instrument,\u201d or the court must make the assumption that the bank by inadvertence, error, or carelessness failed-to strike out the word \u201corder.\u201d There is no evidence in the record on which such a presumption can be based, unless it is on the face of the instrument itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u201cA bill or note, the same as any other instrument, must be construed as a whole, so \u2022 as to give effect to every part of it, if possible. The contract must be collected from the four corners of the document, and no part of what appears there is to be excluded.\u201d 8 C. J. \u00a7 136, pi 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">It is said that the words, \u201con return of this certificate properly indorsed,\u201d indicate negotiability. Whatever tendency they have on that subject is plainly in that direction; and they may properly operate to confirm a conclusion that the earlier part of the instrument satisfies the statutory definition of what is negotiable. Whether they would alone justify that conclusion (as held in Forrest v. Safety Co. [C. C.] 174 F. 345) we need not consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The certificate contains the following language: \u201cThis bank may. require thirty days\u2019 notice of the time when payment will be required to meet the requirements of Federal Reserve Board regarding time deposits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">It is argued\u2019 for plaintiff in error that this provision render^ the instrument nonnegotiable. The case of First National Bank v. Golden, 19 Cal. App. 501, 126 P. 498, is cited as authority for this position. The G.olden Case involved an order drawn by one on his deposit in a savings bank, which was by reason of a requirement of the bank not to be paid till thirty days\u2019 notice to it, and which further required presentment of the depositor\u2019s passbook with the order. The case of White v. Cushing, 88 Me. 339, 34 A. 164, 32 L. R. A. 590, 51 Am. St. Rep. 402, involved an order containing these words: \u201cThe bank book of the depositor must accompany this order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">In the above eases the delivery of the passbook was a condition precedent to recovery. There is no such condition in the instant case. An instrument, to be negotiable under the Kentucky statute, must be payable on demand or at a fixed or determinable .future time. In this ease the certificate was payable twelve months after date, with an option on the part of the bank to extend the time of payment for thirty days Unless the holder of the certificate should give notice thirty days prior to the expiration of the 12 months\u2019 period that payment would be demanded at that time;</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">The certificate of deposit is held to be negotiable, and the defendant in error a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
