Their testimony was not corroborated by any other witness or by any circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">Barnett denied that he had participated in the larceny, and claimed that he bought the paint after it had been taken from the ship and brought to his store.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-19\">Under the laws of the Canal Zone, a conviction cannot be had on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, and corroboration is not sufficient which merely shows commission of the offense charged. Laws of the Canal Zone (Laws 1904-05, p. 188), \u00a7 197. As the testimony of the accomplices was uncorroborated, it follows that Barnett\u2019s conviction is pot supported by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-20\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
