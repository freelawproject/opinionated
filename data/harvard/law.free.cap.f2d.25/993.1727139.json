Rule 1 of the Equity Rules of 1912 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">\u201cThe district courts, as courts of equity, shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing any pleading, of issuing and returning mesne and final process, and of malting and directing all interlocutory motions, orders, rules, and other proceedings preparatory to the hearing, upon their merits, of all causes pending therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Any district judge may, <em>upon reason?able notice </em>to the parties, make, direct, and award, at chambers or in the clerk\u2019s office, and in vacation as in term, all such process, commissions, orders, rules and other proceedings, whenever the same are not grantable of course, according to the rules and practice of the court.\u201d (Italics those of the court.)</p>\n<p id=\"AXR\">Neither the Governor nor Attorney General is named in the complaint as a party defendant, yet the statute, at least in so far as the application for an interlocutory injunction is concerned, makes both the Governor and the Attorney General indispensable parties, and there must be reasonable notice to both before a determination pursuant to the statute be had on such application. By section 266 no difference is made between the notice to be given the Governor and the Attorney General and that to be given to the defendants. In so far as the Governor and Attorney General are concerned, while tho notice mailed them informed them of the time and place of hearing the application, number of tho ease and names of plaintiff and defendants, all the information furnished by it as to the nature of the relief sought was that it was an application for an interlocutory injunction, under section 266 of the Judicial Code, and that the defendants would be served with a copy of the order, complaint, and motion for the interlocutory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">It may be that the Attorney General has waived any defect in the notice, but the question remains as to the sufficiency of the notice served upon the Governor. The notice did not inform him of the particular law of the state of Washington, enforcement of which was sought to be enjoined, nor of the particular official acts sought to be enjoined, nor on what ground such law was claimed to be unconstitutional, nor the time when the defendants would be served with copies of the court\u2019s order, complaint, and motion. Such is not the notice required by law, nor the reasonable notice intended by rule No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">In the absence of such notice, the court will decline to determine the merits of plaintiff\u2019s application for an interlocutory injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
