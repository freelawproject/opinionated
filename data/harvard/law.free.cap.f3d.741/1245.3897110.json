Because he had prior convictions for other violent crimes, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and consecutive prison terms totaling 57 years. Harris appeals his sentence, arguing that imposing a mandatory life sentence without a finding by the jury as to the fact of his prior convictions is inconsistent with <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). He also challenges the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which provide for the imposition of mandatory life sentences for persons convicted of certain felonies, on the ground that they impermissibly remove sentencing discretion from the courts and delegate it to the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">Harris was released from Florida state prison in 2008. He had been in prison for nearly sixteen years for committing numerous armed robberies in central Florida, but the time served did not have its intended effect. Just a year after his release, Harris was back at it \u2014 he robbed a local video games store four times over the course of a seven-month period. In each of these robberies, he used a gun and threatened to kill store employees. On two occasions, he discharged his weapon. During the May 6, 2009 robbery he fired a bullet in an employee\u2019s direction, narrowly missing the employee\u2019s head, and during the December 21, 2009 robbery, he shot an employee in the leg. Harris was later arrested for and charged with these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">The indictment charged: four counts of Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) and (b); four counts of using and carrying a firearm during those robberies, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); and two counts of being a felon in possession of ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), and 924(e)(1). Following a three-day trial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on three of the counts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but convicted him of seven counts \u2014 three for Hobbs Act robberies, three for using a firearm during those robberies, and one for being a felon in possession of ammunition. The government, seeking a mandatory life sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c), had filed the required information under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, averring that Harris previously had been convicted of one felony that qualified as a serious drug offense and seven felonies that qualified as serious violent felonies under \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-16\">Harris\u2019 presentence investigation report calculated a base offense level of 20 for the first robbery and related offenses under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(a), to which it added a 4-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(B) because a victim was shot in the leg. For the second and third robberies and related offenses, Harris\u2019 base offense level was 20 under \u00a7 2B3.1(a), with no adjustments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>The PSR then applied a multiple count adjustment, which resulted in a total offense level of 27. Because he had prior felony convictions for robbery with a firearm and battery on a law enforcement officer, Harris qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. As a result, the PSR increased his offense level to 37. It calculated his criminal history category, to be VI. The result was a guidelines range of 440 months to life imprisonment. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c), however, a defendant convicted of a serious violent felony, who has previously been convicted of a combination of two or more serious violent felonies or serious drug offenses is subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Harris met those criteria, and the district court imposed the statutorily mandated life sentence. It also sentenced him to serve, consecutively, 57 years imprisonment for his other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Harris contends for the first time on appeal that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Alleyne </em>prohibits a court at sentencing from considering a defendant\u2019s prior convictions if the jury has not found that the defendant committed those crimes. He also renews the argument that he made in the district court that imposing a mandatory life sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) is unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">This Court normally reviews constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). However, where a defendant fails to raise such an objection before the district court at sentencing, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Because Harris raised the <em>Alleyne </em>argument for the first time on appeal, the proper standard of review is for plain error. Under that standard, we cannot \u201ccorrect an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court\u201d unless the defendant shows \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). If those conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">Because Harris raised his constitutional challenge to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 in the district court, we will apply <em>de novo </em>review to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-12\">Harris first contends that the imposition of a mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 3559(c) based on prior conviction facts set out in the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information is inconsistent with the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Alleyne. </em>He relies on the statement in <em>Alleyne </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155 (citation omitted). Because \u201c[m]andatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was for that reason the Court in <em>Alleyne </em>overruled <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), which had held that the Sixth Amendment permits judicial factfinding that increases the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">The <em>Alleyne </em>Court\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Harris </em>was based largely on its reading of its earlier opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). It concluded that the distinction made in <em>Harris </em>between facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the mandatory minimum was \u201cinconsistent with our decision in <em>Apprendi.\u201d Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. Notably, however, <em>Apprendi </em>itself drew a distinction between \u201cnormal\u201d judicial factfinding and the use of prior convictions as a factual basis for sentence enhancement. The <em>Apprendi </em>Court held that: <em>\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (emphasis added). Nothing in the facts or holding of <em>Alleyne </em>indicates that it eliminated Apprendi\u2019s exception for judicial findings of prior convictions that increase a criminal penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">As in this case, the sentence at issue in <em>Alleyne </em>was for the armed robbery of a store manager. And Alleyne, like Harris, was charged with a Hobbs Act robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) and with using or carrying a firearm to commit a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides for a minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment for anyone who \u201cuses or carries a firearm\u201d in relation to a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and increases that mandatory minimum sentence to 7 years \u201cif the firearm is brandished.\u201d The jury convicted Alleyne but indicated on the jury form only that he had \u201c[ujsed or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2156. The district court went further, finding that Alleyne had also brandished the firearm. The court believed, as it had every right to do under <em>Harris, </em>that it could make that additional finding without violating the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>But the Supreme Court, which had every right to overrule <em>Harris, </em>did so and held that the \u201cfact of brandishing\u201d constituted \u201can element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2162.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">As this discussion indicates, <em>Al-leyne </em>did not address the specific question at issue in this case, which is whether a sentence can be increased because of prior convictions without a jury finding the fact of those convictions. That question continues to be governed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), where the Court determined that the fact of a prior conviction is not an \u201celement\u201d that must be found by a jury. Indeed, the <em>Alleyne </em>Court specifically recognized that, under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>prior convictions are excepted from the general rule that a jury must find any fact that will increase the penalty for an offense. <em>Al-leyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1. The <em>Alleyne </em>Court declined to \u201crevisit <em>[Almendarez-Torres] </em>for purposes of our decision today\u201d because \u201cthe parties d[id] not contest that decision\u2019s vitality.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Descamps v. United States, </em>- U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2288, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013) (observing that an increase in the maximum statutory sentence based on judicial factfinding that \u201cwent beyond merely identifying a prior conviction\u201d would \u201craise serious Sixth Amendment concerns\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>We recognize that there is some tension between <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>on the one hand and <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>on the other. However, we are not free to do what the Supreme Court declined to do in <em>Alleyne, </em>which is overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As we have said before, we are \u201cbound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision.\u201d . <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001). Applying that rule to this case, Harris\u2019 <em>Alleyne </em>challenge to his \u00a7 3559(c) mandatory life sentence fails. The district court did not commit error, much less plain error, in imposing a mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 3559(c) without any jury findings about the existence of Harris\u2019 pri- or convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Harris\u2019 other contention is that the combination of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which resulted in his mandatory life sentence, violates \u201cthe Nondele-gation Doctrine, Separation of Powers principles, and the U.S. Constitution\u201d by impermissibly giving the executive branch \u201cthe power to prosecute and the power to sentence.\u201d His argument is based on the fact that the mandatory life sentence that \u00a7 3559(c) provides is applied only if the government chooses to file a notice of pri- or convictions under \u00a7 851. Although Harris concedes that Congress can impose mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes, he argues that it cannot constitutionally delegate the authority to decide whether to impose such sentences to the executive branch without providing an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d to constrain that branch\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">We have rejected claims that mandatory minimum sentences violate the United States Constitution in general, <em>see United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175 (11th Cir.1988), and have held that they do not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine in particular, <em>id. </em>at 1178. Our decision in <em>United States v. Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d 1329 (11th Cir.1998), which involved \u00a7 851, forecloses Harris\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">In that case, the government filed a \u00a7 851 information averring a prior conviction that had the effect of enhancing the statutory range of sentences for drug crimes punishable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) so that a range of ten years to life became a range of twenty years to life, effectively doubling the statutory minimum. <em>Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d at 1330. The defendant challenged the combination of those two statutes on separation-of-powers grounds, arguing that they gave the executive branch the power to fix statutory sentence ranges, which is more properly a legislative power. <em>Id. </em>at 1332. In rejecting that argument and upholding the constitutionality of the statutory scheme, we concluded that \u201cthe power of the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>tor under \u00a7 851 is no greater than the classic power of the executive to choose between charges carrying different mandatory penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1835.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Harris argues that <em>Cespedes </em>does not control the issue here because the enhancement triggered by the \u00a7 851 information the government filed in that case merely restricted the range of sentences from which the district court could choose (as opposed to requiring the court to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment). His reasoning is flawed because, when it comes to separation of powers principles, there is no analytical difference between an increase that doubles the minimum term of years and one that increases the minimum from a term of years to life imprisonment. The reasoning and holding of <em>Cespedes </em>applies in both circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Even if we were not convinced that <em>Ces-pedes </em>forecloses Harris\u2019 challenge, the decisions of our sister circuits addressing the constitutionality of \u00a7 3559(c) would persuade us to reach the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>682 F.3d 201, 203 (2d Cir.2012) (\u201cThe authority that \u00a7 3559 delegates to prosecutors ... does not unconstitutionally delegate the judiciary\u2019s power to the executive branch.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gurule, </em>461 F.3d 1238, 1246-47 (10th Cir.2006) (holding that \u00a7 3559 does not violate separation of powers principles); <em>United States v. Kaluna, </em>192 F.3d 1188, 1199 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc) (same); <em>United States v. Rasco, </em>123 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.1997) (same); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>109 F.3d 335, 338 (7th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s power to pursue an enhancement under \u00a7 3559(c)(1) is no more problematic than the power to choose between offenses with different maximum sentences.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">The sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">. These three counts were later dismissed on the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">. Harris does not challenge here, and he did not challenge in the district court, the factual accuracy of the averments contained in the \u00a7 851 notice. He could have challenged their accuracy using the procedure provided in \u00a7 851(c), which would have required the government to prove them (or enough of them to support the enhancement) beyond a reasonable doubt to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">. \"[T]he relevant time period for assessing whether an error is plain is at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>United States v. McKinley, 732 </em>F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 830 (11th Cir.2013)). Therefore, for the purposes of Harris\u2019s direct appeal, we consider the law announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Alleyne. </em>Our doing so is not intended to suggest that <em>Alleyne </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>Alleyne </em>was decided in the context of a direct appeal, and the Supreme Court itself has not expressly declared <em>Alleyne </em>to be retroactive on collateral review. <em>See generally Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155-64; <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 662-63, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 2482, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001). And <em>Alleyne </em>has not been made retroactive through any combination of cases that necessarily dictate retroactivity. <em>See Tyler, </em>533 U.S. at 666, 121 S.Ct. at 2484 (\"Multiple cases can render a new rule retroactive only if the holdings in those cases necessarily dictate retroactivity of the new rule.\u201d); <em>In re Holladay, </em>331 F.3d 1169, 1172-73 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
