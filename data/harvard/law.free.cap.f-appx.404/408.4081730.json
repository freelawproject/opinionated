Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). However, when a defendant presents rebuttal evidence after the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on the government\u2019s case-in-chief, he has waived the right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence based solely on the government\u2019s presentation of evidence. <em>United States v. Alejandro, </em>118 F.3d 1518, 1520-21 (11th Cir.1997). Consequently, where a defendant presents evidence, we will review all of the evidence presented, not just the evidence presented by the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1521. Moreover, when a defendant presents evidence, and asks the jury to evaluate his evidence against the government\u2019s case, he \u201ccannot insulate himself from the risk that the evidence will be favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>987 F.2d 697, 702 (11th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">\u201c[I]t is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilty, provided that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1299 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Thus, \u201cour sufficiency review requires only that a guilty verdict be reasonable, not inevitable, based on the evidence presented,\u201d because \u201cthe jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The credibility of a witness is the \u201csole province\u201d of the jury. <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1334 (11th Cir.2006). Additionally, it is the jury\u2019s responsibility to weigh and resolve conflicts in the evidence. <em>United States v. Pearson, </em>746 F.2d 787, 794 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">It is illegal for any person to knowingly produce, traffic in, have control or custody of, or possess device-making equipment with intent to defraud. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(4). \u201c[T]he term \u2018device-making equipment\u2019 means any equipment, mecha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>nism, or impression <em>designed or primarily used </em>for making an access device or a counterfeit access device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1029(e)(6) (emphasis added). The term \u201caccess device\u201d is defined as \u201cany card, plate, code, account number, or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds (other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1029(e)(1). Intent to defraud has often been defined as \u201cthe specific intent to deceive or cheat, for the purpose of either causing some financial loss to another, or bringing about some financial gain to one\u2019s self.\u201d <em>United States v. Klopf, </em>428 F.Bd 1228, 1240 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">It appears that we have analyzed \u00a7 1029(a)(4) in depth only once. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>81 F.3d 131 (11th Cir.1996). Although \u00a7 1029 has been amended since we considered the statute in Morris, the amendments are not relevant to this case. See <em>id. </em>at 134 (noting that Congress had amended \u00a7 1029(a)(4) to specifically criminalize possession of the cell phones at issue in the case); <em>see also United States v. Sepulveda, </em>115 F.3d 882, 885 n. 5 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that \u00a7 1029 had been amended in 1994 to include telecommunications equipment identifier as an \u201caccess device\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In <em>Morris, </em>the defendant had been convicted under a prior version of \u00a7 1029 for possessing and selling altered cell phones that could access cellular services without charge. <em>Morris, </em>81 F.3d at 132. In particular, the cell phones had altered microchips that could be reprogrammed by a user to allow for free long-distance phone calls. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Morris, </em>we analyzed the particular use to which the defendant put the devices \u2014 the phone themselves, including the microchips \u2014 and determined that they were technically not \u201cdesigned or primarily used for making an access device,\u201d as they were primarily used and designed to make telephone calls, not to make reprogrammed microchips that allowed for free phone calls. <em>Id. </em>at 133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">We held in <em>Morris </em>that the relevant device-making equipment was the equipment used to make the altered microchip in the cellular phone and \u201cnot the actual altered cellular phone itself,\u201d and that the altered microchip, not the phone, permitted the owner to commit a fraud. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we held that \u00a7 1029(a)(4) was \u201capplicable only to those devices which accessed] an individual account, such as a credit card,\u201d because, to find otherwise, would \u201cturn \u00a7 1029 into a general theft statute applicable whenever a company can document a loss through fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134 (internal quotation marks omitted) (noting, however, that \u00a7 1029 had been amended after the defendant\u2019s conduct, and the amended statute specifically criminalized the defendant\u2019s conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Although we have yet to interpret the phrase \u201cintent to defraud,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1029(a)(4), in other instances, we have held that, unless a statute specifies an intended victim, the phrase is \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d making it \u201cimmaterial whether the offender intended to defraud the government or some particular individual.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bradshaw, </em>840 F.2d 871, 875 (11th Cir.1988) (interpreting other counterfeiting statutes, and stating that if Congress intended to limit the intent requirement to a particular victim, \u201cit would have plainly said so\u201d). In other contexts, we have held that where a specific, identifiable victim is not listed as an element of the offense, it is not relevant whether the defendant \u201cpersonally knew of, communicated with, or directed activities towards\u201d any of the victims of the offense. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>430 F.3d 1357, 1369 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, all know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ing participants in a fraudulent scheme are legally liable for the actions of an individual who acts to carry out the scheme. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Additionally, a jury may infer an intent to defraud from the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1496 (11th Cir. 1990) (explaining that the government need not produce direct proof of scienter in a fraud case, but, instead, can rely on circumstantial evidence of criminal intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Here, even Bautista\u2019s own witness stated that the equipment seized in the case was capable of making reasonable facsimiles of credit cards. A government witness stated that these facsimiles could be used just like actual credit cards to make purchases from unsuspecting vendors. The evidence also showed that Bautista and a codefendant: (1) advertised their equipment as having the capability to make counterfeit credit cards; (2) explained how to make counterfeit credit cards; and (3) were fully aware that the government\u2019s confidential informant intended to make counterfeit credit cards. Moreover, Bautista\u2019s efforts to conceal the nature of the transaction evidenced knowledge that the equipment was not designed solely to produce employer identification cards, as he suggests. Additionally, because \u00a7 1029(a)(4) is not limited to any particular victim, it is immaterial whether Bautista personally knew of, had any contact with, or directed any activities towards any specific victim. Because we conclude from the record that the evidence was sufficient to convict Bautista of the offense charged, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
