She also argues that she has demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>in Indonesia based on her Chinese ethnicity-</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion, and we thus review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions and review any factual findings upon which the legal conclusions are based under the substantial evidence test. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must prove that she is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). To establish refugee status, the applicant must show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttal presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1007 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Kok argues that she suffered past persecution in Indonesia because of her Chinese ethnicity on the basis of the following incidents: (1) she was assaulted on a bus in 2002 by native Indonesians who made racial slurs and called her \u201cChinese\u201d when they fondled her on the bus; (2) she was assaulted by Muslims on a different occasion in 2005 while walking home from school and felt that she was assaulted because she is Chinese; and (3) her father\u2019s store went bankrupt after threats from native Indonesians scared customers away.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The IJ found that these incidents were not sufficient to constitute past persecution, and the BIA affirmed. The BIA also determined that Kok had not offered sufficient evidence to show that these incidents occurred on account of her Chinese ethnicity. We agree that Kok failed to demonstrate that she was targeted because of her ethnicity. Kok testified to only a single incident in which the assailants called her Chinese. She did not claim that the men involved in the second incident in 2005 said anything concerning her ethnicity. Reference to her ethnicity during one assault does not show that Kok was targeted because she is Chinese, as opposed to some other reason. Thus, even if we presume that the incidents described by Kok constitute persecution, she has not met her burden of establishing refugee status because she has not established that she was targeted on account of her ethnicity-</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Likewise, Kok has failed to demonstrate that she has good reason to fear future persecution based on her ethnicity if she returns to Indonesia. The single incident in which Kok was called \u201cChinese\u201d occurred eight years ago. <em>See Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2001) (affirming BIA\u2019s denial of asylum application where petitioner interacted with alleged persecutors only once, eight years before the case was decided). The only additional evidence presented by Kok in support of a well-founded fear of future persecution was a 2007 U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Indonesia (\u201cCountry Report\u201d) which describes instances of violence, rape and other sexual abuse against ethnic Chinese women. However, the BIA noted that the Country Report also indicates that \u201cdiscrimination and harassment of ethnic Chinese continued to decline compared with previous years\u201d and that the group \u201caccounted for approximately 3 percent of the population, by far the largest nonindigenous minority group, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>played a major role in the economy.\u201d BIA Op. at <em>2 </em>(citing Country Report at 132). Considering both the prior incident and the Country Report, we find that the record does not compel the conclusion that Kok has good reason to fear future persecution in Indonesia based on her Chinese ethnicity. <em>See I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that the record must compel the conclusion that the applicant \u201cfears persecution <em>on account of\u201d </em>a protected ground) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-14\">. Kok does not challenge the IJ and BIA\u2019s determination that she is not entitled to withholding of removal or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d). Accordingly, Kok has waived her right to object to this determination and we review only the denial of her application for asylum. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
