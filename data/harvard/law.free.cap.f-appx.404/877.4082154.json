We review the BIA\u2019s decision under a \u201chighly deferential\u201d abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, such that this court will not overturn factual findings unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). We also review the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA relied on the decision of the IJ. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-25\">Brom-Rivera was apprehended near the Texas-Mexico border in April 2005. After being processed for removal by immigration officials, Brom-Rivera was personally served with a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d at a removal hearing before an immigration court in Harlingen, Texas. Approximately one week before that hearing, Brom-Rivera <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>sent a letter to the immigration court asking that his case be \u201csent to the Immigration Court in San Francisco, California.\u201d He also requested an extension in order for his recently hired immigration attorney to prepare for the hearing. Finally, he asked the court to \u201cdirect all correspondence to the address listed above.\u201d That address was \u201c1661 F. Crows Landing Rd., Modesto, CA 95358.\u201d On the date of the originally scheduled hearing, the IJ construed Brom-Rivera\u2019s letter as a motion to change venue and denied the motion for failure to include all required information. The IJ also, however, stated that BromRivera could resubmit his motion for consideration and rescheduled the removal proceeding for September 21, 2005. The immigration clerk of court mailed the order to Brom-Rivera at \u201c1661 F. <em>Crowns </em>Landing Rd., Modesto, CA 95358.\u201d Brom-Rivera did not appear at the September 21, 2005 hearing and was ordered removed <em>in absentia. </em>The record does not reflect whether either the order rescheduling the hearing or the removal decision was returned to the immigration court as undeliverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Three years later, Brom-Rivera moved to reopen his removal proceedings. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii), an <em>in absentia </em>removal order may be rescinded \u201cupon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). \u201c[T]he word \u2018receive\u2019 clearly shows that the focus of the rescission inquiry, in contrast to the standard for the initial entry of an in absentia order, is on the actual receipt of the required notice and not whether the notice was properly mailed.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 360 (5th Cir.2009). The IJ denied Brom-Rivera\u2019s motion, finding that he was personally served with the Notice to Appear when he was apprehended. The IJ also stated that \u201c[a]s the Court mailed a notice of hearing to Respondent\u2019s last known address, the Court cannot reopen proceedings on account of the Respondent\u2019s alleged lack of notice.\u201d This factual finding is clearly erroneous; the record compels the contrary conclusion that the court did not mail the notice of hearing to BromRivera\u2019s correct address. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is REVERSED, the removal order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the BIA, or the IJ, may consider in the first instance the effect of the typographical error on Brom-Rivera\u2019s alleged lack of notice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
