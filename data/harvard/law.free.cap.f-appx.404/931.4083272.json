We review the denial of a motion to reopen under a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). Questions of law are reviewed de novo and deference is accorded to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect. <em>Id. </em>Factual findings are reviewed under a substantial-evidence test, which means that this court may not overturn them unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>The underlying decision of the IJ is reviewed only if it influences the decision of the BIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-25\">Loja is correct in his assertion that motion to rescind a deportation order issued in absentia may be filed at any time if the alien establishes that he did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with statutory notice requirements. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number><em>id. </em>However, if the alien has failed to provide a current mailing address, the Government need not establish that written notice was provided in order to obtain the in absentia order. <em>Id. </em>Although he raises a variety of claims regarding the notice issue, Loja has not shown error in the determination that he did not provide immigration officials with a mailing address where notice of the hearing could be mailed. To the extent that the IJ\u2019s form order mistakenly suggested that notice of the hearing was mailed to Loja, the BIA noted this discrepancy and clearly found that Loja had not been served by mail because he had never submitted his address to the immigration court. The discrepancy thus did not influence the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Loja also argues that the in absentia order of removal violated due process. We rejected this argument in <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 361 n. 2, based on the conclusion that there is no liberty interest at stake in a motion to reopen due to the discretionary nature of reopening relief. Moreover, Loja has failed to show that he was denied a procedural safeguard to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Loja also presents several new arguments concerning the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to provide a valid contact address, and he continues in his assertions that he was in telephone contact with the court clerk. Finally, he argues for the first time on appeal that the Government impliedly accepted his residence in the United States by accepting his taxes for over eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">The BIA found that Loja\u2019s assertions regarding the alleged telephone calls were implausible and Loja has not shown that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. Additionally, we lack jurisdiction to consider the arguments that have been raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Loja has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b958-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
