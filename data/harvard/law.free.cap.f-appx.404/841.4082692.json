She was sentenced to 151 months in prison. Walker now appeals the denial of her motion to reduce her sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). She avers that she was eligible for a reduction in her sentence following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-25\">Walker\u2019s untimely notice of appeal may be deemed a request for an extension of time within which to file her notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>see also United States v. Golding, </em>739 F.2d 183, 184 (5th Cir.1984). Although the district court did not expressly make a finding of good cause or excusable neglect, the district court did grant Walker\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, which served as an implicit finding of excusable neglect. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lister, </em>53 F.3d 66, 68 (5th Cir.1995). As there is no jurisdictional impediment to reaching the merits of Walker\u2019s appeal, <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007), we decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>to dismiss it for failure to file a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the motions to dismiss and for an extension of time are DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
