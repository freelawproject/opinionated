Bellafiore ai'gues that his sentence was unreasonable because: (1) the district court imposed an upward variance based exclusively on his criminal history, which was already reflected in his guideline range through the criminal history category; and (2) there is no evidence that the district court considered any of the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United, States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-diseretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). We will remand for resentencing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted). A district court may impose a variance if it determines that \u201cthe case at hand falls outside the \u2018heartland\u2019 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply,\u201d \u201cthe Guidelines sentence ... fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations,\u201d or \u201cthe case warrants a different sentence regardless.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 351,127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Bellafiore\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable. As the record shows, the district court explained that its decision was based on the following facts: (1) Bellafiore\u2019s criminal conduct in this offense was \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d; (2) he had committed a similar offense in the past; and (3) he exhibited a general disregard for the law. The district court thus considered several \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence imposed to promote respect for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Since Bellafiore\u2019s only argument for procedural unreasonableness is that the district court did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and this argument fails, Bellafiore has not shown that his sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Nor has he shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. The unob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>jected facts in the PSI reveal that: (1) Bellafiore and his co-conspirators committed larceny of numerous banks as part of the instant offense; (2) Bellafiore had ten prior adult convictions; and (8) a number of these convictions involved conduct that was virtually identical to Bellafiore\u2019s conduct in the instant offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the district court correctly found, these facts suggest that Bellafiore had little respect for the law, as he kept committing similar offenses over and over again, even after going through repeated prosecutions for these offenses. Moreover, in this case, Bellafiore did not commit larceny of a single bank, but multiple banks, which further demonstrates his disrespect for the law. Therefore, the following \u00a7 3553(a) factors strongly supported the imposition of an upward variance: (1) the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law; (2) deterrence; and (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because a number of \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported an upward variance, Bellafiore\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable, and we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">. Bellafiore did not object to most of the factual statements in the PSI, and therefore, he is deemed to have admitted those statements as true. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that if a defendant fails to object to facts that are contained in the PSI, he is deemed to have admitted those facts).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
