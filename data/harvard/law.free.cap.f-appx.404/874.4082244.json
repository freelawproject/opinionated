He appeals the denial of his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the sentencing guidelines governing crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-18\">Although Charles acknowledges that his guideline range was ultimately determined pursuant to the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, he contends that the district court erred in deciding that he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He also argues that the district court otherwise had the authority to resentence him in light of the advisory guideline system in effect following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); the discretion in sentencing afforded to the district court under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); and the district court\u2019s authority to grant a downward departure under the guidelines. Charles contends that he was also entitled to reconsideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors under the advisory guideline system and that the district court abused its discretion by failing adequately to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to state for the record its reasons for not considering them.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-19\">The denial of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Charles\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in his offenses, but rather from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>his career offender status under \u00a7 4B1.1. \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>Because Charles was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court was not required to reach the question whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted a reduction. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Regarding Charles\u2019s contention that the district court otherwise had the discretion to resentence him to a lesser sentence, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2690-94. The principles of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce the sentence any further than the reduction allowed under \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id.; United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Charles\u2019s arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
