The IJ determined that Samayoa-Lopez\u2019s asylum application was time-barred and that he was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. Samayoa contests the denial of asylum and withholding on the merits but does not contest the finding that his asylum application was time-barred. After thorough review, we dismiss the claims that SamayoaLopez failed to exhaust before the BIA and deny his remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">\u201cWe review only the [BIAj\u2019s decision, except to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion\u201d or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIn reviewing the BIA\u2019s finding that an alien has not established persecution on the basis of a protected ground, our review is limited to whether the BIA\u2019s decision was supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). Factual findings, including credibility determinations, \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>(quotation marks omitted). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We find no error in the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determination that Samayoa-Lopez is ineligible for asylum because his application was untimely when filed. Absent \u201cchanged circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application,\u201d an alien\u2019s asylum application must be filed \u201cwithin 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). Samayoa-Lopez arrived in the United States in 2002 but did not file an asylum application until 2008. Samayoa-Lopez has not argued that changed or extraordinary circumstances warrant an exception to the one-year filing rule. Therefore, we deny Samayoa-Lopez\u2019s petition as to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Samayoa-Lopez argues that the IJ erred in concluding that he is ineligible for withholding of removal. He argues that he has a well-founded fear that his life or freedom would be threatened upon his return to Guatemala because of the presence of guerilla gangs and his family\u2019s unpaid creditors. The INA prohibits removal to a particular country if \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The burden of proof for withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the standard for asylum relief. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Samayoa-Lopez is ineligible for withholding of removal. Samayoa-Lopez acknowledged before the IJ that he was never targeted or attacked by gangs and that he was never a member of a political group in Guatemala. Any threat that Samayoa-Lopez faces on account of his family\u2019s unpaid creditors stems from a personal dispute, not one based on a statutorily-protected ground. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 891. We deny Samayoa-Lopez\u2019s petition as to his claim for withholding of removal under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal under the CAT because Samayoa-Lopez did not exhaust this claim before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). Therefore, we dismiss Samayoa-Lopez\u2019s petition to the extent that it raises a claim for withholding of removal under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
