Calculating his Guidelines range at sentencing, the district court applied a 16-level enhancement, pursuant to advisory Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), for a prior drug-trafficking offense. Sanchez contends the Government failed to produce sufficient evidence establishing his prior felony drug-trafficking conviction where the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. In that regard, Sanchez contends his conviction for \u201cpossession with intent to deliver\u201d, conceded during sentencing, did not establish he had a prior conviction involving an \u201cintent to distribute\u201d for purposes of applying the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-22\">Because Sanchez did <em>not </em>object in district court to the 16-level enhancement, the issue is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 296 (5th Cir.2008). To establish plain error, Sanchez must show a clear or obvious error affecting his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-25\">Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) provides for a 16-level increase if the defendant was deported after a felony-conviction drug-trafficking offense where the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. A \u201cdrug-trafficking offense\u201d includes dispensing a controlled substance with intent to distribute, with \u201cdistribute\u201d defined as delivering a controlled substance, and \u201cdelivery\u201d defined as the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(11), (8); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-26\">Sanchez incorrectly asserts there is insufficient evidence to support his prior Iowa felony-conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, maintaining the only reference to the conviction was by his attorney in district court. To the contrary, the presentence investigation report (PSR) referred to Sanchez\u2019 1996 Iowa felony-conviction and included, as an addendum, the charging instrument for that offense. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding charging documents constitute reliable evidence of prior guilty-plea convictions). Further, as noted, at sentencing, Sanchez made <em>no </em>objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>the PSR, and conceded: he had a 1996 felony-conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance; and the Government possessed the judgment to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">With regard to Sanchez\u2019 contention his prior offense does <em>not </em>qualify as a \u201cdrug-trafficking offense\u201d for purposes of the enhancement, Sanchez is in error. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 715 (5th Cir.2007) (holding a conviction for \u201cpossession with an intent to deliver\u201d a controlled substance qualified as basis for sentencing enhancement as \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under Guidelines). His offense clearly falls within the definition of a \u201cdrug-trafficking offense\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2. See 21 U.S.C: \u00a7 802(11), (8); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv). Accordingly, Sanchez has shown <em>no </em>error, much less <em>plain error, </em>with respect to the 16-level enhancement. <em>See also United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 204 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Fambro, </em>526 F.3d 836, 849-50 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
