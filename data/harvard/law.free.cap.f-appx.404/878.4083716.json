She argues that the district court lacked the authority to order that her sentence be served consecutively to state court sentences that had not yet been imposed, but she concedes that the issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds, United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006). The government moves to dismiss the appeal based on the appeal waiver provision in Brown\u2019s plea agreement or, under <em>Brown, </em>for summary affirmance. The government alternatively moves for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">Contrary to Brown\u2019s argument, she is not entitled to appeal based on the exception to her waiver for appeals of sentences exceeding the statutory maximum, because her sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum term of 20 years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a); <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, we do not address the merits of Brown\u2019s challenge to her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Because Brown\u2019s appeal is barred by her appeal waiver, the motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. The motions for summary affirmance and for an extension of time to file a brief are DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
