Davis contends his trial counsel\u2019s advice fell below the norms of \u201cprofessionally competent assistance\u201d when she assured him he would not jeopardize his eligibility for an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction if he maintained his not guilty plea and proceeded to a largely stipulated bench trial. Davis further claims he suffered prejudice because he would have pled guilty, but for trial counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient advice. The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">(1) Whether trial counsel\u2019s actions and advice fell below the norms of \u201cprofessionally competent assistance\u201d and therefore was constitutionally deficient under the Sixth Amendment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-15\">(2) Whether Petitioner showed a reasonable probability that Petitioner suffered prejudice because the results of the criminal proceeding would have been different, but for trial counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient errors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">Criminal defendants have a right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demonstrate (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>i.e., </em>the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>at 2064-65. The two-part <em>Strickland </em>test applies to ineffective-assistance claims concerning both the decision to accept a guilty plea offer and the decision to forgo a plea offer and stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>trial. <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1504 n. 7 (11th Cir.1995). The deficient performance requirement concerns \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (quotation omitted). There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The offense level of a defendant who \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,\u201d should be decreased by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2004). While the reduction is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof by standing trial, conviction by trial \u201cdoes not automatically preclude a defendant from\u201d an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">In rare situations a- defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt <em>(e.g., </em>to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\"><em>Id. </em>In contrast, \u201c[a] defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment [for acceptance of responsibility] as a matter of right,\u201d as his guilty plea and admission of guilt may be \u201coutweighed by conduct ... that is inconsistent with ... acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The performance of Davis\u2019s trial counsel was not constitutionally deficient. First, counsel testified during the evidentiary hearing, and the district court made a factual finding that counsel never guaranteed Davis he would receive an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. This finding was not clearly erroneous as it is supported by the record, which shows counsel consistently assured Davis that he would not jeopardize his eligibility for the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, but also indicated she was not certain the district court would award the reduction. Moreover, the district court specifically credited counsel\u2019s testimony that she made no guarantee of the reduction over Davis\u2019s testimony to the contrary. This credibility determination was within the district court\u2019s province as fact finder. <em>See Carr v. Schofield, </em>364 F.3d 1246, 1265 (11th Cir.2004) (determining the credibility of a testifying attorney during an evidentiary hearing on an ineffective assistance-of-counsel claim is \u201cwithin the province of the district court, which has the opportunity to observe and study the witness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Further, counsel\u2019s advice that Davis would not jeopardize his eligibility for a two-level, acceptance-of-responsibility reduction by proceeding to a bench trial, in which he did not contest his factual guilt was consistent with the commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.2) (2004). While counsel admittedly failed to take into account Davis\u2019s pretrial conduct and its impact on Davis\u2019s eligibility for the reduction, considerations which would have informed her assessment of Davis\u2019s likelihood of receiving the reduction, this possible error did not render counsel\u2019s performance constitutionally deficient. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.2) (2004); <em>see also Lancaster v. Newsome, </em>880 F.2d 362, 375 (11th Cir.1989) (noting a criminal defendant is \u201cnot entitled to er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ror-free representation\u201d). Davis\u2019s pretrial conduct was relevant to the acceptance-of-responsibility inquiry whether he pled guilty or stood trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Because trial counsel\u2019s performance was not constitutionally deficient, we need not address whether Davis was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s alleged errors. <em>See Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2069 (stating there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim to approach the inquiry in the same order, or even to address both components of the inquiry, if the prisoner makes an insufficient showing on one). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Davis\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-12\">. \"Whether a criminal defendant has received ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law.\u201d <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1142 (11th Cir.2000). We review for clear error questions of fact underlying the claim and review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision on the ultimate issue of \"whether counsel's performance passed constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
