Wilson sued Defendants-Appellees Charles Hudson and Globe Life Accident Insurance in federal court. Wilson alleged that he was the beneficiary of a Globe life insurance policy he purchased in the name of his wife, Sherry Ann Wilson. Wilson further alleged that, upon his wife\u2019s death, the defendants failed to acknowledge his claim for the proceeds of that policy in violation of the policy\u2019s terms and Mississippi law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Wilson\u2019s claim without prejudice for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In his complaint, Wilson asserted that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over his claim on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Section 1332(a) grants a federal district court the power to hear a civil action, provided that the amount in controversy \u201cexceeds the sum or value of $75,000\u201d and the parties are \u201ccitizens of different States.\u201d We determine the amount in controversy \u201cfrom the complaint itself, unless it appears or is in some way shown that the amount stated in the complaint is not claimed \u2018in good faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>367 U.S. 348, 353, 81 S.Ct. 1570, 6 L.Ed.2d 890 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Wilson\u2019s complaint did not meet the first requirement of \u00a7 1332(a). His complaint alleged only $50,000 in damages. Therefore, the district court properly dismissed Wilson\u2019s complaint for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Wilson makes two new arguments on appeal for the reversal of the district court\u2019s order. First, in his notice of appeal, he stated that he was now seeking $75,000 in damages. Wilson\u2019s allegation of a new amount of damages in his notice of appeal did not properly raise the issue before the district court and will not be considered by this court on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (declining to address issues raised for the first time on appeal by <em>pro se </em>litigant). Even assuming that such an issue may be raised in his notice of appeal and that the new claim was made in good faith, the damages Wilson alleged were not sufficient to establish diversity jurisdiction over his claim because he only sought $75,000 in damages. This is not an amount that \u201cexceeds the sum or value of $75,000,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1332(a)(1). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1); <em>see </em>14AA Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice <em>&amp; </em>Procedure \u00a7 3701, 4 (2009)(stating that \u201c[a]n allegation of exactly $75,000 ... is insufficient\u201d to establish jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">Second, in his brief before this court, Wilson stated that the district court erred because it did not address his claim under \u201cTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e Sexual Harassment.\u201d Wilson did not raise a Title VII claim in his complaint before the district court. He cannot raise such a claim for the first time on appeal to establish a separate basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">Therefore, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Wilson\u2019s claim without prejudice for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
