Franklin, Dorothy Moise appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of Franklin\u2019s supplemental security income benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3). That denial was based on, among other things, a finding that the Administrative Law Judge was not biased. In support of her request for review to the Appeals Council, Moise alleged that Franklin \u201cdid not receive a full and fair hearing before this ALJ.\u201d Moise contends only that the Appeals Council applied the incorrect legal standard under SSA Publication No. 05-10071 and SSA procedural regulation 57 Fed.Reg. 49186 by failing to \u201clook into\u201d her complaint that the ALJ was biased in denying the benefits claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moise argues that the Appeals Council failed to \u201clook beyond\u201d the transcript and see a pattern of retaliation by the ALJ against claimants represented by her attorney, Richard Culbertson.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is \u201cdemarcated by a deferential reconsideration of the findings of fact and an exacting examination of the conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). The Commissioner\u2019s \u201cconclusions of law, including applicable review standards, are not presumed valid\u201d and are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>but the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if \u201csupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance: it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id, </em>(quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">A Social Security claimant is entitled to a hearing that is \u201cfull and fair.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996). The ALJ plays a \u201ccrucial role in the disability review process\u201d and has a duty to \u201cdevelop a full and fair record\u201d and to \u201ccarefully weigh the evidence, giving individualized consideration to each claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1401. Because the ALJ\u2019s decision will typically be the final word given our standard of review, the ALJ\u2019s impartiality is \u201cintegral to the integrity of the system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ thus must \u201cnot conduct a hearing if he or she is prejudiced or partial with respect to any party or has any interest in the matter pending for decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1400 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.940).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">If a claimant fears that a particular ALJ will not provide a fair hearing, she must notify the ALJ at the earliest opportunity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1440. If the ALJ declines to recuse herself, the claimant may seek reconsideration by raising the issue before the Appeals Council. <em>Id. </em>The current ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>sion of SSA Publication No. 05-10071 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">If you think any ALJ treated you unfairly, you should tell us about it and ask us to look into it. You can ask even while we are deciding your claim for benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">Someone who has not been handling your claim before will look into the information you gave us in the complaint. You will be advised when the matter is closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">If you also appealed the decision on your claim and included information about your complaint, the Appeals Council will address your complaint when responding to your appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">SSA Pub. No. 05-10071 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Moise also points to a notice titled \u201cSocial Security Administration Procedures Concerning Allegations of Bias or Misconduct by Administrative Law Judges\u201d that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">SSA is committed to providing every claimant and his or her representative fair and unbiased treatment in the handling of all claims buy [sic] its [Office of Hearings and Appeals] hearing offices. SSA is also committed to ensuring that claimants and their representatives are afforded timely opportunities to raise any complaints that they may have about alleged bias or misconduct by Administrative Law Judges, and to have their complaints reviewed or investigated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">57 Fed.Reg. 49186-03, 49186 (Oct. 30, 1992). That regulation further provides that if the complaint alleging bias is filed after the ALJ\u2019s decision but before the expiration of the time to appeal to the Appeals Council, the claimant may present the claim \u201cto the Appeals Council as a basis for granting review,\u201d have the allegations reviewed as part of the request for review, and \u201cbe informed of the results of the review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49187.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Moise presented to the Appeals Council her claim that she did not receive a full and fair hearing before the ALJ presiding over her case. The Appeals Council addressed her complaint of bias in its notice of action. It stated that it had reviewed those allegations and \u201ccarefully studied all of the evidence in the record, including the recording that was made during the hearing.\u201d It informed Moise of the results of its review, stating it found \u201cno evidence of unfair treatment or other inappropriate action\u201d by the ALJ. The Appeals Council thus correctly followed its procedures for handling claims of bias on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Moise failed to allege any specific instances of the ALJ\u2019s bias in her case, and the ALJ made a well-reasoned decision supported by substantial evidence that Franklin\u2019s disability ceased as of June 1, 2005. That decision does not reflect any bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">. Moise does not contest the ALJ's substantive finding regarding cessation of Franklin's disability or otherwise take issue with the Commissioner\u2019s final decision in her brief. Moise's failure to raise the issues means that we need not address their merits. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (\"[T]he law is by now well settled in this Circuit that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
