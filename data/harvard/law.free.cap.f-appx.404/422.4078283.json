Phillips argues that the district court lacked authority to sentence him as a career offender because another court had ruled that his two prior felony convictions were related. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The district court did not err because Phillips was not entitled to any form of cognizable relief. Even if we look \u201cbehind the label of\u2019 Phillips\u2019s motion, his action is not \u201ccognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir. 1990). The district court lacked jurisdiction to modify Phillips\u2019s sentence more than seven days after it was imposed. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) (2007). Phillips could not obtain relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36 because he sought \u201cto make a substantive alteration to [his] criminal sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Pease, </em>331 F.3d 809, 816 (11th Cir.2003), and a motion for relief from his sentence would be dismissed as successive, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b); <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2647-48, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). Phillips also could not obtain a writ of habeas corpus because his petition would be barred as successive and he does not seek relief based on a new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">We AFFIRM the denial of Phillips\u2019s motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
