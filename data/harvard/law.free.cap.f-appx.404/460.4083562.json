Brown, Jr. appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his pro <em>se </em>motion for a sentence reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As a federal prisoner serving a term of imprisonment for a crack cocaine offense, Brown\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which together with Amendment 713, retroactively provides for a 2-level reduction to base offense levels applicable to crack-cocaine offenses. The district court denied Brown\u2019s motion on the ground that Amendment 706 did not lower the base offense level (and thus the resulting guideline range) upon which his original sentence was based.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">At the original sentencing, the district court determined that Brown had a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The court determined that Brown had an offense level of 32 under the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). However, because the court determined that Brown was entitled to a role-reduction, it decreased that offense level by 2 under what is now \u00a7 201.1(a)(5). See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(a)(5) (providing that the \u201cbase offense level\u201d shall be the offense level specified in the Drug Quantity Table, \u201cexcept that if (A) the defendant receives an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 (Mitigating Role); and (B) the base offense level under [the Drug Quantity Table] is ... 32, decrease by 2 levels\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Brown\u2019s base offense level became 30, and the court sentenced him within the resulting guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Amendment 706 does not affect the guideline range upon which Brown\u2019s sentence was based because his base offense level would remain 30. While Amendment 706 would reduce his offense level under the Drug Quantity Table from 32 to 30, that 2-level reduction would negate the 2-level reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), as the latter reduction does not apply where the drug-quantity offense level is below 32. Thus, Brown\u2019s base offense level would remain 30, and the guideline range upon which his sentence was based would likewise remain unaffected. As a result, the district court lacked authority to grant Brown a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368-69 (11th Cir.2008).
