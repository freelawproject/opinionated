Background</p>\n<p id=\"b397-21\">Brown argued before the district court \u2014 and argues again on appeal \u2014 that it was error to enhance his sentence under 18 U.S.C. section 924(e)(1) because he did not have the requisite number of prior convictions for the ACCA to apply. First, he argues that three of his prior convictions (which he concedes constituted violent felonies under the ACCA) should have been considered as only one offense: they took place within a nine-day span, were consolidated for sentencing, and were part of a common scheme or plan. Second, Brown contends that, under the ACCA, one of his prior convictions should not have counted as a predicate conviction where adjudication of guilt had been withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-22\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo, including whether offenses are \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>208 F.3d 1306, 1307 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The district court\u2019s sentence is without error. The district court was correct to conclude that Brown possessed the necessary three previous convictions for a violent felony. The ACCA provides for a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence where a person violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on different occasions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We said in <em>Pope </em>that where \u201cpredicate crimes are successive rather than simultaneous, they constitute separate criminal episodes for purposes of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 692 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that consecutively burglarizing buildings 200 yards apart constituted separate crimes for ACCA purposes); <em>see also United States v. Lee, </em>208 F.3d 1306, 1307 (11th Cir.2000) (looking to whether the defendant possessed a meaningful opportunity to desist activity before committing a later offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Here, the three predicate crimes relied on by the district court for triggering the ACCA mandatory-minimum sentence were committed successively and, with regard to time, were distinct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Committing the crimes over a nine-day span, Brown possessed sufficient opportunity to desist but declined to do so. Brown\u2019s arguments about the crimes constituting a common scheme and about the offenses\u2019 consolidation for sentencing do not alter ACCA\u2019s clear statutory requirement. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (requiring prior convictions arising from offenses \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We reject Brown\u2019s argument that the conviction for which he never received a guilty adjudication should not count. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>601 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that \u201ca guilty plea followed by a sentence of probation and a withholding of adjudication qualifies under Florida law as a predicate conviction for the purpose of enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence under the ACCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-16\">. Brown does not appeal his sentence for the Group 2 counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. Defendant does not contest that the three crimes qualified as \"violent felonpes]\" under section 924(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
