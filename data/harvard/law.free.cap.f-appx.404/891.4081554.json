He argues that his within-guidelines sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because it overstates the seriousness of his criminal history and fails to provide just punishment for the offense in light of his history and characteristics, including his motive for reentering the country. He also contends that the sentence is greater than necessary because the illegal reentry guidelines double counted his criminal history by using a prior conviction both to enhance his offense level and to calculate his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-23\">Because Salvador-Daniel did not object to his sentence in the district court, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-24\">In <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009), we held that there was no impermissible double counting in the guidelines calculations that rendered the sentence un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>reasonable. <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6). Further, Salvador-Daniel\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed and with the district court\u2019s weighing of the mitigating factors he presented in support of a lesser sentence does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
