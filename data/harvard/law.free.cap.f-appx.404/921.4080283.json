Although he argues to the contrary, sentences within the properly-calculated guidelines range determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 are entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Additionally, because Nunez-Morales did not object to his sentence as unreasonable in the district court, we review the reasonableness of the sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-24\">First, Nunez-Morales asserts that his sentence overstated the danger he presents to the community and his risk of recidivism because \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201cdouble counts\u201d the defendant\u2019s criminal record, using it to determine his offense level and his criminal history score. A sentence calculated under \u00a7 2L1.2 is not unreasonable because the Guideline double counts the defendant\u2019s criminal history. See <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6) (a conviction that triggers the 16-level enhancement may be assigned criminal history points).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Next, Nunez-Morales asserts that the Guidelines produced a sentence greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because they failed to account adequately for his personal circumstances, history, and characteristics, in that he has been \u201cmostly law-abiding and hard-working\u201d for the past decade. He contends, relatedly, that illegal reentry is not evil in itself and essentially is an \u201cinternational trespass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">A sentence resulting from the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 is not unreasonable simply because illegal reentry arguably is akin to a trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). The court listened to Nunez-Morales\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence and rejected them. Nunez-Morales has failed to offer a persuasive reason for this court to disturb the district court\u2019s sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>As Nunez-Morales has failed to demonstrate any error, plain or otherwise, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-16\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
