Contreras\u2019s motion to reconsider was filed after the Board\u2019s August 10, 2009 dismissal of his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) denial of his motion to reopen his 1995 deportation proceedings. Contreras did not file a petition for review of the Board\u2019s August 10, 2009 dismissal of his appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, that decision became final. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 388-90, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Nevertheless, the arguments in Contreras\u2019s brief are all aimed at challenging the August 10, 2009 dismissal and the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Absent a timely petition for review of the August 10, 2009 order, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Contreras\u2019s claims. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-21\">Although Contreras raised the issue of venue in his motion to reconsider, he does not make any arguments relating to venue. He has therefore abandoned the only issue before this court. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Contreras\u2019s petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b925-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
