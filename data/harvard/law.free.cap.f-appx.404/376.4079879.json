Halmos contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for malicious prosecution. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">At the Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) stage, we \u201cprimarily consider the allegations in the complaint,\u201d but \u201c[t]he court is not [always] limited to the four corners of the complaint.\u201d <em>Long v. Slaton, </em>508 F.3d 576, 578 n. 3 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). We have held that a district court may take judicial notice of matters of public record without converting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a Rule 56 motion. <em>See Bryant v. Avado Brands, Inc., </em>187 F.3d 1271, 1278 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 2509, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007) (\u201ccourts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In order to adequately allege malicious prosecution of a civil claim, the plaintiff must establish: (1) a judicial proceeding against the present plaintiff was commenced or continued; (2) the present defendant filed the original proceeding against the present plaintiff as the defendant in the original proceeding; (3) the termination of the original proceeding was in favor of the present plaintiff; (4) absence of probable cause for the original proceeding; (5) malice on the part of the present defendant; and (6) the plaintiff suffered damage as a result of the original proceeding. <em>Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Mancusi, </em>632 So.2d 1352, 1355 (Fla.1994) (citing <em>Burns v. GCC Beverages, Inc., </em>502 So.2d 1217 (Fla.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Halmos asserts that the district court explored forbidden territory when ruling on Bomardier\u2019s motion to dismiss. We disagree. The district court\u2019s determination did not exceed the permissible scope of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss \u2014 the complaint, attachments to the complaint, and matters of public record. The district court found that \u201cHalmos was the individual owner of PAH Co.,\u201d \u201che signed numerous documents, including the relevant Agreements, on the company\u2019s behalf,\u201d and he \u201cadmittedly used the aircraft for personal reasons.\u201d (R.2-55 at 5.) All of this information was contained in Halmos\u2019s Amended Complaint and its attachments. (R.1M at 5 \u00b6 17; at 8-10 \u00b6\u00b6 27-31; at 17 \u00b6 43; Exs. 3-6.) The district court relied upon undisputed facts of public record, including the undisputed fact that Halmos did not file a motion to dismiss during the four-year Texas lawsuit, that he filed individual counterclaims in his name in the Texas lawsuit, and that one would not know the proper defendant to sue as there was no entity called \u201cPAH Corporation\u201d in existence in Florida at the time the Texas lawsuit was filed. (R.2-55 at 5.) The district court used this information to conclude that Halmos\u2019s Amended Complaint was \u201cdeficient in failing to allege the critical element that [Bomardier] lacked probable cause in instituting and pursuing an action against Halmos [in his individual capacity].\u201d <em>(Id) </em>The district court did not err in considering matters of public record that went beyond the scope of Halmos\u2019s complaint to reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Halmos also contends that the district court impermissibly held that he had waived his malicious prosecution claim by failing to file a motion to dismiss, a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>for summary judgment, or by filing counterclaims in the Texas lawsuit. Halmos misreads the district court\u2019s order. It is clear from reading the order that the court simply looked at the record of the Texas lawsuit in considering the totality of the undisputed facts surrounding whether Bomardier had probable cause to either commence or continue a suit against Halmos in his individual capacity. The district court concluded that all the facts taken together defeated Halmos\u2019s ability to allege Bomardier\u2019s lack of probable cause. This was proper. Consequently, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Halmos\u2019s malicious prosecution claim against Bomardier.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
