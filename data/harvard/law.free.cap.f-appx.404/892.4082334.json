He argues that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-22\">As a threshold matter, Garcia argues that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his within-guidelines sentence on appellate review because the Guideline upon which it is based, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is penologically flawed and not the result of empirical evidence or study. As Garcia acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-29\">Citing cases from the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, Garcia asserts that, even if the presumption of reasonableness applies, it is rebutted by the facts and circumstances of this case. He emphasizes the staleness of his 1999 conviction, which occurred ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>proximately 11 years prior to the present offense and formed the basis of his 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2. During that 11-year interval, however, Garcia was imprisoned for about six to seven years and then committed the instant illegal reentry offense while on probation for his 1999 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The district court considered and rejected Garcia\u2019s arguments for a sentence below his advisory guidelines range. With reference to the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the arguments made during allocution, the court determined that a sentence at the bottom of Garcia\u2019s guidelines range was indicated. While Garcia provided mitigating evidence, he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness attaching to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). The district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering a 63-month sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b918-30\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
