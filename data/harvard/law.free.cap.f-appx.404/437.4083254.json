Hendley appeals from his sentence, which he argues was based on an improperly calculated guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-27\">One night in April 2008, police in Roswell, Georgia responded to reports of gun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>fire in a public park. After arriving at the park, the officers approached two men leaving a wooded area. When the police identified themselves, one of the two men, Hendley, fled. The police chased Hendley and eventually apprehended him. When the officers retraced the path of the chase, they found a handgun and, 20 yards away from the handgun, two cellophane bags. One bag contained 14.4 grams of crack cocaine and the other contained 3.3 grams of marijuana. Although the officers had not seen Hendley discard the drugs, they assumed that he must have because the bags were dry despite a recent rainstorm. Hendley\u2019s hands tested positive for gunshot residue, and he eventually admitted that the gun was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Hendley was indicted for possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Hendley pleaded guilty to the felon-in-possession charge, and the government moved to dismiss the other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Before sentencing the probation officer recommended that Hendley\u2019s base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines be increased by four points because he had possessed a firearm \u201cin connection\u201d with another felony, possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Hendley objected to the enhancement, arguing that the drugs were not his and, at any rate, they were found in a different place from his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Roswell police detective Mark Macdonald testified that, while he was chasing Hendley, he smelled unburned marijuana near a tire that he and Hendley had jumped over. Macdonald further testified that he found the drugs near the tire about 20 yards from the gun. The government also argued that the cellophane bags were dry even though it had recently rained and noted that Hendley had once before discarded drugs while fleeing from the police. Hendley\u2019s counsel responded that the drugs could have belonged to anyone, and that if Hendley had discarded them, Macdonald would have seen him do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The district court found that the government had proved that Hendley had probably possessed the firearm in connection with the felony drug offense. Accordingly, the court applied the enhancement. The resulting guidelines range was 110 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, but the judge varied downward and sentenced Hendley to 106 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He now appeals his sentence, arguing that it was based on an improperly calculated guidelines range because his offense level was erroneously enhanced by the district court\u2019s finding that he had possessed the handgun in connection with another felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">We review the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). Factual findings, on the other hand, are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>\u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, this court, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004). When a defendant objects to an enhancement under the Guidelines, the government bears the burden of proving any disputed facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a four-point enhancement to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if he possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). If the other felony is a drug-trafficking offense, the enhancement applies whenever the firearm was found in close proximity to the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n. 14(B)). When the other felony is not a drug-trafficking or burglary offense, the enhancement only applies if the possession of the firearm facilitated or had the potential to facilitate the other felony. <em>Id. </em>at comment. (n,14(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Although Hendley argues that the government did not present any evidence that he was engaged in trafficking drugs, he did not object to the PSI\u2019s contention that the police had found 14.4 grams of crack cocaine. When Hendley was sentenced, 14.4 grams of crack was sufficient to support an indictment for possession with intent to distribute. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006) <em>amended by </em>Pub.L. 110-220, \u00a7 2(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And possession with intent to distribute is a drug-trafficking offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Because the quantity of drugs supported a finding that whoever possessed them was engaged in a drug-trafficking offense, to prove that the enhancement should apply the government had to show that the drugs and gun were found in close proximity to one another and that the drugs probably belonged to Hendley. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), comment. (n,14(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the government established that the drugs and gun were found within 20 yards of each other. This satisfies the close-proximity requirement. The district court also found that drugs were likely Hendley\u2019s and that he had discarded the drugs as he fled the police. The district court based this finding on an earlier incident where Hendley discarded drugs while fleeing from the police, as well as the location of the drugs on the path. In addition, the court noted that the marijuana\u2019s strong odor suggested that the it had not been in the open for very long. These facts are sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that the drugs were probably Hendley\u2019s, and that he had possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was correct, and Hendley\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\">.
