Because Grady was properly advised that his amended complaint would replace all previous complaints, his argument that the district court erred in failing to consider his original complaint is without merit. Grady also abandoned his arguments related to his actual confinement and any Eighth Amendment violations because he failed to allege any facts suggesting that he was denied procedural due process. Additionally, Grady alleged that Baker violated state law and that he was entitled to damages pursuant to state law, thus he failed to allege any violation of his federal substantive due process rights. Because Grady failed to allege any facts supporting a \u00a7 1983 claim, the district court did not err in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim. We therefore affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">Grady filed a pro <em>se </em>\u00a7 1983 action against Baker, a senior psychologist employed at Florida State Hospital (\u201cFSH\u201d) where Grady is confined. Grady alleged that Baker committed perjury, falsified court records, and misused her authority to prevent his release from FSH. Grady claimed that Baker\u2019s actions violated his Eighth and Thirteenth Amendment rights, \u201cU.S. Law,\u201d \u201cU.S.C. Art. 6,\u201d and Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 916.15 and 916.16. Grady requested $500,000 in damages, and that FSH terminate Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The magistrate judge ordered Grady to file an amended complaint. The judge noted how the original complaint failed to allege a constitutional violation or present any facts showing how Baker harmed Grady. The judge instructed Grady what elements were necessary for him to prove a claim against Baker pursuant to the Eighth Amendment. The judge also told Grady that filing an amended complaint would completely replace all previous complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Grady filed an amended complaint. According to Grady, Baker submitted clinical findings in state court that were false, exaggerated, perjurious, and designed to prevent Grady\u2019s \u201crelease from the hospital.\u201d Grady alleged that Baker\u2019s false medical reports constituted perjury and violated the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as Florida law governing mentally ill defendants. Grady argued that an evaluation done by Dr. Michael Maher proved that Baker\u2019s report was false. He further argued that he was deprived of due process because Maher took Baker\u2019s false report into account when he recommended that Baker not be released from FSH. Baker again requested relief in the amount of $500,000, and that Baker\u2019s position be terminated. He also requested the ability to \u201cconstruct a method to improve hospital practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The district court dismissed Grady\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, noting that Baker was immune from civil liability for preparing the report because the report was akin to testimony. The court concluded that Grady failed to present a valid claim that Baker violated his Eighth Amendment rights by rendering her medical opinion, noting that Grady failed to allege that Baker was deliberately indifferent to Grady\u2019s medical needs or a risk to his safety, or that she failed to provide him with care. The court also noted that Grady could not use a \u00a7 1983 claim to challenge his confinement. The court did not, however, discuss Grady\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">On appeal, Grady argues that the district court erred in not considering his original complaint. He states his amended complaint was misconstrued because he never intended to challenge Baker\u2019s medical opinion and report, but only her \u201cunlawful conduct, practice, and performing illegally and unconstitutionally as defined by Florida State laws.\u201d Grady asserts that his constitutional rights were violated because FSH did not comply with Florida law regarding mental health treatment, and accordingly argues that he is entitled to damages for Baker\u2019s actions pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.459(10). Grady also notes that he did not seek to challenge his confinement in filing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). In evaluating the sufficiency of a plaintiffs pleadings we \u201cmake reasonable inferences\u201d in the plaintiffs favor, but the court is not required to accept the plaintiffs legal conclusions. <em>Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). \u201cA complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim if the allegations, taken as true, show the plaintiff is not entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 215, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">\u201cSection 1983 creates no substantive rights; it merely provides a remedy for deprivations of federal statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Almand v. DeKalb Cnty., Ga., </em>103 F.3d 1510, 1512 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). Section 1983 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>not meant to replace state tort law, it is only meant to provide a remedy for violations of federally protected rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1513 (citing <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 145-46, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2695, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979)). A successful 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action requires that the plaintiff \u201cshow [that he or] she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">An official violates an involuntarily civilly committed person\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights when the official is deliberately indifferent to their serious medical needs. <em>Dolihite v. Maughon By and Through Videon, </em>74 F.3d 1027, 1041 (11th Cir.1996). Thus, to prevail on his Eighth Amendment claim for damages under \u00a7 1983, Grady must prove \u201c(1) a condition of confinement that inflicted unnecessary pain or suffering, (2) the defendant\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to that condition, and (3) causation.\u201d <em>LaMarca v. Turner, </em>995 F.2d 1526, 1535 (11th Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">A violation of either procedural or substantive due process may also form the basis for a civil rights suit under \u00a7 1983. <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1555 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides \u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Procedural due process \u201centitles an individual to notice and some form of hearing before state action may finally deprive him or her\u201d of a liberty interest. <em>See Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175, 177 (11th Cir.1994). An actionable constitutional violation arises \u201conly when the state refuses to provide a process sufficient to remedy the procedural deprivation.... \u201d <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Substantive due process, on the other hand, protects against \u201cgovernment interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\u201d <em>Williams v. Att\u2019y Gen. of Ala., </em>378 F.3d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he involuntarily civilly committed have liberty interests under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to safety, freedom from bodily restraint, and minimally adequate or reasonable training to further the ends of safety and freedom from restraint.\u201d <em>Dolihite, </em>74 F.3d at 1041 (citing <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982)). Because substantive due process rights are created only by the U.S. Constitution, rights created by state law are not entitled to this protection. <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">In this case, Grady filed an amended complaint, which he was advised would supercede his original complaint. <em>See Pintando v. Miami-Dade Hous. Agency, </em>501 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Thus Grady\u2019s argument that the district court erred by failing to consider his original complaint is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Grady\u2019s amended complaint can liberally be construed to raise the following claims: (1) that Baker committed perjury; (2) that Baker\u2019s report wrongfully resulted in his continued confinement; (3) that Baker was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, as her report increased the severity of his mental illnesses; and (4) that Baker\u2019s report resulted in violations of Grady\u2019s due process rights. The district court analyzed Grady\u2019s first three claims, finding that: (1) to the extent that Baker did commit perjury in preparing her report, Grady could not undermine that testimony by filing a civil rights action; (2) that Grady could not challenge his actual confinement in a \u00a7 1983 action; and (3) that Grady failed to allege that Baker was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>or safety or that she failed to provide him with care. The district court did not analyze Grady\u2019s potential due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AHO\">On appeal, Grady abandons his second and third claims. While we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues that a <em>pro se </em>litigant does not brief on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (citations omitted). First, Grady concedes that he did not attempt to challenge his actual confinement in his amended complaint. Additionally, although mentioned in his amended complaint, Grady failed to raise any argument in his appellate brief related to Baker\u2019s deliberate indifference or any other potential violation of the Eighth Amendment. Accordingly, to the extent that Grady raised these issues below, he has abandoned them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ArF\">Grady argues repeatedly in his amended complaint and his brief to this Court that Baker acted unprofessionally and committed perjury, in violation of his constitutional rights and in violation of Florida law. The remedy for false testimony in a judicial proceeding \u201cis criminal prosecution for perjury and not expanded civil liability and damages.\u201d <em>See Rehberg v. Paulk, </em>611 F.3d 828, 840 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1287 n. 10 (11th Cir.1999)). Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that Grady failed to state a \u00a7 1983 claim based on Baker\u2019s perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"AEsx\">Reading Grady\u2019s complaint liberally, the only remaining claims raised in the amended complaint are due process claims. Grady does not allege that he was denied notice, a hearing, or post-deprivation review, but only that Baker\u2019s false report tainted the review process. Taking Grady\u2019s allegations as true, he has failed to state any facts suggesting that he was deprived of his right to procedural due process. <em>See Cryder, </em>24 F.3d at 177; <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"Amd\">Similarly, Grady has not alleged any facts to support a claim that his substantive due process rights were violated. In his amended complaint, Grady argues that he was wrongfully kept in civil confinement as a result of Baker\u2019s fabricated report, which liberally construed could raise a \u201cliberty interest\u201d due process claim. <em>See Dolihite, </em>74 F.3d at 1041. However, Grady\u2019s amended complaint and appellate brief repeatedly allege that Baker\u2019s intentional lies in her clinical summary violated Florida law, and that he is entitled to recovery based on Florida law. Because Grady seeks to challenge his rights under Florida\u2019s Mental Health Act, and because Florida law provides Grady with a remedy for these alleged violations of state law, the rights that he alleges were violated are not federal rights. Accordingly, he did not allege sufficient facts to show a violation of his substantive due process rights. <em>See McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556; <em>Almand, </em>103 F.3d at 1512.</p>\n<p id=\"AYY\">Although the district court failed to analyze Grady\u2019s potential due process claims, we may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record. <em>Koziara v. City of Casselberry, </em>392 F.3d 1302, 1306 n. 2 (11th Cir.2004). The district court dismissed Grady\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a claim. For the aforementioned reasons, we find that Grady did not allege any set of facts that would support a \u00a7 1983 claim. Because the district court did not err in dismissing Grady\u2019s complaint, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\">. Grady was committed to the Florida Department of Children and Families in connection with state criminal case number 07CFO19581A. It is uncertain whether Grady was found not guilty by reason of insanity, or whether charges remain pending and he is committed because he is not competent to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
