INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir. 1997). The substantial evidence standard test is applied in reviewing factual findings in immigration proceedings. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Under that standard, \u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Nyemb filed his application after the effective date of the REAL ID Act of 2005, which amended the standards for assessing credibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 537 (5th Cir.2009). Under the REAL Act, \u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s testimony, alone, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proving eligibility for asylum, \u2018but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that [his] testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii)). The IJ may consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and \u201call relevant factors\u201d in making a credibility determination. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). An applicant\u2019s credibility is not presumed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Thus, \u201c\u2018an IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538-39. This court will defer \u201c\u2018to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In making a credibility finding, the IJ is not required to consider only inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods that go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim, as details at the periphery of the applicant\u2019s story \u201c \u2018may expose a liar.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537 &amp; 539 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was based on discrepancies between Nyemb\u2019s testimony and statements made to the asylum officer and in his written declaration with respect to (1) injuries suffered during a 2003 detention, (2) the number of times Nyemb was detained in 2003, and (3) facts related to Nyemb\u2019s release from detention in 2003. Nyemb has not shown that, under the totality of the circumstances, no reasonable factfinder could have made an adverse credibility ruling based on these discrepancies. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">The documents submitted by Nyemb in support of his asylum application did not sufficiently corroborate his testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 537. The BIA did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>not err in concluding that the IJ had not erred in determining that additional corroborative evidence, establishing a nexus between the 2003 detention and a fire at Nyemb\u2019s residence and his political activities, was reasonably available and should have been produced. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). Because the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing Nyemb\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision denying Nyemb\u2019s asylum application is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b952-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-32\">. Nyemb raises no issue with respect to the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal from the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>of his requests for withholding of removal and for relief under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, any issue that might have been raised with respect to those determinations has been waived. <em>See Singh v. Holder, </em>568 F.3d 525, 529 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\">. Two cases relied upon by Nyemb, <em>Koulibaly v. Mukasey, </em>541 F.3d 613 (6th Cir.2008), and <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081, 1089-90 (9th Cir.2005), were not governed by the REAL ID Act. <em>See Koulibaly, </em>541 F.3d at 620 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b953-13\">. In reaching this conclusion, we note that many of the documents submitted by Nyemb were not translated. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.33 (foreign language documents must be translated into English and must be accompanied by translator's certificate); <em>Li v. Holder, </em>342 Fed.Appx. 55, 57 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that the IJ was justified in excluding foreign language documents that were not translated).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
