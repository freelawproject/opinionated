He notes that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l) provides that district courts will authorize indigent defendants to obtain services \u201cnecessary for adequate representation.\u201d He contends that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion prejudiced him because it precluded him from requesting a diminished capacity departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. Additionally, he asserts that the denial left him unable to effectively argue for a reduced sentence based on his mitigating psychological issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for presentence psychiatric examination for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Nickels, </em>324 F.3d 1250, 1251 (11th Cir.2003) (reviewing presentence motions brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3552(c) and 4241(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\u201cCounsel for a person who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expert, or other services necessary for adequate representation may request them in an ex parte application.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l). After appropriate inquiry, if the district court finds the services to be necessary, it shall authorize counsel to obtain them. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA court may refuse to authorize Section 3006A(e) expert services on grounds that they are not \u2018necessary\u2019 when it concludes that the defendant does not have a plausible claim or defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Rinchack, </em>820 F.2d 1557, <em>1564 </em>(11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The guidelines provide that a \u201cdownward departure may be warranted if (1) the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity; and (2) the significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. The guidelines do not require a defendant to submit to psychiatric examination in order to request a departure based on diminished capacity. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">In imposing a sentence, the district court is required to choose a term that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to proride restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). For purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(1), \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d include the defendant\u2019s mental capacity. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>see also United States v. Willis, </em>560 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2009) (discussing defendant\u2019s diminished mental capacity in the context of \u00a7 3553(a)(1)). A district court may assess a defendant\u2019s mental condition without the aid of a psychiatric examination if it has adequate information relating to the condition. <em>Nickels, </em>324 F.3d at 1251 (affirming the denial of a motion <em>for </em>a psychiatric examination under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>fencing Lundy without the aid of an additional presentence psychiatric examination, because such an examination was not \u201cnecessary for adequate representation\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l). Lundy did not need the additional examination in order to request a departure for diminished capacity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. The additional examination was also unnecessary for purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing arguments, since the district court may properly consider a defendant\u2019s mental condition without a presentence examination so long as it has adequate information relating to the condition. <em>See Nickels, </em>324 F.3d at 1251. In light of the ample information concerning Lundy\u2019s mental health available to the district court, it did not abuse its discretion in denying his request for an additional psychiatric examination. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Lundy\u2019s request for additional psychiatric examination and his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
