He sought transfer to a facility where he could avail himself of such programs. He also sought removal of an immigration detainer against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Lemus\u2019s July 2010 release rendered moot his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 claims. <em>See Rocky v. King, </em>900 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir.1990). Lemus\u2019s claim regarding the removal of the immigration detain-er, whether brought under section 2241 or any other provision of law, was rendered moot by his September 2010 removal to Mexico. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATZ\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
