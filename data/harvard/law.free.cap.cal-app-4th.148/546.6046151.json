He raises three meritless contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">First, defendant complains his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to evidence of his violent character. We agree that evidence of the officer\u2019s purportedly violent conduct before defendant resisted arrest did not open the door for the prosecution to offer evidence of defendant\u2019s violent character. But the admission of that evidence was harmless. Counsel\u2019s failure to object did not prejudice defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Second, defendant claims the court wrongly found citizen complaints against the officer were unresponsive to his Pitchess<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Finally, in his petition for writ of habeas corpus, defendant contends his counsel provided ineffective assistance by advising him to testify about the details of a prior conviction. He contends his testimony allowed the court to find the prior conviction constituted a serious felony strike. But the court could have made that determination from the record of conviction, without defendant\u2019s testimony. Thus, this ineffective assistance claim fails as well. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment and deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">A California Highway Patrol officer saw defendant walking along a freeway on-ramp. The officer approached defendant and asked what he was doing. Defendant stated he was hitchhiking. The officer began a patdown search of defendant. Defendant followed the officer\u2019s directions to turn around, separate his feet, and interlace his fingers behind his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">As the officer began to check defendant\u2019s waistband, defendant separated his hands and turned toward the officer. The officer radioed for help, tried to control defendant, and pushed him toward the sound wall. Defendant ran past the officer. The officer tried to grab defendant, but he broke free. The officer tackled defendant and lay on top of him. Defendant tried to get up and grabbed the officer\u2019s holster, but the officer finally handcuffed defendant. The officer broke his finger during the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Another officer arrived at the scene and searched defendant. A glass pipe with white residue on it was found in defendant\u2019s pants pocket. Defendant waived his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights and stated he fought with the first officer to keep him from discovering the pipe, which he used to smoke methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The People filed an information charging defendant with one count each of resisting an officer resulting in serious bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148.10, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> committing a battery on an officer (\u00a7 243, subd. (c)(2)), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>possession of drag paraphernalia (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11364).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People also alleged defendant had' suffered a prior serious felony conviction. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (a)(1), (d), (e)(1), 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Before trial, defendant filed a <em>Pitchess </em>motion for discovery of material in the officer\u2019s personnel file. Defendant sought any complaints against the officer of excessive force, complaints of false statements by the officer, and similar material. Defendant supported his motion with a sealed declaration. The court agreed to review in camera any arguably responsive documents in the officer\u2019s personnel file. The prosecution produced the California Highway Patrol\u2019s custodian of records and all citizen complaints against the officer. The court described the complaints on the record of the in camera proceeding. It concluded none were responsive to defendant\u2019s request. It ordered the supporting declaration and the reporter\u2019s transcript to be sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Also before trial, the prosecution filed a motion in limine to admit evidence of defendant\u2019s violent character. The prosecution contended the evidence would be admissible if defendant first testified the officer acted violently during the arrest.' (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1103, subds. (a), (b).) Defense counsel objected the evidence of defendant\u2019s violent character would be unduly prejudicial. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) The court noted the defense did not dispute the evidence\u2019s admissibility pursuant to Evidence Code section 1103. It then overruled the defense\u2019s undue prejudice objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">At trial, defendant took the stand. He testified the officer was overly aggressive towards him, slamming him against the freeway wall and kicking his feet apart. Defendant stated he \u201cfreaked out\u201d and \u201ctried to get away.\u201d He denied touching the officer\u2019s holster, stating it would have been impossible for him to do so while the officer was lying on top of him. He claimed someone had given him the glass pipe to smoke tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Defendant also testified on direct examination about his prior violent conduct. He admitted having a felony conviction \u201cwhich involve[d] assault with a gun\u201d in Arizona. He had been a security guard at a trailer park, and fired two warning shots at suspected drag dealers while off duty. He pled guilty to \u201caggravated assault.\u201d. He also admitted having twice been arrested on misdemeanor assault charges. In one case, he was arrested in Arizona \u201cfor domestic violence\u201d for pushing his girlfriend\u2019s sister to break up a fight between his girlfriend and her sister. In the other instance, he was arrested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Washington after he pushed a different girlfriend during an argument. During cross-examination, defendant admitted pleading guilty to assault charges arising from both instances. The jury found defendant guilty on all counts after about 90 minutes of deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The court held a bifurcated trial on the prior serious felony conviction allegation. The prosecution introduced a certified record of conviction and a certified record of commitment on defendant\u2019s Arizona conviction, which was for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. Defendant testified again, briefly recounting the warning shots and his guilty plea. The court queried whether the Arizona records showed defendant had personally used a firearm during the commission of the aggravated assault. It then found the prior conviction allegation true, based on \u201cthe documents and from what you have told me today about the facts of the prior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The court sentenced defendant to a total term of six years in prison. It imposed a midterm three-year sentence on the resisting an officer count, which it doubled due to defendant\u2019s prior serious felony conviction. (\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(1).) It stayed sentencing on the battery count, and suspended the sentence on the possession of drug paraphernalia count. Defendant appealed and filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. We consolidated the two matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\n<em>Failing to Object to the Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Violent Character on Section 1101 and Section 1103 Grounds Was Not Prejudicial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Although counsel objected to the admission of evidence of defendant\u2019s violent character on the ground of undue prejudice, defendant contends counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing also to object pursuant to Evidence Code sections 1101 (defendant\u2019s propensity for violence generally inadmissible) and 1103 (prosecution may not offer evidence of defendant\u2019s propensity for violence unless in rebuttal to defendant\u2019s evidence of victim\u2019s propensity for violence). He maintains the defense offered only evidence of the victim\u2019s violent <em>conduct </em>during the arrest, not evidence of the victim\u2019s violent <em>character. To </em>prove his ineffective assistance claim, defendant must show (l) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>(Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052] <em>(Strickland).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Usually, defendant\u2019s contentions would not make it out of the gate. \u201cGenerally, failure to object is a matter of trial tactics as to which we will not exercise judicial hindsight.\u201d <em>(People v. Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 520 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].) \u201cA reviewing court will not second-guess trial counsel\u2019s reasonable tactical decisions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But we will review counsel\u2019s failure to object when \u201c \u2018 \u201ccounsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Defendant\u2019s habeas corpus petition includes a declaration from his appellate counsel, stating defendant\u2019s trial counsel told him she could recall no tactical purpose for failing to object on the ground the predicate of Evidence Code section 1103 had not been met. This is hearsay, but the Attorney General does not object. And the issue arose in a motion in limine, not in front of the jury in the heat of trial, making it unlikely defense counsel had a tactical reason for not objecting on all arguable grounds. Thus, we will review the purportedly deficient objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">As defendant correctly notes, character evidence is generally inadmissible to prove a person acted in conformity with it on a given occasion. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a).) Evidence Code section 1103 sets forth exceptions to this general rule. One exception allows a criminal defendant to offer evidence of the victim\u2019s character to show the victim acted in conformity with it. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1103, subd. (a)(1).) If the defendant offers evidence showing the victim has a violent character, then the prosecution may offer evidence of the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>violent character to show the defendant acted in conformity with it. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1103, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Defendant contends evidence of his violent character was not admissible pursuant to Evidence Code section 1103, subdivision (b), because his testimony about the officer\u2019s aggressive conduct at the time of the incident did not constitute character evidence for the purposes of Evidence Code section 1103. The Attorney General contends defendant\u2019s testimony satisfied Evidence Code section 1103, subdivision (b), because it tended to show the victim\u2019s \u201ccharacter for violent behavior on the day of [defendant\u2019s] arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Defendant has the better of the argument. Evidence Code section 1103 contemplates that character evidence comprises something other than evidence of conduct at the time in question, because character evidence is used to show the person acted \u201cin conformity with\u201d his or her character. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1103, subd. (b).) Wigmore, on whose treatise Evidence Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>1103 is based <em>(People v. Blanco </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1173-1174 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 176]), notes the relevance of character evidence is premised on a continuity of character <em>over </em>time: \u201c \u2018Character at an earlier or later <em>time </em>than that of the deed in question is relevant only on the assumption that it was substantially unchanged in the meantime, i.e. the offer is really of <em>character at one period to prove character at another . . . </em>.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Shoemaker </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 442, 448 [185 Cal.Rptr. 370], quoting Wigmore, second italics added, some italics omitted.) If evidence of a victim\u2019s conduct at the time of the charged offense constitutes character evidence under Evidence Code section 1103, then every criminal defendant claiming self-defense would open the door for evidence of his own violent character. Evidence Code section 1103 cannot be read so broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">But although an Evidence Code section 1103 objection would have been meritorious, counsel\u2019s failure to object caused no prejudice. <em>(Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 687, 693-694 [prejudice requires a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that competent performance would have led to a different result].) This was not a close case. The jury deliberated for less than two hours before convicting defendant. It credited the officer\u2019s testimony. Defendant destroyed his own credibility with his farfetched claim that the white-residue-encrusted glass pipe was for smoking tobacco. Any reasonable juror would have concluded defendant fought with the officer to hide his meth pipe. Objecting to the evidence of defendant\u2019s violent character would not reasonably have resulted in a more favorable determination to defendant. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Denying Defendant\u2019s </em>Pitchess <em>Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Defendant asks us to determine whether the court abused its discretion by concluding the citizen complaints in the officer\u2019s personnel file were not responsive to his <em>Pitchess </em>motion. We have reviewed all material in the record regarding defendant\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>motion, including the moving papers, defense counsel\u2019s sealed declaration, and the sealed transcript of the in camera hearing. The hearing transcript contains an adequate record of the court\u2019s review and analysis of the documents provided to it. It reveals no abuse of discretion. (See <em>People v. Mooc </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1228 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 482, 36 P.3d 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\n<em>Counsel Did Not Render Ineffective Assistance by Advising Defendant to Testify About His Prior Felony Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In his habeas corpus petition, defendant contends defense counsel\u2019s advice to testify about the details of his prior conviction led to the only evidence showing the conviction constituted a serious felony strike.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He notes the certified records of conviction and commitment showed he had been convicted in Arizona of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, i.e., a handgun. He asserts <em>personal </em>use of a firearm is required for assault with a deadly weapon to constitute a serious felony strike, relying on section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8) (serious felony includes \u201cany felony in which the defendant personally uses a firearm\u201d) and <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 253, 261 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 949 P.2d 31] (conviction for assault with a deadly weapon may result from aiding and abetting, which would not satisfy personal use requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Defendant\u2019s claim was tenable before the turn of the century, but not now. The voters adopted Proposition 21 in the March 7, 2000, Primary Election. <em>(People v. Luna </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 395, 398 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 539].) The proposition \u201cdelet[ed] for serious felony purposes the personal use requirement for assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The definition of \u201cserious felony\u201d now includes any \u201cassault with a deadly weapon [or] firearm ... in violation of Section 245,\u201d without reference to personal use. (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(31).) The Arizona records show defendant pleaded guilty to assaulting his victim \u201cwith a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, to wit: a handgun.\u201d Defendant\u2019s prior conviction thus satisfies the elements of section 245, subdivision (a)(2)\u2014assault with a firearm. (See <em>People v. Myers </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1193, 1195 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 911, 858 P.2d 301] [court may consider the entire record on the prior conviction to determine whether it satisfies the elements of a serious felony].) Defendant does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Thus, the court could have determined the prior conviction constituted a serious felony strike without defendant\u2019s testimony. Defense counsel\u2019s alleged advice was not prejudicial. (See <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 687, 693-694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
