Carter sued his employer, the Escondido Union High School District (EUHSD), claiming that EUHSD wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of public policy. At trial, Carter supported his allegations by presenting evidence that EUHSD declined to \u201creelect\u201d him to his probationary teaching position because, while employed as a teacher at another school district, Carter informed the athletic director there that the football coach had recommended a nutritional supplement to a student.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">After the jury found that Carter\u2019s report to the athletic director had been \u201ca motivating reason\u201d for EUHSD\u2019s adverse job action and that Carter was entitled to damages of over $1 million, the trial court entered judgment against EUHSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">As discussed in more detail below, we are required by controlling precedent to reverse. For an employer to be liable for the tort of wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the employer\u2019s conduct must violate a public policy that is \u201c \u2018fundamental,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018well established\u2019 \u201d and \u201ccarefully tethered\u201d to a constitutional or statutory provision. <em>(Gantt v. Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1090, 1095 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680] <em>(Gantt).) </em>The public policy upon which EUHSD\u2019s liability was based in the instant case\u2014characterized by Carter on appeal as \u201cthe policy against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>teachers recommending weight-gaining substances to students\u201d\u2014fails to satisfy these requirements. There may indeed be sound policy reasons to bar football coaches from recommending weight-gaining substances to high school students, but as there is currently no law that does so, any such prohibition must be enacted explicitly by the Legislature, not implicitly by the courts. Thus, while EUHSD\u2019s decision to terminate Carter may have been arbitrary, misguided and petty, it was not prohibited by law or in contravention of well-established public policy, and thus provides no basis for liability under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">During the 1999-2000 school year, Harlan Edison was a senior at Monte Vista High School in the Grossmont Union High School District and a member of the school\u2019s football and basketball teams. Edison hoped to play college football after graduation. In the spring semester, Edison took three weight-training classes with football coach Ed Carberry. During that time, Coach Carberry told Edison he was not big enough to play division I college football, and suggested that Edison consume protein drinks containing creatine to gain weight. Edison subsequently bought a \u201cprotein shake\u201d containing creatine from a local GNC store and drank the shake while lifting weights at a Mend\u2019s house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">During that same year, Carter was a teacher and basketball coach at Monte Vista High School. Carter, who knew Edison from the basketball team, noticed during the spring semester that Edison was gaining weight. Edison told Carter he had taken \u201cweight gainer\u201d at the recommendation of Coach Carberry.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">About a week after drinking the protein shake, Edison began having problems with his kidneys and required temporary hospitalization. When Carter heard about the hospitalization, he went to see Phil Poist, the school\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>athletic director. Carter testified he did so \u201cbecause I knew that Harlan had been injured and I wanted to bring it to [Foist\u2019s] attention.\u201d Carter told Foist that he had \u201clearned Harlan Edison was taking a weight gainer at the suggestion of Ed Carberry.\u201d Foist told Carter that he was not going to take any action \u201cunless the parents g[o]t involved\u201d; Carter responded that if no action was taken, he would \u201cbe leaving Monte Vista if [he] could find a job someplace\u201d else.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Carter then applied to teach at Orange Glen High School in the Escondido Union High School District and received a probationary appointment as a teacher. After accepting the position, Carter learned that Diana Carberry, Coach Carberry\u2019s wife, would be the interim principal at Orange Glen.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Carter taught at Orange Glen for the 2000-2001 school year, and again for the 2001-2002 school year after his probationary teaching status was renewed for a second year. On or about March 13, 2002, Carter received a letter from EUHSD informing him that his employment at Orange Glen would terminate at the end of the second probationary year.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Carter subsequently filed suit against EUHSD, alleging that he was unlawfully terminated in violation of public policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A jury trial was held and, at its conclusion, the jury returned a special verdict, answering \u201cYes\u201d to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">\u201cQuestion No. 1: Do you find that Plaintiff reported that he believed Coach Ed Carberry encouraged a student athlete to use a weight-gaining substance?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">\u201cQuestion No. 2: Was the Plaintiff\u2019s reporting that he believed Coach Ed Carberry encouraged a student athlete to use a weight-gaining substance a motivating reason for the determination to not reelect the plaintiff?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\u201cQuestion No. 3: Did the determination to not reelect the Plaintiff cause the Plaintiff harm?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Having answered these three questions in the affirmative, the jury calculated Carter\u2019s damages to be $1,185,258. The trial court then entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>judgment against EUHSD for wrongfully terminating Carter in violation of public policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> EUHSD appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In this consolidated action, Carter also appeals; his sole request is for a reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for attorney fees, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, as the \u201csuccessful party\u201d in the lawsuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">EUHSD makes a number of challenges to the judgment on appeal. As we agree with EUHSD that the judgment must be reversed because the school district\u2019s liability was not grounded, as required by our Supreme Court, on a well-established, fundamental public policy derived from a constitutional or statutory provision, we reverse without reaching the alternative grounds for reversal raised by EUHSD.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>As a consequence of our reversal of the judgment, we necessarily reject Carter\u2019s contention in his cross-appeal that the trial court erred in denying his request for attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">A. <em>Applicable Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">An employer may discharge an at-will employee \u201cfor no reason, or for an arbitrary or irrational reason,\u201d but is precluded from doing so \u201cfor an unlawful reason or a purpose that contravenes fundamental public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1094.) A discharge is actionable as against public policy only if it violates a policy that is: \u201c(1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) \u2018public\u2019 in the sense that it \u2018inures to the benefit of the public\u2019 rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018fundamental.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stevenson v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 901-902 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157] <em>(Stevenson).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The requirement that the policy underlying employer liability be \u201ctether [ed]\u201d to \u201cspecific constitutional or statutory provisions serves not only to avoid judicial interference with the legislative domain, but also to ensure that employers have adequate notice of the conduct that will subject them to tort liability to the employees they discharge.\u201d <em>(Stevenson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 889.) \u201cThis limitation recognizes an employer\u2019s general discretion to discharge an at-will employee without cause . . . , and best serves the Legislature\u2019s goal to give law-abiding employers broad discretion in making managerial decisions.\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 79-80, 82 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Whether the policy upon which a wrongful termination claim is based is sufficiently fundamental, well-established and tethered to a statutory or constitutional provision to support liability is a legal question that we review de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Ghirardo, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 799.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>B. <em>EUHSD\u2019s Liability Is Not Carefully Tethered to Education Code Section 49423</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Carter argues that the pertinent public policy upon which EUHSD\u2019s liability was based is found in \u201cEducation Code section 49423 [restricting school employees from assisting in the taking of most medications under most circumstances], plus California Code of Regulations, sections 601 and 604\u201d which, he argues, establish \u201cthe policy against teachers recommending weight-gaining substances to students.\u201d (Brackets in original.) Carter adds, without elaboration or citation to authority, that this \u201cpolicy is, most definitely, substantial and well-defined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Education Code section 49423 (section 49423) states that \u201cany pupil who is required to take, during the regular schoolday, medication prescribed for him or her by a physician or surgeon, may be assisted by the school nurse or other designated school personnel ... if the school district receives\u201d a \u201cwritten statement from the physician detailing the name of the medication, method, amount, and time schedules by which the medication is to be taken and a written statement from the parent . . . indicating the desire that the school district assist the pupil in the matters set forth in the statement of the physician.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Section 49423 does not support EUHSD\u2019s liability in the instant case because the public policy it establishes was not violated by Carter\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Section 49423 by its terms does not prohibit <em>any </em>conduct. Instead it is expressly permissive, delineating a circumstance under which the school nurse \u201cmay\u201d assist in the administration of medication to a student during the schoolday. An accompanying Education Code section emphasizes that it is \u201cthe intent of the Legislature to provide <em>positively </em>for the health services, many of which may be performed in the public schools only by physicians and school nurses.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 49426, italics added.) As the statute is explicitly permissive, there is, of course, no delineation of any sanctions (criminal or otherwise) that would apply to a failure to abide by its terms. This absence of any explicit prohibition of any conduct and the omission of any sanctions for noncompliance strongly suggest that section 49423 does not establish a fundamental public policy that could support a wrongful termination claim. <em>(Sullivan v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 938, 945 &amp; fn. 6 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 584] [\u201cthe prospect of criminal sanctions to punish the violation of a policy has been a significant factor in the determination that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>policy is substantial and fundamental\u201d].) Instead, as \u201cit is difficult to determine precisely what employer conduct [section 49423] prohibits\u201d (Sullivan, at p. 945), the statute does not \u201csufficiently describe [any] prohibited conduct to enable an employer to know the fundamental public policies that are expressed in that law\u201d as is required for wrongful termination liability. <em>(Sequoia Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1472, 1480 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 888]<footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Even if we were to assume, as the trial court did, that what the Legislature <em>really meant </em>in enacting section 49423 was that \u201cassistance\u201d as described in the statute is not discretionary with parental permission, but in fact <em>prohibited </em>without it, the action allegedly taken here by Coach Carberry would still not fall within its scope. In fact, virtually every portion of the statute is inapplicable. The protein shake was not \u201cmedication\u201d \u201cprescribed for [Edison] by a physician or surgeon\u201d; Edison was not \u201crequired to take [the shake], during the regular schoolday\u201d; and Edison was not \u201cassisted\u201d in taking it \u201cby the school nurse or other designated school personnel.\u201d (\u00a7 49423, subd. (a).) Thus, even if the statute is intended to implicitly prohibit the actions it describes absent written parental authorization, those actions would not include Coach Carberry\u2019s suggestion that a student could improve his college football recruitment prospects if he consumed a protein drink at some unspecified time in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The implementing regulations of the Department of Education do not alter this analysis. The only portion of the regulations that strengthen Carter\u2019s contention is found in California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 601, subdivision (b) which states, in pertinent part, that the definition of \u201cmedication\u201d includes \u201cover-the-counter remedies, nutritional supplements, and herbal remedies.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While the broadening of the definition of \u201cmedication\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>include \u201cnutritional supplements\u201d helps Carter\u2019s claim to overcome one hurdle (placing protein shakes more comfortably within the term \u201cmedication\u201d), the regulatory framework as a whole further demonstrates the inapplicability of the underlying statute to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Section 49423\u2019s implementing regulations are expressly \u201climited to addressing a situation where a pupil\u2019s parent or legal guardian has initiated a request to have a local educational agency dispense medicine to a pupil, . . . as prescribed by a physician or other authorized medical' personnel.\u201d (\u00a749423.6, subd. (b).) Consequently, like the statute itself, the regulation speaks solely to 'the administration by school medical personnel of required medical care, and as pertinent here clarifies that if a student were instructed by a physician to take a \u201cnutritional supplement\u201d during the schoolday, the school nurse \u201cmay\u201d assist in administering the supplement if the student submits appropriate written authorization. As explained above, this pronouncement of covered conduct is not sufficiently similar to the actions taken by Coach Carberry to support EUHSD\u2019s wrongful discharge liability. (See, e.g., <em>Silo </em>v. <em>CHW Medical Foundation </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1097, 1110 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 45 P.3d 1162] [\u201can employer cannot be held liable for violating a public policy that was not manifest at the time it committed the alleged tortious action\u201d]; <em>Foley v. Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 668 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373] <em>(Foley) </em>[the public policy supporting a wrongful termination claim should be \u201cone about which reasonable persons can have little disagreement, and which was \u2018firmly established\u2019 at the time of discharge\u201d].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In sum, we are unable to discern from section 49423 and its implementing regulations any fundamental and well-established public \u201cpolicy against teachers recommending weight-gaining substances to students\u201d; consequently, the statute cannot form the basis for Carter\u2019s wrongful termination action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>C. <em>EUHSD\u2019s Liability Is Not Carefully Tethered to California\u2019s Whistleblower Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We also reject Carter\u2019s implicit argument that the judgment against EUHSD is supported by California\u2019s general whistleblower statute, Labor Code section 1102.5 (section 1102.5).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 1102.5 prohibits termination of an employee \u201cfor disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.\u201d (\u00a7 1102.5, subd. (b); see also <em>id., </em>subds. (d), (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Carter\u2019s conduct in disclosing to the athletic director that Coach Carberry had recommended a protein shake to a student is not protected by section 1102.5. First, as explained above, the information disclosed by Carter did not \u201cdisclosef] a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.\u201d (\u00a7 1102.5, subd. (b); see <em>Love v. Motion Industries, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2004) 309 F.Supp.2d 1128, 1134 [\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s disclosure does not meet the standard for protected activity under Section 1102.5(b), because the disclosed activity does not violate any federal or state statute, rule, or regulation\u201d].) Second, Carter\u2019s conversation with Poist was not motivated by his belief that a law had been broken. In fact, Carter took no action upon learning that Carberry had recommended the shakes; rather, Carter testified he went to see Poist <em>after Edison was hospitalized </em>\u201cbecause [he] knew that Harlan had been injured and [he] wanted to bring it to [Poist\u2019s] attention.\u201d Then, when Poist stated that no action would be taken against Carberry, Carter made no further report. Third, even if Carter subjectively believed that Carberry had violated a statute or regulation and approached Poist for that reason, the record is devoid of anything that would support a conclusion that his belief was \u201creasonable.\u201d Protein shakes containing creatine are not unlawful under either state or federal law. Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>there is no reason to believe that merely suggesting that a high school senior drink one at some unspecified time in the future is <em>illegal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">As Carter\u2019s disclosure was not protected by California\u2019s whistleblower statute, EUHSD was not prohibited from discharging him based on that disclosure. <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 670 [\u201cNo enactment expressly requires an employee to report relevant information concerning other employees to his employer, and none prohibits discharge of the employee for so doing\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The situation in the instant case is analogous to that in <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Grant Joint Union High School Dist. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 113] <em>(Patten), </em>where our colleagues in the Third District rejected a teacher\u2019s lawsuit alleging retaliatory firing under section 1102.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In <em>Patten, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382, the plaintiff/teacher claimed he was fired because he brought to the attention of his supervisor: (1) \u201cthat a male physical education . . . teacher . . . was peering into the girl\u2019s locker room\u201d; (2) \u201can off-color remark that a male science teacher . . . had made to a female student\u201d; and (3) requested that additional security staff be added after a student was assaulted. The <em>Patten </em>court ruled that these disclosures \u201cdo not rise to the level of blowing a whistle,\u201d but were made in \u201cthe context of an internal personnel matter based on a student complaint, rather than in the context of a legal violation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1385.) The court reasoned: \u201cTo exalt these exclusively internal personnel disclosures with whistleblower status would create all sorts of mischief. Most damagingly, it would thrust the judiciary into micromanaging employment practices and create a legion of undeserving protected \u2018whistleblowers\u2019 arising from the routine workings and communications of the job site.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">As in <em>Patten, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1385, Carter\u2019s disclosure here was not whistleblowing under section 1102.5, but rather a routine \u201cinternal personnel disclosure\u201d that was, at its core, a \u25a0 disagreement between the football and basketball coaches about the proper advice to give to student athletes. This type of disclosure is not encompassed by section 1102.5, and consequently cannot support a wrongful termination action. (See <em>Patten, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1385; <em>Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 670 [employer\u2019s firing of employee for reporting that another employee was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>investigation by the FBI did not support claim of wrongful termination because firing did not implicate a \u201csubstantial public policy\u201d]; <em>Read </em>v. <em>City of Lynwood </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 437, 444 [219 Cal.Rptr. 26] [\u201cAppellant had every right to oppose the appointment of this developer and to make her opposition known.

These rulings are not at issue in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\"> The court also denied EUHSD\u2019s motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, as it had EUHSD\u2019s earlier motion for directed verdict. In those motions EUHSD asserted the same grounds it now asserts on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon motion, a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b794-11\"> In addition to the challenge identified above, EUHSD contends that: (i) there was no substantial evidence to support a finding that Carter\u2019s report of Carberry\u2019s conduct led to his termination; (ii) there was no substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s damages calculation; and (iii) in any event, the tort of wrongful termination does not apply to the non-reelection of a probationary employee such as Carter. For this last point, EUHSD relies on <em>Motevalli v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 97, 111 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 562] (holding that teacher who was \u201cemployed under an <em>emergency credential\u201d </em>and could not \u201cascend to permanent status merely through the passage of time\u201d could not sue for wrongful termination). The California Teachers Association filed an application to appear as amicus curiae on Carter\u2019s behalf on this point, contending that <em>Motevalli </em>\u201cwas wrongly decided\u201d and \u201cshould not be followed.\u201d As we note above, we need not, and do not, reach the question, because even if we agreed that <em>Motevalli </em>was wrongly decided (or that its reasoning does not apply), we would still be compelled to reverse the judgment because liability in the instant case is not based on a violation of a constitutional or statutory-based public policy. Consequently, we deny the application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> As noted in footnote 6, <em>ante, </em>EUHSD contends that Carter has fewer rights than an at-will employee. We assume for purposes of this appeal, however, that, as Carter contends, his rights as a probationary employee are essentially \u201cidentical to th[ose] of an at-will employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\"> The trial court ruled, with the agreement of the parties, that the decision as to whether the jury\u2019s findings established a violation of public policy was a legal question for the court to decide. Our review of this legal question, which does not depend on resolution of any disputed facts, is de novo. <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 799 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 883 P.2d 960] <em>(Ghirardo).)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\"> Despite the fact that the statute does not explicitly prohibit any conduct, the trial court read an implied prohibition into the statute, ruling: \u201cStated another way,\u201d the statute means that \u201cschool personnel are prohibited from <em>assisting </em>a student in the taking of medication without a doctor\u2019s note and a parent\u2019s note.\u201d By stating the statutory text \u201canother way,\u201d we believe the trial court failed to heed our Supreme Court\u2019s direction that \u201ccourts should venture into th[e] area [of declaring public policy], if at all, with great care and due deference to the judgment of the legislative branch, \u2018lest they mistake their own predilections for public policy which deserves recognition at law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1095.) In keeping with our Supreme Court\u2019s guidance, courts assessing liability in wrongful termination actions should not restate unambiguous statutory language \u201canother way,\u201d and then assess liability based on a violation of the <em>restated </em>statutory text. (See <em>Day </em>v. <em>City of Fontana </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 457, 19 P.3d 1196] [\u201cIf there is no ambiguity [in a statute], then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said, and the plain meaning of the language governs\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\"> Carter also references California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 604, subdivision (a), but that regulation, which states \u201c[a] school nurse may administer medication to a pupil or otherwise assist a pupil in the administration of medication as allowed by law and in keeping with applicable standards of professional practice,\u201d adds nothing to his contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\"> Were we to affirm the judgment under Carter\u2019s theory that section 49423 prohibits school personnel from <em>suggesting </em>any \u201cmedication,\u201d including, as defined in California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 601, subdivision (b) \u201cover-the-counter remedies, nutritional supplements, and herbal remedies,\u201d there is no principled way to limit this prohibition to the legal creatine supplement at issue in this case. We would consequently be announcing a new and far-reaching prohibition that would include suggesting that a student take her vitamins, use Pepto-Bismol for gastrointestinal distress, calamine lotion on a rash, or hand lotion on dry skin. There may be sound public policy reasons for such a law, but it is the Legislature, not the courts, that must decide that question. Were we to do so, our ruling would constitute exactly the kind of \u201cjudicial policymaking\u201d that is forbidden under <em>Gantt. (Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1095.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"> Carter\u2019s efforts to divine a public policy against teacher\u2019s recommending protein drinks from the trial testimony are equally unavailing. Carter cites the testimony of the commissioner at the California Interscholastic Federation, a nonprofit organization, who stated he would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>personally \u201ccondone\u201d recommending a dietary supplement to a student; and the testimony of the superintendent of EUHSD, who testified he would not want his teachers to <em>\u201cprovide </em>weight-gaining supplements to students.\u201d (Italics added.) This testimony cannot support a conclusion that there was a well-established, fundamental public policy <em>delineated in a statutory or constitutional provision </em>prohibiting Coach Carberry\u2019s conduct. <em>(Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1257 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022] <em>(Turner) </em>[\u201cThe tort of wrongful discharge is not a vehicle for enforcement of an employer\u2019s internal policies or the provisions of its agreements with others\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\"> While Carter does not specifically identify the whistleblower statute as support for the judgment, he references whistleblowing, arguing, for example, that \u201cthe activity that Carter engaged in\u2014essentially \u2018blowing the whistle\u2019 on Coach Carberry\u201d\u2014is \u201ca matter of fundamental public policy.\u201d Despite Carter\u2019s failure to make this contention explicit, we see no unfairness in evaluating this argument with respect to EUHSD, as both EUHSD on appeal and the trial court below recognized the whistleblower statute as a potential basis for liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b801-6\"> Without specifically arguing that his conduct was protected by the mandated reporter obligations of the Penal Code, Carter makes a conclusory assertion that \u201che did nothing more than fulfill his mandatory reporting obligation to his immediate supervisor.\u201d Carter is mistaken. Carter, as a teacher, was a \u201cmandated reporter\u201d under Penal Code section 11165.7, and consequently was required by law to report to police or the county child welfare agency any \u201cchild abuse and neglect\u201d he became aware of during the course of his employment. It is undisputed, however, that Carter did not make any such report, and, in fact, Carter testified he did not believe Carberry\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cchild abuse.\u201d (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11165.9, 11166, subd. (a), 11165.7 [if a mandated reporter during the course of employment obtains \u201cknowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect,\u201d the teacher is mandated to report that abuse or neglect \u201cto any police department or sheriff\u2019s department, not including a school district police or security department . . . , or the county welfare department\u201d].) Instead, Carter reported Carberry\u2019s actions to his supervisor Poist, a course of action the Legislature has specifically stated <em>does not </em>constitute compliance with the mandated reporter statute. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11166, subd. (i)(3) [\u201cReporting the information regarding a case of possible child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person shall not be a substitute for making a mandated report\u201d].) Consequently, Carter\u2019s conversation with Poist is not protected by the mandated reporter statute. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11166, subd. (c) [failure to make required report is a misdemeanor].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
