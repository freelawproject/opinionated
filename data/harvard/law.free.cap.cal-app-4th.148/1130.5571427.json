That year, the Legislature amended Insurance Code section 10133 to allow private health insurers to contract with hospitals and providers of medical services for alternative rates of payment for those services, thus permitting insurers to create panels of \u201cpreferred providers\u201d for the insurers\u2019 subscribers. That amendment was followed a few years later by legislation that enables providers to form groups or combinations to more efficiently negotiate with insurers to' become preferred providers. In doing so, the Legislature immunized certain conduct from antitrust liability. In this case, we. are asked to determine whether the conduct of one such group of providers (which imposed territorial restrictions on its members) and one insurer (which made the members of that, group the virtually exclusive preferred providers for physical therapy services) comes within the scope of this immunity. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">There are two named defendants in this lawsuit. The first is PTPN, Inc., a corporation that was founded by independently owned and licensed physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>therapy practices to negotiate with health insurers to become a preferred provider group. The second is Blue Cross of California, one of the insurers with whom PTPN negotiated alternative rates of payment. PTPN, which is alleged to be the largest group of physical therapy providers in California, limits its membership based in part upon geographic considerations; it does not allow new members whose practices are located within a certain radius of an existing member\u2019s practice. For the most part, the members of PTPN are the exclusive preferred providers of physical therapy services for Blue Cross, which is alleged to be the largest provider of PPO coverage in California.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PTPN also has contracted with many other insurers, including most managed care organizations in the country, to make PTPN members the preferred providers of physical therapy services for those insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Under the Blue Cross PPO plan, a member of PTPN who provides physical therapy services to a Blue Cross subscriber will receive the negotiated rate of payment as a preferred provider directly from Blue Cross. If a Blue Cross subscriber receives treatment from a physical therapist who is not a preferred provider, the subscriber must pay for the treatment and may receive a small portion of that payment as reimbursement from Blue Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Plaintiffs Lori Rubinstein Physical Therapy, Inc., and One on One PT are providers of physical therapy services. They are not, however, members of PTPN, and are not preferred providers for Blue Cross\u2019s PPO plan. They filed the instant action on behalf of themselves and all other non-PTPN-affiliated physical therapist providers in California (they estimate there are tens of thousands of such providers). Plaintiffs allege that PTPN and Blue Cross violate California\u2019s antitrust and unfair competition laws (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16720, 17200 et seq.) by engaging in an improper market allocation (through PTPN\u2019s geographic restrictions) and a group boycott (through Blue Cross\u2019s exclusive contract with PTPN). They assert that Blue Cross\u2019s exclusive arrangement with PTPN and PTPN\u2019s restrictions on membership unlawfully restrain competition for Blue Cross insured patients and have foreclosed actual and potential competitors of PTPN members from competing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>merits for patients with private health insurance. They assert this restraint on competition has resulted in higher prices to patients, less innovation, less variety in service offerings, and lower quality in physical therapy services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They seek an injunction prohibiting PTPN and Blue Cross from imposing any geographic restrictions on members of PTPN, from imposing a group boycott against non-PTPN members, and from making PTPN the exclusive physical therapy providers for any insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">PTPN and Blue Cross moved for judgment on the pleadings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court granted their motions, finding that the conduct at issue was authorized by statute and that plaintiffs failed to allege an antitrust violation under the Cartwright Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16700 et seq.) or under Business and Professions Code section 17200. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">A. <em>The Legislative Scheme Facilitating PPO Plans</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Antitrust laws \u201crest \u2018on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 920, 935 [130 Cal.Rptr. 1, 549 P.2d 833].) As one treatise explains, \u201cAntitrust laws place primary reliance on market forces to discipline economic behavior. If a monopoly or a cartel is created, the antitrust laws may be invoked to restore a situation of diffused power, but once that competitive balance is restored, there should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>no need for continuing government oversight. The \u2018invisible hand\u2019 of the market provides the discipline, so no regulators or bureaucrats are required once the proper competitive balance is restored.\u201d (Sullivan &amp; Grimes, The Law of Antitrust: An Integrated Handbook (2000) \u00a7 1.3, pp. 5-6, fn. omitted.) Thus, ordinarily, antitrust laws are invoked to condemn restraints on competition such as market-allocations and group boycotts because it is understood that market forces unhampered by these restraints will restore a proper competitive balance and produce the most efficient allocation of resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">But, as many commentators acknowledge, unique aspects of the health care market serve to distort the market forces and make it less likely that market forces alone will produce efficient allocation, high quality, and lower prices. (See, e.g., Greaney, <em>Chicago\u2019s Procrustean Bed: Applying Antitrust Law in Health Care </em>(2004) 71 Antitrust L.J. 857, 858, 863-866; Sage &amp; Hammer, <em>Competing on Quality of Care: The Need to Develop a Competition Policy for Health Care Markets </em>(1999) 32 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 1069, 1072-1073; Sullivan &amp; Grimes, The Law of Antitrust: An Integrated Handbook, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.4, pp. 670-671.) Indeed, as a result of these distortions, health care costs soared in the absence of government intervention and regulation. (Woo, <em>Antitrust and California\u2019s New Preferred Provider Organization Legislation: A New Alternative in Health Care Cost Containment </em>(1984) 12 Pepperdine L.Rev. 121, p. 121, fn. 1 (hereafter Woo).)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In 1982, the California Legislature sought to contain those rising costs by enacting legislation designed to encourage the development of PPG plans. (Stats. 1982, ch. 329, \u00a7 8, p. 1613.) In a PPG plan, there is a designated panel of preferred providers with whom a third party- payor has contracted to provide medical services to insureds at discounted rates. The providers agree to discount their rates in part because they are guaranteed a defined pool of patients who have an economic incentive to use a preferred provider. Although the insureds typically are not precluded from using providers who are not preferred providers, they have to pay significantly more for services from nonpreferred providers. (Woo, <em>supra, </em>12 Pepperdine L.Rev., at pp. 124-125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">To facilitate the development of PPG plans, the Legislature amended Insurance Code section 10133 to allow an insurer to \u201cnegotiate and enter into contracts for alternative rates of payment with institutional [and, after July 1, 1983, with professional] providers, and offer the benefit of these alternative rates to insureds who select those providers.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 10133, subds. (b), (e).) Alternatively, the Legislature permitted insurers to \u201climit payments under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>a policy to services secured by insureds from institutional [and] professional providers, charging alternative rates pursuant to contract with the insurer.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 10133, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">The Legislature subsequently found in 1985, however, that individual providers \u201chave not proven to be efficient-sized bargaining units for these contracts\u201d and that groups or combinations of providers would be more efficient-sized contracting units for PPO plans. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16770, subd. (d); Ins. Code, \u00a7 10133.6; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1342.6.) But because the formation of these groups required ah agreement among competitors, the Legislature recognized that antitrust laws were serving as a disincentive to the formation of such groups due to providers\u2019 concerns that they would be \u201cfound guilty of committing per se antitrust violations.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16770, subd. (e).) To alleviate this problem, the Legislature enacted three virtually identical statutes stating its intent \u201cthat the formation of groups and combinations of providers and purchasing groups for the purpose of creating efficient-sized contracting units be recognized as the creation of a new product within the health care marketplace, and be subject, therefore, only to those antitrust prohibitions applicable to the conduct of other presumptively legitimate enterprises.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16770, subd. (g); Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1342.6; see Ins. Code, \u00a7 10133.6.) For ease of reference, we refer to these statutes collectively as the immunity statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">In addition to this portion of the statutory scheme designed to facilitate the development of PPO plans, the Legislature enacted statutes to provide regulatory oversight of the plans and \u201cto promote the delivery and the quality of health and medical care to the people . . . who enroll in, or subscribe for the services rendered by, a health care service plan.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>\u00a7 1342.) To that end, the Legislature created the Department of Managed Health Care, which \u201chas charge of the execution of the laws of this state relating to health care service plans and the health care service plan business including, but not limited to, those laws directing the department to ensure that health care service plans provide enrollees with access to quality health care services and protect and promote the interests of enrollees.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1341, subd. (a).) The Legislature also directed the Insurance Commissioner, in consultation with the Department of Managed Health Care, to promulgate regulations \u201cdesigned to assure accessibility of provider services in a timely manner\u201d to PPO plan subscribers in a cost efficient manner. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 10133.5, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Legislature further directed the Governor to convene a task force on health care service plans to research, among other things, how the changes in health care delivery have affected the health care economy and whether the goals of managed \"care (such as controlling costs and improving quality and access to care) are being satisfied. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1342.1.) Finally, the Legislature enacted Health and Safety Code section 1373.9, which requires insurers offering PPO plans to give \u201creasonable consideration\u201d to proposals by providers wishing to contract to become preferred providers, unless the providers propose to serve a geographic area that is adequately served by the PPO plans\u2019 existing preferred providers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">It is against the backdrop of all these statutes and regulations that we must analyze plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">B. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims Evaluated Under the Legislative Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Plaintiffs contend that PTPN\u2019s geographic restrictions on membership, coupled with Blue Cross\u2019s designation of PTPN members as the exclusive preferred providers of physical therapy services, foreclose non-PTPN physical therapists from competing to provide services to Blue Cross subscribers. They argue that although the immunity statute authorizes the formation of provider networks, it does not allow those networks to violate the antitrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>laws\u2014which prohibit group boycotts and territorial market allocations\u2014 while doing so. They also assert that even if the immunity statute immunized all activity in connection with the formation of provider networks, the conduct at issue is not conduct related to the formation of PTPN, but rather it is conduct related to the operation of the PTPN network and PTPN\u2019s contractual relationship with Blue Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">In examining whether the conduct alleged constitutes an unlawful restraint on competition that is not exempt from antitrust enforcement under the immunity statute, it is important to distinguish between the two markets in which plaintiffs compete with PTPN and/or its members. The first market involves competition to provide physical therapy services to patients, including Blue Cross PPO plan subscribers\u2014a market in which plaintiffs compete with PTPN members. The second market involves the competition to become Blue Cross preferred providers\u2014a market in which plaintiffs compete with PTPN itself (rather than its individual members). We examine each area of competition to determine if the complaint alleges a cognizable unlawful restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">1. <em>Competition to Provide Services to Blue Cross Subscribers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The complaint alleges that, due to the exclusive contract between Blue Cross and PTPN, plaintiffs and other non-PTPN physical therapists cannot reasonably compete to provide physical therapy services to Blue Cross PPO plan subscribers. The reason: The subscribers are required to pay far more to receive services from a physical therapist who is not a preferred provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">There is no doubt that the contractual relationship between Blue Cross and PTPN inhibits plaintiffs\u2019 ability to compete, at least on a price basis, because of the low out-of-pocket costs to patients who utilize the services of PTPN members.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But that competitive disadvantage is expressly authorized by statute. Insurance Code section 10133 allows an insurer to contract for alternative rates with any provider and offer the benefit of those alternative rates to their insureds. The antitrust laws cannot be applied to forbid that which another statute expressly allows.  (Cf. <em>Stafford v. L. A. etc. Retirement Board </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 795, 799 [270 P.2d 12] [statutes must be \u201c \u2018construed with reference to the whole system of law of which [they are] a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>Moreover, by choosing to subscribe to a PPO plan, the subscribers themselves impair the nonpreferred providers\u2019 ability to compete for their business. To the extent that the subscribers\u2019 choice to limit competition among providers might result in higher costs and/or decreased quality, the subscribers are protected by the statutory and regulatory scheme designed to ensure that PPO plan subscribers have adequate access to high quality and cost effective health care. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16770; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1342, 1342.6, 1373.9; Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10133.5, 10133.6; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1300.51, 1300.67 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">2. ' <em>Competition to Become Preferred Providers \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The complaint does not allege that Blue Cross or PTPN have, engaged in conduct that directly restrains plaintiffs from negotiating with Blue Cross to become preferred providers. Instead, the complaint alleges that plaintiffs are foreclosed from becoming preferred providers because Blue Cross and PTPN have agreed to make PTPN members the exclusive or virtually exclusive preferred providers for Blue Cross\u2019s PPO plan. But once again, that conduct is authorized by statute. Insurance Code section 10133 allows an insurer to contract with any provider to become a preferred provider, and Health and Safety Code section 1373.9 requires the insurer to consider proposals by other providers wishing to become preferred providers <em>only </em>if the existing preferred providers do not adequately serve the geographic area proposed to be served by the other providers. And once again, the consumers\u2019 interests are protected by the extensive regulatory oversight to ensure that each plan has sufficient preferred providers in the areas in which it operates to adequately serve those subscribers. (See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1300.51, 1300.67.2, 1300.67,2.1.) Thus, the simple allegation that an insurer has entered into an exclusive contract with a provider group does not describe conduct that violates the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">This is not to say there can never be an antitrust violation if one or more providers or provider groups use coercion, threats, or intimidation to convince an insurer to refuse to negotiate with other providers or provider groups. <em>(G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 256, 268 [195 Cal.Rptr. 211].) But as the trial court found in this case, plaintiffs make no such allegation. In fact, it appears from the exhibit attached to the complaint that Blue Cross intended to negotiate with non-PTPN members who served areas in which PTPN did not have an adequate number of members, which prompted PTPN to modify its geographic restrictions to ensure adequate coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>Plaintiffs contend, however, that the exclusive contract between Blue Cross and PTPN unlawfully restrains competition because PTPN places geographic restrictions on its members. Thus, plaintiffs contend that PTPN and Blue Cross engage in a territorial market allocation that violates the Cartwright Act. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention fails because PTPN\u2019s imposition of geographic restrictions is expressly immunized by the immunity statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">The immunity statute proclaims that combinations or groups of providers formed as \u201cefficient-sized contracting units\u201d are \u201ca new product within the health care marketplace\u201d and are subject \u201conly to those antitrust prohibitions applicable to the conduct of other presumptively legitimate enterprises.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16770, subd. (g); Ins. Code, \u00a7 10133.6; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1342.6.) In other words, the groups\u2019 conduct in forming efficient-sized contracting units is exempt from the antitrust laws, although their conduct in negotiating alternative rates of payment is subject to antitrust enforcement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>Cianci </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 903, 923, fn. 7 [221 Cal.Rptr. 575, 710 P.2d 375].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">In the present case, PTPN\u2019s imposition of geographic restrictions on its members is immunized because it is part of the formation of an efficient-sized contracting unit. The regulations governing PPO plans require Blue Cross (and other insurers) to contract alternative rates of payment with a sufficient number of preferred providers in all geographic areas in which they have subscribers to ensure there will be adequate access to health care services for their subscribers. (See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1300.51, 1300.67.2, 1300.67.2.1.) To create the most efficient-sized contracting unit, PTPN must include a sufficient number of providers to allow Blue Cross to meet the regulatory requirements (or to exceed those requirements, if Blue Cross so desires). At the same time, PTPN must limit its membership sufficiently to ensure a patient volume for each member that will provide an incentive for the members to reduce their rate of payment. The geographic restrictions PTPN imposes on its members thus must be viewed as conduct related to the formation of an efficient-sized contracting unit, and therefore PTPN is exempt from antitrust enforcement under the immunity statute for the imposition of those restrictions. PTPN\u2019s subsequent enforcement of its geographic restrictions arid its modification of those restrictions in response to Blue Cross\u2019s need for additional providers also is excluded from antitrust enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>under the immunity statute because it is conduct aimed at maintaining the efficient size of the contracting unit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">3. <em>Liability Under the Unfair Competition Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">In addition to alleging that PTPN\u2019s and Blue Cross\u2019s conduct violates the Cartwright Act, plaintiffs allege that conduct violates the unfair competition law. They argue on appeal that even if their Cartwright Act claim fails, they have stated an unfair competition claim because the conduct they allege violates the policy or spirit of the Cartwright Act and therefore is \u201cunfair\u201d under Business and Professions Code section 17200. They are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">In <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527], the Supreme Court discussed the scope of the unfair competition law: \u201cAlthough the unfair competition law\u2019s scope is sweeping, it is not unlimited. Courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair. Specific legislation may limit the judiciary\u2019s power to declare conduct unfair. If the Legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie, courts may not override that determination. When specific legislation provides a \u2018safe harbor,\u2019 plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">As we have explained, the Legislature expressly authorized or exempted from antitrust enforcement the conduct alleged in this case. It is from the Legislature or the Department of Managed Health Care that plaintiffs must seek their desired remedy. The courts are not empowered to overrule the Legislature\u2019s judgment in these matters. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling granting PTPN\u2019s and Blue Cross\u2019s motions for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">The judgment is affirmed.

The trial court granted those motions with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint containing minor revisions. Noting there was little difference between the first and second amended complaints, the trial court deemed the original motions for judgment on the pleadings to be motions directed to the second amended complaint, and allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs. The parties did so, and the court subsequently granted the motions without leave to amend and entered judgment against plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b983-6\"> The Legislature\u2019s reference to the creation of a \u201cnew product\u201d is in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 332 [73 L.Ed.2d 48, 102 S.Ct. 2466], to which the Legislature cited in Business and Professions Code section 16770, subdivision (e). In <em>Maricopa, </em>the Supreme Court held that groups of physicians who agreed to maximum fee schedules for reimbursement by insurance companies committed per se antitrust violations. The Supreme Court rejected the provider groups\u2019 reliance on <em>Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 1 [60 L.Ed.2d 1, 99 S.Ct. 1551] for the proposition that their fee schedules involved price fixing only in a literal sense and did not constitute illegal price fixing. The court in <em>Maricopa </em>explained that in <em>Broadcast Music, </em>the blanket license that was offered was an entirely new product that was different from the product an individual composer could offer, whereas the provider groups in <em>Maricopa </em>were offering the same product\u2014medical services\u2014but simply were offering them at a fixed price. <em>(Maricopa, supra, </em>457 U.S. at pp. 355-357 [73 L.Ed.2d 48, 102 S.Ct. 2466].) By referring in the immunity statute to the provider groups as a \u201cnew product,\u201d the Legislature emphasized that the formation of those groups to offer services at fixed prices would not constitute illegal price fixing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b984-7\"><em> </em>Those regulations are found in title 28 of the California Code of Regulations, and include detailed requirements related to patient accessibility to services and geographic accessibility standards. (See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1300.67.2, 1300.67.2.1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\"> The statute defines \u201creasonable consideration\u201d as \u201cconsideration in good faith of the terms of proposals for affiliation prior to the time that contracts for alternative rates of payment are entered into or renewed. A plan may specify the terms and conditions of affiliation to assure cost efficiency, qualification of providers, appropriate utilization of services, accessibility, convenience to persons who would receive the provider\u2019s services, and consistency with the plan\u2019s basic method of operation, but shall not exclude providers because of their category of license.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1373.9, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b985-8\"> We note that a subscriber might be willing to pay the additional cost to be treated by a non-PTPN member if that physical therapist offered services that were sufficiently better or better suited for the subscriber. Thus, plaintiffs may still compete on the basis of quality or innovation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b987-6\"> For example, if two or more groups each formed contracting units and agreed that only one group would negotiate with each insurer, that conduct could be subject to antitrust enforcement. There is no such conduct alleged in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b988-8\"> In light of our holding that the immunity statute exempts PTPN\u2019s imposition of geographic restrictions on its members from antitrust enforcement, we need not address whether plaintiffs allege <em>antitrust </em>injury arising from those restrictions\u2014i.e., whether the alleged territorial market allocation restrains competition in the relevant market, the negotiation to become a Blue Cross preferred provider. (See, e.g., <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc. </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 477, 489 [50 L.Ed.2d 701, 97 S.Ct. 690] [antitrust plaintiff must establish <em>\u201cantitrust </em>injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
