Luis signed an arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>agreement when admitting his wife, Josephina, into Evergreen\u2019s skilled nursing facility. We conclude Luis did not have authority to bind his wife to the arbitration agreement. Accordingly, we affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In May 2004, Josephina Flores, who was suffering from dementia and other ailments, was admitted to Evergreen\u2019s skilled nursing facility. As part of the admission process, Luis Flores, Josephina\u2019s husband, signed various documents provided by Evergreen. These included two arbitration agreements. The arbitration agreements provide for the use of arbitration in lieu of a lawsuit to resolve medical malpractice claims and other disputes arising from the facility\u2019s provision of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">When a patient is admitted to a skilled nursing facility, the patient or the patient\u2019s representative must sign a standard admission agreement. (Health &amp; Saf. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1599.61, subd. (a).) If the facility requests that the patient agree to arbitration, this provision cannot be included in the standard admission agreement. Instead, it must be set forth in a separate document with a separate signature line. (\u00a7 1599.81, subd. (b).) Consistent with this statutory mandate, the arbitration agreements signed by Luis were on forms separate from the admission agreement. The signature lines on the arbitration agreements state: \u201cLegal Rep/Responsible Party/Agent.\u201d On the admission agreement, Luis signed a line designated \u201c[a]gent\u201d; on other admission documents he signed lines variously designated \u201c[l]egal [Representative\u201d or \u201c[Responsible [p]arty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">At the time he signed these documents, Luis did not have a power of attorney to act for Josephina, nor had he been declared her conservator or guardian. Approximately nine months later, in February 2005, Josephina signed a power of attorney giving Luis authority over a variety of matters, including \u201c[c]laims and [l]itigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">On August 22, 2005, Josephina and Luis filed a civil complaint against Evergreen, alleging negligence and several other causes of action. According to the allegations in the complaint, on January 19, 2005, Evergreen staff allowed Josephina to fall to the floor, resulting in a leg fracture, and then failed to provide her medical treatment for approximately 24 hours. Luis pleaded a loss of consortium cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>In December 2005, based on the arbitration agreements signed by Luis, Evergreen- filed a petition to compel arbitration. The Floreses opposed the petition, asserting that Luis \u201cdid <em>not </em>have any legal authority to waive [Josephina\u2019s] right to trial by jury by allegedly signing an arbitration agreement.\u201d The Floreses asserted that Luis\u2019s authority on behalf of his wife extended only to making medical decisions for her as provided under California law, and that waiver of a jury trial is not a medical decision. Evergreen responded that given his wife\u2019s dementia, Luis represented himself as his wife\u2019s agent, as shown by his conduct of signing all the admission papers on her behalf, and that Josephina \u201callowed [Evergreen] to believe that [Luis] had the authority to act on her behalf.\u201d Evergreen also asserted that Luis\u2019s status as Josephina\u2019s spouse gave him authority to act as her agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In January 2006, the trial court denied Evergreen\u2019s petition to compel arbitration. The court reasoned there was \u201cno evidence that the purported principal (Josephina Flores) did anything which caused [Evergreen] to believe that her husband was her agent,\u201d and thus the \u201cfact that Luis Flores purportedly signed the admission papers on her behalf is irrelevant.\u201d The court also rejected Evergreen\u2019s assertion that Luis\u2019s spousal status conferred authority on him to agree to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The party seeking to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence <em>of </em>a valid arbitration agreement. <em>(Garrison v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 253, 263 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 350] <em>(Garrison); Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 972 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903]; <em>Pagarigan v. Libby Care Center, Inc. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 298, 301 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 892] <em>(Pagarigan).) </em>Petitions to compel arbitration are resolved by a summary procedure that allows the parties to submit declarations and other documentary testimony and, at the trial court\u2019s discretion, to provide oral testimony. <em>(Engalla, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 972; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1281.2, 1290.2.) If the facts are undisputed, on appeal we independently review the case . to determine whether a valid arbitration agreement exists. <em>(Garrison, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 263; <em>Buckner v. Tamarin </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 140, 142 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Evergreen asserts the trial court erred in denying its petition to compel arbitration because Luis\u2019s status as Josephina\u2019s spouse gave him authority to bind her to the arbitration agreements. Reviewing general agency principles and statutory authority governing nursing homes, we conclude that absent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>legislative directive, the spousal relationship alone is insufficient to confer authority to agree to an arbitration provision in a nursing home admission contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">A. <em>Agency Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Generally, a person who is not a party to an arbitration agreement is not bound by it. <em>(Buckner </em>v. <em>Tamarin, supra, 98 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 142.) However, there are exceptions. For example, a <em>patient </em>who signs an arbitration agreement at a health care facility can bind relatives who present claims arising from the patient\u2019s treatment. <em>(Mormile v. Sinclair </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1508, 1511-1516 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 725]; <em>Bolanos v. Khalatian </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1586, 1591 [283 Cal.Rptr. 209].) Further, a person who is authorized to act as the patient\u2019s <em>agent </em>can bind the patient to an arbitration agreement. <em>(Garrison, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 264-266; see <em>Buckner, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 142.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In <em>Garrison, </em>the court held that a daughter who had a durable power of attorney to make health care decisions for her mother could bind her mother to an arbitration agreement in a residential care facility\u2019s admission documents. <em>(Garrison, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 265.) The <em>Garrison </em>court reasoned that the decision whether to accept an arbitration provision in the admission documents was \u201cpart of the health care decisionmaking process\u201d authorized in the durable power of attorney for health care. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Here, Josephina did not sign the arbitration agreements; thus, this is not a case where a <em>signatory </em>patient binds his or her spouse who asserts a claim derived from the patient\u2019s care. Further, unlike the situation in <em>Garrison, </em>at the time Luis signed the arbitration agreements he did not have a power of attorney authorizing him to act as Josephina\u2019s agent. Thus, there was no written instrument conferring agency power on Luis.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Even when there is no written agency authorization, an agency relationship may arise by oral consent or by implication from the conduct of the parties, <em>(van\u2019t Rood v. County of Santa Clara </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 549, 571 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 746].) However, an agency cannot be created by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>conduct of the agent alone; rather, <em>conduct by the principal </em>is essential to create the agency. Agency , \u201ccan be established either by agreement between the agent and the principal, that is, a true agency [citation], or it can be founded on ostensible authority, that is, some intentional conduct or neglect on the part of the alleged principal creating a belief in the minds of third persons that an agency exists, and a reasonable reliance thereon by such third persons.\u201d <em>(Lovetro </em>v. <em>Steers </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 461, 474-475 [44 Cal.Rptr. 604]; see Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2298, 2300.) \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe principal must in some manner indicate that the agent is to act for him, and the agent must act or agree to act on his behalf and subject to his control.\u201d. . .\u2019 [Citations.] Thus, the \u2018formation of an agency relationship is a bilateral matter. Words or conduct by <em>both principal and agent </em>are necessary to create the relationship ....\u2019\u201d <em>(van\u2019t Rood, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 571, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Applying these principles, in <em>Pagarigan, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at pages 301-302, the appellate court affirmed the denial of a nursing home\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, finding there was no evidence that a comatose mother had authorized her daughters to act as her agents to bind her to a nursing home arbitration agreement. <em>Pagarigan </em>rejected the nursing home\u2019s contention that the daughters\u2019 act of signing the agreements created agency status, explaining that conduct by the <em>principal </em>was necessary to show the agency. (Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In its arguments to the trial court, Evergreen asserted that Josephina allowed it to believe her husband had authority to act for her. However, Evergreen presented no evidence to support this claim. Evergreen presented evidence that Josephina suffers from dementia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and other ailments, that she was admitted to Evergreen, and that her husband signed the admission documents on her behalf. Although Evergreen presented evidence regarding Luis\u2019s conduct, it failed to offer evidence regarding <em>Josephina\u2019s </em>conduct. The record is completely silent regarding Josephina\u2019s and Luis\u2019s dealings prior to her admission and/or their interactions at the time of her admission. The mere fact Luis signed the admission documents, including the arbitration agreements, is insufficient. Likewise, the fact that Josephina signed a general power of attorney form in February 2005 giving Luis agency authority does not provide the necessary evidentiary support. The power of attorney was created <em>after </em>Luis signed the admission documents in May 2004, and no facts were presented suggesting that by signing the power of attorney form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Josephina intended to ratify Luis\u2019s earlier agreement to the arbitration. (See <em>Rakestraw </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 67, 73 [104 Cal.Rptr. 57, 500 P.2d 1401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Even though Evergreen presented evidence showing that Luis acted as if he were Josephina\u2019s agent, the establishment of the agency also requires conduct on the part of Josephina conferring that status. It was Evergreen\u2019s burden to show the validity of the arbitration agreement based on Josephina\u2019s express or implied consent to have her husband act as her agent. As in <em>Pagarigan, </em>the record is devoid of any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Evergreen\u2019s second argument to the trial court (and its primary argument on appeal) is premised on the claim that Luis\u2019s status as Josephina\u2019s spouse was sufficient to confer agency status on him. Evergreen asserts Luis\u2019s spousal status distinguishes this case from <em>Pagarigan, </em>which involved two daughters purporting to act on behalf of their mother. To support its assertion that the spousal relationship creates agency status, Evergreen relies on the fiduciary and support duties owed between spouses, including the duty to provide medical care. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7 4300 [general duty to support spouse]; <em>Hawkins v. Superior Court, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.3d at pp. 418-419 [duty to support spouse includes provision of health care].) Although we agree that spouses are fiduciaries and owe a duty of support in the family law context, these duties do not create a power to contractually bind each other in the agency context. \u201c[I]t is well established that an agency cannot be implied from the marriage relation alone.\u201d <em>(Lovetro v. Steers, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.2d at p. 475; see <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dopp </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 765, 783 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 768]; <em>Avedissian v. Manukian </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 379, 385 [190 Cal.Rptr. 291].) We recognize that \u201cit is also true that much less evidence is required to establish a principal and agent relationship between husband and wife than between nonspouses.\" <em>(Lovetro, supra, </em>at p. 475.) Here, however, Evergreen presented <em>no </em>evidence of agency apart from the marital relationship. Although the establishment of an agency relationship between spouses does not require a high level of proof, the Floreses\u2019 marital relationship cannot alone create an agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>B. <em>Statutory Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Evergreen also asserts that Luis\u2019s authority to admit Josephina to the nursing facility and to make medical decisions for her gave him the authority to agree to arbitration on her behalf. Evergreen\u2019s contention is based on several statutes enacted by the Legislature that permit next of kin to make certain decisions for mentally incompetent nursing home patients. The assertion raises the issue of whether, independent , of agency principles, there is a <em>statutory </em>basis for the authority to agree to arbitration based solely on kinship.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The Legislature has promulgated a detailed and comprehensive statutory scheme governing nursing homes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This statutory scheme includes provisions giving family members the authority to make medical decisions and to enforce a patient\u2019s bill of rights on behalf of a mentally incompetent patient; a statute providing for the signing of an admission contract by a third party when a prospective patient is mentally incompetent; and a series of provisions permitting arbitration provisions in nursing home contracts but imposing rigorous disclosure requirements and excluding certain claims from arbitration coverage. Although the Legislature has specifically conveyed authority over medical decisionmaking and enforcement of rights to family members, it has not conveyed authority over the arbitration decision to family members. We view this as a significant omission, and accordingly conclude there is no statutory authorization for a person to agree to arbitration based solely on a familial relationship with the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\n<em>Statutory and Regulatory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Section 1418.8 sets forth the procedures for a physician to order medical interventions when a nursing home patient is incapable of giving informed consent and there is no person with legal authority to make the decisions for the patient. The statute defines persons with legal authority to make medical decisions as those \u201cdesignated under a valid Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, a guardian, a conservator, <em>or next of kin.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1418.8, subd. (c), italics added.) Similarly, statutory and regulatory enactments defining a bill of rights for nursing home patients provide for enforcement of the rights by \u201cnext of kin\u201d when the patient cannot understand the rights. Section 1599.1 enumerates a bill of rights to ensure such matters as adequate qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>staffing, good personal hygiene, and sufficient nutrition. Section 1599.3 provides that when a patient is incompetent, unable to understand the information, or exhibiting a communication barrier, the bill of rights \u201cshall devolve to such patient\u2019s guardian, conservator, [or] <em>next of kin </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Regulation 72527 in title 22 of the California Code of Regulations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> incorporates the section 1599.1 rights and delineates additional rights, such as the rights to participate in the plan of care, to consent to or refuse medical treatment, and to manage personal financial affairs. (Cal. Code Regs., \u00a7 72527, subd. (a)(3), (4), (8), (24).) This regulation provides that if a patient lacks the ability to understand these rights, the rights devolve to the patient\u2019s representative, and defines a patient\u2019s representative as including a conservator, a person designated in a durable power of attorney for health care, and <em>\u201cnext of kin </em>. . . .\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., \u00a7 72527, subds. (c), (d), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The Legislature has also enacted a statute addressing the situation when a prospective nursing home patient is unable to understand and sign the admission contract. Section 1599.65, subdivision (a) provides that upon a patient\u2019s admission to a long-term care facility, the facility must explain the admission contract to a mentally competent patient and obtain his or her signature. The section states that if the patient is unable to understand the contract and cannot sign, the physician must document this fact in the patient\u2019s file. The section contains a caveat stating that the provision does \u201cnot preclude the facility from obtaining the signature of <em>an agent, responsible party, or a legal representative, if </em>applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.) The section does not define who qualifies as \u201can agent, responsible party, or a legal representative\u201d authorized to sign the admission contract, nor does it define the scope of authority possessed by these signatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Finally, there are a plethora of statutes and regulations to ensure that an arbitration agreement in a nursing home contract is obtained with the patient\u2019s informed consent and limiting the matters that may be covered by such an arbitration agreement. Section 1599.81 requires that a nursing home admission contract clearly indicate that an arbitration agreement is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>precondition for admission or treatment, and requires that the arbitration clause be \u201con a form separate from the rest of the admission contract\u201d and contain space for the applicant\u2019s signature. (\u00a7 1599.81, subds. (a)-(b).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 1430, subdivision (b) precludes a nursing home patient from waiving the right to sue for alleged violations of the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights or other statutory or regulatory rights. Section 1599.81, subdivision (d) requires that a nursing home admission contract containing an arbitration provision include a notice that the patient cannot waive the right to sue for a bill of rights violation. Regulation 72516 requires that any arbitration agreement presented to a prospective nursing home resident contain an advisory \u201cin a prominent place at the top of the proposed arbitration agreement, in bold-face font of not less than 12 point type,\u201d stating that the arbitration agreement is not required as a condition of admission and that it cannot waive the ability to sue for a violation of the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights. Code of Civil Procedure section 1295, which is applicable to nursing homes, requires that an arbitration agreement governing professional negligence of a health care provider state, immediately before the patient\u2019s signature line and in 10-point bold red type, that the party is giving up the right to a jury or court trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1295, subds. (b), (g)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The question presented is whether the Legislature intended that its definition of a patient representative as including \u201cnext of kin\u201d for purposes of medical decisions and bill of rights enforcement, be engrafted onto the authorized contract signatories identified in section 1599.65, and, if so, whether the next of kin authority extends to the arbitration decision. Facially, the status of agent, legal representative, or responsible party would not arise merely because of kinship. Using the ordinary meaning of these terms (see <em>Pang v. Beverly Hospital, Inc. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 994 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 643]), an agent is a person to whom the principal has delegated authority; a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>legal representative is a person who has acquired authority through the legal process (i.e., a guardian or conservator); and a responsible party in the health care context is a person who assumes personal liability for the patient\u2019s bills <em>(Podolsky </em>v. <em>First Healthcare Corp. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 632, 645 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 89]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Although a mere familial relationship would not normally suffice to give a person formal representative status, as a matter of practical necessity there are certain decisions that must be made for a mentally incompetent nursing home patient even when there is no formal representative. The Legislature recognized this reality when it specified next of kin as among the persons authorized to make medical decisions and enforce the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights. It is likely the Legislature also intended to allow next of kin to sign a nursing home contract for the limited purpose of <em>admitting </em>a mentally incompetent relative to the facility, even if the family member did not technically qualify as an agent, legal representative or responsible party. As with medical decisions, admission of a mentally incompetent patient to a nursing home is sometimes necessary even when there is no person with recognized legal authority to act on behalf of the patient.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">However, we cannot conclude the Legislature intended to include the <em>arbitration </em>decision as among the matters that may be decided by next of kin when signing a nursing home admission contract. In <em>Pagarigan, </em>the court held that although next of kin of a mentally incompetent patient were statutorily defined as persons authorized to make medical decisions and to exercise the patient\u2019s rights at the facility, this authority did not \u201ctranslate^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>into authority to sign an arbitration agreement on the patient\u2019s behalf at the request of the nursing home.\u201d <em>(Pagarigan, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 302; see also <em>Goliger v. AMS Properties, Inc. </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 374, 377 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 819] [mentally competent mother\u2019s conduct of allowing daughter to make health care decisions did not justify expanding daughter\u2019s powers to include arbitration decision].) Absent a legislative directive to the contrary, we agree with this holding in <em>Pagarigan </em>and find it equally applicable to spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Even though the Legislature has extensively regulated the issue of arbitration in nursing home contracts, and in other contexts has specified that next of kin may make significant decisions for mentally incompetent patients, it has failed to specify that next of kin have authority to agree to arbitration. Unlike admission decisions and medical care decisions, the decision whether to agree to an arbitration provision in a- nursing home contract is not a necessary decision that must be made to preserve a person\u2019s well-being. Rather, an arbitration agreement pertains to the patient\u2019s legal rights, and results in a waiver of the right to a jury trial. (See <em>Kleveland v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 761, 764 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 314]; <em>Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9-11 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Because arbitration agreements waive important legal rights, the Legislature has imposed heightened requirements on arbitration provisions in nursing home contracts. Notably, the Legislature has required that arbitration agreements be separate from the rest of the admission contract and contain separate signatures. Thus, when a family member signs an admission agreement, this signature cannot by law also cover an arbitration agreement. Given the Legislature\u2019s extensive regulation of arbitration agreements, combined with the facts that an arbitration agreement waives legal rights and is not necessary to preserve health, we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended <em>by implicdtion </em>to extend authority over the arbitration decision to next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Because the record shows no express or implied agency created by Josephina, and because there is no statutory authority for Luis to act on Josephina\u2019s behalf when signing an arbitration agreement, the trial court properly deified Evergreen\u2019s petition to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The order is affirmed.

However, the supporting cases cited in these decisions do not stand for such a broad proposition, but arise in situations where the spouse who was the patient bound the other spouse to arbitration of claims arising from the medical treatment, or a spouse who purchased insurance bound the other spouse who accepted the benefits of the policy. (See <em>Bolanos v. Khalatian, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1591; <em>Gross v. Recabaren </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 771, 781 [253 Cal.Rptr. 820]; <em>NORCAL Mutual Ins.

(See \u00a7\u00a7 1250, subd. (c), 1326, 1418, subd. (a)(1), 1430, subd. (b), 1599, 1599.60, subd.

Unless the prospective resident has been declared legally incompetent or is unable to understand and sign the contract because of his or her medical condition, he or she shall sign or cosign the admission agreement. In the event the patient is unable to sign the contract, the reason shall be documented in the resident\u2019s medical record by the admitting physician. This provision does not preclude the facility from obtaining the signature of an agent, responsible party, or a legal representative, if applicable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> Section 1599.81 states: \u201c(a) All contracts of admission that contain an arbitration clause shall clearly indicate that agreement to arbitration is not a precondition for medical treatment or for admission to the facility, [fj (b) All arbitration clauses shall be included on a form separate from the rest of the admission contract. This attachment shall contain space for the signature of any applicant who agrees to arbitration of disputes. [10 (c) On the attachments, clauses referring to arbitration of medical malpractice claims, as provided for under Section 1295 of the Code of Civil Procedure, shall be clearly separated from other arbitration clauses, and separate signatures shall be required for each clause, [f] (d) In the event the contract contains an arbitration clause, the contract attachment pertaining to arbitration shall contain notice that under Section 1430, the patient may not waive his or her ability to sue for violation of the patient\u2019s bill of rights.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> The record does not show that Luis qualified as a signatory under section 1599.65 based on the facial meaning of the terms. As we discussed earlier, there is no evidence that Luis qualified as an agent under well-established agency principles, nor had he acquired legal representative status through such avenues as guardianship or conservatorship. Although he signed various admission documents designating him as a \u201cresponsible party,\u201d there is no document in the record stating that he was assuming personal liability for Josephina\u2019s bills. Given the factual posture of this case, we need not decide whether the Legislature intended that a responsible party should have authority to make the arbitration decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> Consistent with this view, the Department of Health Services has developed a standard admission agreement that is required to be used by nursing homes (\u00a7 1599.61, subd. (a)), which refers to family members as authorized to sign the agreement. (See Cal. Code Regs., \u00a7 73518, subd. (a) [incorporating by reference the standard admission agreement].) The standard admission agreement instructs the patient that if he or she is unable to sign the agreement the patient\u2019s representative may sign it. The agreement defines the patient\u2019s representative as <em>\u201ca family member, </em>or by law, any of the following: a conservator, a person designated under the Resident\u2019s Advance Directive or Power of Attorney for Health Care, <em>the Resident\u2019s next of kin, </em>any other person designated by the Resident consistent with State law, a person authorized by a court, or, if the Resident is a minor, a person authorized by law to represent the minor.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
