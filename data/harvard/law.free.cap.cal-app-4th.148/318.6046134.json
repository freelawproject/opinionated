We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">In 1984, the Los Angeles County juvenile court\u2019s caseloads increased so rapidly that many additional lawyers were needed to represent minors and others subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, thus triggering section 44.7 of article IX of the Los Angeles County Charter, which provides: \u201cNothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>this Article shall prevent the County, when the Board of Supervisors finds that work can more economically or feasibly be performed by independent contractors, from entering into contracts for the performance of such work.\u201d In response to the caseload crisis, the board authorized \u201cas-needed\u201d contracts with lawyers for the juvenile court, and lawyers (including Danna Hall and others included in our references to Hall) entered contracts with the county in which they were designated as \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In June 1989, county counsel informed the board that the juvenile court\u2019s caseloads had stabilized so that it would be \u201cadministratively more efficient to acquire the needed [attorney] services through a single employer-provider,\u201d and asked the board to approve the formation of Auxiliary Legal Services, Inc. (ALS), to provide \u201clegal and related services to supplement necessary services\u201d provided by county counsel. County counsel told the board that \u201ca new infrastructure [was] needed to enable the County to continue to cost effectively manage and maintain [a] professional corps of service providers without increasing the number of permanent classified County employees.\u201d The board adopted county counsel\u2019s proposals, ALS was created, and the county and ALS then entered a contract pursuant to which ALS agreed to provide lawyers in \u201csuch number ... as [were] from time to time requested\u201d to work \u201cunder the direction and control of County Counsel.\u201d Under the terms of the contract, ALS was an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and the people provided by ALS were to be \u201cemployees solely of [ALS] and not of [the] County for any purpose.\u201d Hall became an ALS employee and was thereafter paid by ALS.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In 1999, Hall filed a class action against ALS, county counsel, and the county, alleging in her subsequently amended complaint that the \u201cthree defendants [were] \u2018joint employers\u2019 or a \u2018single enterprise,\u2019 \u201d and that ALS was merely a \u201cpayrolling scheme\u201d that enabled county counsel to maintain a \u201ctwo-tier [attorney] work force\u201d notwithstanding that all lawyers did the same work under the same working conditions. As characterized by Hall, her \u201clawsuit \u2018is a federal and state equal pay act and . . . sex discrimination case brought on behalf of a class of about 200 women attorneys channeled by the County into the predominantly female [ALS] unit while receiving substantially less pay and benefits than the predominantly male . . .\u201cofficial\u201d [county counsel] employee unit.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(Feb. 9, 2005, B170447) [nonpub. opn.].) Hall alleged claims under the federal and state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Equal Pay Acts (EPA; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) et seq.; Lab. Code, \u00a7 1197.5) and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA; Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">ALS, county counsel, and the county answered, conducted discovery, then moved for summary judgment, contending there were separate applicant pools for ALS and county counsel; that the hiring decisions were based on merit, not gender; that although there were more female lawyers at ALS than county counsel, both groups were gender-integrated; that there were no gender-based barriers to entry into either group; and that similarly situated males and females within each group were treated the same in terms of pay and benefit^.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of its motion, the County presented the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">During the relevant time, the highest differential between female and male lawyers at ALS was 71 percent female, 29 percent male; the lowest differential at county counsel was 22 percent female, 78 percent male. Similarly situated male and female lawyers at ALS were treated the same in terms of salary and benefits, and similarly situated male and female lawyers at county counsel were treated the same in terms of salary and benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Between 1989 and 1999, there were more than 30 competitive examinations open to outside applicants (including ALS employees) for positions with county counsel. Notices of the exams were posted and otherwise publicly disseminated, and all qualified applicants were allowed to take the exams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>(which consisted of an oral interview, prior experience, education, and the other usual factors). An eligibility list was created and all attorney positions\u2014181 (58 percent of whom were female, 42 percent male)\u2014were filled from that list.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The county presented evidence to show that county counsel\u2019s lawyers were paid more than ALS lawyers \u201cdue to cost-savings,\u201d not gender\u2014the very reason ALS was created back in 1989, as shown by the documents presented to and created by the board of supervisors, which entered into the contract with ALS because it was \u201can economical and cost effective way to provide . . . supplemental legal services and representation for its officers and employees and for minors in dependency court proceedings.\u201d Indeed, the county\u2019s \u201cauditor controller\u201d had opined in 1989 that the ALS contract would result in \u201c[ajlmost two million dollars in annual costs savings\u201d to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Hall opposed the motion, contending that county counsel\u2019s \u201cpervasive control of ALS\u201d meant the ALS lawyers were county counsel\u2019s \u201ccommon law\u201d employees and, as such, entitled to be paid \u201cin accordance with civil service compensation rules.\u201d Instead, claimed Hall, ALS\u2019s female lawyers were paid lower salaries and given fewer benefits than their male civil service counterparts. Although Hall said she disputed the county\u2019s evidence, the county\u2019s objections to portions of her evidence were sustained (and she does not challenge those rulings on this appeal). As a result, there were no disputed material facts, and the trial court granted the county\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The EPA exists to ensure that employees performing equal work are paid equal wages without regard to gender. To prove a violation of that basic principle, a plaintiff must establish that, based on gender, the employer pays different wages to employees doing substantially similar work under substantially similar conditions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If that prima facie showing is made, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>shifts to the employer to prove the disparity is permitted by one of the EPA\u2019s statutory exceptions\u2014here, that the disparity is based on a factor other than sex. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1); Lab. Code, \u00a7 1197.5, subd. (a); <em>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 188, 195 [41 L.Ed.2d 1, 94 S.Ct. 2223]; <em>E.E.O.C. v. Maricopa Cty. Community College Dist. </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 736 F.2d 510, 513.) If an exception is established, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove pretext. <em>(Maxwell v. City of Tucson </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 803 F.2d 444, 446.) As the party moving for summary judgment, the County had to establish, by undisputed evidence, that Hall could not prove one or more elements of her claim, or that it had a complete defense. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. <em>(o), </em>(p)(2); <em>Martin v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1730-1731 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 181].)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Hall contends county counsel is her \u201ccommon law\u201d employer and that, therefore, the appropriate \u201ccomparator\u201d (the person or group to whom the comparison is made) is male county counsel lawyers who earn more than she does.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree with the county that, even assuming Hall is viewed as an employee of county counsel, she is using the wrong comparator and that the appropriate comparator is male ALS lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">To establish her prima facie case, Hall had to show not only that she is paid lower wages than a male comparator for equal work, but that she has selected the proper comparator. \u201cThe EPA does not require perfect diversity between the comparison classes, but at a certain point, when the challenged policy effects [sic] both male and female employees equally, there can be no EPA violation. [Citation.] [A plaintiff] cannot make a comparison of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>classification composed of males and females with another classification of employees also composed of males and females.\u201d <em>(Arthur </em>v. <em>College of St. Benedict </em>(D.Minn. 2001) 174 F.Supp.2d 968, 976; see <em>Hofmister v. Mississippi State Dept. of Health </em>(S.D.Miss. 1999) 53 F.Supp.2d 884, 891 [the \u201clegislative history of the EPA shows that differences in pay between groups or categories of employees that contain both men and women within each group or category are not covered by the EPA\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>Schulte v. State of New York </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1981) 533 F.Supp. 31, a woman sued the state for wage discrimination, contending she and a predominantly female class of \u201cpsychiatric social workers\u201d (70 percent female, 29 percent male) performed substantially the same work for less pay than the predominantly male class of \u201cpsychologists\u201d (67 percent male, 31 percent female). <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 33, 37-38.) The state responded with evidence that although psychologists earned more than social workers, male and female social workers were paid the same wages and afforded the same benefits, and male and female psychologists were paid the same wages and afforded the same benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 37-38.) The court held that because there was \u201csuch a substantial representation of the \u2018minority sex\u2019 within each job classification, ... the fact that they [were] paid different salaries [did] not establish sex discrimination because the EPA was not] [][]... [][] . . . intended to address the situation where the employer pays different wages to two different job classifications, each of which include both men and women.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 38-39; see also <em>Arthur v. College of St. Benedict, supra, </em>174 F.Supp.2d at p. 976; <em>Beall v. Curtis </em>(M.D.Ga. 1985) 603 F.Supp. 1563.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Because undisputed evidence establishes that, at any given time, ALS and county counsel both employed a substantial number of women and that, within ALS, women were paid the same as men, there is no basis for Hall\u2019s use of a male county counsel lawyer as a comparator. For this reason alone, Hall\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law. <em>(Strag </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(4th Cir. 1995) 55 F.3d 943 [failure to identify an appropriate comparator means the plaintiff has not set forth a prima facie case].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Assuming that Hall could justifiably compare ALS female lawyers to county counsel male lawyers, summary judgment was proper because the undisputed evidence establishes that the wage disparity between ALS and county counsel was based on an acceptable business reason, which is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>recognized \u201cfactor other than sex.\u201d <em>(Kouba v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 691 F.2d 873, 874-876; <em>Green v. Par Pools, Inc., supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th at pp. 629-630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The county\u2019s undisputed evidence established that county counsel\u2019s use of independent contractors was authorized by the county\u2019s charter as a gender-neutral cost-saving measure, and that the contract with ALS was entered \u201cto develop an economical and cost effective way to provide . . . supplemental legal services.\u201d At a time when there were few job openings at county counsel due to hiring freezes and other budgetary constraints (only about 180 openings between 1989 and 1999), ALS provided an employment option for more than 250 people\u2014who in accepting positions with ALS knew they were not becoming civil service employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Assuming (as Hall insists) that county counsel is Hall\u2019s common law employer, the two-tier wage and benefits system is not discriminatory because there was a legitimate and nondiscriminatory cost-savings purpose for ALS\u2019s' existence. <em>(Prieto </em>v. <em>City of'Miami Beach </em>(S.D.Fla. 2002) 190 F.Supp.2d 1340, 1351-1354; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>College of St. Benedict, supra, </em>174 F.Supp.2d at pp. 980-981; <em>Aldrich v. Randolph Cent. School Dist. </em>(2d Cir. 1992) 963 F.2d 520.) Accordingly, summary judgment was proper on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Hall contends her FEHA claims for sex-based wage discrimination raise disparate treatment and disparate impact issues that were not properly resolved by summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">To establish a prima facie case of disparate <em>treatment, </em>Hall was required to show membership in a protected class, qualification for the position at issue, adverse employment action, and at least an inference of intentional discrimination from facts showing that the county chose the particular policy because of its effect on members of a protected class, not just that the county was aware that a given policy would lead to adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>consequences for a given group. <em>(Hemmings v. Tidyman\u2019s Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 285 F.3d 1174; <em>Heard v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 1748; <em>Forsberg </em>v. <em>Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 840 F.2d 1409, 1418.) To establish a prima facie case of disparate <em>impact, </em>Hall was required to show that, regardless of the county\u2019s motive, a facially neutral practice or policy bearing no relationship to job requirements had a disproportionate adverse effect on members of the protected class. <em>(Carter v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1321 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 519].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Hall did not establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment or disparate impact because she did not present any evidence to show that the county created ALS because of its effect on female lawyers (or even that the county was aware that the use of independent contractors would lead to adverse consequences for female lawyers), or any evidence to show that the creation of ALS had a disproportionate adverse effect on women.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">If we nevertheless assume for the sake of argument that Hall <em>had </em>made the required showing, it was met with the county\u2019s undisputed evidence of a legitimate and gender-neutral business reason for its actions (cost savings). Hall\u2019s claim that she showed pretext is not borne out by the record. Although her expert opined (based on his statistical analysis) that \u201cthe disparity in hiring between women into ALS versus [county counsel] is so significant that it can only be explained by external factors, i.e., bias,\u201d there was no evidence that ALS\u2019s lawyers (male or female) were precluded from applying to county counsel for posted positions (it is undisputed that ALS\u2019s female lawyers did not face any barriers in applying for positions with county counsel), and no evidence to suggest that ALS\u2019s contract or compensation decisions were the result of gender bias.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the trial court found, there was no evidence of pretext. <em>(Lang </em>v. <em>Kohl\u2019s Food Stores, Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 2000) 217 F.3d 919, 923 [identical jobs with different wages do not violate title VII if all employees may freely select which job to perform]; <em>Lindale </em>v. <em>Tokheim Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1998) 145 F.3d 953, 958 [there must be a causal connection between gender and pay].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The judgment is affirmed.
