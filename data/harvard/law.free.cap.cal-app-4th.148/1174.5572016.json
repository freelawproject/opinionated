Plaintiffs Norma Fonseca and Terry Wilson sued the City of Gilroy and its city council<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to, among other things, set aside the City\u2019s 2002 general plan on the basis that its housing element does not meet or substantially comply with the requirements of the \u201cHousing Element Law\u201d codified at Government Code sections 65580 through 655S9.8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, plaintiffs, who are appellants here, reprise their challenge to the City\u2019s 2002 housing element. Specifically, they contend that Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element: (1) violates section 65583, subdivision (a)(3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in that it does not contain an inventory of available residentiary zoned land identified by parcel or site, and it also fails to provide the required analysis of these sites; (2) violates former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), in that it does not identify adequate housing sites that will be made available to meet Gilroy\u2019s allocated share of the regional housing need at all income levels for the 2001 through 2006 planning period; and (3) violates former section 65583, subdivision (c)(l)(A)(i), in that it does not alternately provide sufficient housing sites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>that are zoned to permit multifamily residential use \u201cby right\u201d in order to otherwise meet the regional housing need.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Plaintiffs further contend that Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element violates the \u201cLeast Cost Zoning Law,\u201d codified at section 65913 et seq., in that it fails to zone sufficient residential sites at appropriate densities to facilitate the development of the regional housing need at each income level\u2014read the lower income levels\u2014during the current planning period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">While many of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments concerning the Housing Element Law are logical in terms of the law\u2019s ultimate goals\u2014the promotion and facilitation of affordable housing\u2014these arguments require us to go beyond the stated terms of the applicable statutory language and, in effect, rewrite it. The Legislature made amendments to the Housing Element Law in 2004 after Gilroy\u2019s adoption of its 2002 general plan to read, in essence, as plaintiffs contend we should read the prior law. In other words, plaintiffs\u2019 arguments largely point not to legal insufficiencies in Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element but instead to inadequacies and inefficacies in the prior statutory language, which, by these gaps, failed to adequately facilitate enforcement of the objectives of the Housing Element Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">As noted, recent statutory revisions appear to have addressed the particular vagaries at issue here. Since 2005, the Housing Element Law has required the detail and specificity, particularly regarding the land inventory and identification of adequate sites to meet the locality\u2019s housing needs, which plaintiffs seek to impose on Gilroy with respect to its 2002 housing element. (See \u00a7\u00a7 65583, 65583.2; Stats. 2004, ch. 724, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3.) Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that these statutory changes merely \u201cclarified\u201d existing law, and that we should apply prior law as the revisions now read. In light of the Housing Element Law as it existed in 2002 and the actual language of former section 65583, as well as the boundaries of judicial review that limit our analysis to whether Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element substantially complies with that statute, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">We likewise reject their contentions concerning Gilroy\u2019s lack of compliance with the Least Cost Zoning Law. In sum, this is so because Gilroy\u2019s 2002 general plan substantially complied with the Housing Element Law that was in effect at the time the plan was adopted. And Gilroy was not required to rezone (in order to facilitate increased high-density housing) in 2002 upon its adoption of that general plan, or immediately thereafter, as plaintiffs contend. The Least Cost Zoning Law does not set such a deadline and instead contemplates rezoning by a public entity pursuant to its general plan within the five-year planning period covered by that plan. Gilroy\u2019s plan sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>describes rezoning efforts to be undertaken to accommodate low-income housing within this five-year period such that it complies with the Least Cost Zoning Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">We accordingly affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">GENERAL LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">We begin with a general legal overview in order to place the issues in proper context. The Housing Element Law, like the Least Cost Zoning Law, is one component of state laws affecting land use, which is otherwise largely a local function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">I. <em>The Source of Local Authority\u2014The Police Power</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Under the California Constitution, a \u201ccounty or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7.) This authority is often referred to as the police power. (75 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 239, 240 (1992); see, e.g., <em>Candid Enterprises, Inc. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 878, 885 [218 Cal.Rptr. 303, 705 P.2d 876].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">The police power is broad. As the California Supreme Court has stated: \u201cUnder the police power granted by the Constitution, counties and cities have plenary authority to govern, subject only to the limitation that they exercise this power within their territorial limits and subordinate to state law. (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7.) Apart from this limitation, the \u2018police power [of a county or city] under this provision ... is as broad as the police power exercisable by the Legislature itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Candid Enterprises, Inc. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist., supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 885.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">It is from this fundamental power that local governments derive their authority to regulate land through planning, zoning, and building ordinances, thereby protecting public health, safety and welfare. <em>(Berman v. Parker </em>(1954) 348 U.S. 26, 32-33 [99 L.Ed. 27, 75 S.Ct. 98]; see generally Curtin, Cal. Land Use and Planning Law (26th ed. 2006) pp. 1-4; Hagman et al., Cal. Zoning Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1969) \u00a7\u00a74.14, 4.16, pp. 112-113; <em>id. </em>(Cont.Ed.Bar 2005 supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 4.14, 4.16, pp. 231-232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">II. <em>State Planning Laws and the General Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">While the police power is the constitutional source of local governments\u2019 land use authority, the framework for the exercise of that power is provided by the state\u2019s land use planning statutes. (\u00a7\u00a7 65100-65910; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number><em>L.I.F.E. Committee v. City of Lodi </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1139, 1148 [262 Cal.Rptr. 166]; Curtin, Cal. Land Use and Planning Law, <em>supra, </em>p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Among other things, state planning law requires adoption of a general plan. (\u00a7 65300.) In the universe of local land use enactments, the general plan is \u201cat the top of \u2018the hierarchy of local government law regulating land use.\u2019 \u201d <em>(DeVita </em>v. <em>County of Napa </em>(1995). 9 Cal.4th 763, 773 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 889 P.2d 1019] <em>(Devito).) </em>Our state\u2019s high court has described \u201cthe function of a general plan as a \u2018constitution,\u2019 \u201d and has labeled it the \u201c \u2018basic land use charter governing the direction of future land use\u2019 \u201d in the locality. <em>(Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540, 542 [277 Cal.Rptr. 1, 802 P.2d 317]; see also, e.g., <em>DeVita, supra, </em>at p.,773.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Local land use decisions must be consistent with the general plan. Thus, for example, zoning ordinances, which are subordinate to the general plan, are required to be consistent with it. (\u00a7.65860, subd. (a); <em>Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 541.) The same is true of other local activities affecting land use, such as tentative maps or development agreements. (Curtin, Cal. Land Use and Planning Law, <em>supra, </em>p,. 10.) \u201cUnder state law, the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.\u201d <em>(Resource Defense Fund </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz-(1982) </em>133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806 [184 Cal.Rptr. 371].) \u201cSince consistency with the general plan is required, absence of a valid general plan, or valid relevant elements or components thereof, precludes enactment of zoning ordinances and the like.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe general plan consists of. a \u2018statement of development policies .\u25a0 . . setting forth objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals.\u2019 (. . , \u00a7 65302.) The plan must include seven elements\u2014land use, circulation, conservation, housing, noise, safety and open space\u2014and address each of these elements in whatever level of detail local conditions require <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 65301).\u201d <em>(DeVita, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 773.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">ITT. <em>The Housing Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Declaring affordable housing \u201ca priority of the highest order\u201d and one not merely a local concern but a matter of. \u201cvital statewide importance,\u201d the Legislature in 1980 enacted legislation to require each local government to adopt a \u201chousing element\u201d as a component of its general plan. (\u00a7\u00a7 <em>65580, </em>subd. (a), 65581, subd. (b), 65582, subd. (d).) According to the Housing Element Law, a public locality\u2019s general plan \u201cmust include a housing element consisting of several mandatory components.\u201d <em>(Black Property Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 974, 978 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 305] <em>(Black).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>\u201cThe housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. The housing element shall identify adequate sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, and mobilehomes, and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.\u201d (\u00a7 65583.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">The housing element must contain a five-year program to \u201cimplement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the housing element through the administration of land use and development controls.\u201d (\u00a7 65583, subd. (c).) Formerly, the program must also have identified adequate sites with services and facilities that would be made available for \u201cthe development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels -. . . in order to meet the community\u2019s housing goals . . . .\u201d (Former \u00a7 65583, subd. (c)(1)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The housing element must further include an inventory of sites suitable for residential development and an analysis of the zoning, public facilities, and services available for those sites. (\u00a7 65583, subd. (a)(3).) If the inventory of sites does not identify adequate sites to accommodate the need for housing of persons of all income levels,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the five-year program must provide for sufficient sites to be zoned for multifamily residential use to accommodate very-low- and low-income households. (Former \u00a7 65583, subd. (c)(l)(A)(i); see now \u00a7 65583.2, subd. (h).) If the total housing needs exceed the available resources and the community\u2019s ability to satisfy the need, the quantified objectives need not equal the need but must be the maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved for each income category over a five-year period. (\u00a7 65583, subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Thus, the five-year program must identify a sufficient number of sites that will be made available through appropriate zoning and development standards to meet the quantified objectives for housing for all income levels. And if the program does not identify sufficient sites to satisfy the need for housing for all income levels, it must in any event identify sufficient sites to be zoned for multifamily housing for low- and very-low-income residents. (Former \u00a7 65583, subd. (c)(l)(A)(i); see now \u00a7 65583.2, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">In creating its housing element, the local government is required to consider the advisory guidelines adopted by the state\u2019s Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>Housing and Community Development (the Department). (\u00a7 65585, subd. (a).) The locality is also required to submit draft housing elements or amendments to the Department prior to adoption. (\u00a7 65585, subd. (b).) The Department, in turn, must review drafts and make written findings as to whether the draft substantially complies with the requirements of article 10.6. (\u00a7 65585, subds. (b), (d).) The local government must then consider the Department\u2019s findings. (\u00a7 65585, subd. (e).) If the findings reflect noncompliance in the Department\u2019s judgment, the locality must either change the draft, so that it substantially complies with article 10.6, or adopt the draft without changes, explaining why the draft substantially complies despite the Department\u2019s findings. (\u00a7 65585, subd. (f)(1), (2).) Under section 65589.3, the housing element (or its amendment) enjoys a rebuttable presumption of validity if the Department makes a finding that it substantially complies with the requirements of article 10.6. (\u00a7 65589.3.) The statute does not provide for the converse, i.e., there is no presumption of invalidity on the basis of the Department\u2019s finding of noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">After each local government adopts its general plan, it \u201cmust review its housing element periodically to evaluate the community\u2019s progress toward attainment of local and state housing goals and objectives, among other factors.\u201d <em>(Black, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 978.) By legislative edict, \u201cthe housing element \u2018shall\u2019 be reviewed as frequently as necessary to evaluate certain enumerated factors\u201d subject to the statutory schedule for revisions. <em>(Garat v. City of Riverside </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259, 296 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 504], overruled on another ground in <em>Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 743 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143].) As provided in section 65588, subdivision (b): \u201cThe housing element shall be revised as appropriate, but not less than every five years, to reflect the results of this periodic review.\u201d But the statute contains an overriding provision, subdivision (e), which governs specified localities. It states: \u201cNotwithstanding subdivision (b) or the date of adoption of the housing elements previously in existence, each city, county, and city and county shall revise.its housing element according to the following schedule: [][]... [j[] (2) Local governments within the regional jurisdiction of the Association of Bay Area Governments: December 31, 2001, for the third revision, and June 30, 2007, for the fourth revision.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 65588, subd. (e).)  These timetables for revision of the housing element have been held to be directory, not mandatory. <em>(San Mateo County Coastal Landowners\u2019 Assn. v. County of San Mateo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 523, 544 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 117] [the timetable set by \u00a7 65588 is directory rather than mandatory and mere noncompliance with the schedule does not operate to automatically invalidate a housing element or, by extension, a general plan].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">IV. <em>Initial Review of a Housing Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\"><em>A </em>local government\u2019s housing element, or any portion thereof, may be challenged by \u201cany interested party\u201d by a traditional mandamus action filed in the superior court under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. (\u00a7 65587, subd. (b).) The court\u2019s review \u201cshall extend to whether the housing element or portion thereof or revision thereto substantially complies with the requirements of [the Housing Element Law].\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c 1 \u201c \u2018Substantial compliance . . . means <em>actual </em>compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018mere technical imperfections of form.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Buena Vista Gardens Apartments Assn. v. City of San Diego Planning Dept. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 289, 298 [220 Cal.Rptr. 732] <em>(Buena Vista); </em>see <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348 [176 Cal.Rptr. 620].) Simply stated, \u201cjudicial review of a housing element for substantial compliance with the statutory requirements does not involve an examination of the merits of the element or of the wisdom of the municipality\u2019s determination of policy.\u201d <em>(Black, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 980.) It merely involves a determination whether the housing element includes the statutory requirements. <em>(Buena Vista, supra, </em>at pp. 298, 306 [court looks only to ensure that the requirements of \u00a7 65583 are met, not whether the programs adopted are adequate to meet their objectives or are the programs the court thinks ought to be there].) Under section 65587 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, then, the court\u2019s role in determining a mandamus challenge to a locality\u2019s housing element is simply to determine whether the locality has satisfied statutory requirements. It is not to reach the merits of the element or to interfere with the exercise of the locality\u2019s discretion in making substantive determinations and conclusions about local housing issues, needs, and concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">V. <em>The Least Cost Zoning Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Echoing the purposes of the Housing Element Law to promote the development of affordable housing, in 1980, the Legislature also enacted the Least Cost Zoning Law, section 65913 et seq. These changes in the law were intended to be \u201cconsistent with the responsibility of local government to adopt the program required by\u201d section 65583, subdivision (c). (\u00a7 65913, subd. (a).) The changes were also expressly designed to: \u201c[e]xpedite the local and state residential development process\u201d; (2) \u201c[a]ssure that local governments zone sufficient land at densities high enough for production of affordable housing\u201d; and (3) \u201c[a]ssure that local governments make a diligent effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>through the administration of land use and development controls and the provision of regulatory concessions and incentives to significantly reduce housing development costs and thereby facilitate,the development of affordable housing . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Section 65913.1 states in relevant part that \u201c[i]n exercising its authority to zone for land uses and in revising its housing element. . . , a city, county, or city and county shall designate and zone sufficient vacatit latid for residential use with appropriate standards, in relation to zoning for nonresidential use, and in relation to growth projections of the general plan to meet housing needs for all income categories as identified in the housing element of the general plan.\u201d (\u00a7 65913.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Thus, section 65913.1 governs land use designation and zoning while section 65583 governs the housing element of a general plan. The two statutes were intended to work in concert. (\u00a7 65913, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"A5O\">I. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">As noted, under section 65588, each local government within the regional jurisdiction of ABAG, of which Gilroy is one, was to prepare and adopt a revised and updated housing element by December 31, 2001, to cover the period January 1, 2002, to June 30, 2007. Gilroy\u2019s allocated regional \u201cfair share\u201d of affordable housing to be accommodated during the period from 1999 through June 2007 included 1,240 new lower income housing units\u2014 906 units affordable to very-low-income households and 334 units affordable to low-income households. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>In accordance with the Department\u2019s mandatory review of its proposed housing element under section 65585, Gilroy submitted a draft housing element accompanied by a \u201cHousing Background Report\u201d to the Department in December 2001. According to the City, the Housing Background Report is a part of the housing element. The Department reviewed the documents and found the draft housing element to be out of compliance with state law. The Department notified the City of its findings by letter dated March 1, 2002, and accompanying appendix of specific comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Gilroy adopted the draft housing element without change on June 13, 2002,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and again submitted it to the Department for review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Department then completed its formal review of the adopted housing element under section 65585. In October 2003, the Department issued its written determination that the adopted element did not substantially comply with the Housing Element Law, for the same reasons that the Department had considered the previously submitted draft to be noncompliant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">In May 2003, before the Department issued this determination, and prior to the City\u2019s formal adoption of its housing element, the City had submitted to the Department comments and proposed revisions to its draft housing element, which were intended to be responsive to the Department\u2019s initial March 2002 review. These materials included proposed revisions to the land inventory and a table of vacant and underutilized land with parcel-level data for sites within the general plan area but outside the city limits and the urban service area. The City also submitted supplemental materials at some later point. And third parties, including the Public Interest Law Firm, California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc.,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the California Affordable Housing Law Project, submitted comments to the Department as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">After its review of the proposed amendments, the supplemental materials, and third party comments, in December 2003, the Department notified the City by letter that while some of the City\u2019s responses had addressed some of the Department\u2019s concerns as outlined in its March 2002 review, further revisions to the housing element were necessary in order to render it compliant with state law from the Department\u2019s perspective. The Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>specifically concluded, in reliance on its \u201cQuestions and Answers\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as guidelines, that \u201cthe element should identify adequate sites and demonstrate the realistic development capacity and potential of sites for all income groups, further analyze and mitigate governmental constraints, and strengthen certain programs.\u201d The Department\u2019s letter was accompanied by an appendix that addressed these issues in further detail and identified, from the Department\u2019s point of view, what changes in the housing element were needed to bring it into legal compliance. Included among these identified shortcomings were those of which plaintiffs complained below\u2014the failure to include a site-specific inventory of land demonstrating adequate sites to accommodate Gilroy\u2019s affordable housing need and the failure to provide analysis and removal of governmental constraints to the construction of affordable housing on those sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">II. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Plaintiffs, each of whom is alleged to be a current or former resident of Gilroy who cannot obtain affordable housing in that locale, filed their verified petition for writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 in May 2004.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They filed an amended petition a few months later.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The amended petition contained eight causes of action, only the first two of which pertain to this appeal. The first cause of action was entitled \u201cwrit of mandate to compel the preparation and adoption of a legally sufficient housing element.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.) It challenged Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element in numerous respects, only three of which are again raised here\u2014 inadequate land inventory and analysis of sites in violation of section 65583, subdivision (a)(3); failure to identify adequate sites for very-low- and low-income housing development in violation of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A); and failure to include any program to allow very-low- and low-income housing development by right in violation of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">The second cause of action was entitled \u201cwrit of mandate to compel compliance with the Least Cost Zoning Law,\u201d and it challenged Gilroy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>alleged lack of compliance with sections 65913 and 65913.1 by the failure to \u201cdesignate and zone sufficient land at sufficient densities and with appropriate standards to accommodate the housing needs of very-low and low-income households.\u201d Below and here, plaintiffs\u2019 essential challenge on the basis of the Least Cost Zoning Law concerns whether Gilroy\u2019s rezoning plans, expressed as part of its housing element revisions, satisfy the law in terms of both the affirmative obligation to rezone and the time within which that obligation must be met. Plaintiffs contend that under the Least Cost Zoning Law, a public entity must \u201cdiligently\u201d rezone upon the adoption of a new housing element so that the actual construction of affordable housing as contemplated by the zoning changes can be accomplished within the planning period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Plaintiffs sought their writ of mandate on the first two causes of action through a noticed motion procedure in the court below. The City answered the petition and filed opposition to the requested relief. Before the court on the motion were, among other things, Gilroy\u2019s 2002 general plan, its adopted housing element (one component of the general plan); the accompanying Housing Background Report; portions of Gilroy\u2019s zoning ordinance; the then current version of the Department\u2019s Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s, which contain its interpretations of statutory requirements; and written revisions, comments, and communications between Gilroy and the Department concerning the Department\u2019s recommendations and the City\u2019s efforts to satisfy the Department that the element substantially complied with the Housing Element Law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The trial court heard argument and then issued a written ruling denying the \u201cPetition/Motion.\u201d The court\u2019s stated rationale in support of its ruling was that: \u201cGilroy\u2019s Housing Element substantially complies with the requirements set out in the Government Code. <em>[(Hernandez </em>v. <em>City of Encinitas </em>(1994)] 28 Cal.App.4th 1048, 1058 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 875].)] Gilroy is not in violation of the Least Cost Zoning law. Gilroy is implementing its plan for Neighborhood Districts during the planning period.\u201d The parties later entered into a stipulation whereby the City would waive costs, plaintiffs would dismiss their remaining causes of action without prejudice, and a \u201cfinal\u201d judgment would be entered in favor of the City on the first two causes of action. The dismissal and judgment were later entered as contemplated by the stipulation. Plaintiffs then appealed from the \u201corder denying their motion for writ of mandate . . . and from the final judgment. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">I. <em>Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">The primary issue on appeal is whether Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element substantially complies with the version of the state Housing Element Law in effect in 2002. More specifically, the questions presented are whether Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-6\">(1) contains an \u201cinventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites\u201d in substantial compliance with section 65583, subdivision (a)(3);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">(2) contains a program setting forth a five-year schedule of actions that Gilroy is undertaking or intends to undertake to \u201c[i]dentify adequate sites which will be made available through appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities . . . needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels in order to meet the community\u2019s [identified] housing goals . . .\u201d in substantial compliance with former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-8\">(3) if failing to provide an inventory of sites under Section 65583, subdivision (a)(3) that identifies sufficient sites to accommodate the housing need for groups of all income levels, does the housing element nevertheless provide for \u201csufficient sites with zoning that permits . . . multifamily residential use by right, including density and development standards that could accommodate and facilitate the feasibility of housing for very low and low-income households\u201d in substantial compliance with former section 65583, subdivision (c)(l)(A)(i). '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">The secondary issue on appeal concerns the question of Gilroy\u2019s compliance with the Least Cost Zoning Law\u2014i.e., has the City \u201cdesignate^] and zone[d] sufficient vacant land ... to meet housing needs for all income categories as identified in the housing element\u201d in compliance with section 65913.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\"><em>Challenge to the City\u2019s Housing </em>Element<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">We have already addressed the standards applicable to the trial court\u2019s mandamus review of a challenge to the legal adequacy of a housing element under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and section 65587, subdivision (b). On appeal, we independently ascertain as a question of law whether the housing element at issue substantially complies with the requirements of the Housing Element Law, substantial compliance meaning \u201c \u2018 \u201c <em>\u2018actual </em>compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018mere technical imperfections of form.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 298; see <em>Camp v. Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 348; <em>Black, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 980.) In our independent review of the housing element\u2019s legal adequacy, we afford no deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusions. (Ga<em>rat v. City of Riverside, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 292; <em>Buena Vista, supra, </em>at p. 298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">On the other hand, a city\u2019s adoption of a housing element is a legislative enactment, something which is generally entitled to some deference. There is a presumption that the adopted element is valid and we do not in the course of our review evaluate the municipality\u2019s determination of policy. <em>(Garat v. City of Riverside, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 292; <em>Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 298; <em>Black, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 980.) The burden is on the challenger to demonstrate that the housing element, and by extension the general plan, is inadequate. <em>(Garat v. City of Riverside, supra, </em>at p. 293.) If the municipality has substantially complied with statutory requirements, we will not interfere with its legislative action, unless that action was arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support. <em>(Hoffmaster v. City of San Diego </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1105-1106 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 684] <em>(Hoffmaster); Hernandez </em>v. <em>City of Encinitas, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1059 <em>(Hernandez); Garat </em>v. <em>City of Riverside, supra, </em>at pp. 292-293; <em>Buena Vista, supra, </em>at p. 298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">Accordingly, like the trial court, we do not review the merits of the housing element at issue or assess the wisdom of the municipality\u2019s determination of policy. <em>(Black, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 980.) Nor do we judge whether the programs adopted by the locality are adequate to meet their stated objectives. <em>(Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at pp. 298, 306.) Our review thus comes down to independently determining whether the housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>element at issue is in substantial compliance with applicable statutory requirements, i.e., does it contain the elements mandated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">The parties offer differing views on the weight we are to afford in the course of our review to the Department\u2019s interpretation of statutory requirements of the Housing Element Law, as reflected in its Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s. Plaintiffs posit that judicial respect for the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Housing Element Law is mandated by general principles of administrative law under <em>Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 12 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031] <em>(Yamaha), </em>and that we should accordingly give great weight to the Department\u2019s \u201cstatements that (a) the inventory [required by section 65583, subdivision (a)(3)] must \u2018identify <em>specific </em>sites suitable for residential development,\u2019 not merely undifferentiated acreages; and (b) the identification of adequate sites [pursuant to former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A)] \u2018must [occur] soon enough in the planning period to reasonably permit development during the planning period.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The City, on the other hand, argues that as a matter of law, no authority requires judicial deference to the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Housing Element Law and that the independent standard of judicial review which we apply under section 65587, subdivision (b), affirmatively precludes such deference.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">In <em>Yamaha, </em>the California Supreme Court addressed the question of the deference to be applied to a state agency\u2019s informal interpretation of a statute in contrast to that afforded to regulations adopted by an agency under quasi-legislative authority expressly delegated by the Legislature. While quasi-legislative regulations are of binding force as statements of the law, commanding judicial deference and receiving limited judicial review, an agency\u2019s informal interpretation of a statute is entitled to considerably less judicial deference, the courts being the constitutional arbiters of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>meaning. <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 7-15.) \u201c \u2018The standard for judicial review of agency interpretation of the law is the <em>independent judgment </em>of the court, giving <em>deference </em>to the determination of the agency <em>appropriate </em>to the circumstances of the agency action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 8.) We accordingly take \u201c \u2018ultimate responsibility for the construction of the statute, according] great weight and respect to the administrative construction. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 12.) But the extent of judicial weight to be afforded is necessarily contextual and \u201cfundamentally <em>situational. </em>A court assessing the value of an interpretation must consider a complex of factors material to the substantive legal issue before it, the particular agency offering the interpretation, and the comparative weight the factors ought in reason to command.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">There are two categories of factors that are relevant to a court\u2019s assessment of the weight to be afforded to an agency\u2019s informal statutory interpretation. First, there are factors indicating a comparative interpretive advantage the agency has over the court due to, for example, the agency\u2019s authorship of the regulation at issue or the technical nature of the legal text under consideration. The second category includes factors indicating that the agency\u2019s interpretation of a rule is likely to be correct, such as the agency\u2019s adoption of a rule pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\u00a7 11340 et seq.) after notice and an opportunity for public comment, or its long-standing maintenance of the interpretation in question. <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 12.) A few of these factors favoring judicial deference are indeed present here. Still, the Department\u2019s informal interpretation of statutory requirements is in no way binding on us and the weight to which we afford it depends ultimately on our assessment of its reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Moreover, as recognized by the Court of Appeal in <em>Buena Vista, </em>in determining the legal adequacy of a housing element, the roles of the Department and the courts differ. \u201cThe Department reviews not only to ensure the requirements of [section] 65583 are met, but also to make suggestions for improvements. . . . However, a court looks only to ensure the requirements of [section] 65583 are met and not whether, in the court\u2019s judgment, the programs adopted are adequate to meet their objectives or are the programs which the court thinks ought to be there. While this court may be of the opinion City should adopt Department\u2019s recommendations, <em>the Legislature has stated its recommendations are advisory. </em>(\u00a7 65585, subd. (a).)\u201d <em>(Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 306.) We think these distinct roles ought to be reflected in the weight we afford to the Department\u2019s statutory interpretation of the Housing Element Law, as reflected in its Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">While we acknowledge that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Housing Element Law\u2019s legal meaning and effect is the product of the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>having regularly dealt with these statutes falling within its administrative jurisdiction, we still must exercise our independent duty to state the meaning of the statutes at issue here, giving consideration to the Department\u2019s views. \u201cCourts must, in short, independently judge the text of the statute, taking into account and respecting the agency\u2019s interpretation of its meaning, of course, whether embodied in a formal rule or less formal representation. Where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue, an agency\u2019s' interpretation is one among several tools available to the court. Depending on the context, it may be helpful, enlightening, even convincing. It may sometimes be of little worth. [Citation.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 7-8.) Thus, the weight we afford here to the Department\u2019s Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s is in accordance with our view of the substantive merits of the Department\u2019s statutory interpretation. And to the extent plaintiffs\u2019 contentions mirror the Department\u2019s interpretation of relevant aspects of the Housing Element Law in the Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s, our analysis necessarily considers those merits.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">\n<em>A. Gilroy\u2019s Adopted 2002 Housing Element Substantially</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">\n<em>Complies with the Requirements of the Housing Element Law As Previously in Effect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">1. <em>Section 65583, subdivision (a)(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">Section 65583 initially provides: \u201cThe housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. The housing element shall identify adequate sites for- housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, and mobilehomes, and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.\u201d Subdivision (a)(3) goes on to require that the housing element contain \u201c[a]n assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs. The assessment- and inventory shall include ... [][]... [f] .. . <em>[a\\n inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant .sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 65583, subd. (a)(3), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">The gist of plaintiffs\u2019 primary contention is that Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element failed to even substantially comply with section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), because the element, while providing an aggregate inventory of what the City identified as vacant sites and sites potentially available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>development, did not identify any specific sites or provide analysis of zoning and facilities in relation to those identified specific sites. This contention rests on the further assertion that the language of the statute, its interpretation by the Department in the Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s, and case law all mandated a statutory construction of this subdivision that required a site-specific inventory of land suitable for development, accompanied by site-specific analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">The City, for its part, contends that its housing element substantially complied with the statute because at the time, there was no requirement that the inventory identify <em>specific </em>sites both suitable for residential development and available to meet the housing needs and, thus, an aggregate listing or summary of vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment with general analysis of zoning and facilities was all that was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">We agree with the City that prior to amendments to the Housing Element Law in 2004, there was no legislative enunciation of the level of detail or specific information required in the land inventory, other than what the language of former section 65583 itself provided. As we read the statute, neither this subdivision nor any other section of the Housing Element Law included a requirement that the land inventory comprise more than a listing of aggregate acreages in .the various categories or that it be parcel or site specific. The word \u201cinventory,\u201d as used in the general sense employed in the statute does not necessarily imply, as plaintiffs would have it, that a detailed item-by-item list is called for. \u201cStock,\u201d as in the quantity of materials on hand, is all that the land inventory in this context spoke to, in the absence of a statutory directive for further or more detailed criteria.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The statute thus required the inventory to include \u201cvacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment,\u201d but did not require it to specifically identify each of such sites'. (\u00a7 65583, subd. (a)(3).) Given the absence of a site-specific requirement for the land inventory itself, the further analysis \u201cof the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites,\u201d also called for by this subdivision likewise did not require site specificity. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Instead, prior to the 2004 amendments to the Housing Element Law, substantial compliance with section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), required only general analysis of zoning and public facilities to the'inventoried sites, as catalogued or Usted in the aggregate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Our reading of what section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), previously required of the land inventory and accompanying analysis is confirmed by the 2004 statutory amendments to the Housing Element Law, effective 2005, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>according to the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest, would <em>\u201crevise </em>the criteria for the inventory of sites.\u201d (Stats. 2004, ch. 724, 2d par.; Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 2348 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.), italics added.) Among these statutory changes is the addition of section 65583.2, which includes newly detailed requirements for the land inventory mandated by section 65583, subdivision (a)(3). According to the new statute, the inventory must now include a \u201clisting of properties by parcel number or other unique reference,\u201d \u201c[t]he size of each property\u201d and the \u201cgeneral plan designation and zoning of each property,\u201d \u201c[a] map that shows the location of the sites included in the inventory,\u201d and for nonvacant sites, \u201ca description of the existing use of each property.\u201d (\u00a7 65583.2, subd. (b)(1), (2), (3), (7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">This new section also makes clear that the general descriptions of \u201cany environmental constraints to the development of housing within the jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cexisting or planned water, sewer, and other dry utilities supply, including the availability and access to distribution facilities,\u201d both of which are now specifically required for the inventory, need not \u201cbe identified on a site-specific basis.\u201d (\u00a7 65583.2, subd. (b)(4) &amp; (5).) Thus, the new statute, while\" for the first time mandating an identification of the designated zoning of each site within the inventory, expressly does not require this same specificity with respect to public facilities and services. We conclude from this that the analysis of these infrastructure issues] as previously required under section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), likewise was not required to be site specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Plaintiffs characterize the 2004 statutory changes to the Housing Element Law as \u201cclarifying\u201d amendments, and they point to two Assembly Committee reports relating to the proposed amendments to suggest that the land inventory mandated by section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), the text of which remains the same, has always required site specificity. In comments, both reports say that then current or existing law (i.e., pre-2005) required \u201chousing elements to include a land inventory <em>identifying sites </em>suitable for residential development by income level.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Appropriations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2348 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended April 16, 2004, p. 2, italics added; Assem. Com. on Local Government, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2348 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended April 16, 2004, p. 2.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, both reports, like the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest, also recognize that many of the statutory amendments proposed by Assembly Bill No. 2348 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) indeed would constitute changes to the law and that such changes would impose uniform and specific content requirements for the land inventory for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>In any event, the statutory amendments themselves do not state that they are merely declarative of existing law. And even when legislative amendments do so state, a later Legislature\u2019s expression that statutory amendments are only intended to clarify what an earlier Legislature enacted are neither binding nor conclusive on courts, which are ultimately vested with the task of statutory interpretation. Coming at a time before our high court\u2019s definitive interpretation of a particular statute, such a legislative expression is merely entitled to \u201cconsideration\u201d as a factor in a court\u2019s construction of the statute.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>(Carter v. California Dept. of Veterans Affairs, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 922.) A court engaged in statutory construction looks to \u201call pertinent circumstances and considerations in deciding whether an amendment is a modification or clarification of a statute.\u201d <em>(People v. Franklin </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 249, 256 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 975 P.2d 30].) And particularly when there is no definitive \u201cclarifying\u201d expression by the Legislature in the amendments themselves, we will presume that a substantial or material statutory change, as occurred here by the addition of section 65583.2 alone, bespeaks legislative intention to change, and not just clarify, the law. <em>(Reidy v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 580, 592 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 894]; <em>Garrett v. Young </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1393, 1404-1405 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 134].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">There is a dearth of case law construing the inventory requirement of section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), either before or after the 2004 amendments to the Housing Element Law. Plaintiffs cite <em>Hoffmaster </em>as authority for the proposition that this part of the statute has always required a site-specific land inventory. But the court in <em>Hoffmaster </em>did not so hold. That case construed only the adequate sites requirement of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1), as the land inventory requirement of subdivision (a)(3) was not in issue. In contrasting what it viewed as the differing specificity mandates between these two subdivisions with the adequate site requirement commanding more, the <em>Hoffmaster </em>court even referred to the land inventory as \u201csimply that which is <em>generally required </em>under section 65583, subdivision (a)(3).\u201d <em>(Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1112, italics added, fn. omitted.) Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Hoffmaster </em>as authority for a pre-2005 site-specific inventory requirement under section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The City, in turn, relies on <em>Buena Vista </em>and <em>Hernandez </em>for its contention that section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), does not require the land inventory to be site specific. As in <em>Hoffmaster, </em>the issues before the court in <em>Buena Vista </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>did not involve the land inventory or judicial construction of the requirements of section 65583, subdivision (a)(3). In fact, all the issues raised in <em>Buena Vista </em>involved the various requirements of the then current iteration of section 65583, subdivision (c). <em>(Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at pp. 298-299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">The court in <em>Hernandez </em>was dealing with a challenge to the City of Encinitas\u2019s housing element that asserted, among other things, that the element did not \u201cinclude an inventory of land as required by section 65583(a)(3) . . . .\u201d <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1062.) The challenge more specifically contended that the subject housing element, while addressing vacant and underdeveloped sites, still only amounted to \u201c \u2018[a] simpl[e] catalogue of] the vacant acres already zoned residential (2434-acres),\u2019 and there [had been] no \u2018manifest attempt\u2019 to identify otherwise suitable land such as vacant or \u2018infill\u2019 sites presently zoned commercial and no consideration given to mixed use potential, such as, for example, rental apartments.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Based on the court\u2019s discussion of the contents of the Encinitas housing element, we cannot tell if that element included, an inventory that was site specific. It' appears, as plaintiffs contend, that the challenge in <em>Hernandez </em>to the land inventory was not based on its lack of site specificity per se, but, instead, on its incompleteness. Still, the characterization by the <em>Hernandez </em>plaintiffs of the Encinitas inventory as a mere \u201c \u2018catalogue of] the vacant acres already zoned residential\u2019 \u201d at least suggests criticism for a lack of site specificity. <em>(Ibid.) </em>And in upholding the trial court\u2019s rejection of the challenge to the housing element, the <em>Hernandez </em>court referred to and discussed what were apparently only generalized descriptions in the land inventory. These facts lead us to infer that the inventory in <em>Hernandez </em>was not site specific.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In any event, the court did not expressly decide that the land inventory required by section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), need not be site specific. It did not even discuss this particular question in its resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Despite not having the benefit of another court\u2019s construction of the land inventory requirement of section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), based on both the language of the statute and the significant 2004 Housing Element Law amendments affecting it, we conclude that prior to the 2004 amendments, neither the land inventory, nor its accompanying analysis, was required to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>site specific. In so concluding, we acknowledge plaintiffs\u2019 overarching point that without site specificity in the land inventory, the ultimate goals of the Housing Element Law of promoting and increasing the available stock of affordable housing in this state are more difficult to achieve. We also recognize as a practical matter that meaningful enforcement of the Housing Element Law, in all its component parts, may have been undermined without, among other things, a requirement of more specificity in the land inventory mandated by section 65583, subdivision (a)(3).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Legislature, whose function it is to write the statutes, has apparently recognized this fact too, prompting its enactment of the 2004 amendments to the Housing Element Law, which in part address, in significant detail, the specificity of the land inventory. But the fact remains that in this case, we are dealing with the state of the Housing Element Law before those amendments, and we must construe, rather than rewrite, the statutes as we.see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">In light of our construction of section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), we now examine Gilroy\u2019s land inventory and assessment, as provided in its 2002 housing element through the Housing Background Report as revised December 2001, to determine whether Gilroy substantially complied with the then applicable legal requirements of the statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The parties do not dispute that the housing element contains an \u201cassessment of housing needs\u201d as required by section 65583, subdivision (a). But as noted, the statute goes on to require \u201can inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs,\u201d which includes an \u201cinventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>these sites.\u201d (\u00a7 65583, subd. (a)(3).) Based on the parties\u2019 opposing interpretations of this latter language, an issue we have resolved in the City\u2019s favor, they dispute whether the element substantially complies with it.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Section 7 of the Housing Background Report, entitled \u201cDevelopment Potential and Evaluation of Constraints,\u201d provides an inventory and discussion of aggregated vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment. This includes a narrative review, which acknowledges a shortage of already zoned land within the city limits for the development of higher density housing, and a table (7-1). The table \u201csummarizes the vacant residentially zoned lands in the City based upon (1) an inventory of vacant lands and the City\u2019s current zoning; and (2) additional lands to be designated for higher density development based on implementation of the Neighborhood Districts [<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]and rezoning based on the Land Use Plan Map of the Draft General Plan. An update of the Zoning Map and Zoning Ordinance (Action 1.A) and the Neighborhood Districts Implementation Strategy (Action l.C) are identified as two of the General Plan\u2019s highest priority items in Chapter 10 of the Draft General Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The table indicates that there had been 43 vacant acres already zoned R3, the second highest density designation, and that 48 additional acres would be added to this zoning category as a result of rezoning, for a total of 91 vacant acres zoned R3 that would potentially yield 1456 total housing units. The table further indicates that there had been zero vacant acres already zoned R4, the highest density designation, and that 39 additional vacant acres would be added to this zoning category as a result of rezoning, potentially yielding 1170 high-density housing units.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In terms of sheer numbers, this is purportedly and facially sufficient to accommodate Gilroy\u2019s remaining allocated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>ABAG fair share of low- and very-low-income housing units for the planning period\u2014882\u2014and then some.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">As for infrastructure analysis of the vacant lands available for residential development as shown in table 7-1, the Housing Background Report notes that \u201call are contained within the City limits and therefore within the City\u2019s Urban Service Area. While the full range of services and facilities do not currently exist in some of the larger planned areas for residential development (especially in the southeast portion of the City), the City and other agencies (e.g., Gilroy Unified School District) have master planned the entire area and will be implementing necessary facility and infrastructure improvements to support future residential development in these areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">The Housing Background Report goes on to discuss a number of \u201copportunities for redevelopment of under-utilized properties.\u201d It further addresses additional mechanisms to increase \u201cMultiple Family Development Potential,\u201d including through the update of the Gilroy zoning map, implementation of the Neighborhood Districts program, encouragement of mixed use development in the downtown area, the identification and encouragement of infill development, development of accessory units, and the establishment of minimum density limits in each residential land use category, all of which are projected to yield additional medium- and high-density housing units.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Finally, the Housing Background Report notes that in the past, \u201cinfrastructure issues\u2014specifically limited wastewater treatment capacity\u2014ha[ve] been an obstacle to development in Gilroy, resulting in a significant reduction in housing development activity in the 1980s and early 1990s. Since completion of the new wastewater treatment facility, development activity has surged. [1] At this time and for the foreseeable future, there are no infrastructure constraint issues that will limit housing development. However, infrastructure issues continue to be a major concern for community residents and city officials, particularly the timing of infrastructure, facility and service improvements with new development. These concerns are reflected in the General Plan policies, the City\u2019s and School District\u2019s development impact fees, and the Residential Development Ordinance\u2014all of which attempt to manage the rate and location of growth; ensure that new development helps pay for the costs of new infrastructure needed to support it; and ensure that levels of service are maintained as new development is completed.\u201d Under the next heading entitled \u201cPotential Government Constraints,\u201d the Housing Background Report goes on to discuss these impact fees and the residential development ordinance in greater detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>We conclude that these portions of the City\u2019s Housing Background Report, notwithstanding the lack of site specificity, demonstrate substantial compliance with section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), of the Housing Element Law as it existed prior to the 2004 amendments.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> From the Housing Background Report, one can compare the regional housing need for the planning period by affordability with the residential development capacity under then current zoning to determine whether additional programs were needed to address the entire regional need by income level. To conclude otherwise based on petitioners\u2019 challenges under this subdivision would be to invalidate the housing element based on its merits. This would impermissibly exceed the scope of \u00f3ur judicial review. <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1068; <em>Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">2. <em>Former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">Former section 65583, subdivision (c), provided that the housing element shall contain a \u201cprogram which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the housing element.... In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community, the program shall do all of the following: [][] (1)(A) <em>Identify adequate sites which will be made available through appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities, </em>including sewage collection and treatment, domestic water supply, and septic tanks and wells, <em>needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels, </em>including multifamily rental housing, factory-built housing, mobilehomes, housing for agricultural employees, emergency shelters, \u00e1nd transitional housing in order to meet <em>the community\u2019s housing goals as identified in subdivision (b).\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Stats. 2001, ch. 671, \u00a7 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>italics added.) Section 65583, subdivision (b)(1), in turn provided, as it still does, that the housing element shall contain a \u201cstatement of the community\u2019s <em>goals, quantified objectives, and policies </em>relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element under former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), comes down to the contention that the element, lacking a site-specific inventory, necessarily also lacked a program that identified adequate and specific sites to meet the regional housing need for the low- and lower income categories in enough time to permit development of such sites during the planning period. Relying principally on <em>Hojfinaster, </em>plaintiffs urge that a site is only \u201c \u2018adequate\u2019 \u201d if it is \u201c \u2018available for immediate development\u2019 of housing of the kind needed\u201d and if it is a \u201csite on which that kind of housing can feasibly be built.\u201d (Italics omitted.) They contend that without a site-specific inventory containing information about the zoning, location, size, and existing use of each site, at a minimum, one cannot know if \u201cadequate\u201d sites have been identified in substantial compliance with former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A). Without this knowledge, the argument goes, it is impossible to determine if government programs addressing zoning and infrastructure relative to specific sites are necessary under this subdivision in order to, within the planning period, meet regional housing needs at each income level. This argument is entirely dependent on a pre-2005 interpretation of section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), mandating a site-specific inventory\u2014an interpretation we have rejected. Finally with respect to former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), plaintiffs contend that the \u201cadequate sites\u201d provision further required that for each of the specifically identified sites, the program must have included a statement of the additional government actions the City will take to make that site immediately available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">The City, for its part, contends that the adequate sites requirement of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), contemplated that a site may be adequate without being presently or immediately available for development. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>In other words, sites which are suitable for development may still be \u201cadequate\u201d even though zoning and public service constraints to development still exist. Under the City\u2019s interpretation of the former subdivision, all that was required to substantially comply with it was inclusion in the housing element of a plan to make sites available that are suitable for development by removal or amelioration of these constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">We conclude that plaintiffs overreach in their interpretation of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A). The statutory language did not require that sites be immediately available for development in order for them to be \u201cadequate.\u201d Nor did it require a showing of the feasibility of development on individual sites.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Nor did it require that actions designed to ameliorate developmental or zoning constraints be scheduled to occur at any particular point early in the planning period so that actual development could be completed within that period. Instead, the statute simply required a statement of administrative plans scheduled to occur over a five-year period\u2014i.e., a program\u2014to implement the policies, goals, and quantified objectives of the housing element. The program was merely required to identify \u201cadequate sites which <em>will be made available </em>through appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels ... in order to meet the [City\u2019s] housing goals . . . .\u201d (Former \u00a7 65583, subd. (c)(1)(A), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">The result in <em>Buena Vista </em>supports our conclusion. The court there rejected a challenge to a housing element on the basis that it did not meet the \u201cadequate sites\u201d requirement of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A). The court did so even though the element had not identified particular sites that were being made available for certain types of housing and as to that matter, the program had indicated only that city-owned land \u201c \u2018may be offered\u2019 \u201d to the public and nonprofit housing agencies for development of affordable housing. <em>(Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at pp. 300-301.) The element stated: \u201c \u2018This will continue the program which has committed about 226 acres of City-owned land valued in excess of $22.9 million to production of over 1,700 affordable units.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300.) The Department, in declining to certify that the housing element was in substantial compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>with the law, asserted that the program did not evidence \u201c \u2018a firm commitment to implementation\u2019 \u201d and that there was \u201c \u2018no indication of how much land will be made available, its zoning, or dwelling-unit capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The <em>Buena Vista </em>court upheld the City\u2019s housing element in spite of the Department\u2019s conclusions about its legal deficiencies. In so doing, the court noted that the \u201cCity states [that] San Diego is divided into 40 subareas each with its own community plan and City has set forth the capacity of each subarea community plan and the capacity remaining for further residential development. <em>The capacity remaining exceeds City\u2019s housing needs for the five-year time span contemplated by the element.\u201d (Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at pp. 300-301, italics added.) The court further noted in finding substantial compliance with the statute that the City had \u201cdeveloped a computer program to monitor development projects throughout the development process and therefore [could] obtain \u2018a picture of current patterns and a one- to three-year look into the future.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Thus, the bases of the court\u2019s finding of substantial compliance with the \u201cadequate sites\u201d requirement under the former version of the statute were the kinds of statements in the housing element that fell well short of plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the same requirement here. The <em>Buena Vista </em>court was satisfied with a general indication in the housing element that site development capacity exceeded housing needs and that the City had developed a program to monitor the development process over the next three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">The court in <em>Hernandez </em>likewise rejected a challenge to a housing element under former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A). There, the plaintiffs contended that the City had failed to identify adequate sites for low- and moderate-income housing. The court observed that the housing element\u2019s discussion, tables, and figures under different categories of sites disclosed \u201cample land site identification applicable to the various categories of housing needs. The housing element includes programs in each of the categories listed in [former] section 65583[, subdivision ](c)(l).\u201d <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1067.) This, the court found, substantially complied with the \u201cadequate sites\u201d requirement. Notably, the court did not delve into the accuracy of the information given or analyze whether or when the programs in each category would yield the desired site development. \u201cThe petitioners\u2019 argument about the nonworkability of the housing element\u2019s facts and figures is a pure attack on the merits of this aspect of the plan based on an [expert\u2019s] opinion the court was under no obligation to accept.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1068.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">Thus, <em>Hernandez </em>too interpreted former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), in a far more lenient manner than that urged by plaintiffs here. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the former statute would impose on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>City stringent requirements that appeared nowhere in the text, or in any other part of the Housing Element Law in place when the 2002 housing element was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">We discern from Gilroy\u2019s housing element that its \u201cquantified objectives\u201d were to meet the unmet regional housing need.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In terms of this objective, we see that the element, as shown thro\u00fcgh the Housing Background Report\u2014 and as expressed in terms of quantified, potentially developable units in the various zoning density categories<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>\u2014facially reflects that the City had the ability to accommodate the ABAG unmet total regional housing need by reference to vacant acres that had already been residentially zoned. (See Housing Background Report, table 7-1.) In isolating the unmet very-low- and low-income regional housing need\u2014the subject of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge here\u2014the City expressed its ability to accommodate this strata by resort to lands to be rezoned.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">As the City points out, the report goes on to articulate various programs and action items that are a part of or consistent with the general plan and that are intended to result in the projected rezoning and the development of sufficient multifamily, high-density, affordable housing units, including implementation of the Neighborhood Districts plan, so as to satisfy the unmet regional housing need for low- and very-low-income families.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Based on this information and these programs and action items, we conclude that the City substantially complied with the requirements of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), to provide \u201cadequate sites.\u201d While the City could have offered more specificity, and while the element does not express that its programs and action items will yield the desired results soon enough in the planning period to permit full development within -that period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>these were not required for substantial compliance with the statute. We view plaintiffs\u2019 many attacks on the housing element and its programs (some specifically raised only in the reply brief) as amounting to \u201cargument about the nonworkability of the housing element\u2019s facts and figures\u201d and a \u201cpure attack on the merits of the plan.\u201d <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1068.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">3. <em>Former section 65583, subdivision (c)(l)(A)(i)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">Former section 65583, subdivision (c)(l)(A)(i), went on to provide that \u201c[w]here the inventory of sites, pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), does not identify adequate sites to accommodate the need for groups of all household income levels pursuant to Section 65584, the program shall provide for sufficient sites with zoning that permits owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential use by right, including density and development standards that could accommodate and facilitate the feasibility of housing for very low and low-income households.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, a locality need not have satisfied the requirements of this subdivision unless it had failed to provide a land inventory under section 65583, subdivision (a)(3) that provided for adequate sites to meet the housing need for all income levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Following their contentions that the land inventory referred to in Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element failed to meet the requirements of section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), and that the element further failed to identify adequate sites under former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), plaintiffs further contend that Gilroy was consequently required to provide multifamily \u201cby right\u201d sites under former section 65583, subdivision (c)(l)(A)(i), and that it failed to do so.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The City contends that it did comply with any obligation to provide \u201cby right\u201d sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Having concluded that Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element substantially complied with section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), of the Housing Element Law then in effect, we need not, and therefore do not, decide whether Gilroy also complied with former section 65583, subdivision (c)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">B. <em>Gilroy Did Not Violate the Least Cost Zoning Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">As noted, section 65913.1 is part of the Least Cost Zoning Law. It states in relevant part that \u201c[i]n exercising its authority to zone for land uses and <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number><em>revising its housing </em>element. . . , a city, county, or city and county shall <em>designate and zone sufficient vacant land for residential use with appropriate standards, </em>in relation to zoning for nonresidential use, and in relation to growth projections of the general plan <em>to meet housing needs for all income categories as identified in the housing element of the general </em>plan.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (\u00a7 65913.1, subd. (a), italics added.) The purpose of the Least Cost Zoning Law \u201cis to encourage local governments to approve needed and sound housing developments that will alleviate the \u2018severe shortage\u2019 of affordable housing for low and moderate income families.\u201d <em>(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1260 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 739].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The parties dispute the standard of review that we apply on appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 Least Cost Zoning Law challenge. Plaintiffs contend that the issue of Gilroy\u2019s compliance with the Least Cost Zoning Law is a question of law subject to our de novo review because there are no substantial evidentiary disputes. But we agree with the City that the challenge here is primarily to Gilroy\u2019s rezoning efforts pursuant to its policies and programs set forth in the general plan, of which the housing element is a part, and the City\u2019s zoning ordinance. These matters constitute legislative enactments. (\u00a7\u00a7 65301.5, 65850.) As such, they are presumed to be valid and \u201ca city need not make explicit findings to support its action. [Citations.] A court cannot inquire into the wisdom of a legislative act or review the merits of a local government\u2019s policy decisions. [Citation.] Judicial review of a legislative act under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is limited to determining whether the public agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, entirely without evidentiary support, or procedurally unfair. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Federation of Hillside &amp; Canyon Assns. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1195 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 543].) Whether an action finds evidentiary support in the record is measured by the substantial evidence test. <em>(Taylor Bus Service, Inc. v. San Diego Bd. of Education </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1331, 1340 [241 Cal.Rptr. 379].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the Least Cost Zoning Law required the City to take action to actually rezone a sufficient supply of adequate sites to meet the City\u2019s lower income share of need and that this action was required to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>been completed within \u201ca reasonably prompt time after the December 2001 deadline for revising [the City\u2019s] housing element.\u201d The City responds that the Least Cost Zoning Law does not require immediate rezoning upon revision of the housing element, that such a requirement would conflict with the five-year planning periods contemplated by the Housing Element Law, and that the element\u2019s plan for meeting its share of the regional housing need through rezoning and implementation of the Neighborhood Districts plan is all that was required to comply with section 65913.1. Echoing their challenge under the Housing Element Law, plaintiffs reply that implementation of the Neighborhood Districts plan cannot constitute compliance with the Least Cost Zoning Law because it is only a plan to \u201c \u2018[cjonvene a Task Force,\u2019 \u201d not a program \u201cto zone sites for higher density housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">We conclude that the City has the better argument. First, there is no express requirement in section 65913.1 that a locality immediately rezone upon adoption of a revised housing element. Second, even as revised, the Housing Element Law, which works in tandem with the Least Cost Zoning Law, does not require immediate action and permits a locality to act within the planning period to meet regional housing needs. (\u00a7\u00a7 65583, subd. (c), 65913, subd. (a)(3).) Third, as we have already concluded, under the Housing Element Law then in effect, Gilroy\u2019s housing element designated sufficient rezoned land, through its programs and actions to update zoning and implement the Neighborhood Districts plan, to increase affordable housing and to satisfy the regional housing need for the low- and lower income categories. Plaintiffs have not shown these legislative actions to have been arbitrary, capricious, or entirely without evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Fourth, there is substantial evidence in the record of the positive effect that implementation of the general plan through rezoning and the Neighborhood Districts program will have on the supply of higher density, lower income housing and that it will satisfy the regional housing need in all income categories. There is also evidence of Gilroy\u2019s efforts to implement its Neighborhood Districts plan after adoption of the 2002 housing element, which dispels plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that the plan is only one to create a task force and nothing more. Further, it is clear that while the Neighborhood Districts plan, which was relied on by the trial court in finding Gilroy compliant with the Least Cost Zoning Law, is not purely an action to rezone, its rezoning aspects are designed to yield an increased supply of affordable housing units, and if implemented, will do so according to the City\u2019s planning expert, David Driskell. And nothing about the Least Cost Zoning Law requires that compliance with it be in the form of action that is purely related to rezoning and nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">In sum, substantial evidence supports that in revising its 2002 housing element and general plan, legislative acts which we have found substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>complied with the then existing version of the Housing Element Law, the City was in compliance with the Least Cost Zoning Law.

These contentions focus on the effect of the Department\u2019s specific findings that Gilroy\u2019s 2002 housing element failed to substantially comply with the Housing Element Law and not the general weight to be afforded to the Department\u2019s interpretation of the law as expressed in its Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s. While plaintiffs make much of this rather subtle distinction, it is one without a difference for our purposes. To the extent the Department found that Gilroy\u2019s housing element did not substantially comply with the Housing Element Law in the particular respects raised here, those findings are consistent with and rest on the Department\u2019s general interpretation of the law as expressed in its Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1035-8\"> Merriani-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary includes both definitions among several general meanings of the word \u201cinventory.\u201d As the parties point out, the word can mean \u201can itemized list of current assets\u201d or \u201cthe quantity of goods or materials on hand: stock.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict.

It also noted that the inventory included discussion of constraints to development, efforts at \u201crecycling\u201d of sites to higher density units, and a proposal for mixed-use development in commercial districts that would yield a quantified number of affordable housing units to lower income households. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1062-1063.) It seems to us that Gilroy\u2019s land inventory, as it appears in the Housing Background Report, has many of these same features, likewise presented in a format of tables and general discussion rather than site-specific analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1039-6\"> This is because a site-specific l\u00e1nd inventory facilitates the assessment whether a locality\u2019s housing element complies with the \u201cadequate sites\u201d requirement of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A). This conclusion explains the Department\u2019s position, as reflected in its June 2001 Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s, that even under prior law, section 65583, subdivision (a)(3), required localities to prepare a land inventory and analysis of specific sites so that it could be determined what, if any, additional actions were needed under former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1), in order to provide sufficient adequate sites to accommodate the locality\u2019s fair share housing needs at all income levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1039-7\"> The courts in both <em>Buena Vista </em>and <em>Hoffmaster </em>suggested, if not concluded, that the requirements of the pre-2005 Housing Element Law could be satisfied by reference to materials or documents not intrinsically a part of the housing element itself. <em>(Buena Vista, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 301 [\u201cWhile nowhere in the housing element itself is found a provision of specific sites for mobilehomes, rental housing or factory-built housing, it appears these designations may be in the detailed community plans which are referred to in City\u2019s housing element.\u201d]; <em>Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1114 [\u201cAvailable sites should be officially designated and publicized, <em>preferably </em>in the housing element, . . .\u201d (Italics added.)].) Accordingly, there is precedent for our reliance here on extrinsic materials, such as Gilroy\u2019s Housing Background Report, to determine substantial compliance. Our further references to Gilroy\u2019s land inventory therefore encompass the Housing Background Report as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1040-6\"> Accordingly, the parties do not dispute the factual contents of the land inventory, just whether those contents substantially comply with statutory requirements, as the parties interpret them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1040-7\"> The \u201cNeighborhood Districts\u201d plan is a new program being incorporated into land use planning in Gilroy. It is a concept providing for mixed use development and a new density designation involving multiple density categories in a single area. This is a move away from the more traditional designations of a single kind of density\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014in a single area that is thought to have resulted in negative planning effects. Gilroy\u2019s Neighborhood Districts plan is a significant component of its general plan, which contains action items relating to it, and it is one invoked by the City, along with updating of zoning, as a means to achieve its housing goals and needs once areas are rezoned. These goals and needs include those relating to affordable housing by providing for minimum-and targeted mixes of densities that will, it is suggested, lead to more development of lower income housing\u2014enough to alone accommodate the City\u2019s fair share housing needs in the lower income categories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1040-8\"> Higher density zoning generally correlates to the lower income categories of housing.

' -</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1041-8\"> In view of these numbers, we need not resolve the disputed issue whether the R3 zoning density designation can ever accommodate low- and lower income housing units. The City argues that areas zoned R3 can indeed accommodate these income categories, thus reducing the corresponding ABAG fair share need to that extent, while plaintiffs deny this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1042-6\"> The record reveals that in 1998, the City prepared a vacant and underutilized land survey, or \u201cdatabase,\u201d as part of the general plan update process. The survey was presented in the form of a spreadsheet and a map of the planning area. This land use database was updated in 2001 and used for the preparation of the 2002 draft housing element. This update process involved revisions to the land use database, which provided \u201cnecessary parcel-level data\u201d for preparation of the draft and the City\u2019s later 2003 comments in response to the Department\u2019s compliance review thereof. If site-specific information was then available, it is not clear why this information never made it into the 2002 housing element or the Housing Background Report or why the City did not later revise these documents to include this information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1042-7\"> Section 65583, subdivision (c)(1), now reads: The program shall \u201c[identify <em>actions </em>that will be taken to make sites available <em>during the planning period </em>of the general plan with appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities to accommodate that portion of the city\u2019s or county\u2019s share of the <em>regional housing need </em>for each income level that could not be accommodated <em>on sites identified in the inventory completed pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) </em>without rezoning ....

Section 65583, subdivision (c)\u2019s prior reference to meeting housing goals in the identification of sites, and not needs, suggested, perhaps inadvertently, that these two subdivisions were directed at different housing objectives, or at least were not necessarily tied together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1044-6\"> To the extent <em>Hoffmaster </em>supports plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of former section 65583, subdivision (c)(1)(A), we disagree with that case, which defers to the Department\u2019s Q\u2019s &amp; A\u2019s for its statutory construction. <em>(Hoffmaster, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1110-1114.)
