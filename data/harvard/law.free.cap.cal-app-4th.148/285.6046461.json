J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV2\">Absent extraordinary circumstances, at the 18-month</p>\n<p id=\"AXC\">permanency review hearing held pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.22<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the juvenile court either orders the return of a dependent child to parental custody or terminates reunification services and sets a hearing for the selection and implementation of a permanent plan pursuant to section 366.26. (\u00a7 366.22, subd. (a); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.720(c)(1) &amp; (3);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see <em>In re Elizabeth R. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1774, 1788 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 200].) If the juvenile court determines there would be no substantial danger to the child if he or she were returned home provided there is continued supervision by a social worker and the ongoing provision of reasonable support services to preserve the family, is such supervised return an option available to the court? Or are the only alternatives returning the child and terminating dependency jurisdiction, on the one hand, or terminating reunification services and setting a section 366.26 hearing, on the other hand?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In this case the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (Department) recommended at Bridget and Christopher A.\u2019s 18-month hearing that the two children and their three siblings be returned to their mother, X\u00f3chitl C., but that the juvenile court retain jurisdiction and family maintenance services be provided to ensure the children\u2019s safety. The juvenile court rejected the Department\u2019s recommendation, stating it had no statutory authority to order the children returned home without also terminating its jurisdiction. Following entry of the court\u2019s order returning the children to their mother and terminating its jurisdiction, Bridget and Christopher, who had objected to the juvenile court\u2019s refusal to consider the Department\u2019s proposed \u201cmiddle option,\u201d petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the juvenile court to vacate its order terminating jurisdiction and to issue a new order setting a hearing pursuant to section 364 to determine whether continued court supervision is necessary to ensure their safety in the home of their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We grant the requested relief. In determining whether to return a dependent child in an out-of-home placement to the custody of his or her parent at the six-month review hearing (\u00a7 366.21, subd. (e)), the juvenile court properly considers if providing family maintenance services to the child and parent will facilitate the child\u2019s return to, and safe maintenance in, the home. Although the juvenile court in this case correctly observed there is no express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>authority in either statute or rule for a similar order returning the child to his or her parent\u2019s custody and ordering family maintenance services at the 12-month (\u00a7 366.21, subd. (f)) or 18-month (\u00a7 366.22) permanency review hearings, neither is there anything in the statutory scheme, including in section 364, that precludes the court in an appropriate circumstanice from entering such an order at those hearings. In fact, this \u201cmiddle option\u201d appears to have been contemplated by the Legislature, as reflected in section 361.5, subdivision (a), and is fully consistent not only with the broad-ranging authority of the juvenile court to make \u201cany. and all reasonable orders for the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the child\u201d (\u00a7 362, subd. (a)), but also with the fundamental policies underlying the dependency system.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">1. <em>The Original Dependency Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Bridget (now 14 years old) and Christopher (now 13 years old) and their three, siblings were initially named in a dependency petition filed on April 22, 2004 by the Department pursuant to section 300, subdivisions (a) (serious physical harm), .(b) (failure to protect) and (j) (abuse of sibling). The petition, as amended and sustained on June 7, 2004, alleged Antonio E., Bridget and Christopher\u2019s stepfather, physically abused Christopher and two of his siblings (Joseph E. and X\u00f3chitl E.) and their mother, X\u00f3chitl C., failed to take appropriate action to protect her children, thereby placing all five children at risk; X\u00f3chitl C. herself physically abused Joseph E. and Marilyn A., placing not only those two children but also their siblings at risk; Antonio E. and X\u00f3chitl C. have a history of domestic violence in which they have' assaulted each other in the children\u2019s presence; Antonio E. has a history of substance abuse and drug-related criminal activity and is a current user of alcohol and illicit drugs, which renders him incapable of providing regular care for the children; and X\u00f3chitl C. knew of Antonio E.\u2019s substance abuse problem and failed to take appropriate action to protect the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The children were placed with their maternal grandmother, who came to live with the children in the family home. (Because the maternal grandmother\u2019s own home was too small to accommodate all the children, she moved into the family home to care for them; Antonio E. and X\u00f3chitl C. moved out of the home.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In connection with the 12-month review hearing held on June 6, 2005 (\u00a7 366.21, subd. (f)), the Department reported X\u00f3chitl C. and Antonio E. had complied with the case plan requirements concerning parenting and domestic violence classes, counseling, alcohol and drug abstinence and visitation and recommended they be allowed to return to the family home. The court agreed and entered home-of-parent orders for the children to be returned to the physical custody of X\u00f3chitl C. and Antonio E. under the continued supervision of the Department. The court scheduled a section 364 review hearing for December 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">2. <em>The Subsequent Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On November 18, 2005 the Department filed a subsequent petition (\u00a7 342); and the children were again detained (and placed with their maternal grandmother in the family home with their parents required to leave) based on an allegation X\u00f3chitl C. had threatened Antonio E. with a loaded gun in the children\u2019s presence because she was afraid he was molesting their six-year-old daughter, X\u00f3chitl E. Christopher had attempted to separate his mother and Antonio E. by stepping between the two of them; he managed to take the gun from his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">On January 26, 2006 the court sustained portions of the supplemental petition, terminated its prior home-of-parent orders, ordered the children suitably placed with Department discretion to place them with any appropriate relative except the parents and directed the Department to provide only six additional months of family reunification services to X\u00f3chitl C. and Antonio E., who were allowed monitored visitation with the children and ordered to participate in counseling and to complete a 52-week domestic violence program.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">3. <em>The Review Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">In connection with the review hearing on July 27, 2006 (held pursuant to \u00a7 366.22 on the original petition and \u00a7 366.21, subd. (e), on the supplemental petition), the Department reported both parents were visiting the children consistently and had enrolled, albeit belatedly, in the required domestic violence program. No conjoint counseling had been initiated. The Department also reported Bridget and Christopher\u2019s visits with X\u00f3chitl C. were going well and both children wanted to return to their mother\u2019s care. The Department recommended termination of family reunification services because the parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>had received the maximum amount (18 months) of services permitted by statute and had made only limited progress on the case plan. Because of notice issues, the court continued the review hearing to September 6, 2006. The Department\u2019s addendum report for the September 6, 2006 review hearing stated X\u00f3chitl C. was making good progress in the domestic violence program but, due to problems with scheduling and costs, the parents and children still were not participating in conjoint counseling. The Department again recommended termination of family reunification services, but also recommended X\u00f3chitl C. be permitted to have unmonitored visits with the children in the family home. The court granted unmonitored visits to X\u00f3chitl C. on condition Antonio E. not be present during the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The review hearing was continued two more times, first to October 6, 2006, and then to November 6, 2006 for a contested hearing. An addendum report for the November 6, 2006 hearing states X\u00f3chitl C. was having unmonitored visits with the children, including overnight and weekend visits, that were going well with no concerns. X\u00f3chitl C. was making good progress in the domestic violence program (although Antonio E. had stopped \u00bfttending), and the family was participating in conjoint counseling. The Department\u2019s report indicates the caseworker had discussed with X\u00f3chitl C. the possibility of her returning to the family home. The Department assessed the risk if this were to be allowed as \u201cmoderate,\u201d and stated the risk would be reduced further if mother continued to attend her counseling and domestic violence programs. Accordingly, the Department recommended the court enter a home-of-parent-mother order (that is, that the court allow the mother t\u00f3 live in the family home with the children, who were already there with their maternal grandmother) and order family maintenance services for X\u00f3chitl C. and the children. The Department continued to recommend termination of family reunification services and monitored visitation for Antonio E.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">4. <em>The Court\u2019s Order Terminating Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">At the outset of the contested review hearing on November 6, 2006, counsel for the Department stated, \u201cThe Department is recommending home of parent mother on the condition that the mother move into the home where the children are currently residing, and the Department is recommending family maintenance services.\u201d In response, the court indicated its intention to return the children to the custody of their mother and terminate its jurisdiction without providing additional services. Following a recess, counsel for the Department repeated the Department\u2019s recommendation for a home-of-parent-mother order with family maintenance services, but added, \u201cif the court will not order home of parent mother, without the Department submitting on the issue of terminating jurisdiction, I will submit on that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Counsel for Bridget and Christopher immediately objected to termination of dependency jurisdiction if the children were sent home. The court then asked if X\u00f3chitl C. had completed all requirements of the case plan. When counsel for the Department indicated she had made significant progress but had not yet completed the 52-week domestic violence course, the court suggested it might not allow the children to return home. Counsel for the Department urged the court to find there had been substantial compliance by X\u00f3chitl C. and repeated her client\u2019s position, \u201cI have made my argument for [family maintenance services], but not to the point where I don\u2019t want the children returned home of the parent mother. I will then submit on the issue of the termination of jurisdiction. If that\u2019s the only way the court will order home of parent mother, that\u2019s the Department\u2019s position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Before entering its orders, the court observed, \u201cIt\u2019s not a 364. It\u2019s not a [361.2]. It doesn\u2019t fall under any of those code sections. There is no code section controlling this thing. There is a \u2018maybe\u2019 in the rules of court, but it\u2019s not controlled by anything else. I am not keeping these cases.\u201d The court then terminated its prior suitable placement orders, dated January 26, 2006, as to all five children; ordered each of the children placed in the home of the mother; granted legal custody of the children to X\u00f3chitl C. and Antonio E. with sole physical custody and primary residence with X\u00f3chitl C.; and terminated its jurisdiction over the children, noting the objections of the Department and the children\u2019s counsel to the termination order.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">5. <em>Bridget and Christopher\u2019s Petition for Writ of Mandate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Following entry of the court\u2019s order terminating juvenile court jurisdiction, Bridget and Christopher petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the juvenile court to vacate that portion of its November 6, 2006 order terminating jurisdiction over them and to issue a new order setting a hearing pursuant to section 364 to, determine whether continued court supervision is necessary, to ensure their safety in the home of their mother.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petition was supported in part by declarations from two attorneys with the Children\u2019s Law Center of Los Angeles who appear before and are familiar with the procedures and practices in department 416 (Commissioner Albert Garcia) of the Los Angeles Superior Court in which Bridget and Christopher\u2019s dependency case was pending. Both attorneys declared Commissioner Garcia has stated on numerous occasions he has no authority to continue dependency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>jurisdiction or to set a section 364 review hearing after he has made an order returning children to the custody of a parent or guardian. Accordingly, when the Department recommends a home-of-parent order and provision of family maintenance services for a child in an out-of-home placement, as it did in this case, Commissioner Garcia will either continue' the out-of-home placement or return the child to his or her parents and immediately terminate the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The Department joined in Bridget and Christopher\u2019s petition. Counsel for Bridget and Christopher\u2019s three siblings have also filed \u201cjoinders\u201d in the petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 7, 2006 we issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted. No return or other response has been filed by any real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">We normally review the juvenile court\u2019s decision to terminate dependency jurisdiction and to issue a custody (or \u201cexit\u201d) order pursuant to section 362.4 for abuse of discretion <em>(In re Stephanie M. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 318 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706]) and may not disturb the order unless the court \u201c \u2018 \u201cexceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd determination [citations].\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>In re Nicholas H. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 251, 265, fn. 4 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 261]; <em>In re Sarah M. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1486, 1501-1502 [285 Cal.Rptr. 374], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>disapproved on another ground in <em>In re Chantal S. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 196, 204 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 866, 913 P.2d 1075].) However, the sole question presented by Bridget and Christopher\u2019s writ petition\u2014does the juvenile court at a section 366.22, 18-month review hearing have the authority to return a dependent child to the home of his or her parent while providing family maintenance services under court supervision\u2014concerns the scope of the juvenile court\u2019s discretion, not the proper exercise of that discretion in a particular case, and thus is a question of law for this court. (See <em>Choice-In-Education League </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 415, 422 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 303] [\u201cThe scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied; action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">To answer this question we must construe and harmonize several related provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code and the California Rules of Court governing dependency review hearings. In approaching this task we are guided by well-established principles of statutory interpretation: The fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(In re Eric H. </em>(1974) 54 Cal.App.4th 955, 965 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 230]; <em>In re Christina A. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1162 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 310].) \u201c[T]o determine this intent, we begin by examining the language of the statute. [Citations.] But \u2018[i]t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u2019 [Citations.] Thus, \u2018[t]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898-899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Broughton </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 307, 316-317 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 161].) \u201cIf statutory language is susceptible to more than one interpretation, courts must adopt the meaning that conforms to the spirit of the statutory scheme and reject that which would result in absurd consequences unintended by the Legislature. In applying these principles, courts must keep in mind the object to be achieved, and the evil to be prevented, by the legislation.\u201d <em>{In re Christina </em>A., at p. 1162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Legislature has unequivocally declared the purpose of dependency law is \u201cto provide for the protection and safety of . . . each minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and to preserve and strengthen the minor\u2019s family ties whenever possible, removing the minor from the custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of his or her parents only when necessary for his or her welfare .... When removal of a minor is determined by the juvenile court to be necessary, reunification of the minor with his or her family shall be a primary objective. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 202, subd. (a); see <em>In re Christina A., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at p. 1162.) The Legislature has further instructed that the provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code shall be \u201cliberally construed\u201d to carry out that purpose. (\u00a7 202, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">2. <em>The Statutes Governing Dependency Review Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201cCalifornia has a comprehensive statutory scheme establishing procedures for the juvenile court to follow when and after a child is removed from the home for the child\u2019s welfare. [Citations.] \u2018The objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent, stable homes if those children cannot be returned home within a prescribed period of time.\u2019 [Citation.] When the child is removed from the home, the court first attempts, for a specified period of time, to reunify the family. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Celine R. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 45, 52 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 432, 71 P.3d 787]; see <em>Sara M. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 998, 1008 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 89, 116 P.3d 550].) Under the current statutory scheme dependency proceedings in which a child is removed from his or her home typically involve four phases: jurisdiction, disposition, reunification and implementation of a permanent plan if reunification is unsuccessful. (See generally <em>Cynthia D. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 242, 247-250 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 851 P.2d 1307]; <em>In re Summer H. </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1324 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 682].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">After the juvenile court has assumed jurisdiction under section 355 by finding the child is a person described by section 300, the court is required to hear evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the child. (\u00a7 358, subd. (a).) In most cases. at the disposition hearing the court determines what services the child and the family need to be reunited and free of court supervision. The court may enter an order ranging from dismissal of the petition (\u00a7 390; rule 5.695(a)(1)) to declaring dependency, removing physical custody from the parents and making a general placement order for the child (\u00a7 361; rule 5.695(a)(7)). If appropriate, the court may declare the child a dependent and, without removing the child from his or her home, order family maintenance services to ameliorate the conditions that made the child subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. (\u00a7 362, subd. (a); rule 5.695(a)(5).)  Alternatively, if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence there is a substantial danger to the physical health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>safety, protection or physical or emotional well-being of the child if the child remains in his or her home and there is no other reasonable means to protect the child (\u00a7 361, subd. (c)(l)-(4); rule 5.695(d) [removal of custody\u2014 required findings]), in the absence of a noncustodial parent who desires custody (see \u00a7 361.2), the child must be removed from the physical custody of his or her parents and placed \u201cunder the supervision of the [county] social worker who may place the child\u201d in an appropriate home. (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Whether or not the dependent child remains in the parent\u2019s home, however, child welfare services (either in the form of family reunification services for a child in an out-of-home placement<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or family maintenance services for a child who remains at home<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>) must be provided to the parent unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that one of the 15 exceptions set forth in section 361.5, subdivision (b), applies.

At least in the context of the section 366.21, subdivision (e), six-month review hearing, there is no doubt that in answering that question the juvenile court properly considers whether continuing dependency jurisdiction and providing additional family maintenance services to the parent and child will facilitate the child\u2019s return to, and safe maintenance in, the home: \u201cIf the child is returned [at the six-month review hearing], the court may order the termination of dependency jurisdiction or order continued dependency services and set a review hearing within 6 months.\u201d (Rule 5.710(e)(2); see Cal.

(The statute similarly makes no mention of terminating jurisdiction upon the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent.) However, the Judicial Council\u2019s interpretation of this statute in rule 5.710 (former rule 1460), quoted above, expressly authorizes continuing court supervision and ordering family maintenance services. \u201c[Ajlthough not binding on the courts and invalid if contrary to statute, [a Judicial Council rule interpreting the dependency statutes] is entitled to great weight and will be overturned only if it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>(Sara M. v.

Indeed, section 361.5, subdivision (a)(3), fourth paragraph, provides in part, \u201cPhysical custody of the child by the parents or guardians during the applicable time period under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) [specifying the duration of court-ordered family reunification services that may be provided to a child and his or her family] shall not serve to interrupt the running of the period.\u201d By precluding any \u201ctolling\u201d of the maximum period for family reunification services for the time a child has been returned home and family maintenance services are provided, the Legislature has plainly expressed both its awareness and approval of the widespread practice of returning a child in an out-of-home placement to the physical custody of his or her parent subject to on-going court supervision and the provision of family maintenance services. It has also recognized the unfortunate reality that\u2014as happened in this case<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\u2014the parent may subsequently lose custody of the child once again following' the filing of a supplemental (\u00a7 387) or subsequent (\u00a7 342) petition.

These orders may concern the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the minor . . . .\u201d].) Permitting a dependent child to return home while retaining jurisdiction and ordering the continuation (with or without modification) of services previously provided to ensure the child\u2019s safety plainly fall within this broad-ranging authority of the juvenile court. <em>(In re Carmen M. </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 478, 486 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 117] [\u00a7 362, subd.

The Legislature has directed the juvenile court \u201cto preserve and strengthen the minor\u2019s family ties whenever possible.\u201d (\u00a7 202, subd. (a).) Even after making the required findings and declaring a child a dependent of the juvenile court, a child may not be removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian absent proof the child cannot be adequately protected by providing reasonable in-home services. (\u00a7 361, subd. (c); rule 5.695(d).) Once it becomes apparent a child initially in an out-of-home placement can safely return home if family maintenance services are made available, ordering that return, while continuing jurisdiction, furthers the legislative mandate to preserve the family whenever possible. (See \u00a7 202, subd. (a) [when removal of a child is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>necessary, \u201creunification of the minor with his or her family shall be a primary objective\u201d of the juvenile court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">4. <em>The Juvenile Court May Order a Dependent Child Home at the 12-month Review Hearing While Continuing Court Supervision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The language in section 366.21, subdivision (f), directing the court to return a dependent child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless that return would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety or physical or emotional well-being of the child is identical to the language in section 366.21, subdivision (e). Accordingly, although rule 5.715 prescribing the conduct of the 12-month permanency hearing does not address the court\u2019s ability to return the child to his or her home arid order continued dependency services, as does rule 5.710(e)(2) with respect to the six-month hearing, there is no reason to conclude the juvenile Court does not have full authority under section 362, subdivision (a), as well as sections 202, subdivision (a) (declaring purpose of juvenile law), and 245.5 (general powers of juvenile court), to enter a home-of-parent order at the 12-month hearing, continue court jurisdiction and direct that family maintenance services be provided to the child and his or her parents. (See Cal. Judges Benchguide 103: Juvenile Dependency Review Hearings, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 103.13, p. 103-26 [identifying among possible findings and orders at 12-month permanency hearing, \u201c[c]hild is returned home and dependency continued/not continued. [Citation.] If dependency is continued, court sets review in six months.\u201d].) As discussed, the Legislature certainly contemplated such an order with the anti-tolling provision in section 361.5, subdivision (a)(3), fourth paragraph, which applies when a child is initially removed, returned home at a periodic review hearing and then re-detained based on the allegations in a supplemental petition. (See, e.g., <em>Carolyn R. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">At the 12-month permanency review hearing, if the dependent child is not returned to the custody of his or her parent or guardian, the court is authorized to order additional reunification services if it finds a substantial probability the child will be returned and safely maintained in the home within the extended period (not to exceed 18 months from the date of the original removal). (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subd. (g), 361.5, subd. (a)(3), 3rd par.) Particularly in light of the legislative directive that family preservation be a primary objective of the dependency system during these initial phases of the proceedings (see <em>Cynthia D. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 248-249; <em>In re Celine R., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 52), it would be anomalous at best to construe section 366.21, subdivision (f), to permit the court to maintain the child in an out-of-home placement while ordering additional reunification services but not to allow the court to return the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to his or her parent while providing continued court and social worker supervision and child welfare (family maintenance) services to ensure the child\u2019s safety. We decline to adopt such an incongruous interpretation of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">5. <em>The Juvenile Court Has Discretion to Enter a Home-of-parent Order at the 18-month Permanency Review Hearing While Continuing Court Supervision and Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Section 366.22, subdivision (a), like section 366.21, subdivisions (e) and (f), contains a statutory presumption the child will be returned to parental custqdy unless the court finds the child\u2019s return would create \u201ca substantial risk of detriment to the physical or emotional well-being\u201d of the child. <em>(Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 249 [discussing review hearings under all three provisions].) Also like section 366.21, subdivisions (e) and (f), section 366.22 does not address the juvenile court\u2019s discretion to return the child to his or her home and order continued dependency services. Nonetheless, finding the child may be returned to, and safely maintained in, his or her parent\u2019s home at the 18-month permanency review hearing while retaining jurisdiction and directing that family maintenance services be provided to the child and his or her parent would appear to fit comfortably within the juvenile court\u2019s broad authority to make \u201cany and all reasonable orders for the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the [dependent] child.\u201d (\u00a7 362, subd.

Judges Benchguide 103: Juvenile Dependency Review Hearings, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 103.13, p. 103-26 [identifying among possible findings and orders at 18-month permanency review hearing, \u201c[c]hild is returned home and dependency continued/not continued. [Citation.] If dependency is continued, court sets review in six months.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">A significant difference between continuing child welfare services following a home-of-parent order at the six-month or 12-month review hearing and a similar order at the 18-month permanency review hearing, however, is that the section 366.22 hearing \u201crepresents a critical juncture in dependency proceedings.\u201d <em>(Mark N. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015.) \u201cThe cutoff date for fostering family reunification is the 18-month status review.

There is no statutory limit on the provision of family maintenance services if the court believes the objectives of the service plan are being met. (See \u00a7\u00a7 364, subd. (d), 16506; <em>In re Joel T., supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at pp. 267-268.) There appears to be no reason, in either the language of the governing statutes or the public policy underlying the dependency system, to permit these child welfare services to continue for a family with a dependent child who has never been removed from the home and to deny those services to an otherwise identical family whose child was originally removed and then returned because of the parents\u2019 substantial progress in completing their case plan.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, although the Legislature has directed in the anti-tolling provision of section 361.5, subdivision (a)(3), fourth paragraph, that the combined period of family reunification and family maintenance services be considered in determining whether additional family reunification services may be provided\u2014at least to the extent family maintenance services were provided following the initial removal and subsequent return of a child to the custody of his or her parent or guardian (see <em>In re N. M., supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 854 [acknowledging argument can be made that family maintenance services should not be counted against 18-month period when child is not removed from parent\u2019s custody until after services are provided]\u2014no similar mandate restricts the provision of family maintenance services beyond the 18-month date.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>6. <em>A Section 364 Review Hearing May Be Held for a Dependent Child Who Has Been Returned to His or Her Parent\u2019s Custody Following an Out-of-home Placement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In addition to noting the absence of express language in sections 366.21, subdivisions (e) and (f), or 366.22 authorizing the court to retain jurisdiction and order family maintenance services after returning a dependent child to his or her parent, the juvenile court in this case stated (as it had in other, similar cases according to the declarations submitted with the writ petition) it has no authority to set a section 364 review hearing after terminating an out-of-home placement and entering a home-of-parent order for a dependent child. It follows, therefore, if there can be no further review hearing for the child, the court must necessarily terminate its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">This narrow interpretation of the availability and scope of a section 364 review hearing is apparently based on language from several appellate cases\u2014and, in particular, from the recent opinion by Division Eight of this court in <em>Janee W., supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at pages 1450 to 1451\u2014suggesting section 364 applies only when a child has never been removed from the physical custody of the parent or guardian. (See also <em>In re Sarah M., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1493 [\u201csection 364 applies in cases where the dependent child has not been removed from the original custodial home.\u201d].) This analysis unnecessarily restricts the language of the statute itself, misreads the relevant case authority and disregards both an applicable Judicial Council rule and the broad authority of the juvenile court to make orders that further the best interests of dependent children.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The juvenile court must conduct a review hearing for every child who has been declared a dependent of the court at least every six months. <em>(In re Natasha A., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 38; <em>In re N. S., supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 172; compare \u00a7 366, subd. (a)(1) [\u201cThe status of every dependent child in foster care shall be reviewed periodically as determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the court but no less frequently than once every six months, as calculated from the date of the original dispositional hearing until the hearing described in Section 366.26 is completed.\u201d] with \u00a7 364, subd.

Section 364, subdivision (a), directs the juvenile court to conduct an initial review hearing for a dependent child who has. not been removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within six months of the original disposition hearing pursuant to section 358. However, by its terms a section 364 review hearing must be set following \u201c[e]very hearing\u201d at which an order is made either placing a child under the supervision of the juvenile court or retaining dependency jurisdiction, provided at that hearing no order is made removing the child from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian. (\u00a7 364, subds. (a), (d).) In view of the Legislature\u2019s direction that we \u201cliberally construed\u201d the dependency laws \u201cto preserve and strengthen the minor\u2019s family ties whenever possible\u201d (\u00a7 202, subd. (a)), we have no difficulty concluding a hearing at which an out-of-home placement is terminated and a home-of-parent order entered is the equivalent of a hearing \u201cin which the child is not removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian\u201d within the meaning of section 364, subdivision (a). (See Cal. Judges Benchguide 103: Juvenile Dependency Review Hearings, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 103.13, p. 103-26 [identifying among possible findings and orders at six-, 12- and 18-month review hearings continuing dependency jurisdiction and setting further review hearing pursuant to \u00a7 364, subd. (d)].) Moreover, as the court explained in <em>In re N. S., supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th 167, to interpret section 364 narrowly, as suggested by the juvenile court in this case, would leave an unacceptable gap in the statutory scheme: \u201cUnless section 364 applies, there is no statute governing the court\u2019s review hearings for a minor who has been removed from, but is subsequently placed back in, parental custody.\u201d <em>(In re N.

(See <em>In re N.

(Cf. <em>Sara M. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1014 [recognizing significant persuasive force of interpretation of dependency statutes contained in the California Rules of Court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">None of the appellate decisions discussing when section 364 properly governs a periodic review hearing in the juvenile court mandates a different result. In <em>Janee W. </em>Division Eight considered only whether section 364 or section 361.2 provides the applicable procedural rules in reviewing the status of dependent children who had been taken from the physical custody of their mother and eventually placed with their father, with whom they did not live at the time they were first detained. Under section 361.2, subdivision (a), when the juvenile court orders the removal of a child from a parent\u2019s home and determines a noncustodial parent desires custody, it must place the child with that parent unless it finds that doing so poses a risk of harm to the child. Although section 361.2 by its terms applies only when the juvenile court first takes jurisdiction of a child, relying upon the relevant rules of court (former rules 1460(h) [now rule 5.710(h)], 1461(c)(2) [now rule 5.715(c)(2)]), Division Eight held its procedures can be invoked at either the six-month or 12-month review hearings, as occurred in the case before it. <em>(Janee W., supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 1451.) Accordingly, the question whether to terminate jurisdiction should have been determined under the standards of section 361.2, not section 364.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court\u2019s explanation of its holding\u2014Section 364 applies when a dependency court determines that jurisdiction under section 300 is appropriate, but \u2018the child is not removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Janee W., </em>at p. 1450)\u2014is not authority for the proposition the juvenile court may not set a section 364 review hearing after entering a home-of-parent order at the six-month, 12-month or 18-month review hearing. <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.

The court concluded section 361.2 applied and held before terminating its jurisdiction the juvenile court must make a factual finding that supervision is no longer necessary. <em>(Sarah M., </em>at p. 1498.) As in <em>Janee W., </em>the general language in <em>In re Sarah M. </em>concerning the authority of the court to conduct a section 364 hearing when a child has initially been removed from the home of a custodial parent simply does not apply to the issue presented by Bridget and Christopher\u2019s writ petition: whether a section 364 review hearing may be set for a child who has been removed from, but then returned to, parental custody.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In sum, whether at the six-month, 12-month or 18-month review hearing, the juvenile court has the authority, in its discretion, to return a dependent child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and either to terminate its jurisdiction or to retain dependency jurisdiction and order family maintenance services to ensure the safety and physical and emotional well-being of the child.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>\n                   In their petition to this court, Bridget and Christopher present powerful arguments as to why, although a home-of-parent order was appropriate, continued court supervision is necessary for their protection and to ensure the conditions leading to dependency jurisdiction are not likely to recur. The juvenile court erred in refusing to consider those arguments, advanced initially before it by the Department and supported by Bridget and Christopher. Accordingly, we grant the petition, vacate the order terminating dependency jurisdiction and return the matter to the juvenile court for an appropriate exercise of its discretion in determining whether to retain jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent juvenile court to vacate that portion of its order of November 6, 2006 terminating jurisdiction over Bridget A. and Christopher A., as well as their siblings Joseph and X\u00f3chitl E., to issue a new order setting a hearing to determine whether continued court supervision is necessary to ensure the children\u2019s safety in the home of their mother and to conduct further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Johnson, J., and Zelon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> Statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\"> All references to rule or rules are to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\"> At the time of the original section 300 petition, Christian A., the biological father of Marilyn, Bridget and Christopher, was identified as \u201cwhereabouts unknown.\u201d In subsequent filings the Department reported Christian A. was incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary in Lompoc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> Although the order terminating jurisdiction is- appealable (\u00a7 395 [order entered after disposition hearing is appealable as an order after judgment]; see, e.g., <em>In re Natasha A. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 28, 33-34 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 332]), Bridget and Christopher allege there is a substantial risk they could suffer serious physical abuse or emotional trauma absent court supervision and Department involvement during the time it would take to resolve an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> The documents filed on behalf of Bridget and Christopher\u2019s siblings, although denominated as \u201cjoinders,\u201d are in the form of statements of support for the positions asserted and relief requested by Bridget and Christopher rather than separate petitions to review the juvenile court\u2019s order terminating jurisdiction over them.

Nonetheless, in response to a question from the court at oral argument, counsel for Bridget and Christopher stated it was her understanding the siblings had intended to seek affirmative relief from this court. That position was confirmed by counsel for Joseph and X\u00f3chitl E. in a letter submitted after argument. However, counsel for Marilyn A. expressly disclaimed any intent to seek writ relief for her client.
