J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALs\">In this action alleging sexual harassment in employment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940 et seq. (FEHA))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and common law claims (sexual battery, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress), plaintiff Alissia Myers appeals from summary judgment entered in favor of her former employer, defendant Trendwest Resorts, Inc. (Trendwest). Plaintiff contends triable issues of material fact exist. Plaintiff also appeals from the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Trendwest under the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">We shall reverse the judgment because Trendwest (1) failed to show entitlement to judgment on the FEHA claims alleged in counts one and two and (2) failed to show entitlement to summary adjudication regarding the punitive damages alleged in count one. We shall affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary adjudication in favor of Trendwest on the other counts. We shall reverse the order awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">A motion for summary judgment should be granted if the submitted papers show that \u201cthere is no triable issue as to any material fact,\u201d and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) A defendant moving for summary judgment meets his burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if he shows that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists. <em>(Ibid.) </em>On appeal, we examine the record de novo, liberally construing the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolving doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 446, 460 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 797, 115 P.3d 77].) \u201c \u2018First, we identify the issues raised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>the pleadings, since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond; secondly, we determine whether the moving party\u2019s showing has established facts which negate the opponent\u2019s claims and justify a judgment in movant\u2019s favor; when a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Waschek v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 640, 644 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 296].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">THE COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">The operative pleading, the third amended complaint filed on February 16, 2005, alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-6\">Trendwest is an' employer subject to the FEHA. Ayman Damlahki<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a project director (manager) at Trendwest\u2019s Roseville office and was acting within the scope'of his employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-7\">Plaintiff alleged she began working for Trendwest in October 2001. During her employment, Damlahki continually and repeatedly harassed her by \u201cnumerous unwanted and unwelcome sexual advances, comments, innuendoes of a sexual nature, numerous non-consensual physical contacts with the body of plaintiff,\u201d all of which created an intimidating, oppressive, hostile and offensive work environment. On one or more occasions between October 2001 and December 2003, in Trendwest\u2019s office, Damlahki (a) told plaintiff she had a \u201cnice ass\u201d; (b) bragged of his sexual prowess and how he could satisfy plaintiff sexually; (c) repeatedly asked plaintiff to go out with him, knowing she had no interest in him as a romantic partner; (d) phoned plaintiff many times at home and attempted to engage her in conversations of a personal nature unrelated to work; (e) repeatedly asked plaintiff to visit him at his home, knowing she had no interest in doing so; (f) asked plaintiff to share a hotel room with him at Lake Tahoe; and (g) stalked plaintiff and frequently phoned, her coworkers, seeking her whereabouts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-8\">,dn May 29, 2003, plaintiff was engaged in a job assignment, accompanied by Damlahki. He persuaded her to accompany him in his car. Damlahki lured plaintiff to his residence, claiming he had to pick up something work related. He drove into his garage, closed the garage door, grabbed plaintiff\u2019s breasts, thrust his hand into her groin area, and urged plaintiff to have sex with him. Plaintiff attempted to resist these sexual advances but was overpowered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-9\">In 2003, Trendwest implemented the Integrity line, an anonymous telephone complaint line operated by a third party vendor, which processed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>complaints and forwarded them to Trendwest for investigation. In July 2003, plaintiff\u2019s coworker Sandy Klein reported to Trendwest\u2019s Integrity line that she was being compelled to work in a hostile work environment, which included the sexual harassment of plaintiff. Trendwest did not contact plaintiff and did not take any corrective action, so that when plaintiff returned from a disability leave, Damlahki again harassed her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-5\">On December 13, 2003, Trendwest discharged plaintiff from employment \u201cin significant part because plaintiff had complained about the misconduct\u201d of Damlahki.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-6\">In early January 2004, plaintiff contacted Trendwest\u2019s Integrity fine and complained Damlahki sexually harassed her when she resumed active duty in November 2003. She is unaware of an investigation ever being conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">The complaint alleged the following counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-8\">(1) Sexual harassment under the FEHA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-9\">(2) Failure to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment, as required by the FEHA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-10\">(3) Sexual battery (regarding the May 29, 2003, incident);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-11\">(4) Intentional infliction of emotional distress;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-12\">(5) Retaliatory discharge from employment;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-13\">(6) False imprisonment (regarding May 29, 2003); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-14\">(7) Quid pro quo sexual harassment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1235-15\">Plaintiff sought compensatory damages, injunctive relief regarding failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harassment, punitive damages, and \u25a0 attorney\u2019s fees. -</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-16\">While the complaint does not make clear whether the common law counts are alleged against Trendwest, rather than against Damlahki alone, Trendwest\u2019s summary judgment motion treated the complaint as alleging all counts against Trendwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">On June 21, 2005, Trendwest filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The separate statement of undisputed facts asserted among other things:</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Trendwest is in the business of time-share sales and resort development. Sales are generated by customers taking a tour of a Trendwest sales office. Although contrary to Trendwest policy, salespersons at the Roseville office on occasion offered to follow home customers who had failed to bring their checkbook or credit card\u2014a practice the Roseville office called, \u201cdriving for dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">When plaintiff began working for Trendwest in October 2001, she and Damlahki both worked as salespersons at Trendwest\u2019s Walnut Creek sales office. In June 2002, plaintiff transferred to the Roseville office after Damlahki transferred there to be the project director. A project director manages the office and trains, motivates, and monitors the salespersons. It is within the project director\u2019s duties to be on site at all times in the office. While project directors have the authority to hire salespersons, they do not have the authority to fire or discipline any employee without conferring with the human resources department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">Plaintiff enjoyed making money and was highly motivated to make enough sales (100 time-shares in a calendar year) to earn bonuses of the President\u2019s Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">When plaintiff was hired, she received information about Trendwest\u2019s policy against sexual harassment, and posters about the policy were posted in the Roseville office. In 2003, Trendwest instituted an anonymous complaint line called the Integrity line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">Trendwest accepted as undisputed fact for summary judgment purposes that Damlahki made sexual advances to plaintiff on two \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d trips in March and May 2003. On the first occasion, he tried to touch her hair and leg, pretended to be lost, parked on an isolated dirt road, tried to kiss plaintiff, said he would like to sleep with her, touched her breasts, and touched her vagina through her underwear. He told her she should go along with him because he was her project director, and he would guarantee that she achieved the President\u2019s Club. On the second occasion, he drove her to his house, stating he wanted to show her some work-related documents and asked for five to 10 minutes of her personal time. Once inside his garage, he tried to kiss plaintiff, touched her breasts, put his hand up her dress, forced her hand down his pants between his pants and underwear, and tried to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>her to come inside his house. Plaintiff threatened to pepper spray him. He took her back to the office. Neither of them reentered the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Trendwest\u2019s motion also asserted that in December 2002, about a dozen workers from the Roseville office, including plaintiff and Damlahki, went to a bar for an informal social get-together not sponsored by Trendwest. Damlahki made people move so he could be next to plaintiff. When she leaned over the table, Damlahki whispered in her ear that she had nice breasts and he would like to see them again. Plaintiff was offended but said nothing because she is an attractive woman accustomed to this type of male attention. Plaintiff, Damlahki, and several others left the bar to go dancing. Plaintiff rode in Damlahki\u2019s car and invited him into her apartment when they stopped there on the way to the nightclub. At the club, Damlahki tried to dance close to plaintiff, but she rebuffed him. She says he asked her to give him a lap dance, and she was offended. She nevertheless accepted a ride home from Damlahki.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">In January 2003, Damlahki began calling plaintiff at her home and on her cell phone after business hours. She says he called other Trendwest employees looking for her. Plaintiff estimated he called her between 60 and 70 times between January and June of 2003. He left messages wanting to know her whereabouts. She characterized the messages as rude but not sexual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">In February 2003, Damlahki began to offer to take plaintiff places unrelated to work, including dinner, the opera, Paris, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. Damlahki told her he had paid his wife $50,000 to go to Syria for a month, and if plaintiff went to Las Vegas with him for the weekend, he would do something similar for her. Plaintiff inferred he was offering her $50,000 to accompany him to Las Vegas for purely personal reasons. After stalling, she finally picked a date, thinking it would be a downpayment on a house, but they never went on the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">Plaintiff never made use of Trendwest\u2019s antiharassment policies until she called the Integrity line after her employment ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">Trendwest submitted records showing plaintiff was terminated as of December 12, 2003, because she took leave of absence longer than six months, which made her subject to administrative termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">Responding to plaintiff\u2019s claim that coworker Sandy Klein complained about Damlahki, Trendwest submitted excerpts of Klein\u2019s deposition, in which Klein denied calling the Integrity line on behalf of herself or plaintiff. Klein also said she was never sexually harassed by Damlahki, and plaintiff never told her about any harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">Trendwest\u2019s vice-president for human resources, Kent R. Keoppel, submitted a declaration attesting that Trendwest does not sponsor or have mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>events' for employees at bars or nightclubs. The only event Trendwest sponsors is an annual holiday party. Keoppel attested, \u201cIt is contrary to Trendwest policy for salespeople to leave a sales office and follow a timeshare buyer to their residence to obtain payment.\u201d He also said that, throughout plaintiff\u2019s tenure, Trendwest had a policy against sexual harassment that was distributed to all employees and conducted antiharassment training. Trendwest received no complaint of sexual harassment against Damlahki on its Integrity line before plaintiff filed this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Trendwest\u2019s vice-president for Northern California, Kevin Fiore, attested Trendwest\u2019s policy was for customers to come to a Trendwest sales office with their credit card or checkbook. Salespeople at Trendwest\u2019s Roseville office came up with the idea of \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d to follow customers home if they failed to bring their checkbook or credit card. This practice was against Trendwest policy. Fiore also described the President\u2019s Club as a reward for top salespersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Trendwest argued it was entitled to summary judgment or summary adjudication of each count because (1) Damlahki\u2019s actions were personally motivated, outside the scope of his employment, and unforeseeable to Trendwest; (2) his actions did not constitute severe and pervasive conduct; (3) plaintiff never availed herself of Trendw\u00e9st\u2019s policies and procedures to prevent sexual harassment; and (4) Trendwest\u2019s conduct was not outrageous or intentional. Trendwest also sought summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim, as we discuss, <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">THE OPPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">Plaintiff filed an opposition to the summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Plaintiff submitted her own declaration attesting she was a successful salesperson at Trendwest until she suffered a mental breakdown in June 2003, as a result of Damlahki\u2019s harassment. She returned to work on November 15, 2003. Despite promises to stop, Damlahki resumed his sexual advances. She had a second mental breakdown and was hospitalized on December 7, 2003. Shortly after she returned to work in December 2003, Trendwest terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>On January 7, 2004, plaintiff called the Integrity line and complained about Damlahki\u2019s sexual harassment. Plaintiff later called the Integrity line for an update but was told they had no record of her having made a complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Plaintiff attested: \u201cIn approximately September or October 2003 I learned that most of the employees in the Roseville office were asked to and did in fact attend sessions, lectures, seminars on the policies of the company in reference to discrimination and harassment. I never was invited nor did I attend these lectures, etc [wc| on the subject of harassment and/or discrimination.\u201d Plaintiff ambiguously attested, \u201cthe only information I received on the subject of Trendwest\u2019s discrimination policy was contained in the employee handbook,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but she never received any of the discrimination and- harassment policies that Trendwest said it distributed to every employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Regarding her failure to call the Integrity line sooner, plaintiff attested: \u201cPrior to December 2003, aside from the name (integrity line) I knew little about its role or function in respect to reporting complaints of discrimination. Moreover ... we in the Roseville office had on many occasions been told by [Damlahki] that we were not to \u2018go over his head\u2019 for any problems that may arise from our employment. He let it be known, in no uncertain terms, that if an employee in the office did \u2018go over his head\u2019 and report a problem to personnel, or anyone senior to [Damlahki], that he would fire her or him. Since I had personally witnessed him fire at least three employees while I served under him, I had no reason to believe that he would not carry out his threat.\u201d Plaintiff asserted that, when she was in the hospital in June 2003, coworker Sandy Klein called the Integrity line to report a problem and also informed them that plaintiff was being sexually harassed. There was no followup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">On May 29, 2003, Damlahki insisted on accompanying plaintiff to \u201cdriv[e] for dollars\u201d though she did not need him, Damlahki drove her in his car. They talked about work-related matters. He had viewed a tape of a presentation she gave, and he offered suggestions for improvement. He spoke about achieving success on the job. He said, \u201cyou hang around people that are successful if you want to be successful yourself.\u201d He said he was successful. Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>inferred he was saying she should hang out with him. He also complained about his wife, who was in Syria. At the customer\u2019s house, Damlahki waited in the car while plaintiff went in and transacted business. Then, instead of driving plaintiff back to the office, Damlahki took her to his home, over her protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s declaration then refers the reader to her deposition transcript, in which she said that, after they left the customer\u2019s house, Damlahki put his hand on her leg and told her he could please her sexually. He tried to put her hand on his leg. She was scared. She objected when he drove past the exit to the office. He said he wanted to take her to his house for 10 minutes. She said no. He pulled into his garage, shut the door by remote control, then leaned over, pushed himself onto her and kissed her on the mouth while trying to put his hand up her dress. He continued groping her as she got out of the car and tried to get away from him. He pushed her up against the car and kissed her again. He unbuttoned some buttons on her dress and touched her bra and her breasts. When she managed to get out of the garage into the front yard, he stopped and apologized. He drove her back to the office. She did not tell anyone what happened because she was scared and was making good money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s declaration attested that Damlahki asked her numerous times to go away with him on expense-paid weekend trips. She understood he was tying these \u201cgifts\u201d to sexual favors. Plaintiff said she received favorable treatment from Damlahki in that he kept her name on the \u201cowner referral board\u201d even when she was late or missed work, which should have made her ineligible for the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">Plaintiff submitted her own separate statement of facts, asserting (1) Damlahki fired at least three persons at the Roseville office; (2) Trendwest knew he was a poor manager who frequently acted irrationally, threw tantrums, and intimidated his subordinates; (3) the employee handbook did not contain information required by the FEHA; (4) Trendwest did not have plaintiff participate in any seminar concerning harassment and did not adequately train project managers in handling harassment complaints; (5) discrimination complaints were not well received by senior management; and (6) other sexual harassment claims were filed by Trendwest employees. Plaintiff supported these assertions with her own declaration and deposition excerpts of former Trendwest manager Marlene Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">THE REPLY</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Trendwest filed a reply. Trendwest replied, \u201cIMMATERIAL\u201d to many of plaintiff\u2019s assertions and filed multiple evidentiary objections to plaintiff\u2019s declaration and Marlene Martin\u2019s deposition excerpts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>THE RULING</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">After the trial court allowed plaintiff to submit some revised papers to correct deficiencies in her opposition papers and sustained Trendwest\u2019s objections to unauthorized revisions, the trial court issued a written order granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">As to evidentiary objections, the trial court overruled Trendwest\u2019s objections to plaintiff\u2019s declaration and Martin\u2019s deposition excerpts. The court sustained Trendwest\u2019s objections to (1) Damlahki\u2019s \u201csupplemental response to plaintiff\u2019s separate statement\u201d and (2) plaintiff\u2019s revised/amended separate statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">The trial court explained its reasoning for granting summary adjudication of each count of the complaint, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-8\">The first and third counts, for sexual harassment (FEHA) and sexual battery, failed because the alleged incidents took place outside the workplace. Although the March 2003 and May 2003 incidents occurred while returning from customers\u2019 homes, Damlahki\u2019s actions were no longer related to his employer\u2019s interests as soon as he diverted from a return to the office and went to an isolated road or to his garage. Damlahki\u2019s declaration did not raise a triable issue of fact. Whether or not \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d was a Trendwest policy, as soon as Damlahki deviated from that task, he was no longer acting for Trendwest\u2019s benefit, but for his own personal gratification. Plaintiff conceded Damlahki\u2019s improprieties were for his own gratification. The alleged incidents were not work related or sanctioned by Trendwest. Damlahki\u2019s argument that the salesperson-mentor relationship might lead to improprieties was unconvincing to the trial court. The relationship is not such as predictably to create the risk employees will commit intentional torts of the type for which liability is sought. Damlahki\u2019s statements that any contact with plaintiff was encouraged by Trendwest as team building was a conclusion without factual support. There was no evidence Trendwest paid for the ski trip to Tahoe. Even if Trendwest had funded that trip, Damlahki\u2019s alleged groping would have been for his gratification, not Trendwest\u2019s. Trendwest\u2019s ultimate responsibility for placing plaintiff and Damlahki in a common business location was not sufficient to establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact. Plaintiff had not established conduct so pervasive as to alter the condition of employment. Prior to her termination, plaintiff did not complain, and she continued to associate with Damlahki outside of work, e.g., she rode with him to Lake Tahoe seven months after the incident at his house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-9\">The second count (failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harassment under the FEHA) failed because plaintiff conceded that failure to prevail on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>her battery/harassment claims precluded recovery on this count. Further, Trendwest\u2019s alleged knowledge that Damlahki was a \u201cloose cannon\u201d and that he lacked judgment, intelligence, maturity and management skills, did not constitute evidence that Trendwest knew it needed to take additional steps to prevent sexual harassment beyond those in its established sexual harassment program. Plaintiff alleged she made a complaint to Trendwest, via its Integrity line, in January 2004, after her termination. There was no record of that complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-4\">The fourth count (intentional infliction of emotional distress) failed for the same reasons as the first and third counts. Damlahki\u2019s conduct, even if it rose to a level actionable against him, could not be imputed to Trendwest because it was unrelated to his employment, took place outside of the work environment, outside the course and scope of employment, and was for Damlahki\u2019.s personal gratification only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-5\">The fifth count (retaliation) failed because plaintiff conceded she did not have sufficient evidence to support this cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-6\">The sixth count (false imprisonment) failed because Damlahki acted for his own personal \u2022 gratification, and his conduct could not be imputed to Trendwest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-7\">The seventh, count (quid pro quo sexual harassment) failed. Plaintiff attested Damlahki. implied that going away with him on weekend trips would help her career. Yet she provided no evidence that her employment or advancement was conditioned in any way on a favorable response. Indeed, in the same declaration, plaintiff stated Damlahki placed her on the coveted \u201cowner referral board\u201d even though she missed days at work, which should have, disqualified her, and she never went on a weekend trip with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">The trial court further concluded that, in the absence of any wrongful conduct by Trendwest, plaintiff\u2019s claim for punitive damages- against Trendwest also failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">Judgment was entered on January 24, 2006. Notice of entry of judgment was served on January 31, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">Trendwest filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under section 12965, subdivision (b), which gives the trial court.discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in an FEHA case. The motion sought $125,000. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>the trial court reduced the award to $40,000, based on its conclusion that only some of the counts were frivolous (the standard set by case law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment and the order granting attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">I. <em>Counts Not at Issue on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">As indicated (fns. 3 &amp; 4, <em>ante), </em>plaintiff on appeal presents no argument or analysis regarding count five (retaliatory discharge) and expressly states she does not contest the trial court\u2019s adverse ruling on count seven (quid pro quo sexual harassment). We therefore need not discuss those counts and shall affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of Trendwest\u2019s motion for summary adjudication as to counts five and seven. We now turn to the counts at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">II. <em>Count One\u2014Sexual Harassment Under the FEHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">Plaintiff argues Trendwest failed to show entitlement to summary judgment/adjudication on count one, sexual harassment in violation of the FEHA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">First, it is obvious this case includes conduct prohibited by the FEHA, i.e., conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create a hostile or abusive work environment. <em>(Lyle </em>v. <em>Warner Brothers Television Productions </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 264, 284 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 2, 132 P.3d 211].) We need not discuss each act alleged by plaintiff, because Damlahki\u2019s physical groping of plaintiff during \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d in and of itself constitutes actionable conduct sufficient to defeat summary judgment/adjudication of the FEHA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">In deciding whether Trendwest can be liable under the FEHA for conduct by Damlahki (who was plaintiff\u2019s supervisor), we are guided by the California Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the FEHA in <em>State Dept. of Health Services </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1026 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 441, 79 P.3d 556] <em>(Health Services):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">\u201cThe FEHA imposes two standards of employer liability for sexual harassment, depending on whether the person engaging in the harassment is the victim\u2019s supervisor or a nonsupervisory coemployee. The employer is liable for harassment by a nonsupervisory employee only if the employer (a) knew or should have known of the harassing conduct and (b) failed to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>immediate and appropriate corrective action. (\u00a7 12940, subd. (j)(l).[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]) This is a negligence standard. [Citation.] Because the FEHA imposes this negligence standard only for harassment \u2018by an employee other than an agent or supervisor\u2019 (\u00a7 12940, subd. (j)(l)), by implication the FEHA makes the employer strictly liable for harassment by a supervisor. [The California Supreme Court] and the Courts of Appeal have so stated. [Citations to cases dating back to 1989.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">\u201cThe applicable language of the FEHA does not suggest that an employer\u2019s liability for sexual harassment by a supervisor is constrained by principles of agency law. Had the Legislature so intended, it would have used language in the FEHA imposing the negligence standard of liability on acts of harassment by an employee \u2018other than an agent,\u2019 \u2018not acting as the employer\u2019s agent,\u2019 or \u2018not acting within the scope of an agency for the employer.\u2019 By providing instead in section 12940, subdivision 0(1), that the negligence standard applies to acts of harassment \u2018by an employee other than an agent <em>or </em>supervisor[,]\u2019 ... the Legislature has indicated that <em>all </em>acts of harassment by a supervisor are to be exempted from the negligence standard, whether or not the supervisor was then acting as the employer\u2019s agent, and that agency principles come into play only when the harasser is <em>not </em>a supervisor.\u201d <em>(Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 1040-1041.) The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cunder the FEHA, an employer is strictly liable for <em>all </em>acts of sexual harassment by a supervisor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\"><em>Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 1026, added: \u201cOf course, this analysis assumes the supervisor is acting in the capacity of supervisor when the harassment occurs. The employer is not strictly liable for a supervisor\u2019s acts of harassment resulting from a completely private relationship unconnected with the employment and not occurring at the workplace or during normal working hours. But instances of such harassment must be rare.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1041, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">The Supreme Court also said an employee\u2019s failure to avail herself of available protections offered by the employer (a point asserted by Trendwest in this case) may reduce the amount of damages for which the employer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>liable, but it would not provide the employer a complete defense. <em>(Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\"><em>Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 1026, reversed a summary judgment in favor of the employer and remanded for further proceedings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1049.) The Supreme Court reiterated the limits of its holding: \u201cAn employer continues to be strictly liable for hostile environment sexual harassment by a supervisor. An employee\u2019s failure to report harassment to the employer is not a defense on the merits to the employee\u2019s action under the FEHA, but at most it serves to reduce the damages recoverable. And it reduces those damages only if, taking account of the employer\u2019s antiharassment policies and procedures and its past record of acting on harassment complaints, the employee acted unreasonably in not sooner reporting the harassment to the employer.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Since an employee\u2019s failure to avail herself of available protections does not provide the employer with a complete defense, the posture of this appeal from summary judgment does not require us to address the parties\u2019 dispute about whether Trendwest adequately advised plaintiff of the availability of a grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Here, the trial court granted summary adjudication of the FEHA claims because the incidents took place outside die workplace, were not work related, and Damlahki was acting for his own personal interests rather than Trendwest\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">The trial court erred because, in order for the employer to avoid strict liability for the supervisor\u2019s actions under the FEHA, the harassment must result from a completely private relationship unconnected with the employment. Otherwise, the employer is strictly liable for the supervisor\u2019s actions regardless of whether the supervisor was acting as the employer\u2019s agent. <em>(Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1041 &amp; fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">Here, the harassment did not result from a completely private relationship unconnected with the employment. There was no personal dating relationship between plaintiff and Damlahki at the time of the most significant incidents, which occurred during the \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d excursions. The \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d excursions were obviously connected with the employment and of obvious benefit to the employer\u2019s enterprise. Although there is some evidence that Trendwest did not approve of \u201cdriving for dollars,\u201d the evidence was conflicting on the point (precluding summary adjudication), and even if Trendwest did not approve of the practice, it admittedly was aware of the practice, clearly would benefit from the practice, and did nothing to stop it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>On appeal, Trendwest does not mention <em>Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 1026, though it was cited by plaintiff in the trial court and on appeal. Trendwest instead focuses on a federal case cited by plaintiff on appeal <em>(Sparks v. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. </em>(11th Cir. 1987) 830 F.2d 1554) and argues plaintiff for the first time on appeal argues that general agency principles preclude application of respondeat superior in the context of this case, where the harasser is a supervisor. Trendwest argues plaintiff cannot raise a new argument on appeal and in any event reads the federal case too broadly. Trendwest argues- the sexual contact during the \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d excursions occurred <em>away from the workplace </em>and therefore require application of respondeat superior principles. Trendwest argues that, even if there was a work-related purpose at the outset of the excursions, that purpose was completed by the time the tortious conduct occurred. Under .Trendwest\u2019s reasoning, it would appear an employer would never be liable for sexual harassment by a supervisor, because the act of sexual harassment is never work related. The gropings. occurred during the \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d excursions, which were clearly work related. In any event, we need not address the federal case because we have already explained our conclusion is guided by <em>Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Moreover, Trendwest goes too far in trying to inject respondeat superior principles into an employer\u2019s strict liability for supervisors\u2019 misconduct under the FEHA. The California Supreme Court said in a footnote in <em>Farmers Ins. Group v. County of Santa Clara </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 992 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 478, 906 P.2d 440] <em>(Farmers) </em>(a case which we address in detail in our discussion of the common law claims, <em>post) </em>that \u201cregulations enacted by the Fair Employment and Housing Commission (FEHC) indicate that respondeat superior and scope of employment principles are supposed to play an integral role in fixing an employer\u2019s liability for both supervisor and nonsupervisor sexual harassment under the FEHA. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7286.6, subd. (b).) Yet it is reasonably clear that the purpose underlying the comprehensive statutory scheme is to ensure that all employers maintain their worksites free from prohibited sexual harassment, regardless of the lack of foreseeability of such harassment in their particular enterprises. (See Stats. 1984, ch. 1754, pp. 6403-6404.) Under the FEHA, however, there is a need to determine whether sexual conduct that occurs off the worksite or after working hours constitutes an \u2018unlawful employment practice\u2019 within the ambit of the act. (\u00a7 12940.) Although rigid principles of respondeat superior would not appear to apply to FEHA claims, they do provide guidance in such determinations. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1016, fn. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">The regulation cited in the <em>Farmers </em>footnote (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7286.6, subd. (b)) states; \u201cLiability of Employers. In view.of the common law theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>and its codification in California Civil Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>Section 2338,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] an employer or other covered entity shall be hable for the discriminatory actions of its supervisors, managers or agents committed within the scope of their employment or relationship with the covered entity or, as defined in Section 7287.6 (b) [affirmative defense of business necessity to overcome facially neutral practice which has discriminatory effect], for the discriminatory actions of its employees where it is demonstrated that, as a result of any such discriminatory action, the applicant or employee has suffered a loss of or has been denied an employment benefit.\u201d (Cal, Code Regs, tit. 2, \u00a7 7286.6, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">The <em>Farmers </em>footnote also cited <em>Capitol City Foods, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1042 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 418], in which we held an employer was entitled to summary judgment on an FEHA claim where an employee claimed her supervisor raped her at his parent\u2019s house after she agreed to meet him for a date. We said that regulations promulgated under the FEHA indicated that, under the theory of respondeat superior, an employer is liable for harassment by supervisors committed within the scope of employment or the relationship with the employer. <em>(Capitol City Foods, </em>at p. 1047.) The employer argued that, before it could be held strictly liable for the harassing conduct of an employee, even one in a supervisory position, agency principles must first be applied. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The employer noted the supervisor was off duty during the incident, the parties agreed to the date, there was no evidence he used his authority as a supervisor to compel the plaintiff\u2019s presence, and the fact that he made a phone call to excuse her from work was insufficient to bring his conduct within the scope of employment. <em>(Id. </em>fit pp. 1048, 1050.) Agreeing that the employer was entitled to summary judgment, we said harassing conduct need not occur in the workplace, but it must occur in a work-related context. <em>{Ibid.) </em>We cited a precedential decision of FEHC (Fair Employment and Housing Commission) that where a supervisor exerted and exploited his authority to compel an employee\u2019s attendance at several meals away from the office, the use and abuse of his supervisory status sufficed to bring within the ambit of the FEHA the sexually harassing conduct that occurred away from the workplace. <em>(Capitol City foods, </em>at pp. 1048-1049, citing <em>DFEH </em>v. <em>Bee Hive Answering Service </em>(June 7, 1984) FEHC Dec. No. 84-16.) We also said the FEHC \u201chas applied common law agency principles to determine whether sexually harassing conduct was work-related.\u201d <em>(Capitol City Foods, </em>at p. 1049.) Even assuming the rape would not have occurred but for his position as the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor, the employer conclusively refuted the allegation that the supervisor forced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>plaintiff to accompany him or coerced her in any way prior to her entering his bedroom. His phone call to excuse her from work was insufficient to support an inference that he was acting within the scope of his employment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1049-1050.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">From the foregoing precedents, the Second Appellate District, in holding a demurrer was erroneously sustained, \u201cdistill[ed] the principle that while an employer\u2019s liability under the [FEHA] for an act of sexual harassment committed by a supervisor or agent is <em>broader </em>than the liability created by the common law principle of respondeat superior, respondeat superior principles are nonetheless relevant in determining liability when ... the sexual harassment occurred away from the workplace and not during work hours.\u201d <em>(Doe v. Capital Cities </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1048-1049 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 122] [aspiring actor\u2019s complaint adequately alleged a viable FEHA claim against casting director\u2019s employer for rape at a meeting at the casting director\u2019s home on a Sunday].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">As clarified in the more recent case of <em>Health Services, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 1026, however, an employer\u2019s FEHA liability for sexual harassment by a supervisor is not constrained by principles of agency law, unless the supervisor is not acting in the capacity of supervisor when the harassment occurs, but such cases will be rare, i.e., where the supervisor\u2019s acts of harassment result from a completely private relationship unconnected with the employment and not occurring at the workplace or during normal working hours. (31 Cal.4th at p. 1041 &amp; fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Here, as indicated, the worst incidents occurred during working hours but away from the office during the \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d incidents. Trendwest has not shown with undisputed evidence that there was any personal consensual dating relationship between plaintiff and Damlahki. That Damlahki sometimes socialized with his staff outside the office does not establish a personal dating relationship between him and plaintiff. Although there is evidence plaintiff agreed to go away with him on a personal trip to Las Vegas, her evidence indicated she felt coerced, and the trip never happened. At best for Trendwest, the matter would present a triable issue, precluding summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Trendwest suggests that none of the foregoing discussion matters, because plaintiff has failed to address an additional ground for the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, i.e., that plaintiff failed to show she was bothered by Damlahki\u2019s conduct in that she failed to complain of his conduct during her employment and continued to socialize with him outside the office. Trendwest notes a plaintiff who does not perceive the workplace as hostile or abusive will not prevail, even if it is objectively so. <em>(Lyle v. Warner Brothers Television </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number><em>Productions, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 284.) However, a triable issue precludes summary adjudication, since plaintiff presented evidence (her declaration) that she was committed to a mental hospital in June 2003 (shortly after the March and May 2003 \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d incidents), for a mental breakdown she attributes to the harassment, and she later returned to work because Damlahki promised to leave her alone (a promise he broke).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">We conclude the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication of plaintiff\u2019s FEHA claims because Trendwest failed to show entitlement to summary adjudication of count one, FEHA sexual harassment. Our conclusion requires reversal of the judgment. However, Trendwest moved in the alternative for summary adjudication of each cause of action. We therefore address the parties\u2019 contentions about the other counts of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">III. <em>The Other FEHA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">Count two of plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged failure to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment as required by the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">The trial court granted Trendwest\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of count two because \u201c[pjlaintiff concedes that failure to prevail on her battery/harassment causes of action precludes recovery. Further, Trendwest\u2019s knowledge that Damlahki was a \u2018loose cannon\u2019 and that he \u2018lacked judgment, intelligence, maturity and management skills,\u2019 does not evidence Trendwest\u2019s knowledge that it needed to take additional steps to prevent sexual harassment by Damlahki beyond those in its established sexual harassment program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">Since we reverse summary adjudication of the FEHA harassment claim (count one), the trial court\u2019s first ground cannot stand. We need not decide the validity of the second ground given by the trial court, because we agree with plaintiff that summary adjudication of count two was precluded by the existence of a triable issue as to whether Trendwest complied with its statutory obligation (\u00a7 12950) to inform plaintiff of remedies available through the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and FEHC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">Thus, count two alleged in part that Trendwest violated section 12950, which requires in part that employers provide employees with information about \u201c[tjhe legal remedies and complaint process available through the department and the commission,\u201d and \u201c[djirections on how to contact the department and the commission.\u201d (\u00a7 12950, subd. (b)(5)\u2014(6).) The remedy for a violation of section 12950 is injunctive relief, which is what plaintiff sought. (\u00a7 12950, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>Trendwest failed to show it complied with section 12950, a defect noted in plaintiff\u2019s appellate brief. Trendwest asserted it distributed information about its antiharassment policy to employees and had posters regarding sexual harassment in its Roseville office, but Trendwest\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts said nothing specific about informing employees of DFEH and FEHC. On appeal, Trendwest says it provided competent evidence that a DFEH pamphlet was distributed to all Northern California employees, but plaintiff denied receiving it. However, Trendwest merely presented a copy of a DFEH pamphlet (DFEH-185 (4/01)) attached to a June 2005 declaration of Trendwest\u2019s human resources vice-president, Kent Keoppel, indicating Trendwest distributes this pamphlet to employees. We see nothing showing this pamphlet was distributed during plaintiff\u2019s tenure. Keoppel\u2019s declaration also said that throughout plaintiff\u2019s tenure, Trendwest had a policy against sexual harassment, of which it informed employees. Again, we see nothing showing that during plaintiff\u2019s employment Trendwest advised employees of DFEH\u2019s complaint process or gave directions on how to contact DFEH. We reject Trendwest\u2019s argument that plaintiff must show authority that her nonreceipt of the pamphlet raises a triable issue where Trendwest had equivalent policies and procedures in place. Trendwest\u2019s institution of its own grievance procedure does not excuse its violation of section 12950. Additionally, plaintiff presented evidence suggesting Damlahki dissuaded his subordinates from complaining about him to his superiors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">We conclude Trendwest failed to show the absence of a triable issue on count two, failure to take reasonable steps required by the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">Plaintiff also sought damages under count two for failure to take all reasonable steps under another statute, section 12940. We need not address the parties\u2019 arguments on this point, because Trendwest\u2019s failure to disprove a section 12950 violation precludes summary adjudication on count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">We conclude Trendwest failed to show entitlement to summary adjudication on count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">IV. <em>The Common Law Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">Plaintiff argues the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication as to the common law claims of sexual battery (count three), false imprisonment (count six), and intentional infliction of emotional distress (count four). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">There is no common law cause of action for sexual harassment, but conduct constituting sexual harassment may be alleged in common law claims such as battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>(Medix </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number><em>Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 109, 118-119 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\">The trial court ruled that Damlahki\u2019s conduct could not be imputed to Trendwest because his conduct was unrelated to his employment, took place outside the workplace, and was for Damlahki\u2019s personal gratification only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">We observe two doctrines may be implicated in assessing liability against an employer. One doctrine is respondeat superior, pursuant to which the employer is indirectly or vicariously liable for torts committed by its employees within the scope of their employment. <em>(Mary M. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 208 [285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341] <em>(Mary M.).) </em>The other doctrine is- an agency theory pursuant to which an employer may be directly liable for acts of its agents. \u201cVicarious liability based on the tort doctrine of respondeat superior and direct liability based on the theory of actual or ostensible agency are different liability theories which cases do not always distinguish between. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Inter Mountain Mortgage, Inc. v. Sulimen </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1440, fn. 4 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 790].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Plaintiff has not clearly presented a theory of direct liability based on agency in connection with the common law counts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore need not consider it as a separate doctrine. <em>(Kim </em>v. <em>Sumitomo Bank </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 974, 979 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 834].) However, as we discuss, <em>post, </em>there is some overlap, and plaintiff does argue that Trendwest can be vicariously liable for Damlahki\u2019s misuse of his supervisory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">We turn to the respondeat superior theory. Plaintiff focuses on the trial court\u2019s comments that Damlahki\u2019s detour in his car during \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d took him outside the scope of employment. Plaintiff argues \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d was a \u201cspecial errand\u201d within the scope of respondeat superior, and the trip was still work related even when Damlahki took a detour to molest plaintiff. Even accepting plaintiff\u2019s arguments on these points, however, they are not enough to defeat summary adjudication in favor of Trendwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">We take guidance from the analysis of the Supreme Court in <em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992. <em>Farmers </em>is not directly on point because it involved a public employer, and the issue was whether the employee\u2019s conduct was within the scope of employment so as to trigger the employer\u2019s duty to defend the employee under the Tort Claims Act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 995-996.6.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>However; the Supreme Court said the Tort Claims Act was governed by the general principles of the respondeat superior doctrine in actions by third persons against the employer for the torts of the employee. <em>(Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1003.) Ordinarily, scope of employment presents a question of fact, but it becomes a question of law when the facts are undisputed and no conflicting inferences are possible. <em>(Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\"><em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, was an indemnification suit by a male deputy sheriff and his homeowners insuran.ee company to recover from his employer (the county) money he paid to settle a federal court action brought against him by female deputy sheriffs for sexual harassment (FEHA and copimon law claims). (11 Cal.4th at pp. 999-1000.) He admitted conduct such as touching one female\u2019s thighs, slapping another\u2019s buttocks, telling the females he wanted to \u201ceat pussy\u201d and \u201cbutt fuck\u201d them, and telling one female he was supervising that she would have to \u201cgive him head\u201d, to complete her training. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 998.) At trial in the federal court, some of the females obtained a. judgment against the employer under the FEHA. (11 Cal.4th at p. 1000.) In the state court indemnification action, the trial court granted summary judgment to the employer, concluding the male deputy\u2019s conduct was outside the scope of employment as a matter of law. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1000-1001.) The Court of Appeal reversed. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\"><em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, reiterated scope of employment principles under the respondeat superior doctrine, stating an employer is liable for risks arising out of the employment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1003.) A risk arises out of the employment when in the context of the particular enterprise an employee\u2019s conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer\u2019s business. Where the question is one of vicarious liability, the inquiry should be whether the risk was one that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the employer. Accordingly, the employer\u2019s liability extends beyond his actual or possible control of the employee to include risks inherent in or created by the enterprise. <em>(Ibid.) </em>One way to determine whether a risk is inherent in, or created by, an enterprise is to ask whether the actual occurrence was a generally foreseeable consequence of the activity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1004.) However, foreseeability in this context must be distinguished from foreseeability as a test for negligence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the latter sense \u201cforeseeable\u201d means a level of probability that would lead a prudent person to take effective precautions, whereas \u201cforeseeability\u201d as a test for respondeat superior merely means that in the context of the particular enterprise an employee\u2019s conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the resulting loss in the employer\u2019s cost of doing business. <em>(Ibid..)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number><em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, said scope of employment has been interpreted broadly under the respondeat superior doctrine in California. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1004.) For example, the fact that an employee is not engaged in the ultimate object of his employment at the time of his wrongful act does not preclude attribution of liability to an employer. Acts necessary to the comfort, convenience, health, and welfare of the employee while at work, though strictly personal and not acts of service, do not take the employee outside the scope of employment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, when an employee is combining his own business with that of his employer, or attending to both at substantially the same time, \u201c \u2018 \u201cno nice inquiry will be made as to which business he was actually engaged in at the time of injury, unless it clearly appears that neither directly nor indirectly could he have been serving his employer.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>An employer\u2019s vicarious liability may extend to willful and malicious torts of an employee as well as negligence, and employee\u2019s tortious act may be within the scope of employment even if it contravenes an express company rule and confers no benefit to the employer. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\"><em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, said: \u201cNotwithstanding the generally broad view given to scope of employment determinations, the law is clear that an employer is not strictly liable for all actions of its employees during working hours. Significantly, an employer will not be held vicariously liable for an employee\u2019s malicious or tortious conduct if the employee <em>substantially </em>deviates from the employment duties for personal purposes. [Citations.] Thus, if the employee \u2018inflicts an injury out of personal malice, not engendered by the employment\u2019 [citation] or acts out of \u2018personal malice unconnected with the employment\u2019 [citation], or if the misconduct is not an \u2018outgrowth\u2019 of the employment [citation], the employee is not acting within the scope of employment. Stated another way, \u2018[i]f an employee\u2019s tort is personal in nature, mere presence at the place of employment and attendance to occupational duties prior or subsequent to the offense will not give rise to a cause of action against the employer under the doctrine of respondeat superior.\u2019 [Citation.] In such cases, the losses do not foreseeably result from the conduct of the employer\u2019s enterprise and so are not fairly attributable to the employer as a cost of doing business.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1004-1005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\"><em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, continued: \u201cIn a context more analogous to this case, several decisions have addressed whether an employee\u2019s sexual misconduct directed toward a third party is within the scope of employment for respondeat superior purposes. Those cases hold that, except where sexual misconduct by on-duty police officers against members of the public is involved [citations], the employer is not vicariously liable to the third party for such misconduct [citations to cases where a church was held not liable for repeated acts of sexual assault on a minor by a Sunday school teacher, an archbishop was not liable for priests\u2019 seduction of parishioner, and a school district was not liable for a janitor\u2019s rape of a student]. In those decisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>vicarious liability was rejected as a matter of law because it could not be demonstrated that the various acts of sexual misconduct arose from the conduct of the respective enterprises. In particular, the- acts had been undertaken solely for the employees\u2019 personal gratification and had no purpose connected to the employment. Moreover, the acts had not been engendered by events or conditions relating to any employment duties or tasks; nor had they been'necessary to the employees\u2019 comfort', convenience, health, or welfare while at work.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (11 Cal.4th at pp. 1006-1007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Turning its attention to the facts before it, <em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, held the male deputy\u2019s conduct was outside the scope of employment as a matter of law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1007.) His conduct, although it took place at the workplace during work hours, was motivated by personal reasons unrelated to his job duties and was in direct violation of the-employer\u2019s sexual harassment policy. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Supreme Court rejected the argument that sexual harassment is foreseeable in any workplace. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1008.) \u201cWhile it is no doubt true that sexual harassment is a pervasive problem and that many workers in many different fields of employment have experienced some form of uninvited and unwanted sexual attention, this argument stretches the respondeat superior foreseeability concept beyond its logical limits. . . . [I]n determining whether a risk is \u2018unusual of startling\u2019 for respondeat superior purposes, \u2018 \u201cthe inquiry should be whether the risk was one \u2018that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental\u2019 <em>to the enterprise undertaken by'the employer.\u201d </em>\u2019 [Citations.] Thus, it is not enough that\u2019 a risk be neither unusual nor startling as a general matter; rather, the risk must be evaluated in the context of the employer\u2019s particular enterprise. [Citations.] . . . [E]vidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>general prevalence of sexual harassment in workplaces and in newly integrated work environments has little, if any, probative value in determining whether lewd propositioning and offensive touchings of coworkers are typical of or broadly incidental to the particular enterprise here\u2014a county jail.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">The Supreme Court also said in <em>Farmers, </em>supra, 11 Cal.4th 992: \u201cEven if the evidence shows that the use of profanity and sexually explicit language was not uncommon at this particular county jail, it still falls far short of establishing that serious misconduct such as asking individual employees for sexual favors and targeting those individuals for inappropriate touching is either typical of or broadly incidental to the operation of a county jail or to the duties and tasks of deputy sheriffs at such a jail. [Citations.] [][] Moreover, factors that might be relevant to whether the County itself acted negligently are not relevant to whether the County should be vicariously liable for an employee\u2019s misconduct regardless of its own fault. [Citations.] Accordingly, even assuming arguendo that the usage of profanity and crude language at the jail should have put the County on notice that [the employee\u2019s] actions were \u2018foreseeable\u2019 in a negligence sense despite the absence of a causal link between the acts of sexual harassment and [his] work as a deputy sheriff, that is a matter lacking relevance in scope of employment analysis.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1011.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">The Supreme Court also said that, although the male deputy was the supervisor of one of the females for part of the time in question, his power over her was in no way comparable to the extraordinary power police officers exercise over members of the public (in which context vicarious liability has been imposed). <em>(Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 1011-1012.) <em>Farmers </em>thus distinguished a case upon which plaintiff here relies heavily, <em>Mary M. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 202, which held a public entity employer could be liable when an on-duty police officer used his authority to rape a citizen (if the jury so decided). <em>Farmers </em>said <em>Mary M. </em>emphasized police officers occupy a unique position of trust in our society and are given authority to detain, arrest, and use deadly force if necessary. <em>(Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1012.) When officers abuse their authority by committing crimes against members of the community, they violate the public trust and may erode the community\u2019s confidence in the integrity of its police force. <em>(Ibid.) Farmers </em>said, \u201cPlainly there is no parallel between the supervisory authority in the instant case and the formidable, official authority at issue in <em>Mary </em>M.\u201d <em>(Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1012.) <em>Farmers </em>added: \u201c[F]or purposes of respondeat superior, employees do not act within the scope of employment when they abuse job-created authority over others for purely personal reasons.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1013.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>Thus, we reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that <em>Mary M., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 202, supports her case on the basis that Damlahki\u2019s misconduct resulted from his misuse of his authority as her supervisor and project director.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\"><em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, considered whether imposing vicarious liability would further the three policy justifications for the respondeat superior doctrine: (1) to prevent recurrence of the tortious conduct; (2) to give greater assurance of compensation for the victim; and (3) to ensure that the victim\u2019s losses will be equitably borne by those who benefit from the enterprise that gave rise to the injury. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1013.) <em>Farmers </em>found it significant that the FEHA already requires employers to take steps to prevent harassment and in some circumstances imposes direct liability on the employer. (Fa<em>rmers, </em>at pp. 1014, 1020.) Because the potential for direct liability under the FEHA already furnishes powerful motivation for the employer to maintain antiharassment policies, the imposition of vicarious liability was not essential to create a strong incentive for vigilance by those in a position to guard against the evil to be prevented. <em>(Farmers, </em>at p. 1015.) <em>Farmers </em>said the second justification (compensation of victims) was a neutral factor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1016.) The third factor (bearing of loss by those who benefit from the enterprise) did not justify imposing vicarious liability, because the male deputy exercised no job-conferred authority over the females during some of the misconduct, and even if the court were to consider only the misconduct that he committed as a supervisor, the case did not implicate the factors present in <em>Mary M., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 202, i.e., considerable authority and control inherent in the responsibilities of an officer enforcing the law, or the substantial benefits that the community derived therefrom. <em>(Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1017.) <em>Farmers </em>concluded consideration of the three respondeat superior policy justifications reinforced its determination that the male deputy\u2019s lewd propositioning and offensive touching of his trainee and coworkers were not within the scope of his employment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Applying <em>Farmers </em>to the case before us, we conclude .Damlahki\u2019s sexual conduct towards plaintiff was outside the scope of employment as a matter of law, motivated by personal reasons unrelated to his job duties and in violation of the employer\u2019s sexual harassment policy. Even though plaintiff characterizes Damlahki\u2019s job as including mentoring of salespersons, which could lead to emotional relationships, Damlahki\u2019s sexual conduct toward plaintiff was not typical of or broadly incidental to Trendwest\u2019s enterprise of selling time-shares. We also consider the respondeat superior policy justifications: (1) to prevent recurrence of the tortious conduct; (2) to give greater assurance of compensation for the victim; and (3) to ensure that the victim\u2019s losses will be equitably borne by those who benefit from the enterprise that gave rise to the injury. As in <em>Farmers, </em>we consider it significant that Trendwest is already subject to strict liability under the FEHA for the conduct of Damlahki as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s supervisor. Thus, common law liability is not needed to advance the respondeat superior policy justifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">In her reply brief, plaintiff cites <em>Jacobus v. Krambo Corp. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1096 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 425], an indemnification action, which held an employee sued by a coworker for sexual harassment was entitled to indemnification from his employer for the legal costs in successfully defending against the sexual harassment action. There, the test was whether the conduct defended against was within the course and scope of employment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1103.) In the underlying suit, the \u201charasser\u201d conceded he discussed his sex life with the coworker, engaged in sexual bantering with her, and showed her sexually explicit materials. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1102.) The First Appellate District held this conduct fell within the scope of employment, as it was simply part of the social intercourse that occasionally occurs in modem office settings. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1103-1106.) Social interactions among employees, including sharing of personal or private information, are broadly incidental to the employer\u2019s enterprise. The facts also suggested the co worker asserted her sexual harassment claim to deflect an adverse performance review, which the appellate court held was a risk inherent in employment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, plaintiff neglects to acknowledge the First Appellate District\u2019s statements that the jury in the underlying action answered \u201cno\u201d to the question whether Jacobus sexually harassed the coworker, and \u201cin light of the verdict in the underlying action, Jacobus\u2019s conduct must necessarily be viewed as something other than sexual misconduct or sexual harassment. ... In light of this verdict and what appears to be the entirely consensual interchange between Jacobus and [the co worker], [the First Appellate District] conclude [d] that the conduct of Jacobus was simply part of the social intercourse that occasionally occurs in modem office settings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1103.) Here, there is no jury finding that sexual harassment did not occur, and the evidence indicates nonconsensual sexual contact. <em>Jacobus </em>has no bearing on the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">We conclude Trendwest is not liable for Damlahki\u2019s conduct under the common law counts of plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">Plaintiff argues <em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, is distinguishable because it did not involve misconduct by a supervisor. She is wrong, because <em>Farmers </em>discussed the fact that the male deputy supervised one of the female deputies during at least some of his misconduct. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 998, 1001, 1017.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">Plaintiff also argues <em>Farmers, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 992, is distinguishable because in this case a triable issue exists as to whether the sexual battery and false imprisonment were foreseeable results or were engendered by or an outgrowth of the work at Trendwest. Plaintiff says Damlahki\u2019s declaration shows he worked closely with his employees in order to motivate them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>become successful salespersons, which was for everyone\u2019s economic benefit. His contact with employees after office hours was for this purpose. His management style of close relationships with salespersons was known to Trendwest. Plaintiff argues Damlahki\u2019s style of training and motivating his staff was likely to lead to the development of personal relationships. Plaintiff quotes from <em>Carr v. Wm. C. Crowell Co. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 652 [171 P.2d 5]: \u201cSuch associations \u2018include the faults and derelictions of human beings as well as their virtues and obediences. Men do not discard their personal qualities when they go to work. Into the job they carry their .intelligence,-, skill, habits of care and rectitude. Just as inevitably they take along also their tendencies to carelessness and camaraderie, as well as emotional makeup. In bringing men together, work brings these qualities together, causes frictions between them, creates occasions for lapses into carelessness, and for fun-making and emotional flareup. Work could not go on if men became automatons repressed in every natural expression. . . . These expressions of human nature are incidents inseparable from working together. They involve risks of injury and these risks are inherent in the working environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 656.) However, the conduct in <em>Carr </em>was one construction worker impulsively throwing a hammer at another worker when they got into a dispute about one\u2019s work interfering with the other\u2019s work. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 653.) <em>Carr </em>does not help plaintiff here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">As indicated, plaintiff argues Trendwest can be vicariously liable for Damlahki\u2019s misuse of his supervisory authority. Though not cited for this proposition in plaintiff\u2019s opening brief on appeal, we note that in <em>Capitol City Foods, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pages 1049 through 1050, in discussing respondeat superior in an FEHA cas\u00e9, we observed the FEHC has applied common law agency principles to determine whether sexually harassing conduct was work related. We said: \u201cUnder comriion law agency principles, a principal is liable for the torts of his agent if the agent was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relationship. (Rest.2d Agency, \u00a7 219, subd. (2)(d) [see now Rest.3d Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 7.03, 7.08<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>].) Under this theory of agency an employer may be liable when a supervisory employee uses the authority of his position to sexually harass an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>employee. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Capitol City Foods, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1049, fn. 2.) In <em>Capitol City Foods, </em>we said the plaintiff (who consented to date her supervisor) \u201cdid not allege the harassment was conditioning her job upon a demand for sexual favors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1049, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Here, we see nothing indicating Damlahki conditioned plaintiff\u2019s job upon a demand for sexual favors. To the contrary, the trial court granted summary adjudication in favor of Trendwest on plaintiff\u2019s claim for quid pro quo harassment (which alleged that in December 2003 Damlahki offered to help plaintiff succeed at work in exchange for sexual favors), and plaintiff states on appeal that she does not challenge this ruling. The trial court noted the quid pro quo claim arose from an inference drawn by plaintiff without supporting evidence, and to the contrary, evidence showed Damlahki placed her, on the coveted \u201cowner referral board\u201d even though her absences from work should have disqualified her. We recognize that plaintiff attested Damlahki exerted his authority over her by insisting on accompanying her on \u201cdriving for dollars,\u201d over her protests that it was unnecessary. However, she also admitted they had extensive work-related discussions during the drive, including his suggestions on how she could improve her group presentations. That Damlahki told plaintiff he wanted to show her something work-related at his house does not bring this case within respondeat superior liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">We conclude the trial court properly granted summary adjudication in favor of Trendwest on the common law counts of plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">V. <em>Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">Plaintiff argues the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication in favor of Trendwest on plaintiff\u2019s claim for punitive damages. We shall conclude Trendwest failed to establish entitlement to summary adjudication regarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">The complaint sought punitive damages for both the FEHA and the common law counts. Our affirmance of summary adjudication in favor of Trendwest regarding the common law counts defeats plaintiff\u2019s claim for punitive damages on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-10\">However, the question remains of punitive damages on the FEHA counts. A court can award Civil Code section 3294 punitive damages in an FEHA case. <em>(Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 215 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912].)  A party can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>move for summary adjudication of a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (f)(1)), and Trendwest did so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">Trendwest asserted in its motion that it was moving for summary adjudication of punitive damages on the ground that Damlahki was not Trendwest\u2019s managing agent. This was a reference to Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b), which states: \u201cAn employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">Trendwest mistakenly reads this statute as stating that punitive damages cannot be awarded against a corporation for the conduct of an employee who is not a corporate officer, director, or managing agent. To the contrary, the statute says punitive damages cannot be awarded against a corporation for conduct of an employee unless a corporate officer, director, or managing agent had knowledge of the employee\u2019s unfitness and disregarded the rights of others (or authorized/ratified the conduct or committed the act of oppression).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">In its separate statement of undisputed facts, on the issue of punitive damages, Trendwest merely repeated everything it asserted with regard to each count of the complaint. Trendwest submitted a declaration from its vice-president of human resources, Kent R. Keoppel, attesting Trendwest is a corporate employer, headquartered in Redmond, Washington, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cendant Timeshare Resort Group, which is headquartered in Orlando, Florida. Trendwest policies are formulated in Washington or Florida. Keoppel attested Damlahki was never an officer or director of Trendwest and had no control over or authority to make policy for Trendwest. Keoppel equated Damlahki\u2019s position to that of a retail store manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-7\">Plaintiff responded, \u201cUndisputed but disputed as to the conclusion that Daml[ah]ki was the equivalent of a retail store manager.\u201d Plaintiff cited her own deposition testimony Damlahki told her that \u201ccorporate\u201d told him not to go on a trip to Lake Tahoe with his subordinates, and he said he told them \u201cfuck you,\u201d he was going to go anyway. Plaintiff also cited deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>testimony of Marlene Martin, a former Trendwest project director, who said each project director \u201cran their own store,\u201d but they could not bend upper management\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">The trial court granted summary adjudication to Trendwest on the issue of punitive damages because \u201c[i]n the absence of any wrongful conduct by Trendwest, plaintiff cannot be entitled to punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Our reversal of the judgment necessarily invalidates the trial court\u2019s reasoning. At this point, it has not yet been determined whether Trendwest may be liable under the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">We can affirm a trial court\u2019s decision for reasons different from those of the trial court. <em>(Troche </em>v. <em>Daley </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 403, 407-408 [266 Cal.Rptr. 34].) However, we decline to do so in this case\u2014not because a question exists as to whether Damlahki was a managing agent, but rather because Damlahki\u2019s status alone does not resolve the question of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">Thus, we agree with Trendwest that Damlahki was not a corporate officer, director, or managing agent within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294. The determination whether a supervisor is a \u201cmanaging agent\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294 \u201c \u2018does not necessarily hinge on their \u201clevel\u201d in the corporate hierarchy. Rather, the critical inquiry is the degree of discretion the employees possess in making decisions that will ultimately determine corporate policy.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kelly-Zurian </em>v. <em>Wohl Shoe Co. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 397, 421 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 457].) In <em>Kelly-Zurian, </em>the supervisor was the highest ranking person in the employer\u2019s Southern California offices and had immediate and direct control over the plaintiff, including the authority to terminate her employment. Nevertheless, he was not a managing agent within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294, because he did not have authority to change or establish business policy for the company\u2019s Southern California offices. Such policies were established by the corporate headquarters in St. Louis. (22 Cal.App.4th at pp. 421-422.) Thus, a supervisor must be in a corporate policymaking position in order to be considered a managing agent for purposes of imposing punitive damages liability on the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Here, Trendwest presented evidence that Damlahki did not have policy-making authority, and plaintiff did not refute that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">Plaintiff says in her reply brief she <em>did </em>dispute this point. She says there was evidence in this case that Damlahki was unfit as a project director, and his unfitness was brought to the attention of upper management. Plaintiff says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>that, given this evidence, summary adjudication was patently erroneous. However, evidence that Damlahki was unfit as project director says nothing about whether he had policymaking authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">On the other hand, knowledge by upper management that Damlahki was unfit might provide a basis for punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294, and this basis was not addressed in Trendwest\u2019s separate statement of facts concerning punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">We conclude Trendwest is not entitled to summary adjudication on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">VI. <em>Attorney\u2019s. Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">Since we reverse the trial court\u2019s summary adjudication of the FEHA counts, we will also reverse the trial court\u2019s award of FEHA attorney\u2019s fees to Trendwest under section 12965, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Though not clear, it appears Trendwest may believe the award is nevertheless sustainable on the, ground it was awarded for frivolous counts unchallenged by plaintiff on appeal. Thus, the trial court cited case law that the standard for awarding attorney\u2019s fees was whether the FEHA claims, against Trendwest were frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. The court said that, although plaintiff did not prevail on count one (sexual harassment), the sexual harassment claim was not frivolous. However, said the court, the other three FEHA counts (failure to take reasonable steps, retaliation, and quid pro quo harassment) were frivolous. The trial court concluded most of Trendwest\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees would have been incurred in opposing the nonfnvolous sexual harassment count, and the court therefore awarded only $40,000, rather than the $125,000 requested by Trendwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">Our reversal of summary adjudication of count two (failure to take , reasonable steps) warrants reversal of the order awarding attorney\u2019s fees. In, the absence of express argument on the point, we decline to consider whether section 12965, subdivision (b), should be construed to authorize an interim award of attorney\u2019s fees to Trendwest as prevailing party on a motion for summary adjudication of the two counts (retaliation and quid pro quo harassment) unchallenged by plaintiff on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an order (1) denying Trendwest\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of counts one and two (sexual harassment and failure to take steps to prevent harassment under the FEHA), (2) denying Trendwest\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages alleged in count one (no punitive damages were alleged in count two), and (3) granting Trendwest\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of plaintiff\u2019s other counts (counts three through seven).

In holding a hospital was not vicariously liable for an ultrasound technician\u2019s sexual molestation of a patient during an ultrasound examination, <em>Lisa M. </em>said, \u201ca sexual tort will not be considered engendered by the employment unless 'its motivating emotions were fairly attributable to work-related events or conditions. Here the opposite was true: a technician simply took advantage of solitude with a naive patient to commit an assault for reasons unrelated to his work. [His] job was to perform, a diagnostic examination and record the results. The task provided no occasion for a work-related dispute or any other work-related emotional involvement with the patient..The technician\u2019s decision to engage in conscious exploitation of the patient did not <em>arise out of </em>the performance of the examination, although the circumstances of the examination made it possible. \u2018If . . . the assault was not motivated or triggered off by anything in the employment activity but was the result of only propinquity and .lust, -there should,be no liability.\u2019 <em>(Lyon </em>v. <em>Carey </em>(D.C.

In the federal <em>Lyon </em>case, a deliveryman got into a dispute at a customer\u2019s home as to whether he would take a check rather than cash and whether he had to carry the goods upstairs. He then raped the woman customer and cut her.

The purposes likely intended to be met by the \u2018aided in accomplishing\u2019 basis are satisfied by a more fully elaborated treatment of apparent authority and by the duty of reasonable care that a principal owes to third parties with whom it interacts through employees and other agents.\u201d (Rest.3d Agency, \u00a7 7.08, com. b, p. 228.) The Restatement Third of Agency combines a principal\u2019s direct liability and vicarious liability in one provision, section 7.03, which says the principal is (1) directly liable when the agent acts with actual authority, but (2) vicariously liable when the agent acts with apparent authority or within the scope of employment.
