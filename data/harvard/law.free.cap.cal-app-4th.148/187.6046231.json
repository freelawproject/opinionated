J.</author>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">After the attorney for plaintiff failed to appear for a mandatory settlement conference, the trial court set an order to show cause hearing (OSC) in regard to dismissal or other sanctions. The day before that hearing, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its case without prejudice pursuant to section 581, subdivision (b)(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Nevertheless, the court held the hearing, at which it vacated the voluntary dismissal without prejudice and entered, in its stead, a new dismissal, by the court, with prejudice. This appeal is from the order denying plaintiff\u2019s latter motion to vacate the new dismissal with prejudice. ' ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">We must reverse. By its terms, section 581, subdivision (b)(1) confers on plaintiffs the right to dismiss anytime prior to the \u201ccommencement of trial.\u201d As we explain below, a mandatory settlement conference,, or an ensuing OSC regarding dismissal or other sanctions for failure to appear at that mandatory settlement conference, does not in any way implicate the \u201ccommencement of trial.\u201d Plaintiff had the statutory right to dismiss its case without prejudice, even on the eve of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Also, even if plaintiff did not have the right to dismiss without prejudice, it is clear that the trial court had no right' to dismiss the case with prejudice on its own. As we explain below, the dismissal for failure to attend the mandatory case management conference was essentially a dismissal for failure to prosecute, and the statute and Supreme Court authority make clear that a dismissal for failure to prosecute is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">In November of 2003, Franklin Capital Corporation (Franklin) filed this garden-variety debt collection action against defendant Douglas Wilson (a complaint for breach of contract regarding default on an outstanding loan balance of some $57,000), but by the spring of 2004 counsel for Franklin must have been preoccupied with other things, because he basically went inert as far as Franklin\u2019s case was concerned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>To be precise: On March 2, 2004, counsel for Franklin failed to appear at a case management conference. That order was vacated (errant mail service), but counsel had a relapse of his aversion to case management conferences on April 13, prompting the court to issue an OSC contemplating dismissal. Counsel, failed to appear at the OSC (this particular OSC was <em>not </em>the OSC that would prompt this appeal), and in fact the case was dismissed. Franklin\u2019s counsel managed to have the dismissal set aside in September, albeit with a $900 sanction. .Then Franklin actually moved for summary judgment, but, true to form, failed to show up at the hearing on his motion, so it was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In late April defendant Wilson filed a motion to dismiss for delay in prosecution, essentially relying pn what litigators used to call the \u201ctwo-year rule\u201d (compare Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 583.410 [discretionary authority to dismiss for delay in prosecution] with <em>id., </em>\u00a7 583.420, subd. (a)(2)(B) [no authority to dismiss for delay in prosecution prior to two years having gone by from filing without the case having been brought to trial]) arguing that, under factors set out in rule 373 (now rule 3.1342) of the California Rules of Court, discretionary dismissal was appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">On May 6, 2005, counsel for Franklin failed to appear at a mandatory settlement conference\u2014ironically, one requested by Franklin\u2014and that day the trial court once again issued an OSC regarding \u201cDismissal and/or sanctions,\u201d setting the hearing for May 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The minute order did <em>not </em>mention any authority on which the trial court\u2019s OSC would proceed. However, two days before the hearing, defendant Wilson\u2019s attorney filed a \u201cdeclaration\u201d in support of \u201cdismissal of action\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>which incorporated the late April motion to dismiss under section 583.410 (lack of prosecution after two years have passed since filing without case having been brought to trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The day before the hearing, May 18, Franklin\u2019s counsel filed a voluntary dismissal without prejudice with the court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Counsel didn\u2019t show up at the hearing the next day, so the court ordered a dismissal <em>with </em>prejudice. While the court, in its minute order, cited no statutory or case authority for its action, it indicated that the dismissal was for lack of prosecution, though it also alluded to counsel\u2019s failure to comply with the previous order to pay sanctions of $900.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court entered an unsigned minute order of dismissal with prejudice on May 19 (as distinct from a signed final order of dismissal under section \u00a7 581, subd. (d) [all dismissals must be in writing signed by the court]).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In late August, after an aborted attempt to file a new action in July,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Franklin filed a motion to vacate the dismissal on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction for the trial court to do what it did on May 19. That motion was denied in a hearing on September 23. While the trial court again did not mention any specific statutory or case authority for its decision, it clearly alluded to a body of case law, which we discuss in detail below, which the trial court read as precluding voluntary dismissals in the face of any \u201cdispositive\u201d action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The denial of the motion to vacate was filed September 26, and the October 3 notice of appeal is timely.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">A. Did the Pending Court-initiated OSC to Dismiss or Impose Other Sanctions Because of the Failure to Attend the Mandatory Settlement Conference Cut Off Plaintiff\u2019s Right to Dismiss Voluntarily? No.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">1. <em>The Statute Controls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">While the case law (which we discuss in detail below) is extensive, we must remember that the right of a plaintiff to dismiss its case voluntarily and without prejudice is set forth in a statute, and all permutations of circumstances on the subject flow from that statute. The statute is section 581, subdivision (b)(1), which provides: \u201cAn action may be dismissed in any of the following instances: [1] (1) With or without prejudice, upon written request of the plaintiff to the clerk, filed with papers in the case, or by oral or written request to the court at <em>any time before the actual commencement of trial, </em>upon payment of the costs, if any.\u201d (Italics added.) In essence, then, all cases which deal with voluntary dismissals are glosses on the words, \u201ccommencement of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In terms of the case before us, it would seem obvious that a mandatory settlement conference is not the \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d in any sense of the phrase. By definition no adjudication is contemplated at a settlement conference. And it would seem likewise obvious that an ensuing OSC regarding dismissal or sanctions for failure to appear at such a conference would not implicate the idea of \u201ccommencement of trial.\u201d Again, nothing like adjudication of the merits happens at an OSC conducted in the wake of a failure to appear at a mandatory settlement conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">We should also mention at this point that the statute also contains a definition of what constitutes a trial. The definition is found in subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(\u0430) (6) of section 581. It reads: \u201c(a) As used in this section: [][]... [f] (\u0431) \u2018Trial.\u2019 A trial shall be deemed to actually commence at the beginning of the opening statement or argument of any party or his or her counsel, or if there is n\u00f3 opening statement, then at the time of the administering of the oath or affirmation to the first witness, or the introduction of any evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">If section 581, subdivision (a)(6) set forth the <em>exclusive </em>criteria for the concept of \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d we might end this opinion right here. Quite obviously an OSC regarding failure to appear at a mandatory settlement conference does not fit any of the three specified acts for determining whether trial has actually commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On its face; however, the language in section 581, subdivision (a)(6) \u25a0is not exclusive\u2014it tells you that some things constitute a trial but it doesn\u2019t say that those are the only things that constitute a trial\u2014and in any event the issue of its'exclusivity was dispositively settled against exclusivity by our Supreme Court in <em>Wells, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 781, 784-788. As the <em>Wells </em>case shows, the \u201ctrial shall be deemed\u201d language had been added to the statute in 1947, though then the language was in the last sentence of subdivision 1 of section 581 (see Stats. 1947, ch. 990, \u00a7 1, p. 2256). The specific question in <em>Wells </em>was whether that language, as well as the addition of the word \u201ccommencement\u201d as in \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d set up \u201ca new and exclusive test, preserving the right of voluntary dismissal until the occurrence of one of the specific acts deemed by subdivision 1 to constitute \u2018the actual commencement of trial\u2019 \u201d such that a voluntary dismissal after a general demurrer had been sustained and the time to amend had expired might be valid. <em>(Wells, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 786.) Answer: No. The court said the 1947 amendment with its \u201ctrial shall be deemed\u201d language did not address the question of when \u201cthe trial of an issue of <em>law </em>commences.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 787-788 [\u201cAccordingly, we are unable to agree with plaintiff\u2019s contention that the 1947 amendment erased or diluted the <em>Goldtree </em>rationale. It is reasonable to conclude that the 1947 amendment to section .581, subdivision 1, did not address the issue before us, namely, .when does the trial of an issue of <em>law </em>commence?\u201d (Original italics.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In the wake of <em>Wells, </em>a substantial and fairly complex body of case law has grown up involving when\u2014and when not\u2014a plaintiff\u2019s statutory..right to dismiss pursuant to section 581, subdivision (b)(1) is cut off by the presence of some impending \u201cdispositive\u201d procedure. Indeed, defendant Wilson in this case urges us to affirm the trial court\u2019s refusal to vacate its dismissal with prejudice precisely because of the voluntary dismissal while a \u201cdispositive\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>proceeding (the OCS regarding dismissal or sanctions) was pending. In order not to run afoul of this case law we. are required to map its relevant boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">2. <em>The Supreme Court Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Despite the nonexclusivity of section 581, subdivision (a)(6), the basic right to voluntarily dismiss remains statutory, with the operative benchmark being the phrase \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d in section 581, subdivision (b)(1). So we will begin at the beginning, with the first major Supreme Court case limiting the statutory right to dismiss, <em>Goldtree v. Spreckels </em>(1902) 135 Cal. 666 [67 P. 1091] <em>(Goldtree). Goldtree, </em>decided when the statute merely said \u201ctrial,\u201d was essentially a. gloss on that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In <em>Goldtree, </em>the high court held that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice had no effect on two causes of action that had previously been the subject of a sustained demurrer without subsequent amendment. The court reasoned that the demurrer, challenging the sufficiency of the facts, went \u201cdirectly to the determination of the rights of the parties,\u201d and that was to be \u201c \u2018considered a trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Goldtree, supra, </em>(1902) 135 Cal. at pp. 670-671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">While most of the <em>Goldtree </em>opinion was an exposition on how the word \u201ctrial\u201d as used in the statute encompasses the adjudicatory process of consideration of a demurrer (see <em>Goldtree, supra, </em>135 Cal. at pp. 669-673), the court alluded to an argument rooted in judicial policy, by quoting a passage from <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1888) 22 Neb. 628 [36 N.W. 121, 126], the gravamen of which was: There has to be an end to litigation. However\u2014and this point will be important later on when' we address some of the Court of Appeal decisions limiting the otherwise \u201cabsolute\u201d right to dismiss\u2014the high court did not stray from the benchmark df the word \u201ctrial\u201d as used in the statute. The connection to the statutory word \u201ctrial\u201d was made by linking the commonsense idea that litigation must end to the more technical idea that an <em>initial submission of the merits of the case </em>to the trial court terminates the right to dismiss because that submission <em>is </em>a \u201ctrial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The next major Supreme Court case addressing any limitations on the right to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice was the <em>Wells </em>case, which we have already discussed as regards its dealing with the 1947 amendments to the dismissal statute, both adding the \u201ccommencement of\u2019 phrase and the \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In <em>Wells, </em>there was a demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, the plaintiff was given leave to amend but didn\u2019t. The defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice, and the plaintiff then quickly filed a request for dismissal of the action without prejudice. The trial court granted the motion for dismissal with prejudice, then reversed itself and granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the dismissal with prejudice. There was an appeal by the defendant from the last order, and the high court reversed, holding that the case should have been dismissed <em>with </em>prejudice. (See <em>Wells, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at pp. 784-789.) The court noted that the defendant was entitled to an appealable judgment <em>with prejudice </em>if its demurrer was successful. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 785.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The thrust of the <em>Wells </em>opinion is (in addition to the demonstration that the \u201cshall be deemed language\u201d was not exclusive) a demonstration that, as between (1) the apparently \u201cabsolute\u201d right to dismiss without prejudice afforded by the controlling statute (and it was the <em>Wells </em>opinion that first put the word \u201cabsolute\u201d in quotes), and (2) the countervailing <em>statutory </em>right of a defendant to obtain a dismissal with prejudice after a court has sustained a demurrer with leave to amend and there has been no amendment, the latter takes precedence. The alternative\u2014a truly \u201cabsolute\u201d right to dismiss even after a demurrer had been sustained without the possibility of cure by amendment\u2014made \u201cneither good sense nor good law.\u201d <em>(Wells, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 788.) Despite (or consonant with) the fact that the <em>Wells </em>court held that the .\u201cshall be deemed\u201d language was nonexclusive, the focus of the <em>Wells </em>court was still on the statutory word \u201ctrial.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 785-788 [demonstrating that two appellate , decisions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> did not undermine the <em>Goldtree </em>definition of trial, despite the 1947 amendment changing \u201ctrial\u201d to \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>A final Supreme Court case that (judging from subsequent appellate decisions) has not received perhaps quite as much attention as <em>Wells </em>is <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Dewor Developments </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 778 [191 Cal.Rptr. 8, 661 P.2d 1088] (Christensen). The result in <em>Christensen </em>cut in the opposite direction of <em>Goldtree </em>and <em>Wells, </em>holding that the dismissal there <em>was </em>an effective dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Read alongside <em>Wells, Christensen </em>provides a relatively complete picture of our Supreme Court\u2019s essential approach to the subject: Statutory language still controls. That is, courts must look to when \u201ctrial\u201d\u2014granted, \u201ctrial\u201d including trials of issues of law\u2014begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\"><em>Christensen </em>arose out of an anomalous strategy (the court\u2019s word was \u201cstrange,\u201d see <em>Christensen, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 781) by a plaintiff to compel arbitration of a construction dispute by filing a complaint, as distinct from a straightforward petition to compel arbitration. The idea was to obtain the kind of discovery from the defendants of their defenses and position that would not normally be available to a litigant in straight arbitration. (See <em>ibid.) </em>The \u201cnovel strategy backfired,\u201d however, when the defendants filed a demurrer, and things became \u201cstill worse\u201d for the plaintiffs when the trial court sustained the demurrer to all causes of action save one, and that one was struck on the court\u2019s own motion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The plaintiffs then filed a \u201ctrimmed-down\u201d amended complaint still asserting that the dispute should be arbitrated and the defendants demurrered again, arguing that the plaintiffs had been too clever by half. The defendants asserted that the plaintiffs had waived their right to insist on arbitration. So, one day before the hearing on this second demurrer, the plaintiffs dismissed their complaint without prejudice. (The defendants did not go through with the hearing on their demurrer.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Two months later, the plaintiffs filed a petition to compel arbitration. The trial court reasoned that the \u201cbad faith\u201d of the plaintiffs having the ulterior motive of obtaining (otherwise unavailable) discovery effectively waived the right to arbitrate. <em>(Christensen, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 781.) For their part, the defendants moved to vacate the earlier, nonprejudicial dismissal by the plaintiffs and enter a new dismissal <em>with </em>prejudice. The trial court denied <em>that </em>motion. Both sides appealed, and the case was eventually taken by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The first part of the opinion showed that the trial court\u2019s conclusion as to the waiver issue was correct\u2014the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cprocedural gamesmanship\u201d showed that the action indeed had been filed in bad faith and \u201cby doing so\u201d they had waived their right to arbitrate. (See <em>Christensen, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 783-784.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>But there was still the question of whether the plaintiffs had \u201cproperly dismissed their complaint without prejudice.\u201d <em>(Christensen, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 784.) Moving in for the kill, the defendants asserted that the trial court incorrectly denied their motion to vacate the earlier nonprejudicial dismissal order and substitute a new dismissal with prejudice\u2014a result that, as the <em>Christensen </em>court observed, would leave the plaintiffs \u201cwithout any remedy whatsoever.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Resolution of the issue centered on an often-quoted<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> passage from <em>Wells, </em>which we include (as quoted by <em>Christensen) </em>in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Christensen </em>rejected an interpretation proffered by the defendants that the sustained demurrer to the original complaint locked in a result adverse to the plaintiff, so that after a \u201cdemurrer to a new, amended complaint is filed, as here, plaintiff can no longer voluntarily dismiss.\u201d <em>(Christensen, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 785.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For the <em>Christensen </em>court, the absence of an actual <em>ruling </em>on the still viable amended complaint was dispositive. In effect, the <em>Christensen </em>court elevated what it called an <em>intimation </em>from <em>Wells </em>about the freedom to dismiss prior to a \u201cdecision\u201d into a straight proposition of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>plaintiffs in <em>Christensen </em>had the \u201cthe right to dismiss\u201d before \u201cany decision\u201d on the amended complaint. (33 Cal.3d at p. 785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">3. <em>Consistent Appellate Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In the wake of <em>Wells, </em>a number of appellate decisions have applied the <em>Goldtree-Wells </em>approach to \u201ctrial\u201d to voluntary dismissals in the shadow of impending demurrers or summary judgment motions even though there was no actual ruling or decision on the impending motion. (The word \u201cshadow\u201d is ours; at this point in the opinion we deliberately use an imprecise metaphor.) What there was, however, in each of these cases, was some objective indicia, e.g., by way of publicly announced tentative ruling or a failure to file opposition by the deadline, that the plaintiff\u2019s case was inherently defective on the merits. In short, <em>as a matter of law, </em>the case was a loser: See <em>Mary Morgan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Melzark </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 765 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 4] <em>(Mary </em>Morgan) (plaintiff not permitted to dismiss without prejudice where adverse tentative summary judgment ruling had been announced and the hearing had been continued to allow plaintiff opportunity to obtain evidence to defeat motion); <em>Cravens </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 253 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 436] <em>(Cravens) </em>(plaintiff not permitted to dismiss one day prior to hearing on summary judgment motion where plaintiff had failed to file any opposition to summary judgment motion); and <em>Groth Bros. Oldsmobile, Inc. v. Gallagher </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 60 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 405] <em>(Groth Bros.) </em>(no voluntary dismissal without prejudice where trial court had announced a tentative ruling to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">On the other hand, a number of cases going in the opposite direction rested on the point that the voluntary dismissal could not be construed as a concession, implicit or otherwise, that the case lacked substantive merit as a matter of law: <em>Mossanen </em>v. <em>Monfared </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1410 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 459] (where trial court allowed attorney for plaintiff guardian ad litem to withdraw from medical malpractice action, dismissal by guardian ad litem in the face of summary judgment motion filed by defendants was proper because guardian ad litem had no other \u201cmeans to resist the motion\u201d; court also noted that summary judgment motion was substantively defensible because new counsel \u201cwould have been in a position to assert triable issues of material fact\u201d); <em>Zapanta </em>v. <em>Universal Care, Inc. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1173-1174 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 842] <em>(Zapanta) </em>(dismissal one day prior to the day opposition to summary judgment motion was <em>due </em>was effective because case had not yet reached stage where disposition was \u201cmere formality\u201d); and <em>Tire Distributors, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th 538 (dismissal of particular defendant one day before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>continued hearing date of that defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion was effective because of evidence that the plaintiff believed it had already settled out with that defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">4. <em>Can the Appellate Decisions Be Harmonized?

The \u201cMere Formality\u201d Test As a Way to Ascertain the \u201cCommencement of Trial\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The cases we have reviewed so far suggest this test as the accepted judicial gloss on the voluntary dismissal statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">When the dismissal could be said to have been taken</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">\u2014(a) in the light of a public and formal indication by the trial court of the legal merits of the case, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">\u2014(b) in the light of some procedural dereliction by the dismissing plaintiff that made dismissal otherwise <em>inevitable, </em>then the voluntary dismissal is ineffective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">This two-part test readily harmonizes the results in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decisions in <em>Mary Morgan, Cravens, Groth Bros., Mossanen, Zapanta </em>and <em>Tire Distributors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">In the three cases of the six just mentioned where the dismissal had been held to be ineffective, either the trial court had already <em>publicly </em>indicated that the impending motion would result in a substantive dismissal of the action <em>(Mary Morgan </em>and <em>Groth Bros.), </em>or the plaintiff was in a position to deduce that there was nothing to be done to prevent the substantive dismissal of the action\u2014the dice had already been thrown <em>(Cravens).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">In the other three cases where the dismissal was effective, there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">\u2014(a) no reason at all to believe that the case was inherently a loser as a matter of law <em>(Mossanen, </em>where the court in fact pointed out that the case would have survived a summary judgment motion in the hands of a competent attorney), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-15\">\u2014(b) affirmative reason to believe that the case had at least enough merit to warrant settlement <em>(Tire Distributors), </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u2014(c) a complete absence of any reason to conclude that an adverse result on an impending motion was a foregone conclusion <em>{Zapanta).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Our distilled test is also consistent with the three Supreme Court cases we have already examined as well: In <em>Goldtree </em>and <em>Wells </em>there was the truly \u201cformal\u201d indication of actual decisions on pending demurrers on the substantive merits. By contrast in <em>Christensen </em>there was no formal indication by the trial court on the merits as to the pending demurrer on the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">A test of <em>formal </em>indication by the court, or the legal inevitability of dismissal based on dispositive procedural inaction by the plaintiff (like not filing opposition to a summary judgment motion or not bringing the case to trial in five years) also harmonizes almost all the rest of the appellate cases that have dealt with the issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">It explains <em>Kyle v. Carmon </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 901 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 303], where an effective dismissal occurred after an apparently contested hearing on an anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) motion but while the matter was under submission to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">It explains <em>M &amp; R Properties v. Thomson </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 899 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 579] <em>(M &amp; R), </em>where a dismissal was not effective given that the plaintiff had not brought the case to trial in five years, where the defendant had filed a dismissal motion on that basis, and where a tentative ruling had even become the actual ruling of the court prior to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The test even reconciles <em>Datner </em>v. <em>Mann Theatres Corp. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 768 [193 Cal.Rptr. 676] to <em>Groth Bros., </em>though the two cases are sometimes perceived to be in conflict as to whether a plaintiff can dismiss \u201ceven after learning of an adverse tentative ruling.\u201d (See Rutter Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>ffj 11:25.2 to 11:25.3, p. 11-12 [noting policy rationales support <em>Groth Bros, </em>position].) In <em>Datner, </em>there was a dismissal one day prior to a hearing on an apparently contested demurrer, based on a statement by the judge in an <em>unr.eported chambers conference </em>that the demurrer was meritorious. <em>Datner </em>is, in fact, like <em>Kyle, </em>where the plaintiff might have subjectively picked up on signals from the trial judge in oral argument that the case would be lost, but there had been no formal indication, by the court, to that effect. The <em>Datner </em>court had not yet gone \u201cpublic\u201d with a tentative ruling. By contrast, in <em>Groth Bros, </em>there was a formally posted tentative for the world to see.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The test we have derived from these cases is basically the one proposed by the <em>Zapanta </em>court, which employed the more elegant shorthand, \u201cmere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>formality,\u201d (see <em>Zapanta, supra, </em>107 Cal.App,4th at pp. 1173-1174) though perhaps a slight qualification is necessary as regards the tentative ruling cases, <em>Groth Bros, </em>and <em>Mary Morgan. </em>It is stretching things a wee bit to say that a trial court\u2019s <em>tentative </em>ruling means that an adverse judgment is a \u201cmere formality\u201d which must <em>inevitably </em>ensue: Such a reading of tentative rulings suggests a rather excessive confidence in.the infallibility of judges and an unseemly despair over the possibilities that oral argument might, change things. <em>(See Moles v. Regents of University of California </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 867, 874 [187 Cal.Rptr. 557, 654 P.2d 740] [one different judge hearing appellate court oral argument might have made a difference in the outcome].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">That said, if we qualify Zapanta\u2019s \u201cmere formality\u201d test to extend it to <em>public and formal </em>judicial expressions of the merits of a case in the context of a substantively dispositive proceeding\u2014rand, we stress that any test to be faithful to the Supreme Court cases must retain a link to the idea of \u201ctrial\u201d as exposited in <em>Goldtree, Wells, </em>and Christensen\u2014it is remarkable how consistent the cases are in. this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">b. A Compendium of the Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Let\u2019s see how the <em>Zapanta </em>\u201cmere formality\u201d test works when we apply it to a wider range of cases. With the explosive growth of case precedent, of course, the ability to exhaust the applicable legal authorities is becoming more difficult with each passing day. That said, here is a reasonably complete compendium of California case law to date (February 2007) on the iss.ue of precisely when an impending motion of some kind cuts off a plaintiff\u2019s statutory right to voluntarily dismiss a cas\u00e9 without prejudice:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">i. <em>where right to dismiss was cut </em>off:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\"><em>Goldtree, supra, </em>135 Cal. 666\u2014dismissal after demurrers to certain causes of action were long sustained and time to amend had long run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\"><em>London </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 876 [222 P.2d 941]\u2014dismissal after one year had expired since case was ordered transferred and transfer fees had not been paid, precluding trial court, under statute, from taking any other action than dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\"><em>Wells, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 781\u2014dismissal after demurrer to second amended complaint sustained and time to amend had run and specifically one day before motion to dismiss with prejudice:'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\"><em>Herbert Hawkins Realtors, Inc. v.

The One Case Not Explained by the \u201cMere Formality\u201d Test</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">One case, however, clearly does not fit the mere formality rule, even with an emendation to allow for tentative (public and formal) <em>rulings\u2014Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th 168. There, the plaintiff had disobeyed a discovery order to turn over certain audiotapes. The defendant filed a motion for discovery sanctions, which entailed the <em>possibility </em>of terminating sanctions. (We explain below that such discovery terminating sanctions are with prejudice and result in a judgment that is res judicata.) As far as the opinion discloses, there was no tentative ruling on the discovery sanction motion. Rather, \u201cjust prior\u201d to the hearing, the plaintiff dismissed the case. <em>(Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">There are several reasons that <em>Hartbrodt </em>cannot be said to fit into the \u201cmere formality\u201d test that works so well with all the other cases. As just noted, there was no indicated public disposition of the case by the trial court. The opinion doesn\u2019t even make reference to the possibility that the trial judge or referee who had presided over earlier proceeding even growled at the plaintiff in one of the earlier hearings. (E.g., \u201cA word to the wise, counsel: Stop fooling around and have your client produce that tape or you will soon find yourself standing in deep dismissal territory,\u201d or words to that effect.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Second, unlike the cases where dismissals were taken in the face of procedurally based dispositions, such as <em>Miller, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 765 or <em>M &amp; R, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 899, it could not be said that the procedural dismissal in <em>Hartbrodt </em>was inevitable. Procedural inevitability happens when dispositive admission requests have been made and a litigant has allowed them to be deemed admitted (Miller) or the plaintiff has blown the five-year deadline (M <em>&amp; R) </em>requiring the trial court to dismiss. In such cases one can say that the ultimate dismissal is indeed a \u201cmere formality\u201d dictated by hard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>rules of procedure, qualified perhaps by the idea that only some miracle (a change of heart by. an adversary? some unknown estoppel or tolling that might apply?) can save the case, otherwise predestined to perdition.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">A pending <em>discretionary </em>dismissal motion based on the plaintiff\u2019s procedural sins is something different. In that case dismissal is more like the joke about modem health-conscious Californians and death: Some people are so dour as to always believe that death is imminent, most people recognize that death is inevitable, but in California it is perceived as merely optional. The point is\u2014in <em>Hartbrodt, </em>dismissal <em>really was </em>only optional. In the written opinion, at the point just prior to when the court tackled the issue of the voluntary llth-hour dismissal, the court emphasized the fluidity of possible outcomes, not the inevitability. Hence the <em>Hartbrodt </em>court stated that the trial court\u2019s own choice of a terminating sanction was within its \u201cwide discretion to order discovery and broad powers to enforce those orders\u201d and that the choice of termination would \u201cnot be disturbed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 175.) The implication is that if, in the trial court\u2019s discretion, the. court had chosen some other way to enforce its discovery order short of termination (really large monetary sanctions? a tough evidentiary sanction?) that decision too would,have been upheld as within the trial court\u2019s discretion. Unlike <em>Miller </em>or <em>M &amp; R, </em>dismissal as a result of the plaintiff \u2019 s. procedural foul7up <em>in Hartbrodt </em>was not an inevitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The <em>Hartbrodt </em>court did not elaborate on what paradigm it used, except to describe and cite <em>M &amp; R, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 899, and derive its conclusion from that case. The court\u2019s treatment of the whole issue did not extend for more than two paragraphs. (See <em>Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 175-176.) As we have seen, though, <em>M &amp; R </em>involved an impending dismissal motion based on the <em>mandatory </em>five-year rule. (Cf. \u00a7 583.360 [\u201cshall\u201d].) The impending five-year dismissal in <em>M &amp; R </em>really was a mere formality or foregone conclusion\u2014unlike a discretionary two-year dismissal for lack of prosecution, the court in <em>M &amp; R </em>had no choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Perhaps the best expression of why the <em>Hartbrodt </em>court, ruled as it did was its rejection of the perceived circumvention of consequences that are possible when dismissals are a matter of (absolute or not) right. The key language was: \u201cIn one last effort to salvage his case; appellant attempted to voluntarily dismiss his case without prejudice and thereby deny to respondents the finality obtained by imposition of the terminating sanction. This <em>tactic would simply - defeat </em>the trial court\u2019s power to enforce its discovery orders.\u201d <em>(Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 175, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The reference to \u201cfinality\u201d merits comment. The <em>Hartbrodt </em>case left unsaid the fact that dismissals pursuant to terminating sanctions for discovery disobedience are <em>with </em>prejudice and res judicata. (See <em>Kahn v. Kahn </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 372 [137 Cal.Rptr. 332].) The point of the court\u2019s brief comments was obviously this: Having practically invited a discovery dismissal that would have res judicata effect, it was simply repugnant to the court\u2019s basic sense of justice that a <em>likely </em>(and that is reading a little between the lines) dismissal with prejudice could not be \u201cdefeated]\u201d by a cheap deathbed dismissal pursuant to section 581, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Hartbrodt </em>thus would appear to be based on the essential equities of the situation rather than a precise ascertainment of when the statutory cutoff right ends. While we agree that looking to the equities is good judicial policy, we are mindful that any consideration of when the statutory right to voluntary dismissal terminates must be rationally connected to the statutory phrase \u201ccommencement of trial.\u201d We must therefore respectfully (very respectfully, given that it articulates good policy in a vacuum) part company with <em>Hartbrodt </em>to the degree that it might be read to stand for the idea that equities <em>alone </em>can justify the termination of the statutory right.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In the same vein, there is a sentence in <em>Tire Distributors, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at page 544 which, if read out of context, can also be read for the proposition that the core test of when the statutory right to dismiss is simple \u201cgood faith,\u201d untethered to the statutory text.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In context, however, one can still find the necessary link to the idea of commencement of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Factually, <em>Tire Distributors </em>was a complex case, the short version is this: There was a good faith settlement of the case about four days prior to the initiation of a summary judgment motion brought by two defendants, one of whom, Gary, was entitled to be dismissed from the case as a result of the settlement. (Gary was the father of the defendant making the settlement agreement and not technically a party to the settlement.) With the summary judgment motion pending, the plaintiff brought a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The plaintiff failed to file opposition as to Gary\u2019s motion by the deadline, and a week after missing the deadline the trial court denied the motion to enforce. The plaintiff then made an interesting tactical decision: It went ahead and dismissed Gary without prejudice, and that same day sought writ relief from the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to enforce. <em>(Tire Distributors, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 541-542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Things got more complicated when the appellate court stayed proceedings and then issued a notice of intent to grant the writ in the first instance. But then Gary sought relief from the stay on the ground that he was not a party to the settlement. The appellate court granted that request. Eventually the appellate court issued a decision granting the plaintiff\u2019s writ (i.e., the settlement agreement was indeed enforceable). In the meanwhile, though, Gary sought to have the trial court vacate his dismissal without prejudice and enter an order granting his unopposed summary judgment motion. The trial court granted both.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">On appeal, the appellate court found it unthinkable that the rule from the <em>Cravens </em>decision should apply. It ruled that the earlier dismissal was effective, so that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the summary judgment. <em>(Tire Distributors, </em>supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at p. 547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">It is true that in the process of reversing the order vacating the earlier dismissal, the <em>Tire Distributors </em>court wove the theme of good faith into its rationale. (E.g., \u201cThe legal principles that have evolved in this area tend to focus on the reasons for the dismissal and whether the plaintiff acted in good faith or merely for tactical reasons designed to prevent a defendant from obtaining an otherwise inevitable summary judgment.\u201d <em>(Tire Distributors, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 544.)) After all, given the facts of the case, it would be practically impossible for any court to ignore the actual good faith of the plaintiff in initially dismissing Gary.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">But the good faith theme was still tied to the problem of the impending adjudication on the merits posed by Gary\u2019s summary judgment motion. The court emphasized that it was the settlement that resulted in Gary\u2019s dismissal. <em>(Tire Distributors, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 547.) Since the settlement was <em>the </em>undisputed motivation for Gary\u2019s dismissal <em>(ibid, </em>[\u201cthere is no substantial evidence that TDI\u2019s dismissal of Gary was motivated by anything other than its belief that the dismissal was a term of the settlement\u201d]), the <em>Cravens </em>rule\u2014where the plaintiff had also missed the deadline to file opposition to a summary judgment motion\u2014was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">We need only add by way of a gloss on <em>Tire Distributors </em>that <em>of course </em>the <em>Cravens </em>rule (see also <em>Mary Morgan) </em>was not applicable because the settlement agreement dismissing Gary antedated the filing of the summary judgment motion (by four days), and, as emphasized by the <em>Tire Distributors </em>court, the voluntary dismissal of Gary was a <em>consequence </em>of the settlement, not a consequence of the summary judgment motion. The references to unfairness or good faith in the <em>Tire Distributors </em>opinion were ways of making that precise point. The <em>Tire Distributors </em>opinion should not, divorced from its facts, be read for the idea that unfairness or good faith in a vacuum are all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that a court needs to look at in deciding whether a voluntary dismissal is effective. If, by some weird out-of-context exegesis, <em>Tire Distributors </em>were read for that idea,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we would be forced to respectfully decline to follow it because unfairness in a vacuum is a test inconsistent with the statutory language of section 581, subdivision (b)(1), not to mention the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Christensen.', </em>if the <em>Christensen </em>court had employed some generalized \u201cunfairness\u201d or \u201cgood faith\u201d test, the case would have gone the other way. As we have seen, all the Supreme Court cases have stayed close to the legislative text, which confers on plaintiffs a <em>right </em>to dismiss prior to <em>commencement of trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">5. <em>Application of the \u201cMere Formality\u201d Test to the Case at Hand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The trial court did not specify the basis of its May 6 OSC regarding dismissal or other sanctions, though it is clear that the OSC did not <em>necessarily </em>contemplate complete dismissal\u2014otherwise the \u201cor sanctions\u201d part of the OSC would not have been included. And we dare say that the trial court might very well have exercised its discretion <em>not </em>to dismiss the case if counsel for plaintiff Franklin had shown up to provide some reason for his failure to attend the mandatory settlement conference, or even just to beg for mercy. So, unlike <em>Miller </em>(deemed admissions), <em>M &amp; R </em>(mandatory five-year dismissal), or <em>Cravens </em>(failure to timely file opposition to summary judgment) there was no inevitability of dismissal based on milk that had already been spilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Nor was there any public announcement of impending dismissal, tentative or otherwise, which would suggest some substantive confrontation by the court with the legal merits of the case\u2014a \u201ctrial of an issue of law\u201d as the <em>Wells </em>court put it\u2014or even that dismissal was procedurally mandated in light of counsel\u2019s apparent dereliction. (See <em>Groth Bros., supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 70 [court concerned that last minute dismissals would undermine the \u201ctentative ruling system\u201d].)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Nor, of course, had the case experienced anything on the order of an. adjudication of the merits in some auxiliary context, like referral to a referee <em>(Gray) </em>or to judicial arbitration <em>(Herbert Hawkins, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.3d 334, 337 [allowing dismissals after completion of judicial arbitration \u201cmocks\u201d judicial arbitration statutes].) \u2022 '</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In short, the OCS regarding dismissal or sanctions was miles away from, the \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d which is the statutory benchmark for a plaintiff\u2019s right to dismiss. ,.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Next we ask this question: Can it be said that Franklin\u2019s counsel\u2019s bad faith, including not appearing at a mandatory settlement conference, is sufficient by itself to justify cutting off his client\u2019s statutory right to dismiss? We must answer no. As noted above, a good faith-bad faith test might be an excellent judicial policy and indeed we might adopt it ourselves if writing in vacuum. But it\u2019s not what the Legislature said. The Legislature said \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d and we therefore must conclude the trial court\u2019s decision was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">B. Could the Trial Court Dismiss the, Case (Essentially, for Lack of Prosecution) with Prejudice? No.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">No doubt one day our high court will revisit the subject, already visited in <em>Goldtree, Wells </em>and <em>Christensen, </em>of the precise moment of cutoff and we will know whether we have been correct in rejecting the idea that substantive evidence of \u201cdishonest litigation tactics\u201d or unfairness is enough, by itself, to cut off plaintiff\u2019s statutory right to dismiss. And of course the high court is more than welcome to this case, if the court deems it the appropriate vehicle. (Shades of Henny Youngman: Take this case. <em>Please </em>take this case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Assuming, in that regard, that we have been incorrect and plaintiff Franklin lost the right to dismiss by May 18 (or, as <em>Tire Distributors </em>intimates, if the retroactive revocation of that right on May 19 as tested by an abuse of discretion standard were upheld), the question arises as to whether the trial ' court could properly enter its own dismissal with prejudice, such that the dismissal would have a res judicata effect. Since there are only two. possible bases for that dismissal, and neither permits a dismissal with prejudice having res judicata effect, the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>1. <em>No Dismissal with Prejudice Pursuant to Local Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">While the trial court did not mention them, Orange County Superior Court local rules are one possible source of authority to dismiss the case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Orange County Superior Court, like some other large urban courts in the state, has local rules that (a) require attendance at mandatory settlement conferences<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and (b) allow for dismissals of cases for failure to comply with local rules, even when the fault is solely counsel\u2019s.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, Orange County Superior Court local rules contemplate at least the theoretical possibility that plaintiffs might lose their entire case if their attorneys don\u2019t show up at a single mandatory settlement conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">However, even assuming that the local rules validly contemplate such a draconian possibility (and there is at least a colorable case to be made that they don\u2019t),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Legislature has enacted a statute, section 575.2, which sets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>limits on the ability of trial courts, acting pursuant to local rules, to dismiss cases for violations of local rules. Basically, the restriction is: If it\u2019s solely the lawyer\u2019s fault and not the clients, any penalty for violation of local rules must be structured so as not to \u201cadversely\u201d affect the client\u2019s cause of action (or defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Section 575.2 is divided into two subdivisions, (a) and (b). While subdivision (a) does indeed allow for local rules to provide for the dismissal of a case for failure to comply with local rules,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> subdivision (b) cautions that \u201cany penalty\u201d arising from the dereliction of counsel, as distinct from a client, must be visited only on counsel.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The clear implication of subdivision (b) is that in cases where failure to comply with some local rule is not attributable to the client, then dismissal of the <em>client\u2019s </em>case is off limits.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court may hit the attorney with penalties, perhaps even severe penalties (see also Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6103 [failure of attorney to obey court order is grounds for discipline with state bar]) but, like the devil being allowed to afflict Job but only up to a point, there is one area that is off limits\u2014the <em>client\u2019s </em>cause of action or defense. The client\u2019s case may not be adversely affected by malfeasance solely attributable to the attorney.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In this regard we need only note that an attorney\u2019s failure to pay sanctions to the other side for <em>his </em>not showing up to attend a mandatory settlement conference surely falls into the category of dereliction attributable to the attorney only. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>contains absolutely no indication that Franklin is implicated in any of its trial attorney\u2019s failures to attend various court hearings or pay sanctions.'</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">2. <em>No Dismissal with Prejudice Pursuant to State Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"ApR\">a. Improper Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The other basic authority, and the one which the trial court itself relied on, is lack of, or delay in, prosecution.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The subject of delay in prosecution is covered in section 583.410 (which is part of chapter 1.5 of title 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure). Section 583.410 gives a trial court discretion to dismiss an action for delay in prosecution,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> though it confines both the procedure and criteria of any such discretionary dismissal to rules prescribed by the Judicial Council.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In response to section 583.410 the Judicial Council adopted rule 373 (now renumbered as 3.1342, hereinafter, rule 373) of the California Rules of Court. Rule 373 prescribes no less than 45 days\u2019 notice of any motion to dismiss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>delay in prosecution.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In the present case, the OSC on May 19 that resulted in the dismissal of Franklin\u2019s cause of action with prejudice was set on May 6. Franklin had less than 14 days\u2019 notice. Thus even if we deem the trial court\u2019s May 6 order setting an OSC for May 19 as.the functional equivalent of a section 583.410 motion to dismiss for delay in prosecution, the targeted party did not receive sufficient notice under the terms of section 583.410 (which incorporate rule 373).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">b. The Legislature and Supreme Court Have Said That Dismissals for Lack of Prosecution Are to Be Without Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">On top of that, however, is what we perceive to be an even greater and absolutely dispositive reason to set aside the May 19 order: the fact that the Legislature has made it clear, and Supreme Court case law has recognized, that dismissals for procedural dereliction pursuant to Chapter 1.5 .are to be without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">We will begin with what the Legislature has said first. Section 581, subdivision (b)(4) states: \u201cAn action \"may be dismissed in any of the following instances: [][] . . . [$] (4). By the court, <em>without prejudice, </em>when dismissal is made pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 583.110).\u201d (Italics added.) Significantly, chapter 1.5 includes not only the discretionary provisions of section 583.410 (the \u201ctwo-year rule\u201d for discretionary dismissal for lack of prosecution<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>) but also, interestingly enough, sections 583.310 and 583.360, which set forth the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>stringent five-year rule.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Section 581 thus sets up the general template for dismissals under California law.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The Supreme 'Court recognized what the Legislature said in <em>Gonsalves v. Bank of America </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 169, 172-173 [105 P.2d 118]: \u201cBut it is a fundamental rule that a judgment is not <em>res judicata </em>unless it is on the merits, and a dismissal for delay in prosecution is not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Decisions of the Court of Appeal have followed suit. (See <em>Mattern v. Carberry </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 570, 572 [9 Cal.Rptr. 137] [collecting authorities holding that \u201ca dismissal for want of prosecution is not on the merits and therefore does not operate as res judicata to a subsequent proceeding\u201d]; <em>Ashworth v. Memorial Hospital </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1046, 1053 [254 Cal.Rptr. 104] [earlier dismissal under five-year statute had no res judicata effect].)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It\u2019s pretty hard to argue with a clear statute on point, and clear language from the Supreme Court to boot. You rarely get cases where the governing authority is this dispositive. We are forced then to conclude that even if the trial court had a free hand to validly dismiss Franklin\u2019s lawsuit on May 19 because the May 6 OSC regarding dismissal or other sanctions was pending, the trial court had no authority to enter such a dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>3. <em>The Seemingly Inconsistent Appellate Case Law Isn\u2019t</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We should note, albeit in passing, that <em>M &amp; R, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 899 (five-year rule) and <em>Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th 168 (discovery sanctions) contain language that, if read carelessly and taken out of context, might lend support for the idea that a dismissal for lack of prosecution could be \u201cwith prejudice\u201d in the sense of res judicata. That is, each case uses the phrase \u201con the merits\u201d in such a way as to possibly imply that the procedurally based (that is, based on some dereliction of counsel in the conduct of the litigation as distinct from the underlying merits of the plaintiff\u2019s case) pending dismissal motions that precipitated the voluntary dismissals in each case would have yielded a dismissal \u201con the merits,\u201d i.e., one that would be res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">a. <em>Hartbrodt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Let\u2019s take the later-decided case, <em>Hartbrodt, </em>because it is quickly distinguishable. <em>Hartbrodt, </em>as we have noted, involved an impending possible dismissal for violation of a discovery order. But, as we have also noted, at the time <em>Hartbrodt </em>was decided (and to this day) case-law had already established that dismissals pursuant to a terminating sanction for violation of discovery orders are indeed res judicata. (See <em>Kahn v. Kahn, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 372.) Since the present case involves a dismissal for lack of prosecution, not discovery violations, any intimation about the \u201cmerits\u201d of the case being decided in the discovery sanction motion is inapplicable to the case before us now. Further, all three of the reasons the <em>Kahn </em>court gave for making terminating sanctions in discovery res judicata would clearly not apply to dismissals for lack of prosecution.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>b. <em>M&amp;R</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The earlier case, <em>M &amp; R, </em>is a little more complicated from our point of view, because it involved a strictly procedural dismissal which, unlike <em>Hartbrodt </em>which involved terminating sanctions in the discovery context, did not even indirectly implicate the action\u2019s substantive merits.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> And it was clearly a \u201clack of prosecution\u201d case, centering on a motion for mandatory dismissal pursuant to the five-year statute. At several places in the opinion, the phrase \u201con the merits\u201d is indeed used.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">If <em>M &amp; R </em>is read for the unqualified proposition that a dismissal pursuant to the five-year statute (which is also part of \u201cchapter 1.5\u201d as used in section 581 subdivisions (b)(4) &amp; (g)) is \u201con the merits,\u201d therefore \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d therefore res judicata, it is simply incorrect. Such a proposition is flatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>contrary to what the Supreme Court said in <em>Gonsalves </em>and what the Legislature has said in the very text of section 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Rather, however, <em>M &amp; R </em>should be read as standing merely for a more nuanced point; That a dismissal under the five-year statute can have adverse repercussions on the plaintiff even though those repercussions do not extend as far as a dismissal that is res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The repercussions specifically at issue in <em>M &amp; R </em>were payment of attorney fees under a <em>prevailing party </em>statute (\u00a7 1717), and one must remember that the issue of whether a litigant is a prevailing party (and therefore entitled to fees) is different from the issue of whether that litigant can use a previous dismissal for lack of prosecution as res judicata in a future action.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">That reading is demonstrated by the facts of the <em>M &amp; R </em>case, and the nature of the authorities employed by the <em>M &amp; R </em>court. By letting the five-year deadline run, the plaintiff had, in effect, given the defendant a \u201cvested\u201d right (our phrase, not <em>M &amp; R\u2019s) </em>to a dismissal pursuant to the five-year statute. So, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss under the five-year statute, and, as the court noted (though perhaps it could have done so a tad more clearly), if that motion had been granted, the defendant, as <em>prevailing party, </em>would have been entitled to its attorney fees. Thus the court\u2019s cited authorities in its first reference to \u201con the merits\u201d were to all authorities making the point that a defendant who wins on the five-year rule is still a prevailing party entitled to collect attorney fees.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Put another way, <em>M &amp; R </em>is part of a group of cases that have considered under what circumstances a prevailing party may collect costs and attorney fees after a voluntary dismissal. (See cases discussed in <em>Parrott v. Mooring Townhomes Assn., Inc. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 873 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 116] [homeowners who sued homeowners association liable for statutory fees awardable to prevailing party in homeowner association litigation, even after they dismissed complaint without prejudice].)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>IV. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The trial court lost its authority to dismiss the case pursuant to the OSC on May 18, when plaintiffs validly exercised their right to dismiss voluntarily. On top of that, the trial court had no authority to override that dismissal on May 19 and enter a new dismissal with prejudice. Therefore, the trial court should have granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate its May 19 order. We therefore reverse the order denying that motion, with directions to make a new order, vacating the dismissal of May 19 and leaving the voluntary dismissal of May 18 as the operative document.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In recognition that it was both the derelictions of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that got his client into this mess and of the complexity of the law, in the interests of justice each side will bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">One more thing. The Rutter Guide points out that some courts, including the Orange County Superior Court, have local rules which provide that when an action is refiled after dismissal, it must be assigned to the same judge. (See Rutter Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>f 11:6.3, p. 11-3.) Whether, under section 170.6, subdivision (a)(2), Franklin might yet have a right to make a peremptory challenge to Judge Perk following \u201creversal on appeal\u201d of the trial court\u2019s decision, is a matter that is not before us, and our opinion is, er, \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d to either side on the point in any future proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">However, even if, arguendo, plaintiff Franklin will have such a right, this is a perfect case for application of the local rule that requires assignment to the same judge after dismissal and refiling. The Legislature may have conferred on Franklin the right to dismiss \u00f3n May 18, but it has not conferred on Franklin the right to judge shop. Absent a valid peremptory challenge, there is no reason Judge Perk shouldn\u2019t preside over the balance of the case. (Even assuming a right to make a valid peremptory challenge, if Franklin has such a right, it is going to have to spend it against Judge Perk.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Accordingly, unless Judge Perk is retired, somehow disqualified pursuant to section 170.6, subdivision (a)(2), or not available as defined by section 661, all future proceedings involving any cause of action by Franklin for breach of contract against Wilson based on the contract at issue in this case shall be heard before Judge Perk, regardless of the trial\u2019 court panel or department to which he is assigned at the time..</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Fybel, J., concurred. ,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\"> Should we name Franklin\u2019s counsel? As the next paragraph shows, the record doesn\u2019t make him look good, and his malfeasance (or, at the least, inaction) no doubt has cost the trial court and opposing counsel time, and therefore money. We feel the trial judge\u2019s irritation. On the other hand, this is not a case, such as might happen on a motion strictly for sanctions against an attorney, a bar disciplinary proceeding, or a classic Code of Civil Procedure section 473 set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>motion, where we have something approaching a complete picture of all the circumstances of an attorney\u2019s apparent inaction. Nor are we dealing with some scheme on the part of an attorney that necessarily suggests unethical behavior. Perhaps, if we knew all the facts, there might even be something <em>excusable </em>in trial counsel\u2019s conduct. It is becoming to the judiciary for judges to recall in such contexts the difficult exigencies of day-to-day law practice. If perfection were the standard none of us should escape ridicule. (See <em>Wells v. Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 791, fn. 3 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217] <em>(Wells) </em>(dis. opn. of Carr, J.)

You can do that up until the point where the motion is actually pending.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b164-11\"> This case presents one of those zen-like conundrums in civil procedure where the court must first peek at the merits in order to ascertain the procedural propriety of some question\u2014in this case, appealability. As we explain below, when Franklin filed its May 18 voluntary dismissal without prejudice, the trial court was stripped of jurisdiction to take any further action. (E.g., <em>Tire Distributors, Inc. v. Cobrae </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 538, 542 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>761] <em>(Tire Distributors) </em>[\u201cWhen a dismissal has properly been filed, the trial court loses jurisdiction to act in the case.\u201d].) When the trial court entered, on its own, a dismissal with prejudice the next day, the trial court exceeded its jurisdictional authority in a way that the issue could be raised at any time. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mower </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 457, 474, fn. 6 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 326, 49 P.3d 1067].) Technically speaking, then, the September 26 order denying the motion to set aside was a postjudgment order (the judgment being the May 18 voluntary dismissal, not the- May 19 minute order), and the order denying the set aside request was an appealable postjudgment order, from which <em>this </em>appeal, noticed within two weeks of that postjudgment order, was easily timely.

(See <em>id. </em>at pp. 1189-1190.) Unfortunately for Wilson, the similarities don\u2019t end there. The <em>Reid </em>case actually supports our determination that the trial court co.uld not dismiss the case with prejudice for failure to show up at the mandatory settlement conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">In <em>Reid, </em>the case was ordered to (judicial) arbitration. After the arbitrator made his award, the plaintiffs filed a request for trial de novo. When the plaintiffs failed to appear at a scheduled status conference, the trial court, among other things, dismissed the case under the <em>discretionary </em>dismissal statute (\u00a7 583.410) dealing with lack of prosecution. (See <em>Reid v. Balter, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1189-1190.) Fifteen months later the plaintiffs filed a motion for a status conference and trial date\u2014it turned. out that a substitute attorney at an earlier conference forgot to tell the plaintiffs\u2019 regular attorney about the status conference\u2014and the trial court <em>vacated </em>its earlier dismissal, which decision was upheld by the appellate court in a subsequent appeal by the defendants after a victory by the plaintiffs in a jury trial. Here is what the appellate court plainly said in rejecting the defendants\u2019 attempt to keep their earlier procedural win: \u201cWe do not agree that warning plaintiffs their case could be dismissed if they failed to appear on May 15, 1989, for a trial setting conference is sufficient notice to sustain dismissing the case for failure to appear on October 27,1989, at a status conference.\u201d <em>(Reid, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 1193.)

(See <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Kahn, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 383.) In that regard, the <em>Kahn </em>court reasoned that the power of trial courts to enter dismissals in the first place for discovery violations was rooted in the theory was itself a manifestation of the substantive merits of the case: \u201cThe ratio decidendi behind such cases appears to be on the theory that a persistent refusal to comply with an order for the production of evidence-is tantamount to an admission that the disobedient party really has no meritorious claim or defense to the action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p.. 382.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">\u2014(2) Section 582 tells us that, in distinction to the various kinds of dismissals without prejudice under section 581, \u201c \u2018In all other cases judgment shall be rendered on the merits,\u2019 \u201d and the discovery statutes certainly come within the rubric of \u201c \u2018all other cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kahn </em>v. <em>Kahn, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at pp. 382-383, italics omitted.) \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">\u2014(3) Analogous federal discovery statutes had been interpreted by federal courts to mean that dismissals for discovery noncompliance constituted \u201ca final judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>(Kahn v.

Reason (2) does not apply because, while section 582 by its terms, applies to the discovery sanction statutes, it does not apply to template of dismissals under section 581, to which it is an exception. And reason (3) does not apply for basically the same reason: Unlike the discovery area where recourse to federal law is instructive, in the context of dismissals for lack of prosecution we don\u2019t care what federal law says because our state statute clearly says that such dismissals are without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> Reason (1) given by the <em>Kahn </em>court (see fn. 34 above) recognized that discovery recalcitrance can be, essentially, a surrogate for the fact that the case is a loser on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> Here they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">(1) Barely five sentences into the opinion, in the course of laying out the facts, the court wrote: \u201cWhen plaintiffs did not bring the matter to trial within five years, defendants moved for mandatory dismissal of the action, a procedure which would be a determination on the merits entitling defendants to their attorney fees.

Burke </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 168 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 562] <em>(Hartbrodt), </em>the court concluded the plaintiff could not dismiss before a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for terminating sanctions, declaring the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on section 581 a mere \u201ctactic\u201d designed to \u201cdefeat the trial court\u2019s power to enforce its discovery orders.\u201d <em>(Hartbrodt, </em>at pp. 175-176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We must presume, however, the policy issues determined in the foregoing cases were considered and rejected by the Legislature when it adopted section 581. Under this section, a party has an absolute right to dismiss an action if done \u201cbefore the actual commencement of trial,\u201d even if this places the other party at a disadvantage and gains the plaintiff a tactical respite. (\u00a7 581.) What section 581 means by \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d presents no mystery because it is defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">My colleagues have deftly attempted to reconcile the leading cases, but even they concede their \u201cmere formality test\u201d fails to account for all the disparate rationales and results in the case law. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 204.) For example, niy colleagues reject <em>Hartbrodt, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th 168 because it does not fit within their formula. The problem is the mere formality test is not really a test one would apply to reach a legally correct conclusion, but a general description that attempts to reconcile appellate decisions, some of which have strayed too far from the statutory language and Supreme Court precedent interpreting section 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The source of the problem may stem from <em>Wells v. Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217], where the Supreme Court interpreted the commencement of trial language in section 581 to include the trial of an issue of law, which occurs when a court rules on a demurrer or summary judgment motion. Courts have relied on <em>Wells </em>to stretch \u201ccommencement of trial\u201d to encompass any procedure that is potentially dispositive, including demurrer or summary judgment tentative rulings, or a pending motion for terminating sanctions. The issue appears ripe for further guidance from the Supreme Court or the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 13, 2007, S151732.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
