(Van Elk), on public works projects, which were allegedly subject to California\u2019s prevailing wage law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>(Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1720-1861.) Plaintiffs sued Van Elk and others for failing to pay prevailing wages. The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the grounds undocumented workers were precluded by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (the IRCA) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.) and <em>Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB </em>(2002) 535 U.S. 137 [152 L.Ed.2d 271, 122 S.Ct. 1275] from asserting such claims. The superior court also found the supremacy clause preempted California statutes declaring immigration status irrelevant to claims under California\u2019s labor, employment, civil rights and employee housing laws. Plaintiffs contend the IRCA and <em>Hoffman </em>do not preclude undocumented workers from asserting such claims and the California statutes are not preempted. Defendants contend the court erroneously denied their request for attorney\u2019s fees. We reverse the judgment and order the superior court to enter an order denying the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SYNOPSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Plaintiffs performed welding-related work for Van Elk on different construction projects in Los Angeles County. The causes of action alleged in the complaint include failing to pay prevailing wages,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> breach of contract, recovery under public works payment bond, and unfair business practices. Plaintiffs later added as Doe defendants Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland (Fidelity), Fassberg Construction Company (Fassberg) and Morillo Construction, Inc. (Morillo). Van Elk was a subcontractor for Fassberg and Morillo on the subject projects. Fidelity provided the payment bonds for the subject projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Defendant Van Elk filed a motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication arguing that pursuant to the IRCA and Hoffman, plaintiffs did not have standing to sue because they were undocumented workers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of the \u201cundisputed fact\u201d plaintiffs were undocumented, defendants cited plaintiffs\u2019 discovery responses affirming they were not bom in the United States and had no Social Security numbers and plaintiffs\u2019 refusals to respond to discovery questions regarding citizenship, legal residency status, documented worker status, and work visa information.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Alternatively, defendants sought summary adjudication of their claim that several of the construction projects identified in the complaint were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>public works projects. Defendants also sought summary adjudication that the time plaintiffs spent \u201coff-site\u201d fabricating components to be installed at the construction projects was not governed by prevailing wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In opposition, plaintiffs invoked their statutory privilege to refuse to answer discovery questions regarding their immigration status. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 1171.5; Civ. Code, \u00a7 3339; Gov. Code, \u00a7 7285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The court granted summary judgment against Jose Reyes and Carlos Flores in part finding their discovery responses constituted admissions they were not authorized to obtain employment in the United States. Plaintiffs objected to the court\u2019s proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">After a hearing, the court filed a revised order granting summary judgment against all four plaintiffs, finding (1) under <em>Hoffman, </em>plaintiffs had no standing to assert their action, (2) the three statutes making immigration status irrelevant to certain claims were preempted by the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, and (3) there was no disputed fact plaintiffs were undocumented as the evidence established each plaintiff had not been bom in the United States and had no Social Security number, which shifted the burden to plaintiffs to introduce other evidence of authorization to work in the United States, and no such evidence had been adduced. The court denied summary adjudication on the basis it could not resolve discrete facts within a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment entered after the court granted summary judgment. Defendants filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying their request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">I. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Defendants contend summary judgment was proper because they met their initial burden of showing all plaintiffs were undocumented. \u201cOn the grant of summary judgment, the appropriate standard of review is de novo.\u201d <em>(Schachter </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc. </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 726, 733 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 920].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Defendants argue plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their action as they were not in compliance with federal law, i.e., the IRCA. Thus, one issue presented by this appeal is whether an employee\u2019s undocumented status alone means he or she has no standing to bring an action for the payment of prevailing wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>n. <em>IRCA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The United States Supreme Court stated \u201c[w]e have often recognized that a \u2018primary purpose in restricting immigration is to preserve jobs for American workers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(INS v. National Center for Immigrants\u2019 Rights, Inc. </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 183, 194 [116 L.Ed.2d 546, 112 S.Ct. 551].)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The IRCA \u201c \u2018forcefully\u2019 made combating the employment of illegal aliens central to \u2018[t]he policy of immigration law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>535 U.S. at p. 147.) Among other things, the IRCA est\u00e1blished an extensive \u201cemployment verification system\u201d designed to deny employment to aliens who (a) are not legally present in the United States or (b) are not lawfully authorized to work in the United States. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(l), (h)(3).) It is a crime for an unauthorized alien to subvert the employer verification system by tendering false documents. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324c(a).) Both employers and unauthorized aliens who violate the IRCA may be punished by civil fines and criminal prosecution. <em>(Hoffman, supra, </em>535 U.S. at p. 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u201cUnder the IRCA, it is unlawful to hire or continue to employ an alien the employer knows to be an \u2018unauthorized alien,\u2019 defined as one who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or authorized to be so employed by federal immigration and nationality law or by the United States Attorney General. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(l)-(2), (h)(1).) The statute provides for graduated civil penalties for violations, and criminal penalties for employers who are found to have engaged in a pattern or practice of hiring unauthorized aliens in violation of the law. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(4)-(5), (f)(1).) It is also a crime to knowingly accept a false immigration document for purposes of satisfying the requirements of the statute. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324c(a)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(b).)\u201d <em>(Farmer Brothers Coffee v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 533, 538 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 23].)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Several times in defendants\u2019 brief, they claim plaintiffs provided false documents to obtain employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only \u201cfacts\u201d listed in defendants\u2019 statement of facts in their summary judgment motion are that each plaintiff was \u201can undocumented worker not legally authorized to work in the United States.\u201d There is no \u201cfact\u201d that plaintiffs provided false documents. The only cited evidentiary support for the claim false documents were provided is in a response to a request for admission by Jose Perez. When Perez was asked if he provided false employment information to Van Elk, he objected, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>admitted he had. False employment information is a vague term and could mean any number of things, including false information about an applicant\u2019s employment history, and does not necessarily mean the applicant submitted false work authorization documents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Thus, as presented to this court, this case does not involve a situation where undocumented workers submitted false work authorization documents to a prospective employer. (See, e.g., <em>Ulloa v. Al\u2019s All Tree Serv. </em>(Dist.Ct. 2003) 2 Misc.3d 262 [768 N.Y.S.2d 556, 558] [\u201cThe Court also notes in passing that, if there had been proof in this case that the Plaintiff had obtained his employment by tendering false documents (activity that is explicitly unlawful under IRCA), <em>Hoffman </em>would require that the wage claim [for unpaid wages] ,be disallowed in its entirety.\u201d].) However, the issue of whether <em>Hoffman </em>requires that a wage claim be denied if an employee submitted false authorization documents is not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">III. <em>Prevailing Wage Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u201cThe conditions of employment on construction projects financed in whole or in part by public funds are governed by the prevailing wage law.\u201d <em>(Lusardi Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Aubry </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 976, 985 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 837, 824 P.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u201cSection 1773 requires the public entity \u2018awarding any contract for public work, or otherwise undertaking any public work,\u2019 to obtain from the Director [of the Department of Industrial Relations] the general prevailing rate for each craft, classification or type of worker needed to execute the contract. The public entity must specify those rates in its call for bids, in bid specifications, and in the contract or, alternatively, must specify in those documents that the prevailing wage rates are on file in its principal office. (\u00a7 1773.2.) [][] A contractor for a public works project that fails to pay the prevailing rate to its workers is liable for the deficiency and is subject to a statutory penalty. (\u00a7 1775.)\u201d <em>(Lusardi Construction Co. v. Aubry, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 986.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The Legislature has declared that it is the public policy of California \u201cto vigorously enforce minimum labor standards in order to ensure employees are not required or permitted to work under substandard unlawful conditions or for employers that have not secured the payment of compensation, and to protect employers who comply with the law from those who attempt to gain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>competitive advantage at the expense of their workers by failing to comply with minimum labor standards.\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 90.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u201cIt is well established that California\u2019s prevailing wage law is a minimum wage law.\u201d <em>(Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v. G &amp; G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 765, 778 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 804].) \u201cThe duty to pay prevailing wages is mandated by statute and is enforceable independent of an express contractual agreement. (\u00a7\u00a7 1771, 1774\u20141775 . . . .) Thus, while the obligation to pay prevailing wages arises from an employment relationship which gives rise to contractual obligations and claims . . . , the duty to pay the prevailing wage is statutory. (\u00a7\u00a7 1771, 1774.) [|] For these reasons we conclude that, because the prevailing wage law is a minimum wage law mandated by statute and serves important public policy goals, section 1194 provides an employee with a private statutory right to recover unpaid prevailing wages from an employer who fails to pay that minimum wage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Road Sprinkler, </em>at p. 779, citations omitted, underscoring added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u201cEarned but unpaid salary or wages are vested property rights.\u201d <em>(Loehr v. Ventura County Community College Dist. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1080 [195 Cal.Rptr. 576].) Noncitizens are guaranteed the same property rights as citizens. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In determining that paying prevailing wages was a statutory obligation, one court noted: \u201cThe overall purpose of the prevailing wage law ... is to benefit and protect employees on public works projects. This general objective subsumes within it a number of specific goals: to protect employees from substandard wages that might be paid if contractors could recruit labor from distant cheap-labor areas; to permit union contractors to compete with nonunion contractors; to benefit the public through the superior efficiency of well-paid employees; and to compensate nonpublic employees with higher wages for the absence of job security and employment benefits enjoyed by public employees.\u201d <em>(Lusardi Construction Co. v. Aubry, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 987; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hwang </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1177 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 61] [\u201cPrevailing wage legislation is intended to prevent government contractors from using \u2018 \u201citinerant, cheap, bootleg labor.\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>IV. <em>Hoffman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In <em>Hoffman, </em>the court concluded that allowing the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) \u201cto award backpay to illegal aliens would unduly trench upon explicit statutory prohibitions critical to federal immigration policy, as expressed in IRCA. It would encourage the successful evasion of apprehension by immigration authorities, condone prior violations of the immigration laws, and encourage future violations. However broad the Board\u2019s discretion to fashion remedies when dealing only with the NLRA [National Labor Relations Act], it is not so unbounded as to authorize this sort of an award.\u201d <em>(Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>535 U.S. at pp. 151-152.) The court noted that awarding backpay<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ran counter to the policies underlying the IRCA because it was for \u201cyears of work not performed, for wages that could not lawfully have been earned, and for a job obtained in the first instance by a criminal fraud.\u201d (535 U.S. at p. 149.) The court, however, noted the NLRB could impose other \u201csignificant sanctions\u201d against an employer for its violation of the NLRA (National Labor Relations Act; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.). (535 U.S. at p. 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>Hoffman </em>concerned remedies available to undocumented workers under the NLRA and not their standing to file a claim before the NLRB. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the portion of its earlier holding in <em>Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 883 [81 L.Ed.2d 732, 104 S.Ct. 2803] that undocumented workers had standing to file claims under the NLRA and were considered \u201cemployees\u201d under the NLRA. <em>(Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>535 U.S. at pp. 149-150, fn. 4; see also <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Mecca Farms, Inc., supra; </em>213 F.R.D. at p. 604 [the court rejected a suggestion that <em>Hoffman </em>removed undocumented aliens\u2019 right to file charges with the NLRB, reasoning <em>Hoffman </em>\u201cdealt with the remedies available to the undocumented, and not his right to file a charge with the NLRB\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In <em>Patel </em>v. <em>Quality Inn South </em>(11th Cir. 1988) 846 F.2d 700, 704, the court held the IRCA did not purport to limit remedies (for unpaid wages) available to undocumented aliens under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.) reasoning that if the FLSA did not cover undocumented aliens, employers would have an incentive to hire them. The court concluded the legislative history of the IRCA \u201cstrongly suggested]\u201d Congress believed undocumented workers would continue to be protected by state and federal wage laws. <em>(Patel, </em>at p. 704.) The court also noted the appropriation of additional funds in the IRCA for the increased FLSA enforcement on behalf of undocumented workers supported that supposition. <em>(Patel, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>p. 704.) The court reasoned that minimum wage laws supported the IRCA policy of reducing illegal immigration because such laws offset the most \u201cattractive feature\u201d of such workers\u2014their willingness to work for less than the minimum wage. <em>(Patel, </em>at p. 704.) The court opined claims for wages for work already performed did not conflict with federal immigration policy. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 705-706.) Other courts agree that the IRCA did not foreclose all remedies for undocumented workers under FLSA, NLRA or other federal labor statutes. (See, e.g., cases cited in <em>Patel, supra, </em>846 F.2d at p. 703 &amp; fn. 4; <em>Mester Mfg. Co. v. I.N.S. </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 879 F.2d 561, 567; <em>Contreras </em>v. <em>Corinthian Vigor Ins. Brokerage, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1998) 25 F.Supp.2d 1053, 1056.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Defendants argue <em>Hoffman </em>would prohibit plaintiffs\u2019 action for unpaid prevailing wages because there is no basis to restrict its reasoning to backpay as the court would have said so if it wanted to do so. The dissent in <em>Hoffman </em>noted the IRCA does not address the enforcement of other state laws. <em>(Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>535 U.S. at pp. 154\u2014155 (dis. opn. of Breyer, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Defendants cite three cases, which they claim support their position. Two of those cases note that <em>Hoffman </em>did not preclude an undocumented worker\u2019s claim for wages for work already performed. <em>(Crespo v. Evergo Corp. </em>(App.Div. 2004) 366 N.J. Super. 391 [841 A.2d 471, 475]; <em>Ulloa </em>v. <em>Al\u2019s All Tree Serv., supra, </em>768 N.Y.S.2d at pp. 557-558.) In the third case, <em>Escobar v. Spartan Security Service </em>(S.D.Tex. 2003) 281 F.Supp.2d 895, 897, the- court noted if <em>Hoffman </em>was viewed quite broadly, it would limit an undocumented worker\u2019s remedies under the Civil Rights Act, but stated the rationale for extending <em>Hoffman </em>to foreclose all the remedies claimed by the employee was not applicable because that employee had become documented. However, the court also noted that <em>Hoffman </em>\u201cdid not specifically foreclose all remedies for undocumented workers under either the [NLRA] or other comparable federal labor statutes.\u201d <em>(Escobar, </em>at p. 897.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In <em>Zavala v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. </em>(D.N.J. 2005) 393 F.Supp.2d 295, 325 the court concluded the FLSA did not preclude undocumented workers from obtaining relief for work already performed. The court was persuaded <em>Hoffman </em>did not prohibit such relief because, in contrast to <em>Hoffman, </em>the plaintiffs in <em>Zavala </em>were seeking unpaid wages for work already performed, the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> under the FLSA was broad and. not limited to citizens, and post <em>-Hoffman </em>interpretations by the Department of Labor and <em>post-Hoffman </em>court decisions construed the FLSA to cover undocumented workers. (393 F.Supp.2d at pp. 322-325.) For much the same reasons, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>persuaded that <em>Hoffman </em>does not prohibit plaintiffs from having standing to raise claims for prevailing wages as those claims are also for work already performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">V. <em>Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The superior court found that because there was no dispute plaintiffs were undocumented, the burden shifted to them to introduce evidence of their authorization to work in the United States. Plaintiffs argue that finding was improper under section 1171.5 and the other statutes declaring all residents of California are entitled to the protection of California\u2019s labor, employment, civil rights and employee housing laws regardless of immigration status.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Section 1171.5<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201c(a) All protections, rights, and remedies available under state law, except any reinstatement remedy prohibited by federal law, are available to all individuals regardless of immigration status who have applied for employment, or who are or who have been employed, in this stat\u00e9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201c(b) For purposes of enforcing state labor and employment laws, a person\u2019s immigration status is irrelevant to the issue of liability, and in proceedings or discovery undertaken to enforce those state laws no inquiry shall be permitted into a person\u2019s immigration status except where the person seeking to make this inquiry has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the inquiry is necessary in order to comply with federal immigration law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\u201c(c) The provisions of this section are declaratory of existing law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Citing section 1171.5, one court observed, \u201cThus, if an employer hires an undocumented worker, the employer will also bear the burden of complying with this state\u2019s wage, hour and workers\u2019 compensation laws.\u201d <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>Paicius </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 452, 460 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 756].)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">\u201c \u2018Article VI of the Constitution provides that the laws of the United States \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d Art.

However, <em>Sanango </em>is inapposite as, like backpay, lost wages are for \u201cwages that plaintiff allegedly would have been able to earn in the United States but for his injuries.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Because legislation providing for the payment of prevailing wages comes under the historic police powers of the state, the presumption is that legislation is not superseded by the IRCA. Defendants do not cite any provision in the IRCA preempting state wage and hour legislation. The only specific preemption provision prohibits state or local law from imposing civil or criminal sanctions upon those who employ unauthorized aliens. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(2).) That provision is irrelevant to the wage claims asserted by plaintiffs. Thus, the IRCA does not expressly preempt state wage laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In <em>Farmer Brothers, </em>the court determined California\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not conflict with the IRCA. <em>(Farmer Brothers Coffee v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at pp. 539-542.) \u201cAs it stated in its report prior to the passage of the IRCA, the House Judiciary Committee discerned no intention in the statute \u2018that the employer sanctions provisions of the bill be used to undermine or diminish in any way labor protections in existing law, or to limit the powers of federal or state . . . labor standards agencies . . . .\u2019 (H.R.Rep. No. 99-682(1), 2d Sess. (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 5662 . . . .)\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Farmer Brothers Coffee v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 539, citation omitted.) Moreover, as the IRCA does not contain provisions relating to the payment of wages, minimum or otherwise, Congress did not implicitly preempt prevailing wage laws by occupying that field. <em>(Farmer Brothers Coffee, </em>at p. 540; see also <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Defendants argue the <em>post-Hoffman </em>California statutes are in direct conflict with <em>Hoffman </em>as they prevent or frustrate the accomplishment of federal objectives. We conclude there is no actual conflict between the IRCA and the prevailing wage law as the state law is not an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the IRCA. (Cf. <em>Farmer Brothers Coffee </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 540; see also <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The ultimate goal of the IRCA is to control illegal immigration into the United States by prohibiting the employment of unauthorized aliens. (3A Am.Jur.2d (2005) Aliens and Citizens, \u00a7 25, p. 73; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a).) Allowing employers to hire undocumented workers and pay them less than the wage mandated by statute is a strong incentive for the employers to do so, which in turn encourages illegal immigration. The fact an employer pays a worker less than the prevailing wage suggests the employer knew the worker was undocumented. Moreover, it is not the public which benefits from the savings. Employers are awarded public works contracts based on bids\u2014bids which provide for the payment of prevailing wages. When prevailing wages are not paid, it is the employer who pockets the difference just as if it had provided substandard materials to those promised in a contract. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hwang, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 1177 [\u201cIf contractors ... are permitted to win public works contracts based on their express written agreement to pay workers the prevailing wage, and if they then pay their workers far less than the prevailing wage, the entire statutory scheme [for prevailing wages] would be subverted\u201d]; see also <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>NIBCO, Inc., supra, </em>364 F.3d at p. 1072 [\u201cRegrettably, many employers turn a blind eye to immigration status during the hiring process; their aim is to assemble a workforce that is both cheap to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>employ and that minimizes their risk of being reported for violations of statutory rights. Therefore, employers have a perverse incentive to ignore immigration, laws at the time of hiring but insist upon their enforcement when their employees complain.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In <em>Hoffman, </em>the undocumented worker obtained employment by using false authorization documents; the court determined the award of backpay violated the' IRCA because it provided wages for work not performed and for work that could not have been performed without violating the IRCA. <em>(Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>535 U.S. at pp. 141, 149-150.) In contrast to <em>Hoffman, </em>the work at issue in the case at bar had already been performed. The <em>Hoffman </em>court concluded, \u201crecognizing employer misconduct but discounting the misconduct of illegal alien employees, subverts [the IRCA].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 150.) Allowing employers to hire undocumented workers and pay them less than the prevailing wage would also subvert the IRCA by condoning and encouraging future violations by employers. Moreover, such awards do not condone future unauthorized work; rather they make it clear that employers should not be allowed to profit from employing undocumented workers and then exploiting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">As one federal circuit court reasoned: \u201cWe recognize the seeming anomaly of discouraging illegal immigration by allowing undocumented aliens to recover in an action under the FLSA. We doubt, however, that many illegal aliens come to this country to gain the protection of our labor laws. Rather it is the hope of getting a job\u2014at any wage\u2014that prompts most illegal aliens to cross our borders. By reducing the incentive to hire such workers the FLSA\u2019s coverage of undocumented aliens helps discourage illegal immigration and is thus fully consist\u00e9nt with the objectives of the IRCA.\u201d <em>(Patel v. Quality Inn South, supra, </em>846 F.2d at pp. 704-705; <em>Singh v. Jutla </em>(N.D.Cal. 2002) 214 F.Supp.2d 1056, 1062 [The FLSA \u201cdiscourages employers from hiring such workers because it eliminates the employers\u2019 ability to pay them less than minimum wage or otherwise take advantage of their status\u201d]; <em>Flores v. Amigon </em>(E.D.N.Y. 2002) 233 F.Supp.2d 462, 464 [If employers know they will not only be subject to civil and criminal penalties \u201cwhen they hire illegal aliens, but they will also be required to pay them at the same rates as legal workers for work actually performed, there are virtually no incentives left for an employer to hire an undocumented alien in the first instance.\u201d].) Hence, the IRCA does not preempt California\u2019s prevailing wage law as the prevailing wage law removes a major incentive to hiring undocumented workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In conclusion, we hold that <em>Hoffman </em>and their undocumented status did not prohibit plaintiffs from having standing to raise their prevailing wage claim and that the prevailing wage law and the <em>post-Hoffman </em>statutes are not preempted by the IRCA. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>granting summary judgment and direct the superior court to enter an order denying the motion for summary judgment. We need not consider the cross-appeal from the order denying defendants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The judgment is reversed with directions to enter an order denying the motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Perluss, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The petition of defendants and appellants for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 13, 2007, S152133.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\"> Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Labor Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\"> Plaintiffs were paid wages, but not prevailing wages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-10\"> At oral argument, the parties stated all defendants were before the court on the summary judgment motion. However, judgment was only entered in favor of three of the four defendants\u2014Van Elk, Fidelity and Fassberg. Morillo was not named in the judgment. Accordingly, the issue of whether the general contractors should be dismissed may be raised in the superior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> The IRCA requires employers to verify that each new hire is authorized to work in the United States. The employee must present documents establishing his or her identity and employment authorization. (For list of acceptable documents see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.2(b)(l)(v) (2007).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\"> One amicus curiae claims its clients regularly report that they are given documents and false names by the employers who hire them as a condition of employment.

Even though in <em>San Francisco Labor Council v.
