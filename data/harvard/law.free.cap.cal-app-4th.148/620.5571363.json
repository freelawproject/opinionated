J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUs\">In a prior action, an insured homeowner was found liable to a downhill neighbor for a landslide that inundated the neighbor\u2019s backyard with dirt and debris. The judgment totaled around $4 million. The homeowner\u2019s primary and excess insurers provided a defense and indemnity. This is a declaratory relief action between the insurers concerning the coverage provided under successive policies issued by the primary insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Immediately after the landslide, the City of Los Angeles determined that the neighbor\u2019s backyard was unusable and ordered the insured to repair the slope. But the slope went unrepaired for years, and the backyard remained unusable while each of the primary policies was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">The primary insurer issued four successive policies that covered an \u201coccurrence [of] property damage,\u201d defined as an accident, including continuous exposure to the same conditions resulting in a loss of use during the policy period. The policies separately covered an \u201coccurrence [of] personal injury,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>which included \u201can act . . . that occurs during the policy period and which results [in wrongful entry or eviction].\u201d Each policy had limits of $500,000 per occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In this case, the primary insurer contended it was liable for only one occurrence, or $500,000. The excess insurer argued that because both property damage and personal injury occurred in all four policy periods, the primary insurer was liable for up to $4 million. The trial court granted summary judgment for the primary insurer, stating that coverage under the primary policies was limited to $500,000. We agree. There was only one occurrence because the ensuing damage was the result of one cause: the landslide. Further, under the policy language, the continuation of any damage into subsequent policy periods\u2014for example, loss of use\u2014did not give rise to multiple occurrences. The judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The parties stipulated to the material facts. We also accept as true the additional undisputed facts supported by the cross-motions for summary judgment. (See <em>Raghavan </em>v. <em>Boeing Co. </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1120, 1125 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 397].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Harold Lancer and his next-door neighbors owned homes on top of a hill in Encino, California. Their downhill neighbors included Lawrence and Linda Rauch (the Rauches), and Bradley and Mitzi Kapture (the Raptures). On February 27, 1998, a portion of the uphill properties failed, causing a landslide. Dirt and debris deluged the backyards of the Rauches and the Raptures and caused a one-inch bulge in the Rauches\u2019 north retaining wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Within 24 hours of the slope failure, the City of Los Angeles \u201cyellow tagged\u201d the Rauches\u2019 backyard. A yellow tag notice read: \u201cWARNING: THIS SITE HAS BEEN DAMAGED AND MAY BE DANGEROUS TO OCCUPY. FURTHER DAMAGE MAY OCCUR AT ANY TIME. UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY OR OCCUPANCY IS A MISDEMEANOR. - - - [Si] ... [1] NO ACCESS TO YARD AREA.\u201d The yellow tag remained in the Rauches\u2019 backyard more than three years, until at least June 24, 2001. When the city \u201cyellow tagged\u201d the backyard, it also ordered Lancer and the other uphill neighbors to repair the slope.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">In February 1999, the Rauches filed suit against Lancer and the other uphill neighbors <em>(Rauch </em>v. <em>Lancer </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1999, No. LC047839)), alleging causes of action for nuisance, trespass, and negligence. In addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the above facts, the complaint alleged as follows. The yellow tag prevented the Rauches from using their backyard, which included a swimming pool and spa. The uphill neighbors did not comply with the city\u2019s repair order. Mud, debris, vegetation, and water from the uphill neighbors\u2019 properties continued to flow onto the Rauches\u2019 residence when it rained. The Rauches moved a substantial amount of their personal property from the residence and placed it in storage. Their living conditions deteriorated substantially; their residence lost most, if not all, of its market value; and their family life was materially disrupted. The slope remained unstable, posing a risk of additional slippage and further damage to the Rauches. As relief, the complaint sought general damages and injunctive relief to abate the nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Cross-complaints were filed in the <em>Rauch </em>case, including cross-complaints between Lancer and another uphill neighbor for indemnity and comparative fault. Several settlements were reached before the case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In February 1999, in a separate case, the Raptures, among others, brought claims against Lancer and the uphill neighbors for nuisance, trespass, and negligence <em>(Shephard v. Lancer </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1999, No. LC048012) <em>(Rapture </em>case)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Lancer had obtained a homeowners policy from Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, effective June 24, 1997, to June 24, 1998. Fireman\u2019s Fund renewed the policy in three subsequent years, each for a one-year period. The last policy expired on June 24, .2001. The premium went up every year but the last, when it dropped, averaging about $1,600 per year. Each, policy had a $1,000 deductible. The policies covered claims against Lancer seeking damages for property damage, bodily injury, and personal injury caused by an occurrence. The limit of liability in each policy was $500,000 per occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Safeco Insurance Company of America issued a personal umbrella policy to Lancer, effective July 9, 1997, to July 9, 1998. It was renewed annually in two subsequent years, the last policy expiring on July 9, 200Q. The Safeco policies covered property damage and personal injury caused by an occurrence. The limit of liability was $5 million per occurrence. The Safeco coverage did not apply to an occurrence until Lancer had exhausted the limits available under all other underlying insurance. Safeco was therefore an excess insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In the <em>Rauch </em>and <em>Kapture </em>cases, Lancer sought a defense and indemnity from Fireman\u2019s Fund and Safeco. In or about June 2001, the <em>Rapture </em>case settled for $175,000. On June 8, 2001, Fireman\u2019s Fund contributed $50,000 to the settlement. The rest of the settlement was covered by the other uphill neighbors: The <em>Rapture </em>case came to an end. .</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>In the <em>Rauch </em>action, the cross-complaints between Lancer and the other uphill neighbor were settled by agreement that each pay $1.1 million into a trust to repair the slope. On August 8, 2001, Fireman\u2019s Fund paid $450,000 toward the settlement. It then took the position that it had exhausted its policy limits of $500,000, arguing that the slope failure had caused only one occurrence under the first of its four policies. Nevertheless, Fireman\u2019s Fund agreed to continue defending Lancer, subject to a reservation of rights to seek reimbursement of defense costs from Safeco. Fireman\u2019s Fund spent an additional $265,000 in that regard. For its part, Safeco contributed $450,000 toward the settlement of the same cross-complaints, subject to a reservation of rights to seek reimbursement from Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In 2001, the complaint in <em>Rauch </em>was tried in two phases. In phase I, the superior court heard evidence regarding the condition of the slope, declared it a nuisance, and ordered that it be abated. The court directed Lancer and the other uphill neighbors to implement a repair plan to be approved by the city and determined that the repairs would cost $3,795,448. Lancer and the other uphill neighbors were found jointly and severally liable for that sum and were instructed to deposit the funds, including all prior settlements, into one or more interest-bearing accounts. The court appointed a receiver to control the funds and supervise the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In phase II, a jury found for the Rauches on the nuisance and negligence causes of action and for Lancer and the other uphill neighbors on the trespass claim. The jury found Lancer 50 percent at fault for the slope failure. It awarded $75,500 in economic damages for loss of use and relocation expenses, and $12,500 in noneconomic damages for annoyance, discomfort, and inconvenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On September 24, 2003, the superior court entered judgment in favor of the Rauches for $75,500 in economic damages, $12,500 in noneconomic damages, $26,718 in postverdict interest, $65,785 in investigative costs (see <em>Stearman </em>v. <em>Centex Homes </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 611, 625 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 761]), and $26,992 in litigation costs. Defendants were also ordered, jointly and severally, to deposit $3,795,448 into a fund for slope repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Taking into account the jury\u2019s finding that Lancer was 50 percent at fault, his share of the judgment exceeded $2 million. Lancer paid a portion of the judgment with settlements from other parties. Fireman\u2019s Fund paid at least $765,000 in the case, including: (1) $500,000 toward settlement of the <em>Rapture </em>case and the cross-complaint against Lancer in Rauch; and (2) $265,000 in defense costs after the settlement payments. Safeco paid $1.53 million on Lancer\u2019s behalf: (1) $44,000 of the Rauches\u2019 damages; and (2) $1.49 million of the repair fund (including $275,000 of the fund for which Lancer\u2019s codefendants were responsible but could not pay).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>In July 2002, Safeco filed this declaratory relief action against Fireman\u2019s Fund in which it claimed that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s policies provided Lancer with $500,000 in coverage for property damage and an additional $500,000 in coverage for personal injury during each of Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s four policy periods, for a total of $4 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Fireman\u2019s Fund filed a cross-complaint against Safeco, alleging three causes of action: declaratory relief, equitable subrogation, and equitable indemnity. Fireman\u2019s Fund requested a declaration that it owed Lancer $500,000 in indemnity for a single occurrence and sought, through subrogation and indemnity, to recover the amount it had paid after the $500,000, namely, $265,000 in defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In February 2004, the insurers filed cross-motions for summary judgment, arguing the points made in their respective pleadings. The parties stipulated to the material facts. The trial court granted Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s motion, concluding that there was a single occurrence during a single policy period, resulting in $500,000 in coverage for the slope failure. The court denied Safeco\u2019s motion. Judgment was entered in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund for $265,000. Safeco appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">A motion for summary judgment must be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cA defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established [or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action]. ... In reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment, the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court. . . . We must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Raghavan v. Boeing Co., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">A. <em>Principles of Insurance Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">\u201cInterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law and follows the general rules of contract interpretation. . . . \u2018The fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>contract must give effect to the \u201cmutual intention\u201d of the parties. \u201c. . . Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. . . . The \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 . . . , controls judicial interpretation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(MacKinnon </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 635, 647-648 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 228, 73 P.3d 1205], citations omitted.) The goal is to protect the mutual intentions of the insured and the insurer. (See <em>Julian v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 747, 754, 756-757 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 648, 110 P.3d 903]; <em>Gravillis v.

Hogan </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1292, 1299 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 761].)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u201c \u2018[A] liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity. . . . \u201c[T]he carrier must defend a suit which <em>potentially </em>seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.\u201d . . . Implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify; an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u201c \u2018The determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. . . .\u2019 . . . \u2018[F]or an insurer, the existence of a duty to defend turns not upon the ultimate adjudication of coverage under its policy of insurance, but upon those facts known by the insurer at the inception of a third party lawsuit. . . . Hence, the duty \u201cmay exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 295 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The term \u201ctrigger of coverage\u201d is often used in connection with the duty to defend. \u201cThe word \u2018trigger\u2019 is not found in the . . . policies themselves, nor does the Insurance Code enumerate or define \u2018trigger of coverage.\u2019 Instead, \u2018trigger of coverage\u2019 is a term of convenience used to describe that which, under the specific terms of an insurance policy, must happen in the policy period in order for the <em>potential </em>of coverage to arise. The issue is largely one of timing\u2014what must take place <em>within the policy\u2019s effective dates </em>for the potential of coverage to be \u2018triggered\u2019?\u201d <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 645, 655, fn. 2 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 913 P.2d 878] <em>(Montrose II).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>\u201cThe obligation to indemnify must be distinguished from the duty to defend. The duty to defend arises when there is a <em>potential </em>for indemnity.\u201d <em>(Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 659, fn. 9.) \u201c[W]here successive [liability] policies have been purchased, bodily injury and property damage that is continuing . . . throughout more than one policy period is <em>potentially </em>covered by all policies in effect during those periods.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 686-687, italics added.) \u201cThe obligation to indemnify, on the other hand, arises when the insured\u2019s underlying liability is established. . . . Although an insurer may have a duty to defend, it ultimately may have no obligation to indemnify, either because no damages were awarded in the underlying action against the insured, or because the actual judgment was for damages not covered under the policy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 659, fn. 9, citations omitted.) \u201cWhether coverage is ultimately established in any given case may [also] depend on . . . the existence of express conditions or exclusions in the particular contract of insurance under scrutiny, the availability of certain defenses that might defeat coverage, and a determination of whether the facts of the case will support a finding of coverage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 655, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u201cThe insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify runs to claims that are actually covered, in light of the facts proved. ... By definition, it entails the payment of money in order to resolve liability.\u201d <em>(Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 46 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766], citations omitted.) \u201cBoth the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend are in fact dependent on coverage\u2014the former on actual coverage, the latter on at least potential coverage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 47, fn. 10.) In determining indemnity, \u201ccourts must focus on the nature of the risk and the injury, in light of the policy provisions,\u201d not on the \u201cinjured party\u2019s choice of remedy or the form of action sought.\u201d <em>(Vandenberg v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 840 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229].) Here, the litigation has moved beyond the pleading and discovery stages, to judgment. We are therefore concerned primarily with indemnity (actual coverage), not the duty to defend (potential coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Last, although the parties to this action are a primary insurer and an excess insurer, the dispute focuses on the coverage afforded the insured by the primary policies. We therefore interpret the provisions of the primary policies\u2014as do the parties\u2014without regard to the existence of the excess coverage. (See <em>Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 663-666 [courts must consider context in which insurance policy dispute is litigated].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">B. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The material provisions of the four Fireman\u2019s Fund policies were identical. The insuring provisions were contained in \u201cCoverage E\u2014Personal Liability.\u201d They stated: \u201cIf a claim is made or a suit is brought against an \u2018insured\u2019 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019, \u2018personal injury\u2019, or \u2018property damage\u2019 caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 to which this coverage applies, we will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201c1. Pay up to our limit of insurance for the damages for which the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally liable. Damages include prejudgment interest. . . ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201c2. Provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice. . . . Our duty to settle or defend ends when the amount we pay for damages resulting from the \u2018occurrence\u2019 equals our limit of insurance.\u201d The limit of insurance, or policy limits, for Coverage E was $500,000 \u201cper occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d was defined as \u201cphysical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property.\u201d \u201cBodily injury\u201d meant \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease . . . .\u201d \u201cPersonal injury\u201d was defined as \u201cinjury, including bodily or mental harm, arising out of any of the following acts: [f] a. False arrest, detention or imprisonment; [(K] b. Malicious prosecution; [f] c. <em>Wrongful entry </em>or eviction; [f] d. Defamation, libel, slander; or [|] e. Invasion of privacy.\u201d (Italics added.) Under the heading, \u201cPolicy Period,\u201d the policy stated that it \u201capplies only to . . . \u2018bodily injury\u2019, \u2018personal injury\u2019, or \u2018property damage\u2019 . . . which occurs during the policy period.\u201d The inclusive dates of the policy period\u2014one year in each instance\u2014appeared on the declarations page of each policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">There were two definitions of \u201coccurrence,\u201d depending on the type of harm involved. For \u201cproperty damage\u201d and \u201cbodily injury,\u201d \u201coccurrence\u201d meant \u201c[a]n accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to the same or similar harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage.\u2019 \u201d For \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d \u201coccurrence\u201d was defined as \u201c[a]n act or series of acts of the same or similar nature that occurs during the policy period and which results in \u2018personal injury.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The policy contained a \u201cLimit of Liability\u201d provision, stating: \u201cOur total liability under Coverage E for all damages resulting from any one \u2018occurrence\u2019 will not be more than the limit of insurance for Coverage E[, $500,000,] as shown in the Declarations. The limit is the same regardless of the number of \u2018insureds\u2019, claims made or persons injured. All \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 resulting from any one accident or from continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions shall be considered to be the result of \u2018one occurrence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">C. <em>Safeco Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The Safeco policies provided Lancer with excess coverage. For our purposes, the insuring provisions of the Safeco policies and the Fireman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Fund policies were essentially the same, except Safeco was subject to policy limits of $5 million per occurrence. Safeco states in its opening brief that its policies covered the damages awarded against Lancer, assuming the Fireman\u2019s Fund benefits were exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">D. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">As stated, each Fireman\u2019s Fund policy had limits of $500,000 per occurrence. Under the insuring provisions, once Fireman\u2019s Fund paid that amount in indemnity, it was no longer obligated to pay defense costs or indemnity under the policy. Safeco contends that Fireman\u2019s Fund is liable for multiple policy limits because (1) each policy contained more than one definition of \u201coccurrence,\u201d and (2) both property damage and personal injury occurred during all four policy periods. Based on the language of the policies and the cause of the damage in this case, we reject those contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The landslide unquestionably resulted in an \u201coccurrence\u201d of \u201cproperty damage\u201d during the first policy period: The Rauches\u2019 backyard\u2014\u201ctangible property\u201d\u2014suffered \u201cproperty damage\u201d as a consequence of an \u201caccident.\u201d (See <em>Borg v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 448, 456-457 &amp; fn. 2, 460-461 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 811] <em>(Borg) </em>[loss of use]; <em>City of Mill Valley v. Transamerica Ins.

The landslide may have also resulted in \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under the first policy, specifically, \u201cwrongful entry or eviction\u201d (see <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1123-1132 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 670])\u2014an issue we do not decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The Fireman\u2019s Fund policy contained two definitions of \u201coccurrence,\u201d one for \u201cproperty damage\u201d and another for \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d Safeco argues that when a single event, such as a landslide, results in <em>both </em>types of harm, there are two occurrences under each policy for purposes of determining policy limits. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The different definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d simply determined whether coverage existed under a particular policy. (See <em>Whittaker Corp. </em>v. <em>Allianz Underwriters, Inc. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1241-1243 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 659].) As defined in the policies, an \u201coccurrence\u201d of \u201cproperty damage\u201d triggered coverage based on when the <em>damage </em>took place, not when the wrongful act was committed. (See <em>Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 667-670.) On the other hand, under the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d for \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d \u201c[i]t is the insured\u2019s <em>wrongful act, </em>not [the] injury to the third party claimant, that triggers coverage . . . .\u201d <em>(North American Building Maintenance, Inc. v.

Put another way, in determining which policies provided coverage, the definitions of \u201coccurrence\u201d meant that property damage claims triggered policies in effect at the time of the damage; personal injury claims triggered policies in effect when the wrongful act took place. (See <em>Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 669-673; <em>North American Building Maintenance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at p. 633, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s liability under the policies is determined on a \u201cper occurrence\u201d basis. In determining policy limits, <em>\u201coccurrence </em>has generally been held to mean the underlying cause of the injury, rather than the injury or claim itself; otherwise, the insurer\u2019s effort to limit its liability per occurrence would be substantially weakened.\u201d <em>(Whittaker Corp. v.

In such a case, the result is a finding of only one claim, i.e., the court looks to the single cause rather than to the multiple injuries.\u201d <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v.

Such limits are usually stated in terms of a certain amount for <em>each </em>\u2018occurrence,\u2019 \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018claim\u2019 during the policy period.\u201d (Croskey et al., Cal.

It is irrelevant that there are multiple injuries or injuries of different magnitudes, or that the injuries extend over a period of time. Conversely, when a cause is interrupted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>or when there are several autonomous causes, there are multiple \u201coccurrences\u201d for purposes of determining policy limits and assessing deductibles.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Caldo Oil Co. v.

But in determining . . . <em>which </em>policy or policies provide coverage [for property damage]\u2014the focus is on the <em>timing of the injury or </em>damage; i.e., whether the injury or damage took place during the policy period.\u201d (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:375, p. 7A-119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Here, there was one uninterrupted cause or event\u2014the landslide\u2014that resulted in all the damage. Some of the damage\u2014loss of use\u2014may have continued into subsequent policy periods. But the existence of only one cause or event means there was only one occurrence for determining policy limits. (See, e.g., <em>Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 672 [freight train derailment is one occurrence for determining policy limits]; <em>Caldo Oil Co. v. State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1826-1829 [leakage from two storage tanks located on different sites constituted two occurrences for purposes of policy limits].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Safeco\u2019s reliance on the policy\u2019s \u201cLimit of Liability\u201d provision is misplaced. That provision stated in part that \u201c[a]ll <em>\u2018bodily </em>injury\u2019 and <em>\u2018property damage\u2019 </em>resulting from any one accident or from continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions shall be considered to be the result of \u2018one occurrence.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) Safeco deems it significant that Fireman\u2019s Fund did not include <em>\u201cpersonal injury\u201d </em>in the provision. This omission, Safeco contends, means that a single occurrence of property damage can simultaneously give rise to <em>additional </em>occurrences under the personal injury coverage in determining policy limits\u2014for example, a second occurrence for wrongful entry and yet a third for wrongful eviction. But,-as we have explained, policy limits are determined by the cause of the damage. Here, there was only one cause regardless of the number of injurious effects. (See <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Elizabeth N. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1236-1237 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 327].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">And Safeco can. hardly rely on a provision <em>limiting </em>an insurer\u2019s liability per occurrence in arguing for <em>higher </em>policy limits. (Cf. <em>Elysian Investment Group v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. </em>(2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 315, 324 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 372] [\u201c \u2018an exclusion cannot act as an additional grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>or extension of coverage\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Ray v.

American Empire Surplus Lines </em>(D.Md. 1993) 811 F.Supp. 210, 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Nor is it relevant that the resulting damage may have continued into subsequent policy periods. Policy limits are based on the number of occurrences, not the amount, type, or timing of the damage. Fireman\u2019s Fund was obligated to pay up to $500,000 \u201cper occurrence.\u201d An occurrence of property damage was defined as \u201can accident, <em>including </em>continuous . . . exposure to the same or similar harmful conditions, which results during the policy period, in . . . \u2018property damage.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) This definition distinguishes between a precipitating act or event (\u201can accident, including . . . exposure\u201d) and the ensuing harm (\u201cproperty damage\u201d). (See <em>Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 668-673.) <em>Both </em>are necessary to constitute an \u201coccurrence.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at p. 668, fn. 12 [distinguishing between an occurrence and the resulting loss of use].) The phrase \u201cincluding continuous . . . exposure\u201d does not dispense with the requirement of a precipitating act or event. Rather, it makes clear that the act or event does not have to be sudden for coverage to apply. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672.) Thus, the mere continuation of damage during successive policy periods, by itself, does not create a series of indefinitely ongoing occurrences. A subsequent policy period that consists solely of preexisting or continuing damage, without another precipitating act or event, does not provide additional benefits. Assuming there was a loss of use that continued after the first policy period, there was still only one precipitating act or event, that is, only one \u201coccurrence\u201d: the landslide, which resulted in the loss of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Further, \u201c \u2018this definition [of \u201coccurrence\u201d] includes the word \u201caccident.\u201d This [was] done in order to clarify the intent with respect to time of coverage and application of policy limits, particularly in situations involving a related series of events attributable to the <em>same factor. </em>Under such circumstances only <em>one accident or occurrence </em>is intended as far as the application of <em>policy limits </em>is concerned.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 672, italics added &amp; omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Turning to the coverage for \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d an occurrence meant \u201c[a]n act or series of acts of the same or similar nature that occurs during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>policy period and which results in \u2018personal injury.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018In the world of liability insurance, personal injury coverage applies to injury which arises out of the commission of certain enumerated acts or offenses. . . . Coverage thus is triggered by the offense, not the injury or damage which a plaintiff suffers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Martin Marietta Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1124, citation omitted.) If a wrongful entry or eviction occurred in this case, the \u201coffense\u201d was committed during the first policy period. A reasonable interpretation of the policies does not support a conclusion that the Rauches were continuously or repeatedly <em>evicted. </em>Within 24 hours after the landslide, the city declared their backyard off-limits. The Rauches were evicted once, at that time, if at all. And there was no finding at trial to the effect that another wrongful <em>entry </em>took place after the landslide.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Safeco counters that the coverage for \u201cpersonal injury\u201d encompasses nuisances and that nuisances are <em>continuing </em>offenses. (See <em>Remmer v. Glens Falls Indem. Co. </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 84, 88-89 [295 P.2d 19] <em>(Remmer); Borg, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at pp. 460-462; <em>Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp. </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 1087, 1099-1103 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 912 P.2d 1220]; <em>Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1219 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 518].) Of course, the continuing nature of a nuisance is an aspect of <em>substantive nuisance law. </em>(See <em>Remmer, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at pp. 88-89; <em>Borg, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at pp. 460-462; <em>Mangini, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at pp. 1099-1103; <em>Beck Development Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 1219.) That law may have played a role at trial in determining the Rauches\u2019 damages. But the <em>insurance policy </em>does not use the term \u201cnuisance\u201d or refer to nuisance law. \u201c[T]he proper issue here is whether the <em>facts </em>of this case fit within the policies\u2019 personal injury coverage, not whether <em>nuisance . . . </em>fit[s] under the personal injury coverage.\u201d <em>(Travelers Indem. Co. v. Summit Corp. </em>(Ind.Ct.App. 1999) 715 N.E.2d 926, 937, italics added, fn. omitted.) As noted, under the policy language, the offenses of wrongful entry and eviction <em>occurred, </em>if at all, when they were committed\u2014 during the first policy period\u2014not at the time of the injury or damage. (See <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1124; <em>North American Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at p. 633, fn. 4.) In short, the timing and duration of damage did not determine coverage for wrongful entry or eviction. (See <em>Martin Marietta Corp., supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1124; <em>North American Building Maintenance, Inc., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at p. 633, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Nothing in <em>Remmer, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 84, or <em>Borg, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th 448, is to the contrary. <em>Remmer </em>involved insured homeowners who graded and filled a portion of their lot in a faulty manner. Years later, a landslide occurred, damaging the property of the downhill neighbor. The downhill neighbor sued the insureds for creating a nuisance, and they, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>looked to their insurer for a defense under a single policy. The court recognized that a nuisance is of a continuing nature (see <em>Remmer, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at pp. 88-89) but distinguished between an \u201coccurrence\u201d and the resulting damage. It held that the nuisance did not trigger potential coverage, and thus did not require a duty to defend because, although the wrongful act (the grading and filling) occurred during the policy period, the damage did not arise until after the policy had expired. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 88-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Similarly, in <em>Borg, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th 448, where the insured\u2019s overhanging deck encroached upon a neighbor\u2019s property, causing an ongoing loss of use over a period of years, the court held that the policy provided potential coverage because it was in effect during the neighbor\u2019s loss of use (damage), even though it was not in effect when the encroaching deck was built (the wrongful act was committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Neither <em>Remmer </em>nor <em>Borg </em>concerned multiple policies or the determination of policy limits. Both cases involved the trigger of coverage in determining the duty to defend under a single policy. They simply illustrate the rule, set forth in <em>Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 645, that for purposes of property damage liability, \u201c \u2018the time of the occurrence of an accident ... is not the time the wrongful act was committed, but the time when the complaining party was actually damaged.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 670, quoting <em>Remmer, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at p. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Our interpretation of the policy\u2014that there was one occurrence\u2014is consistent with the reasonable expectations of the insured. According to Safeco, when the landslide happened, it simultaneously gave rise to personal injury and property damage in a variety of ways. As the mud and debris initially crossed the Rauches\u2019 property line, it caused a wrongful entry; as it moved onto their property, it caused physical injury; and after it ended, it resulted in a wrongful eviction and an ongoing loss of use. Yet, notwithstanding these various types of harm, the insured would perceive them all as the result of a single discrete event\u2014the landslide. Nor would the insured believe that by paying annual premiums of around $1,600, he was entitled to an additional $500,000 per year in benefits, for a total of $2 million, based on conditions that remained static after the landslide; The insured\u2019s slope and the Rauches\u2019 backyard were unchanged during the successive policy periods, resulting in a jury award of around $88,000 for loss of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">As one court explained in a case involving continuing damage caused by hazardous waste disposal: \u201c[The insured] contends that the contract definition of \u2018occurrence\u2019 is so broad that an occurrence is ongoing as long as any harm from loss of use of property continues as a result of presence in or upon the property of any contaminant deposited there years earlier. Thus, the argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>goes, an \u2018occurrence\u2019 type of liability insurance coverage, in each new policy period, provides more coverage, added to that existing under policies for previous policy periods, until all contaminants that impair use of the property have been removed. Such an interpretation of liability insurance contracts would indeed tap vastly more insurance resources to help pay for the consequences of ill-advised toxic waste disposal. But a moment\u2019s reflection on the resulting extraordinary expansion of coverage, beyond anyone\u2019s reasonable expectations at the time of issuance of liability insurance coverage . . ., is enough to cause a court concern about fidelity to the judicial role. Taking this course, a court would be engaging in . . . expanding] coverage beyond the terms of the contract between the parties, construed in accordance with ordinary rules of contract law.\u201d <em>(Interex Corp. v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(D.Mass. 1995) 874 F.Supp. 1406, 1411-1412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">For its part, Safeco argues that the allegations of the complaint <em>triggered </em>all of the Fireman\u2019s Fund policies. That may be true. But a triggered policy is not necessarily a policy that pays. (See <em>Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 655, fn. 2, 659, fn. 9.) As stated, Fireman\u2019s Fund was required to pay up to $500,000 per occurrence, and there was only one occurrence. Haying paid that amount in indemnity, Fireman\u2019s Fund had no further duty to pay for defense or indemnity regardless \u2022 of <em>potential </em>coverage under successive policies. Although the complaint in <em>Rauch </em>alleged that, after the landslide, mud and debris from Lancer\u2019s property continued to flow onto the Rauches\u2019 residence when it rained, neither the stipulated facts nor the .evidence on the insurers\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment supported that allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Finally, we note that many comprehensive general liability policies obligate the insurer to \u201c \u2018pay on behalf of the insured <em>all sums </em>which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . property damage ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Montrose II, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 656, italics added.) Because the insurer agrees to pay \u201call sums,\u201d the policy language may support an argument that the insured is entitled to the policy limits under successive policies even though there is only one occurrence. (See, e.g., <em>Stonewall Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Palos Verdes Estates </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1810, 1834, 1849, 1855 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 176]; <em>FMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Plaisted &amp; Companies </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1182-1191 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 467]; Croskey et al\u201e Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:376.2, p. 7A-120.) This argument, which could result in \u201cstacking\u201d policy limits, has no application to the homeowners policy here, under which the insurer agreed to \u201c[p]ay <em>up to our limit of </em>insurance[, $500,000 <em>per </em>occurrence,] for the damages for which the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally liable.\u201d (Italics added.) As we have discussed, there was only one occurrence in this case, entitling the insured to $500,000 in indemnity under the first policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that Fireman\u2019s Fund satisfied its obligations under the policies once it paid .$500,000 toward the settlement of the <em>Rauch </em>and <em>Rapture </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AZA\">Jackson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b555-7\">VOGEL, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">I concur but write separately to emphasize a few points.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">These are the pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Harold Lancer, the insured, owned a house on the top of a slope. Lawrence and Linda Rauch (collectively Rauch) lived at the bottom of the slope, which failed on February 27, 1998, at which time mud and debris flowed onto Rauch\u2019s property. Rauch lost the use of his backyard and had to move some of his personal property into storage. The City of Los Angeles ordered Lancer to repair the slope but he did not comply with the order. In February 1999, Rauch sued Lancer and the other uphill owners for damages and injunctive relief on theories of negligence (failure to maintain the slope), trespass (by the mudslide) and nuisance (the continuing risk of \u201cadditional slippage\u201d). Another action against the same defendants was filed by Rauch\u2019s downhill neighbors and various cross-complaints were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">At the time of the landslide, Lancer was insured (1) by a $500,000 Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company homeowners policy and (2) by a $5 million Safeco Insurance Company of America personal umbrella policy. The Fireman\u2019s Fund policy was effective from June 1997 to June 1998, and was renewed annually for three years, through June 2001; the Safeco policy was effective from July 1997 to July 1998, and was renewed annually for two years, through July 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Lancer notified both Fireman\u2019s Fund and Safeco of the lawsuits, and Fireman\u2019s Fund provided a defense in both Rauch\u2019s action and his downhill neighbors\u2019 action. Before Rauch\u2019s action went to trial, Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s contributions to various settlements exceeded $500,000, and Fireman\u2019s Fund took the position that its homeowners policy limits were exhausted. When Safeco disagreed, Fireman\u2019s Fund continued to defend Lancer in Rauch\u2019s action, subject to a reservation of its right to recover certain postexhaustion defense costs from Safeco.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Rauch\u2019s action was tried in part to the court, in part to a jury. The court found there was a nuisance, ordered Lancer and his uphill neighbors to repair the slope according to a particular plan approved by the city, and determined that the cost of the repair would be about $3.8 million. The damage issues were then tried to a jury, which found for Lancer on the trespass claim but against him on Rauch\u2019s negligence and nuisance causes of action. The jury awarded $75,500 to Rauch for his relocation costs and loss of use of his backyard, and $12,500 in noneconomic damages (annoyance and inconvenience), to which the court added interest, costs of developing the repair plan, and litigation costs. Fireman\u2019s Fund contributed $265,000 in defense costs in Rauch\u2019s action, and Safeco paid the remaining amounts owed by Lancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In 2002 (before Rauch\u2019s action was concluded), Safeco filed this declaratory relief action against Fireman\u2019s Fund, claiming that Lancer was covered not only by the 1998 homeowners policy in effect on the date of the landslide but also by the three successive policies\u2014and that each policy provided $1 million in coverage, $500,000 for property damage and an additional $500,000 for personal injury, a total of $4 million. Fireman\u2019s Fund cross-complained against Safeco for declaratory relief, equitable subrogation, and equitable indemnity, claiming it owed Lancer only $500,000 for a single occurrence and was entitled to reimbursement from Safeco for its postexhaustion defense costs ($265,000). Following cross-motions for summary judgment based on stipulated facts, the trial court rendered judgment for Fireman\u2019s Fund.

In order to determine coverage (as opposed to a duty to defend), the number of \u201coccurrences\u201d is calculated by reference to the event causing the injury. <em>(EOTT Energy Corp. v.

Rauch\u2019s property, once damaged by the 1998 landslide, was covered by Lancer\u2019s 1998 Fireman\u2019s Fund policy\u2014and the fact that Rauch\u2019s loss of use of that property continued into successive policy periods does not mean there was coverage under Lancer\u2019s subsequent policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The jury in Rauch\u2019s case against Lancer found there was a nuisance, which Safeco characterizes as an eviction of Rauch from at least part of his property and a continuing loss during the periods of the successive Fireman\u2019s Fund policies. Safeco\u2019s argument confuses the causative event with the-resulting, damage. As noted in the majority opinion and above, the occurrence was the February 1998 landslide, which in one fell swoop damaged Rauch\u2019s property, created a nuisance, and caused his partial eviction. The fact that the damage (partial eviction and loss of use) continued into subsequent policy periods does not mean there was more than one occurrence, without which coverage under the subsequent policies was not triggered. (Cf. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Central National Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1036-1038 [211 Cal.Rptr. 902]; see <em>Interex Corp. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(D.Mass. 1995) 874 F.Supp. 1406, 1411-1412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">I think this point is best made with an example. Assume there was no landslide but in 1998 Lancer and Rauch discovered the hill was unstable and that there was a possibility the slope might fail (a threat of harm). If Rauch wanted to sell his property, he would have to disclose this known defect to a potential buyer and thus would suffer a loss from the diminution of the value of his property\u2014and he probably could sue Lancer for injunctive relief and damages. But there would be no coverage under the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy because there would not have been an occurrence (no act or accident resulting in physical injury to or destruction of the property or loss of its use, or personal injury), notwithstanding that there would have been damage and-that the damage might have continued over a period of years if Lancer refused to fix the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>In our case, there was a landslide, and there was coverage under the 1998 Fireman\u2019s Fund policy for the damage (physical injury, destruction, and loss of use) caused and suffered during the policy period\u2014but not for the continuing loss of use in subsequent policy periods, because there was no occurrence during any of the successive policy periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">For these reasons, I agree that the judgment must be affirmed, and that Safeco must reimburse Fireman\u2019s Fund for its postexhaustion defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 12, 2007.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
