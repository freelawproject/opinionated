She alleged Exchange, in violation of Insurance Code section 381, subdivision (f),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not state in the automobile policy issued to her the fee it charges insureds for paying the policy annual premium in installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Exchange filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate challenging the trial court\u2019s orders (1) granting Williams\u2019s motion for summary judgment,and (2) denying Exchange\u2019s motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. Exchange contends: (1) The trial court erred by interpreting the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), to include fees imposed for installment payments of the annual premium; (2) Williams agreed to pay the fees disclosed by Exchange on her billing statement; (3) it substantially complied with section 381, subdivision (f); and (4) even if it violated section 381, subdivision (f), there are triable issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment for Williams. Because we conclude the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), does not include charges imposed for mating payments of the annual premium in installments, Exchange did not violate that statute and therefore Williams is not entitled to summary judgment in her class action against Exchange and Exchange is entitled to summary judgment against Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">In January 2002, Williams obtained an automobile insurance policy (Policy) from Exchange. She paid the Policy\u2019s annual premium in one lump sum. In January 2003, on renewal of the Policy she again paid the Policy\u2019s annual premium in one lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">In December 2003, Exchange mailed to Williams a renewal declarations page for the Policy and an accompanying billing statement for the annual renewal period beginning in January 2004. The declarations page set forth the \u201cgrand total\u201d premium due of $1,049 and, after deduction of a policyholder\u2019s dividend of $63, required Williams to pay a \u201cnet total\u201d premium of $986 to renew her policy for another year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The accompanying billing statement gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Williams the option of paying the $986 annual net premium in either one lump sum or nine monthly installments, subject to additional charges for interest at a rate of 17.99 percent per year and requiring payment of only the first installment of $53.60. Williams read the billing statement, understood an election to pay the annual premium in installments would subject her to interest charges, and elected to pay the annual prefiaium in installments rather than in one lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">In December 2004, Exchange mailed to Williams a renewal declarations page for the Policy and an accompanying billing statement for the renewal period beginning in January 2005. The declarations page set forth the \u201ctotal annual\u201d premium due of $913 and, after deduction of a policyholder\u2019s dividend of $67, required Williams to pay a \u201cnet\u201d premium of $846 to renew her policy for another year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The accompanying billing statement gave Williams the option of paying the $846 annual net premium in either one lump sum or nine monthly installments, subject to additional charges for interest at a rate of 18 percent per year and requiring payment initially of only the first installment of $34.48. Williams again elected to pay the annual premium in installments rather than in one lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">On October 6, 2004, Williams, on behalf of herself, others similarly situated, and the general public, filed the instant complaint against Exchange alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2). committing an unlawful business act or practice in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.; (3) violating the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.); (4) unjust enrichment; and (5) money had and received. The premise for each cause of action was Exchange\u2019s alleged wrongful charging and receipt of a fee for payment of annual premiums in installments, a \u201cpremium\u201d not stated in its policies in violation of section 381, subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">On March 15, 2005, the trial court overruled Exchange\u2019s demurrer,to the complaint. The trial court subsequently granted Williams\u2019s motion to represent the class of all Exchange automobile insurance policyholders.who paid installment charges after October 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">On or about August 5, Williams filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. On August 12, Exchange filed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. On October 26, pursuant to Exchange\u2019s request, the trial court stayed the proceedings and referred to the California Department of Insurance (DOI) the question of \u201c[wjhether installment fees [constitute a] premium as that term is used in [section] 381[, subdivision] (f).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">On April 25, 2006, the DOI issued an opinion' finding \u201cthe term \u2018premium\u2019 has several different (and sometimes conflicting) meanings depending upon the context in which it is used.\u201d It discussed the various meanings of the term \u201cpremium\u201d in actuarial, accounting, industry practice, taxation, DOI rate approval, and other statutory contexts. Apparently finding those other meanings unhelpful in determining the meaning of the term \u201cpremium\u201d for section 381, subdivision (f) purposes, the DOI reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-6\">\u201c[T]he primary purpose of \u00a7 381 (as specifically stated for the automobile line of insurance in \u00a7 383.5) is to prevent fraud and mistake by requiring insurers' to list the basic terms of the contract. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner\u2019s view that policyholders would be less likely to be defrauded or mistaken about the amount of premium if that term is defined in the broadest sense, in the typical way policyholders view their installment payments (i.e., the total price of obtaining coverage, including the installment fee).' If that overall price varies depending on the existence of an installment fee, a policyholder will be less likely to be mistaken about the cost of insurance if the policy discloses the nature and amount of that variation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-7\">\u201cThis interpretation is consistent with 10 CCR \u00a7 2360 [szc] . .., which was promulgated to make certain that insurance companies charge policyholders the lowest available price for insurance coverage. For such a figure to be meaningful, the regulation uses a liberal definition that includes \u2018all other items which change the amount the insurer charges to the insured,\u2019 which presumably would include installment fees. The same reasoning applies here.\u201d Accordingly, the DOI concluded: \u201c[T]he purpose of \u00a7 381 was not to calculate rates, determine tax liability, or assess the financial solvency of insurers, but to mandate the disclosure of material insurance contract terms, including the price. For the above reasons, the Commissioner concludes that installment fees are [a] premium under \u00a7 381* in the private passenger automobile context.\u201d The DOI then noted: \u201cThe Commissioner is giving consideration to promulgating regulations and/or proposing legislation to clarify what charges must be disclosed under premium and to address other issues raised by this referral.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>On August 3, the trial court granted Williams\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Exchange\u2019s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-6\">\u201cIn reaching this ruling, the Court has given the Department of Insurance\u2019s (\u2018DOI\u2019) [opinion] some deference. In <em>Yamaha Corp. of America </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 11 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031], where, in addressing the issue of relying [on] an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, the Court said, \u2018Because an interpretation is an agency\u2019s <em>legal opinion, </em>however \u201cexpert,\u201d rather than the exercise of a delegated legislative power to make. law, it commands a commensurably lesser degree of judicial deference.\u2019 Thus, this Court is not precluded from giving some degree of deference to the DOI\u2019s decision in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-7\">\u201cThe decided law supports the conclusion that defendant should have included the installment fees in the premium. In <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Board of [Equal.] </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 165, 168 [336 P.2d 961], the court stated, \u2018 \u201cPremium\u201d in the law of insurance means the amount paid to the company for insurance. [Citation.]\u2019 The <em>Allstate </em>court held that, \u2018The \u201cinstallment payment fee\u201d . . . was \u201cactually given by the insured for his insurance.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 173.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-8\">\u201cThe reasoning of the <em>Allstate </em>case applies here. Defendant requires payment of the installment fee as a condition of receiving insurance.' Thus, the installment fees are part of the amount paid to the company for insurance. <em>(Allstate, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.2d at p. 168.) Failure to specify those fees in the policy is a violation of Insurance Code section 381, subdivision (f). This violation forms the basis for each of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action.\u201d The court then addressed each of Williams\u2019s five causes of action, concluding she proved her entitlement to relief under each one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">On August 24, Exchange filed the instant petition (Petition), requesting we issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the trial court' to vacate its order granting Williams\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Exchange\u2019s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and to issue a new order denying Williams\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting Exchange\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On November 21, we issued an order to the trial court to show cause why the relief requested by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>the Petition should not be granted. We subsequently issued an order allowing Williams to file a return to the Petition and Exchange to file a reply. We have received and considered those documents, together with the Petition, and its accompanying exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">\n<em>Grounds for Writ Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">Exchange contends we should consider the Petition\u2019s merits even though a final judgment has not yet been entered because if it waited to challenge that judgment on appeal, it would be required to post an appellate bond costing millions of dollars, which could not be recovered from Williams were its appeal successful.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1086 provides: \u201cThe writ [of mandate] must be issued in all cases where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law. . . .\u201d To obtain writ review, a petitioner generally must show his or her remedy in the ordinary course of law is inadequate or that petitioner would suffer irreparable injury were the writ not granted. <em>(Powers v. City of Richmond </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 85, 113-114 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 893 P.2d 1160]; <em>City of Half Moon Bay v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 795, 803 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 213].) However, discretionary writ review may nevertheless be appropriate \u201cwhere it is necessary to resolve an issue of first impression promptly and to set guidelines for bench and bar. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rodrigues v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1032 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 194]; see <em>also Elden v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1497, 1504 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 322] [\u201c[W]rit review is permissible here since the petition raises a novel issue of law.\u201d].) Furthermore, writ review may be appropriate to \u201cprevent a needless and expensive trial and reversal [citation].\u201d <em>(Coulter v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 144, 148 [145 Cal.Rptr. 534, 577 P.2d 669], superseded by statute on another ground as noted in <em>Sakiyama </em>v. <em>AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 398, 412, fn. 6 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 762].) It may also be appropriate if the issues involved are of \u201cwidespread interest\u201d <em>(Brandt v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 813, 816 [210 Cal.Rptr. 211, 693 P.2d 796]) or if \u201cresolution of the issue would result in a final disposition as to the petitioner\u201d <em>(Casterson v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 177, 182 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 637]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>Based on Exchange\u2019s representation regarding the substantial cost of an appeal bond were Williams to obtain a judgment awarding her represented class the amount she apparently seeks, it would seem improbable Exchange' could recover that cost after a successful appeal of the judgment and therefore its remedy in the ordinary course of law may be inadequate. In any event, assuming arguendo Exchange has not shown its remedy on appeal would be inadequate, we nevertheless conclude one or more of the exceptional circumstances discussed above apply and warrant discretionary writ review in this case. Both parties agree the question of the meaning of the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), is one of first impression. Because section 381 presumably is a consumer protection statute affecting all Californians who . obtain automobile insurance, that issue also is one of widespread interest. Therefore, we exercise our discretion to reach the merits in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">\n<em>Summary Judgment Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">\u201c[A]fter a motion for summary judgment has been granted [by a trial court], [an appellate court] review[s] the record de novo, considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Guz </em>v. <em>Bechtel National, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 334 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089]; see <em>Saelzler </em>v. <em>Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 767 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143].) \u201cThe purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties\u2019 pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\"><em>Aguilar </em>clarified the standards that apply to summary judgment motions under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 843-857.) Generally, if all the papers submitted by the parties show there is no triable issue of material fact and the \u201c \u2018moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c)),\u201d the court must grant the motion for summary judgment. <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>at p. 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (o) provides that a cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or more elements of that cause of action cannot separately be established; or (2) a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>establishes an affirmative defense to that cause of action. Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (p)(2) states: \u201cA defendant or cross-defendant has. met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be.established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. Once the defendant or cross-defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff or cross-complainant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. The plaintiff or cross-complainant may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u201d <em>Aguilar </em>made the following observations: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>an element of a cause of action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 853.) It is sufficient for a defendant \u201cto show that the plaintiff cannot establish at least one element of the cause of action,\u201d which the defendant can do \u201cby showing that the'plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 853-854.) \u201cSummary judgment law in this state . . . continues to require a defendant moving for summary judgment to present evidence, and not simply point out that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 854, fn. omitted.) <em>Aguilar </em>stated: \u201cTo speak broadly, all of the foregoing discussion of summary judgment law in this state, like that of its federal counterpart, may be reduced to, and justified by, a single proposition: <em>If a party moving for summary judgment in any action . . . would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination, then he should prevail on summary judgment. </em>In such a case, ... the \u2018court should grant\u2019 the motion \u2018and avoid a . . . trial\u2019 rendered \u2018useless\u2019 by nonsuit or directed verdict or similar device.

There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-6\">\u201cSecond, and generally, the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a shift,' and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact. ...

It is commonly understood that a premium is the amount paid for certain insurance for a certain period of coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For example, in this case Exchange charged Williams an annual premium of $986 for renewal of her automobile insurance coverage for the period from January 2004 through January 2005. As section 480 confirms, a premium is to be paid on commencement of the period of insurance coverage. Section 480 provides: \u201cAn insurer is entitled to payment of the premium as soon as' the subject matter insured is exposed to the peril insured against.\u201d Therefore, in the case of an annual period of renewal of insurance coverage, an insurer is entitled to payment of the annual premium in one lump sum at the beginning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>policy period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (\u00a7 480.) To the extent an insurer provides an insured with the option of paying that one lump sum in installments of partial premium payments together with interest on the unpaid premium balance, the interest charged for the time value of money for the option of making payments of premium over time is <em>not </em>considered part of the premium paid for insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">In this sense, a premium is analogous to the principal amount of a loan. In a loan situation, the principal loan amount is often paid in installments of partial principal payments together with interest accrued on the unpaid principal balance. In that context, it is commonly understood, and cannot reasonably be argued otherwise, that payment of the interest charged is not payment of part of the unpaid principal amount, but rather for the time value of the unpaid principal amount. The same concept of time value of money applies in this case, in which Exchange provided Williams with the option of paying her annual lump sum premium in installments of partial premium amounts together with interest on the unpaid premium balance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, the interest charged by Exchange for use of its installment payment option does <em>not </em>constitute a \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), and therefore was not required to be disclosed in its declarations page or elsewhere in the Policy. Because the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), is clear and unambiguous, it is not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation proffered by Williams and we need not engage in further statutory construction. ?(P<em>eople v.

Belled, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 884.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">Although we do not rely on cases from other jurisdictions in reaching our decision in this case, we note that courts in another state have considered the term \u201cpremium\u201d in a like manner. One court stated: \u201cThe installment fees are paid not to procure an indemnification contract, but for the privilege of paying the premium over time.\u201d <em>(Blanchard v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(La.Ct.App. 2000) 774 So.2d 1002, 1006.) Accordingly, under the applicable Louisiana statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number><em>Blanchard </em>concluded \u201cthese [installment] fees need not be disclosed on the policy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Cacamo v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(La.Ct.App. 2004) 885 So.2d 1248 found <em>Blanchard\u2019s </em>reasoning \u201csound\u201d and reached the same conclusion. <em>(Cacamo, </em>at p. 1256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">Williams does not cite any California case (or apposite case from another jurisdiction) holding the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), or otherwise for insurance policy disclosure purposes, includes interest charged for the time value of money for the option of making payments of premium over time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although she cites, as the trial court did, <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equal., supra, </em>169 Cal.App.2d 165 as authority supporting that position, <em>Allstate </em>is distinguishable because it interpreted the term \u201cgross premiums\u201d for taxation purposes and, in any event, involved inapposite, facts to this case. <em>Allstate </em>stated: \u201c \u2018Premium\u2019 in the law of insurance means the amount paid to the company for insurance. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 168.) In the context of taxation of insurance companies, \u201c[t]he gross premium, or the amount charged in a contract of insurance, ordinarily includes two elements, that is, the net premium and the loading. The loading, or the amount arbitrarily added to the net premium, is intended to cover the expenses of the company. In a stock company it may also be a source of profit; and in a mutual company, a source from which dividends may be paid to the insured. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because \u201c[t]he expense of administering the insurance is a component of premium,\u201d <em>Allstate </em>reasoned that \u201c[reimbursement of the additional expense resulting from selling the insurance on an installment basis is an essential element of the gross premium.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 173.) In its circumstances involving an installment payment fee charged solely to recover the additional costs resulting from the optional installment payment program, <em>Allstate </em>stated: \u201cThe sole basis for the imposition of the \u2018installment payment fee\u2019 and the determination of its amount was the expense to the company of the additional installment collections. Plaintiff made the charge of the \u2018installment payment fee\u2019 directly to the insured in order that the increase of its expense from acceptance of installment premiums be passed directly to the insured. The option to the insured was whether he wanted to pay in installments. If he did, he was required to pay the installment payment charge. . . . The \u2018installment payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>fee\u2019 was an item of expense loading to cover the additional cost of the installment premium plan, and was in the same category as the expense loading in the cash premium. . . . The expense incident to the installment payment plan does not differ in character from other expenses included in premium. The entire cost to the policyholder arising out of the issuance and performance of the contract of insurance constitutes the taxable premium.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> Allstate </em>concluded that, in its circumstances, \u201cgross premiums\u201d for taxation purposes included installment payment fees based solely on the additional costs incurred by an insurance company in offering an installment payment program. <em>(Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equal., supra, </em>169 Cal.App.2d at pp. 173-174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\"><em>Allstate </em>is inapposite to this case because here the installment charges in question are not based on the additional costs incurred by Exchange in offering an installment payment program, but are based solely on the time value of money for use of the option of making payments of premium in installments (i.e., interest on the amount of the unpaid premium balance).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In Williams\u2019s statement of disputed material facts in opposition to Exchange\u2019s motion for summary judgment, she admits it is \u201c[u]ndisputed\u201d that \u201cExchange\u2019s administrative costs\u2014including the cost of collecting premiums paid in installments\u2014are included in the premium amount approved by the DOI (and listed on policyholders\u2019 declarations pages), on which the Exchange does pay gross premiums tax.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Although <em>Mercury Casualty Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 43 [190 Cal.Rptr. 72] also is distinguishable from this case because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>it interpreted the'term \u201cgross premiums\u201d in the context of taxation of insurance companies, it, unlike <em>Allstate, </em>involved interest income that an insurance company received from installment notes and therefore is more closely analogous to the circumstances' in this case. <em>(Mercury, </em>at pp. 44-45.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Mercury </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-6\">\u201cPlaintiff offers to prospective insureds the option of either paying, in advance, in cash, the annual premiums on policies written by it, or of paying part of such premiums in cash and partly by an installment note, for the balance. In the latter case, the insured is charged an amount calculated to cover the increased overhead to plaintiff for handling the notes and collecting them, <em>plus a sum equal to interest at the going rate on the principal of the notes. </em>- - \u25a0 '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-7\">\u201cPlaintiff treats the face of the note as part of the \u2018gross premium\u2019 and pays the \u2018gross income\u2019 tax thereon; it also treats the \u2018service charge\u2019 as part of the premium and pays the tax thereon. <em>It regards the interest charged as not-being part of the \u2018gross premium\u2019 </em>and, in this litigation, resists the board\u2019s position that it is a third element of the \u2018gross premium.\u2019 <em>We agree with the plaintiff.\u201d (Mercury Casualty Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at pp. 44-45, italics added.) <em>Mercury </em>reasoned: \u201c[I]n those cases where an insured pays the entire advance premium in cash, plaintiff co.uld, and would, invest the \u2018nonload\u2019 part of the premium and earn a nontaxable income therefrom. <em>It is the position of plaintiff </em>that, in computing the gross premium[,] it has satisfied its full obligation by its treatment of the \u2018service charge\u2019 and the face value of the note as part of the \u2018gross premium\u2019 <em>an\u00e9 that the interest it collects is no more than income from an investment\u2014i.e., a loan to the insured. We agree.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 45, italics added.) <em>Mercury </em>expressly concluded <em>Allstate </em>was factually inapposite to its case because \u201c[i]t did not deal with any \u2018interest\u2019 charge on the delayed installments.\u201d <em>(Mercury, </em>at p. 45.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">Therefore, although we do not rely on taxation cases in interpreting the meaning of the term \u201cpremium\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), to the extent those cases are analogous because they interpreted the term \u201cgross premiums,\u201d we conclude they support, rather than contradict, our conclusion above. In particular, we conclude <em>Mercury Casualty Co., </em>which effectively held interest income is not part of ,\u201cgross premiums\u201d for taxation purposes, is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>closely analogous to this case than is <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>cited by Williams and by the trial court in support of its order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Similarly, although Williams cites two California Attorney General opinions in support of her position, both opinions related to the definition of \u201cgross premiums\u201d in the context of insurance company taxation. (See 9 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 257 (1947); 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 768 (1975).) Therefore, those opinions are factually and legally inapposite and do not persuade us to reach a different conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Williams also argues we should give substantial deference to the DOI\u2019s opinion dated April 25, 2006, as discussed and quoted above, on the proper interpretation in this case of the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f). Apparently finding the meanings of the terms \u201cpremium\u201d and \u201cgross premiums\u201d in taxation, rate making, and other contexts unhelpful in determining the meaning of \u201cpremium\u201d for section 381, subdivision (f) purposes, the DOI reasoned: \u201c[T]he primary purpose of \u00a7 381 (as specifically stated for the automobile line of insurance in \u00a7 383.5) is to prevent fraud and mistake by requiring insurers to list the basic terms of the contract. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner\u2019s view that policyholders would be less likely to be defrauded or mistaken about the amount of premium if that term is defined in the broadest sense, in the typical way policyholders view their installment payments (i.e., the total price of obtaining coverage, including the installment fee). If that overall price varies depending on the existence of an installment fee, a policyholder will be less likely to be mistaken about the cost of insurance if the policy discloses the nature. and amount of that variation.\u201d Accordingly, the DOI concluded: \u201c[T]he purpose of \u00a7 381 was not to calculate rates, determine tax liability, or assess the financial solvency of insurers, but to mandate the disclosure of material insurance contract terms, including the price. For the above reasons[,] the Commissioner concludes that installment fees are premium under \u00a7 381, in the private passenger automobile context.\u201d In deciding the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the trial court expressly gave \u201csome deference\u201d to the DOI\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">However, the trial court erred in giving deference to the DOI\u2019s opinion. The DOI\u2019s opinion was not based on any long-standing administrative construction of section 381, subdivision (f), on the meaning of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>\u201cpremium.\u201d On the contrary, it is implicit in that opinion that the DOI had never before expressly addressed the specific issue in this case. As the California Supreme Court stated: \u201cBecause the [administrative] policy at issue here is not a formally adopted regulation, and the Board does not claim that its . . . policy constitutes a long-standing administrative construction of [the statute], <em>we need not defer </em>to any administrative understanding of the meaning of those [statutory] provisions. <em>We determine independently </em>[the meaning of those statutory provisions].\u201d <em>(Agnew v. State. Bd. of Equalization </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 310, 322 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 981 P.2d 52], italics added.) Alternatively stated, \u201cwhen, as here, the agency does not have a longstanding interpretation of the statute and has not adopted a formal regulation interpreting the statute, the courts may simply disregard the opinion offered by the agency. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(State of California ex rel. Nee v. Unumprovident Corp. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 442, 451 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 491].) Furthermore, an agency does not have the authority to alter or amend a statute or enlarge or impair its scope. <em>(Ibid.; Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 748 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697]; <em>First Industrial Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 545, 550 [159 P.2d 921].) \u201cThe ultimate interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power.\u201d <em>(Bodinson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>California E. Com. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 321, 326 [109 P.2d 935].) Accordingly, \u201ca tentative administrative interpretation [of a statute] makes no pretense at finality and it is the duty of this court, when such a question of law is properly presented, to state the true meaning of the statute finally and \u25a0 conclusively, even though this requires the overthrow of an earlier erroneous administrative construction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Therefore, in this case because the proper interpretation of the term \u201cpremium\u201d under section 381,' subdivision (f) is a question of law for our independent determination, we are not bound by the DOI\u2019s opinion on that question. <em>(Agnew v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>at p. 322.) Furthermore, because the DOI has not issued a formal regulation or had a long-standing opinion on that question (having first expressly addressed it on April 25, 2006, after the trial court referred this issue to the DOI), we do not defer to the DOI\u2019s opihion. <em>(Ibid.; State of California ex rel. Nee v. Unumprovident Corp., supra, </em>at p. 451.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Assuming arguendo the DOFs opinion is entitled to <em>some </em>deference, the degree of that deference \u201cturns on a legally informed, commonsense assessment of [its] contextual merit.\u201d <em>(Yamaha. Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1, 14.) However, in reaching its opinion in this case, the DOI expressly relied solely on its understanding of the primary purpose of section 381, subdivision (f)\u2014i.e., \u201cto prevent fraud and mistake\u201d-\u2014by requiring disclosure of an insurance contract\u2019s material terms. The DOI reasoned that primary purpose would be served by construing the term \u201cpremium\u201d broadly to include interest charged for the option of making payments of premium over time. However, in so doing, the DOI did not have</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>any special expertise that we or other courts lack in construing the underlying legislative intent of section 381 or its term \u201cpremium.\u201d To the extent the purpose of section 381 is to prevent fraud or mistake by requiring disclosure of material terms of an insurance contract, we are in as good a position as the DOI to determine the meaning and scope of the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in that statute. Accordingly, we give little, if any, deference to the DOI\u2019s opinion on the instant question. <em>(Yamaha Corp., </em>at p. 14; <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 842, 858-859 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 653].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Because, as we concluded above, the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), does not include interest charged for the time value of money for utilizing the option of making payments of the annual premium in installments, were we to defer to the DOI\u2019s contrary interpretation of that term, it would result in an unauthorized amendment, or enlargement of the scope, of section 381. <em>(State of California ex rel.

Daugherty, supra, </em>26 Cal.2d at p. 550.) If the Legislature wishes to expand the meaning of the term \u201cpremium\u201d beyond its plain and ordinary meaning, then it must amend that statute to expressly define that term to have an extraordinary, broader meaning.

States Preferred Ins. </em>(2004) 123 Wn.App. 12 [95 P.3d 391], cited by Williams, is inapposite because it involved a Washington statute that broadly defined the term \u201cpremium\u201d for insurance policy disclosure purposes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 392, fn. 2 [\u201c \u2018premium\u2019 [defined] as \u2018all sums charged, received, or deposited as consideration for an insurance contract or the continuance thereof.\u2019 \u201d].) More importantly, <em>Sheldon </em>expressly did not decide the .question whether a $2 installment fee constituted a \u201cpremium\u201d under that Washington statute, stating: \u201cAmerican States does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the fee constitutes premium. We therefore do not decide this issue.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 393, fn. 10.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1073-7\"> <em>Allstate </em>also stated: \u201cThe amount of the \u2018installment payment fee\u2019 was determined by cost accounting and was imposed to cover additional bookkeeping expense, and the collection expense ensuing from the necessity of additional entries in the accounts and billings resulting from the exercise of the installment payment plan.\u201d <em>(Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equal., supra, </em>169 Cal.App.2d at p. 166.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1073-8\"> Therefore, to the extent other cases cited by Williams approved or followed <em>Allstate, </em>those cases are also inapposite. (See, e.g., <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 649, 660 [186 Cal.Rptr. 578, 652 P.2d 426]; <em>Interinsurance Exchange v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 606, 614 [203 Cal.Rptr. 74].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1073-9\"> As supporting evidence for that statement of undisputed material fact, Exchange cites the declaration of John Boyle, executive vice-president of ACSC Management Services, Inc., which is Exchange\u2019s attorney-in-fact. In his declaration, Boyle states: \u201cAt all times during the class period, <em>the Exchange has employed an interest-based auto installment finance charge </em>(as opposed to a flat fee charge). In applying to the DOI for approval of a rate, <em>the Exchange includes the cost of collecting all premiums\u2014including the cost of collecting premiums paid in installments and of otherwise administering the installment payment program\u2014in the calculations that support its rate application. </em>The result is that the rates reviewed and approved by the DOI\u2014which rates result in <em>the premiums specified on each policyholder\u2019s declaration </em>page\u2014 <em>already reflect the cost of administering the installment payment program. </em>The Exchange pays gross premiums tax on all the premiums collected pursuant to the DOI-approved rates.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1074-9\"><em> </em>For purposes of this opinion, we presume, as Williams asserts, the installment notes in <em>Mercury </em>constituted \u201cpremium financing\u201d notes (or \u201cpremium finance agreements\u201d) within- the meaning of section 778 et seq. and therefore their periodic finance charges were, unlike the interest charges imposed under -the installment program in this case, subject to the specific statutory disclosure requirements of section 778.3. Despite those factual and legal differences, we- nevertheless conclude it is more closely analogous to this case than <em>Allstate </em>-is because <em>Mercury </em>focuses on interest charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1075-9\"> Williams also cites <em>State v. Allstate Insurance Company </em>(1960) 221 Ore. 371 [351 P.2d 433], overruled on another ground by <em>Parr v. Department of Revenue </em>(1976) 276 Ore. 113 [553 P.2d 1051, 1053], and <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. State Tax Com\u2019n </em>(1974) 365 Mass. 411 [312 N.E.2d 559], However, both of those cases involved the interpretation of \u201cgross premiums\u201d for taxation purposes and are closely analogous to <em>Allstate, </em>which we conclude is inapposite to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1077-8\"> In reaching our conclusion, we need not discuss, and do not rely on, other statutes and regulations cited by Exchange or the DOI\u2019s purported historical enforcement practices supporting Exchange\u2019s position. Furthermore, we do not rely on the mle of lenity that Exchange argues also supports its position. Nevertheless, we note that to the extent the term \u201cpremium\u201d is reasonably susceptible to Williams\u2019s proposed interpretation, because violation of section 381, subdivision (f)\u2019s disclosure requirements is a misdemeanor offense under section 383, subdivision (a), the rule of lenity presumably would apply to support our interpretation of that term in Exchange\u2019s favor, which interpretation presumably is also reasonable. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 622 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713]; <em>People ex rel. Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 312-313 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Overstreet </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 896 [231 Cal.Rptr. 213, 726 P.2d 1288].) Finally, we note Williams has not provided any evidence on section 381\u2019s legislative history (at the time of or since its enactment in 1935) showing the Legislature intended \u201cpremium,\u201d as used in section 381, subdivision (f), to have a meaning other than that which we have given it in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1078-12\"> Although, pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452, subdivision (d), and 459, we grant Exchange\u2019s request that we take judicial notice of the. stipulated dismissal of the appeal in <em>Steinbeck v. Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(Oct. 17, 2006, G035999), we did not consider that appeal or its dismissal in deciding this case. \u25a0 \u2022 -</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1078-14\"> To the extent Williams argues her breach of contract cause of action is not dependent on a violation of section 381, subdivision (f), Exchange- is nevertheless entitled to summary judgment because that cause of action is dependent on her allegation that it charged her interest not included as \u201cpremium\u201d in the Policy. Based on our interpretation of the term \u201cpremium\u201d in this case, she cannot show Exchange charged her a premium greater than that set forth in her declarations page or elsewhere in the Policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
