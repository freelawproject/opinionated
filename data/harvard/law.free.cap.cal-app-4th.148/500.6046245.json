(Pen. Code, \u00a7 368, subd. (e).) (All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise noted.) We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Defendant first contends there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction for theft based on a theory of larceny, because the victim, a 68-year-old man suffering from cognitive impairment due to Parkinson\u2019s disease and the medication taken to treat the disease, consented to her taking more than $17,000 of his money to buy herself a new sport utility vehicle (SUV). We disagree because substantial evidence showed the victim was not capable of consenting to the transfer of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Next, defendant argues\" the trial court erred by instructing the jury in accordance with section 1127g, enacted in 2004, that a witness with a cognitive impairment is not any more or less credible than any other witness. Defendant contends the instruction lowered the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof and thereby denied her federal constitutional due process. No published case has addressed whether an instruction tracking the language of section 1127g violates a defendant\u2019s \u25a0 due process rights by lowering the prosecution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>burden of proof. However, many cases considering the same instructional language applied to children as witnesses have determined the instruction does not lessen the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof and does not deny a defendant those rights. We publish this opinion because this reasoning also applies to the evaluation of the testimony of witnesses with developmental disabilities or cognitive, impairments, and hold that an instruction based on section 1127g does not violate federal constitutional due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In April 2004, Edward Walsh was 68 years old. He suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Defendant was hired to serve as Walsh\u2019s caretaker in April 2004. Her duties included driving Walsh to medical appointments; she was to use Walsh\u2019s car to do so. At some point after defendant was hired, Walsh\u2019s car was damaged in an accident. Walsh testified he became aware defendant was driving a new SUV sometime after the accident. Walsh asked defendant where she got the SUV; she showed Walsh a check he signed, and claimed the vehicle was a gift from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Walsh denied he knowingly signed a check to enable defendant to purchase the SUV. Walsh admitted his signature was on the check, but did not recall signing it. He also could not recall transferring money from his savings account to his checking account to fund the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">On April 7, 2004, Walsh had given his daughter, Stephanie Hill-Aikins, a power.of attorney. Hill-Aikins\u2019s name was on Walsh\u2019s checking account. Hill-Aikins wrote checks on that account to pay Walsh\u2019s bills. Hill-Aikins denied authorizing the writing, issuance, or payment of the check to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Hill-Aikins fired defendant on June 30, 2004, and contacted the police on the same day. Deputy Sheriff Brian Hagerman interviewed defendant at Walsh\u2019s residence on July 1, 2004. She told Deputy Hagerman the SUV was a gift from Walsh to reward her for work exceeding her agreed-upon duties. Defendant also told Deputy Hagerman she had asked Hill-Aikins for a larger vehicle to transport Walsh, and Hill-Aikins had refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Defendant claimed Walsh later gave her permission to buy the vehicle. Defendant told Deputy Hagerman that Walsh accompanied her to Wells Fargo bank, where he transferred $20,000 from his savings account to his checking account. Defendant-filled out a check dated June 3, 2004, in the amount of $17,365.61, made payable to Norma Catley, and Walsh signed it. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>then obtained a cashier\u2019s check from a different bank made out to Paradise Automotive, which she used to purchase the SUV. Defendant claimed she registered the SUV in her name because Walsh did not have a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In August 2004, Dr. Bryan Kemp met with Walsh, and determined Walsh had cognitive impairment, including problems with short-term memory and limited attention span, as a result of his Parkinson\u2019s disease, and the medication he took to treat and control the disease. Dr. Kemp testified at trial as an expert witness on financial abuse of the elderly. He characterized Walsh\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease as a disability that made him vulnerable to financial abuse. Dr. Kemp testified many elderly persons are reluctant to disclose financial abuse to their families, and, in this case, Walsh was upset with himself and was concerned about disclosing the situation to his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Defendant was charged with theft by a caretaker from an elder (\u00a7 368, subd. (e)), and grand theft (\u00a7 487). A jury found defendant guilty of caretaker theft, and not guilty of grand theft. Defendant was sentenced to three years\u2019 formal probation, including 180 days in. jail. Defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The record contains substantial evidence supporting defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to sustain her conviction under section 368, subdivision (e). \u201cIn assessing a claim of insufficiency of evidence, the reviewing court\u2019s task is to review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014 such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] The federal standard of review is to the same effect: Under principles of federal due process, review for sufficiency of evidence entails not the determination whether the reviewing court itself believes the evidence at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but, instead, whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] The standard of review is the same in cases in which the prosecution relies mainly on circumstantial evidence. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cAlthough it is the duty of the jury to acquit a defendant if it finds that circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence [citations], it is the jury, not the appellate court[,] which must be convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u2018 \u201cIf the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Defendant contends there was not substantial evidence of theft by larceny because she obtained the money from Walsh in a consensual transfer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The elements of theft by larceny are: (1) the defendant took possession of personal property owned by someone else; (2) the defendant did so without the owner\u2019s consent; (3) when the defendant took the property, he or she intended to deprive the owner of it permanently; and (4) the defendant moved the property, even a small distance, and kept it for any period of time, however brief. (Judicial Council of Cal. Crim. Jury Instns. (2006-2007) CALCRIM No. 1800; see \u00a7 484.) <em>\u201cThe act of taking personal property from the possession of another is always a trespass unless the owner consents to the taking freely and unconditionally </em>or the taker has a legal right to take the property. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 301, 305 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 965 P.2d 1165], fns. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Defendant argues she could not have committed theft by larceny because Walsh consented to her taking his money. But the jury was properly instructed on the issue of consent (CALJIC No. 1.23), and there was ample evidence Walsh was not capable of consenting to such a transaction. Dr. Kemp testified Walsh suffered from cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss due to his Parkinson\u2019s disease and the medication he took to control it. The medication also caused him to suffer depression and hallucinations. He had difficulty paying attention and was slow in his reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Walsh\u2019s own testimony at trial supports a finding he did not consent to transfer funds to defendant. Although the parties stipulated that Walsh\u2019s signature was on the check, Walsh testified he could not remember signing the check, or going to the bank to make the transfer of funds. At times during his testimony, Walsh could not recognize his own signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">In sum, Walsh\u2019s own testimony, as well as the expert opinion of Dr. Kemp, showed Walsh\u2019s mental capacity was sufficiently diminished to have prevented him from consenting to give or transfer the money to defendant. There was substantial evidence to support defendant\u2019s conviction for theft by larceny committed by the caregiver of an elder.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Because we conclude there was. substantial evidence supporting defendant\u2019s conviction based on a theory of theft by larceny, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding theft by fraud or theft by trick and device. If a jury is instructed on two alternative theories of criminal liability, one of which is legally sufficient and one of which is not, we will affirm unless the record affirmatively demonstrates the jury relied on the unsupported ground. <em>(People v. Sanchez </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 834, 851 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 129, 29 P.3d 209].) If the jury in this case was not instructed on other theories of criminal liability for theft, but the theory on which it was instructed is legally and factually supported, any error in failing to instruct the jury on other theories is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The trial court did not err by instructing the jury with CALCRIM No. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Defendant argues that by instructing the jury with CALCRIM No. 331, the trial court lessened the People\u2019s burden of proof in violation of defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to. due process. Defendant further argues the jury should have been instructed to view the testimony of Walsh\u2014who was suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease at the time the crimes took place\u2014with caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIn evaluating the testimony of a person with a cognitive impairment, consider all of the factors surrounding that person\u2019s testimony, including his or her. level of cognitive development. []Q Even though a person with a cognitive, or mental impairment . . . may perform differently as a witness because of his or her level of cognitive development, that does not mean he or she is any more or less credible than another witness, [f] You should not discount or distrust the testimony of a person with a cognitive . . . impairment solely because he or she has such a[n] impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">This instruction tracks the language of section 1127g, which requires the trial court to give such an instruction upon the request of a party. (In her opening appellate brief, defendant failed to address the mandatory language of section 1127g. Even after the Attorney General raised the issue in the respondent\u2019s brief, defendant did not discuss the statute in her reply brief.) We have found no cases addressing section 1127g or CALCRIM No. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The language of section 1127g is almost identical to the language of section 1127f, which advises the jury, in an appropriate case, that the testimony of a child is no more or less credible than that of an adult, and that all factors surrounding the child\u2019s testimony, including his or her level of cognitive development, should be considered by the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 1127f reflects \u201cthe modem view regarding the credibility of child witnesses,\u201d namely, \u201cthat a child\u2019s testimony cannot be deemed insubstantial merely \u00a1because of. his or her youth.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 315 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In <em>People v. Gilbert </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1393 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 660], the defendant argued the trial court denied him due process by instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 2.20.1, which tracked the language of section 1127f, because \u201cthe instruction \u2018lessened the government\u2019s burden of proof\u2019 because it \u2018effectively instructs the jury to unduly inflate the testimony of a child witness.\u2019 \u201d The appellate court squarely rejected this argument. \u201cThe instruction tells the jury not to make its credibility determinations solely on the basis of the child\u2019s \u2018age and level of cognitive development,\u2019 but at the same time invites the jury to take these and all other factors surrounding the child\u2019s testimony into account. The instruction provides sound and rational guidance to the jury in assessing the credibility of a class of witnesses as to whom \u2018 \u201ctraditional assumptions\u201d \u2019 may previously have biased the factfinding process. Obviously a criminal defendant is entitled to fairness, but just as obviously he or she cannot complain of an instruction the necessary effect of which is to increase the likelihood of a fair result. There was no denial of due process.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>at p. 1393; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 974, 978-980 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 366] [CALJIC No. 2.20.1 does not violate a defendant\u2019s state or federal constitutional rights]; <em>People v. Jones </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1572-1574 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 9] [CALJIC No. 2.20.1 permits jury to independently consider child\u2019s credibility as witness]; <em>People v. Harlan </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 439, 455-456 [271 Cal.Rptr. 653] [CALJIC No. 2.20.1 does not usurp jury\u2019s role as arbiter of witness credibility or excessively inflate child\u2019s testimony].)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Section 1127g was added in 2004 by the Legislature, which articulated its purpose as follows: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation protecting the rights of developmentally disabled persons and other dependent persons who are witnesses in criminal cases and ensuring that they are given equal access to the criminal justice system.\u201d (Stats. 2004, ch. 823, \u00a7 1.) The Legislature defined a dependent person as \u201cany person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially restricts his or her ability to carry out normal activities or to protect his or her rights, including, but not limited to, persons who have physical or developmental disabilities or whose physical or mental abilities have significantly diminished because of age.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">CALCRIM No. 331 tracks the language of section 1127g, and is consistent with section 1127f and the cases interpreting it. CALCRIM No. 331 informs the jury it should not decide whether an individual with a developmental disability or cognitive impairment is a credible witness based solely on the disability or impairment. Rather, the instruction advises the jury the level of the witness\u2019s developmental disability or cognitive impairment is one factor it must consider. Like CALJIC No. 2.20.1, CALCRIM No. 331 \u201cprovides sound and rational guidance to the jury in assessing the credibility of a class of witnesses as to whom \u2018 \u201ctraditional assumptions\u201d \u2019 may previously have biased the factfinding process.\u201d <em>(People v. Gilbert, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The due process analysis of the instruction required by section 1127f is equally applicable to the instruction required by section 1127g. The same rationale for upholding the use of a similar instruction regarding the testimony of children also applies to the testimony of witnesses with a developmental disability or cognitive impairment. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s claim of instructional error, and hold the use of CALCRIM No. 331 did not deny defendant her federal constitutional right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Sills, P.
