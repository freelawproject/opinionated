J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqcE\">After the United States Supreme Court pulled the plug on California\u2019s determinate sentencing law to the extent it had allowed imposition of the upper term based upon certain aggravating facts found by the trial judge, not the jury <em>(Cunningham </em>v. <em>California </em>(2007) 549 U.S._ [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856] (hereafter <em>Cunningham)), </em>trial courts have scrambled to determine how to apply that academic holding to the real world of criminal cases pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">In this case, in which defendant Alejandro Quinones Barragan is accused of attempted murder and other crimes, the jury was empanelled and the People presented its first witness on January 23, 2007, before the prosecutor learned that the previous day the Supreme Court had issued its decision in <em>Cunningham. </em>The prosecutor immediately moved to amend the information to charge a number of aggravating facts. Defendant objected, asserting that \u201cCalifornia statutes provide for no procedure allowing for the submission of such issues to the jury,\u201d that the aggravating facts had not been \u201cpresented\u201d at the preliminary hearing, and that he had not been given adequate notice of the \u201csentencing aggravators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-13\">Observing it was in \u201cuncharted waters,\u201d the trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to amend the information. Defendant then filed a demurrer to the amended information, on the grounds that the aggravating fact allegations were uncertain, that they did not state a public offense, and that they did not conform to governing statutes. The court overruled the demurrer and bifurcated the trial so that the aggravating facts would be submitted to the jury only if it found defendant guilty of one or more of the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>Defendant then filed in this court a petition for writ of prohibition, asserting that the trial court should have sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer because, in his view, \u201cno statutory procedure exists in California under which a jury may decide the truth of [facts] in aggravation\u201d and, in any event, \u201c[facts] in aggravation must be established by sufficient proof at a preliminary hearing or a grand jury,\u201d otherwise \u201ca motion to dismiss pursuant to Penal Code section 995 will lie.\u201d We denied defendant\u2019s request for a \u201cstay of bifurcated portion of trial,\u201d but issued an alternative writ to address the issues that he raises. We now shall deny his petition for writ relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, California\u2019s statutory scheme governing accusatory pleadings in criminal cases does not preclude the prosecutor from amending the information to allege aggravating facts for purposes of sentencing. Thus, the trial court correctly overruled defendant\u2019s demurrer to those new allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">As pertinent to this case, a defendant in a criminal action \u201cmay demur to the accusatory pleading at any time prior to the entry of a plea, when it appears upon the face thereof\u2019 that \u201cit does not substantially conform to the provisions of Sections 950 and 952, and also Section 951 in case of an indictment or information\u201d and that \u201cthe facts stated do not constitute a public offense.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1004, subds. 2 &amp; 4; further section references are to the Penal Code.) Section 950 states in pertinent part that the \u201caccusatory pleading must contain\u201d a \u201cstatement of the public offense or offenses charged therein.\u201d Section 952 states in part; \u201cIn charging an offense, each count shall contain, and shall be sufficient if it contains in substance, a statement that the accused has committed some public offense therein specified.\u201d Section 951 simply sets forth a suggested form for the accusatory pleading.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>An aggravating fact for the purpose of sentencing is not a \u201cpublic offense\u201d within the meaning of sections 950 and 952. (\u00a7 15 [a \u201cpublic offense\u201d is \u201can act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it, and to which is annexed, upon conviction, either of the following punishments: [][] 1. Death; [][] 2. Imprisonment; [f] 3. Fine; [f] 4. Removal from office; or, [f] 5. Disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit in this state\u201d].) However, sections 950 and 952 specify only what an accusatory pleading \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d contain, namely, a sufficient statement of the \u201cpublic offense\u201d allegedly committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">The statutes do not, on their face, preclude allegations other than public offenses. Indeed, because a fact \u201cother than a prior conviction\u201d used to impose the upper term must first be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, unless the accused waives the right to jury trial <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._ [166 L.Ed.2d at pp. 864, 873], it now appears that to satisfy procedural due process, an aggravating fact must be charged in the accusatory pleading. (See <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466, 476, 494, fn: 19 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 446, 457, fn. 19, 120 S.Ct. 2348]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1999) 526 U.S. 227, 243, fn. 6 [143 L.Ed.2d 311, 326, fn. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215] [\u201cany fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime <em>must be charged in an indictment, </em>submitted to a jury, and prove[d] beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">So that the statutory scheme governing accusatory pleadings complies with the notice requirements of procedural due process, we construe sections 950 and 952 to permit the People to amend the information to allege aggravating facts for purposes of sentencing. (See <em>Conservatorship of Hofferber </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 161, 175 [167 Cal.Rptr. 854, 616 P.2d 836] [\u201cIf feasible within bounds set by their words and purpose, statutes should be construed to preserve their constitutionality\u201d]; <em>Samples </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 787, 799 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 216].) It is feasible to so construe the statutes because their wording and purpose do not limit an accusatory pleading to allegations of public offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">Indeed, a contrary construction of the statutes would not only implicate due process concerns, it would create an absurd result, i.e., the prosecution would be unable to comply with the <em>Cunningham </em>holding that precludes an aggravating fact (other than , a prior conviction) from being used to. impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>the upper term unless the fact has been submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Courts do not interpret statutes in a manner that results in absurd consequences that could not have been intended by the Legislature. <em>(People v. Esparza </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 691, 698 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 377].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">We also disagree with defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecution was precluded from amending the information to allege aggravating facts because those facts had not been presented at the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">An accusatory pleading \u201ccannot be amended so as to change the offense charged . . . [or] to charge an offense not shown by the evidence taken at the preliminary examination.\u201d (\u00a7 1009; see also \u00a7 739 [following a preliminary examination (\u00a7 872), the prosecution \u201cmay charge the defendant with either the offense or offenses named in the order of commitment or any offense or offenses shown by the evidence taken before the magistrate to have been committed\u201d]; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 14 [\u201cFelonies shall be prosecuted as provided by law, either by indictment or, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, by information\u201d]; <em>Jones v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 660, 666 [94 Cal.Rptr. 289, 483 P.2d 1241] [a defendant cannot be prosecuted for a felony \u201cin the absence of a prior determination of a magistrate or grand jury that such action is justified\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">However, an aggravating fact is not an \u201coffense\u201d within the meaning of section 1009 and the statutes governing accusatory pleadings. (See \u00a7 15 and the discussion in pt. I, <em>ante.) </em>Thus, the statutory scheme does not require the prosecution to plead and prove at the preliminary examination the existence of aggravating facts that can be used to impose the upper term in California\u2019s determinate sentencing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">We recognize that for purposes of the constitutional right to trial by jury, a \u201c \u2018sentence enhancement\u2019 \u201d that \u201cdescribe^] an increase [in punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>ment] beyond the maximum authorized' statutory sentence\u201d has been viewed by the United States Supreme Court as the \u201cfunctional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.\u201d <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494, fn. 19 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 457, fn. 19].) But aggravating facts used to impose the upper term may have nothing to do with the offense; instead, they may relate solely to the offender regardless of the crime committed. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to say that such aggravating facts are the functional equivalent of elements of an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">In any event, we are concerned here with statutory provisions, not the constitutional right to trial by jury. For purposes of section 1009 and other sections governing pleading and proof at the preliminary examination, neither the Legislature nor the courts have ever deemed aggravating facts used to impose the upper term as being equivalent to statutory sentencing \u201cenhancements\u201d\u2014many of which were contained in statutory definitions of particular offenses prior to enactment of the determinate sentencing law-\u2014that must be alleged in the accusatory pleading and proved at the preliminary hearing. (E.g., \u00a7 667, subd. (f)(1); <em>People v. Superior Court </em>(Mendella) (1983) 33 Cal.3d 754, 758-763 [191 Cal.Rptr. 1, 661 P.2d 1081]; <em>Thompson v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 144, 149 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 89].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">Simply stated, the applicable statutes do not, explicitly or implicitly, require the pleading and proof of aggravating facts at the preliminary examination. It would be wrong to so interpret the statutory scheme now because doing so would in effect nullify the availability of the upper term in many cases\u2014and give defendant the windfall of a lesser sentence than allowed by the determinate sentencing law\u2014simply because the prosecution played by the rules as they were understood when defendant\u2019s preliminary examination was held. The law is not a game of \u201cgotcha\u201d that should be played to unfairly penalize the prosecution and frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent to better protect public safety by providing for the possible imposition of an upper term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">In sum, for purposes of sections 1009 and 995,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> aggravating facts need not be pleaded and proved at the preliminary examination. Indeed, some aggravating facts may not become apparent until after testimony at the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">The petition for writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"Abl\">Sims, J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 13 2007, S151684.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1306-8\"> Defendant recently moved to dismiss his petition for writ of prohibition because, for unspecified reasons, the issues it raises have become moot as to him.
