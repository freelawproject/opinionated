Schienle, Robert L. McWhirk,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Hanover/Califomia Management and Accounting Center, Inc. (HC), for various torts including fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. CHFA also accused Schienle and McWhirk of having a financial interest in a government contract they made while in their official capacity as CHFA employees, a violation of Government Code section 1090 (all statutory references are to the Government Code, unless otherwise noted). A jury found for CHFA, awarding it compensatory and punitive damages against each defendant. The trial court awarded CHFA prejudgment interest and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Defendants contend the trial court should have granted their summary judgment motion because all of plaintiff\u2019s claims were time-barred. Defendants also complain the trial court improperly instructed the jury (a) on the discovery rule for statutes of limitations, (b) on liability under section 1090, and (c) that McWhirk owed CHFA fiduciary duties as a matter of law. Defendants further contend CHFA\u2019s attorney fee motion should have been denied because it was untimely, based on a void contract, and sought fees for noncompensable work. Finally, defendants argue CHFA\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest should have been denied because it was untimely and sought a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">We reject each of defendants\u2019 contentions. In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude any potential error in denying defendants\u2019 summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>judgment motion was harmless because all factual disputes were fully and fairly litigated at trial. We also conclude the trial court did not err in instructing the jury liability may attach under section 1090 for a person designated an independent contractor. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we conclude the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the limitations defense, and defendants\u2019 failure to offer clarifying instructions for any perceived instructional ambiguity forecloses further consideration of the issue. The trial court properly rejected defendants\u2019 contention that civil liability under section 1090 requires the jury to find defendants acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d Defendants\u2019 argument that McWhirk, CHFA\u2019s attorney, did not owe CHFA fiduciary duties is patently meritless, and the trial court correctly instructed the jury that McWhirk was CHFA\u2019s fiduciary. CHFA timely filed its attorney fee motion, and sought only compensable fees based on its contract. Finally, we conclude CHFA timely requested prejudgment interest, and the award did not constitute a double recovery. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">CHFA is a component unit of the State of California, created under the Zenovich-Moscone-Chacon Housing and Home Finance Act, codified as Health and Safety Code section 50000 et seq. CHFA\u2019s mission is to provide affordable housing in the state. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50003.) To accomplish this, CHFA acts as direct lender, loan purchaser, and mortgage insurer of both its own loans and those of other lenders. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 50000, 51611.) CHFA\u2019s mortgage insurance programs are conducted with funds held in the California Housing Loan Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) under Health and Safety Code section 51611.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Schienle served as CHFA\u2019s director of insurance from 1986 through 2001, reporting directly to CHFA\u2019s highest officer, the executive director. McWhirk served as CHFA\u2019s general counsel from 1984 until 1990. From 1991 through 2000, McWhirk became CHFA\u2019s outside counsel under a series of written agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">During the first half of Schienle\u2019s tenure, the Insurance Fund collected mortgage insurance premiums exclusively on an annual basis. In 1994 or 1995, Schienle took steps to have the Insurance Fund offer mortgage insurance programs in which the lenders and loan servicers could pay premiums monthly. In late 1995 and early 1996, Schienle and McWhirk created HC to provide CHFA insurance premium processing services. McWhirk incorporated HC, acted as its legal counsel, and served as president and chief executive officer during the time he also served as CHFA\u2019s outside counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>McWhirk operated HC from his residence, and arranged for his domestic partner, Michael Misita\u2014who had no mortgage insurance or accounting experience\u2014to manage its day-to-day activities. To hide their interest in HC, Schienle and McWhirk brought in Roger Formisano to pose as HC\u2019s sole owner, promising Formisano $100,000 if he would participate in the scheme. Formisano never owned any interest in HC, but held the company\u2019s stock for McWhirk and Misita with directions to relinquish the stock to them when McWhirk no longer represented CHFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In early 1996, Schienle and McWhirk influenced CHFA to enter into a contract with HC (HC contract), whereby HC would collect monthly premiums from lenders and loan servicers and forward the premiums to CHFA, after deducting HC\u2019s \u201coperating costs.\u201d Schienle drafted the HC contract, which was the only agreement he drafted during his CHFA tenure. The agreement failed to describe HC\u2019s services, continued in perpetuity with no termination date, included no audit provisions, and failed to define the amount of HC\u2019s compensation. Neither Schienle nor McWhirk ever disclosed their interest in HC to anyone at CHFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Under the HC contract, the amount deducted from the premiums for operating costs increased dramatically after four years into the policy period, and after year five, HC could keep all of the premiums it collected. In other words, after five years into any particular policy HC would cease remitting to CHFA any part of the premiums it collected, even though CHFA would continue to provide mortgage insurance. In 1996, the first year of operation, HC collected approximately $59,000 in premiums, kept $35,000, and forwarded $24,000 to CHFA. During the last two and one-half years of operation, from 2000 through the first six months of 2002, HC. skimmed approximately $6 million from the premiums it received.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">As the volume of HC\u2019s business grew, defendants hired Misita\u2019s nephew and McWhirk\u2019s sister to assist in processing the insurance premiums. In 1999, HC paid Formisano the $100,000 initially promised. At the end of 2000, McWhirk ceased acting as CHFA\u2019s outside counsel. In early 2001, Formisano surrendered his stock to HC without receiving further consideration, and HC reissued stock to McWhirk and Misita, making them the sole owners of the company. During the scheme, HC paid McWhirk substantial legal fees, leased space in his residence, and paid numerous personal expenses, including the lease on a new Mercedes automobile. HC funds were also used to fund two other companies, Stars and Stripes (California) and Stars and Stripes (Nevada), also owned by McWhirk and Misita. Schienle served as an officer and director in both Stars and Stripes companies, and received substantial financial benefits from them and through HC.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Schienle retired from CHFA in December 2001. Shortly thereafter, Schienle\u2019s replacement discovered the HC contract in a stack of papers Schienle had left behind. Concerned about the agreement, CHFA launched an investigation into the contract and HC. After hiring the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, CHFA discovered Schienle and McWhirk\u2019s involvement in the matter, and terminated the HC contract. On June 14, 2002, CHFA filed suit against Schienle, McWhirk, and HC. CHFA\u2019s third amended complaint sought damages for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of section 1090, legal malpractice, negligence, and breach of contract. The complaint also sought a declaration that the HC contract was void, restitution and injunctive relief based on Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., and an accounting. HC filed a cross-complaint against CHFA for breach of the HC contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that CHFA\u2019s action was barred under the applicable statutes of limitations. The court denied the motion, finding a triable issue of fact on whether defendants fraudulently concealed the facts upon which the causes of action were based, and on whether CHFA should have known about defendants\u2019 wrongdoing more than three years before it filed the action. McWhirk also filed a separate summary adjudication motion asserting he owed no duty to CHFA because he acted as an independent contractor for the Insurance Fund. The court denied the motion, finding a triable issue of fact on whether McWhirk was CHFA\u2019s fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Following a seven-week trial, the jury returned its verdict finding (a) each defendant liable for fraud and negligent misrepresentation; (b) Schienle and McWhirk liable for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of section 1090; and (c) McWhirk liable for legal malpractice and breach of contract. The jury awarded CHFA compensatory damages of $6,744,602 and $375,000 in punitive damages against each defendant, and awarded prejudgment interest from the date the action was filed. The jury found in CHFA\u2019s favor on HC\u2019s cross-complaint. Following the jury verdict, the trial court determined that defendants violated Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., and ordered restitution in the amount of $6,744,602. Following the verdict, the trial court awarded prejudgment interest of $1,149,903.72 on CHFA\u2019s tort claims against all defendants, and an additional $492,817.15 against McWhirk based on CHFA\u2019s contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">A. <em>Defendants May Not Challenge the Denial of Their Summary Judgment Motion Because the Parties Litigated the Same Issues at Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Defendants contend the trial court erred when it denied their summary judgment motion, which sought dismissal of CHFA\u2019s claims based on statutes of limitations. CHFA contends that orders denying summary judgment based on triable issues of fact are not reviewable as a matter of law after a full trial covering the same issues. We agree with CHFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>TJD, Inc. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 830 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 38] <em>(Waller), </em>the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. A jury later decided the same issues at trial in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. The Court of Appeal declined to review the summary judgment denial, reasoning that the defendants suffered no prejudice because they received a jury trial on the merits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 836.) <em>Waller </em>explained: \u201cWhen the trial court commits error in ruling on matters relating to pleadings, procedures, or other preliminary matters, reversal can generally be predicated thereon only if the appellant can show resulting prejudice, and the probability of a more favorable outcome, <em>at trial. </em>[California Constitution] Article VI, section 13, admonishes us that error may lead to reversal only if we are persuaded \u2018upon an examination of the entire cause\u2019 that there has been a miscarriage of justice. In other words, we are not to look to the particular ruling complained of in isolation, but rather must consider the full record in deciding whether a judgment should be set aside. Since we are enjoined to presume that the trial itself was fair and that the verdict in plaintiffs\u2019 favor was supported by the evidence, we cannot find that an erroneous pretrial ruling based on declarations and exhibits renders the ultimate result unjust.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 833.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Defendants rely on the recent case of <em>Gackstetter v. Frawley </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1257 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 333] <em>(Gackstetter), </em>which distinguished <em>Waller. </em>In <em>Gackstetter, </em>the defendants unsuccessfully raised a defense of good faith settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 in their summary judgment motion. On appeal, the defendants argued the trial court erred in denying their summary judgment motion. <em>Gackstetter </em>accepted <em>Waller's </em>conclusion that a reviewing court will not consider whether a trial court erred in denying a summary judgment motion based on triable issues of fact following a full trial of those same issues. <em>(Gackstetter, </em>at p. 1268.) The court explained: \u201c \u2018A decision based on less evidence (i.e., the evidence presented on the summary judgment motion) should not prevail over a decision based on more evidence (i.e., the evidence presented at trial).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1269, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>quoting Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (2004) 1 8:168.10, p. 8-114.) <em>Gackstetter </em>nonetheless reviewed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment because the good faith issue was not based on disputed facts which were resolved at a subsequent trial. The court recognized the good faith settlement issue could have been raised in a number of different ways, and the defendants had not forfeited review merely because they chose summary judgment as the procedural device to assert their good faith settlement defense. (Gackstetter, at p. 1269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Defendants also cite <em>Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 579 [210 Cal.Rptr. 573] and <em>Coy v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1077 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 215] <em>(Coy) </em>to support the notion that a reviewing court could consider whether the trial court erred in denying summary judgment despite a full trial on the same issues. <em>Sturm </em>does not support defendants\u2019 argument. There, the trial court simply recognized that a party\u2019s failure to timely seek writ review of an order denying summary judgment did not prevent that party from raising the same issues at trial, or from appealing the resulting judgment. <em>(Sturm, </em>at p. 582.) Nothing in <em>Sturm </em>suggested the moving party could obtain reversal based on the trial court\u2019s erroneous summary judgment denial where the same issue was adversely decided against the moving party following a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"><em>Coy, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1077, reversed a judgment following a jury trial based on the trial court\u2019s erroneous summary judgment denial. But there, the court expressly noted the plaintiff had not contested the defendant\u2019s ability to challenge the pretrial summary judgment ruling on appeal after trial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1082, fn. 2.) Because the issue was never addressed, <em>Coy </em>offers no support for defendants\u2019 argument. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ault </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1250, 1268, fn. 10 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 302, 95 P.3d 523] [\u201cIt is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Here, the trial court denied defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion because it found triable issues of fact on whether defendants fraudulently concealed facts upon which the causes of action were based, and whether CHFA should have known about defendants\u2019 wrongdoing more than three years before it filed the action. These factual issues were fully litigated at trial and determined adversely to defendants. For that reason, no miscarriage of justice occurred when the trial court denied defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>D. <em>The Trial Court Properly Instructed the Jury on Section 1090</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">1. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Instructing the Jury That Section 1090 May Apply to Independent Contractors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Section 1090 provides, in relevant part: \u201cMembers of the Legislature, state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any body or board of which they are members. Nor shall state, -county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees be purchasers at any sale or vendors at any purchase made by them in their official capacity.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he \u2018officer or employee\u2019 language of Section 1090 must be interpreted broadly. The fact that someone is designated an independent contractor is not determinative; the statute applies to independent contractors who perform a public function.\u201d Defendants contend the trial court erred in giving this instruction because section 1090 applies only to a public agency\u2019s \u201cofficers or employees,\u201d and therefore could not apply to McWhirk, an independent contractor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The common law distinction between an employee and an independent contractor developed as the courts attempted to establish the parameters for imposing tort liability on the master for the acts of the servant. The Supreme Court in <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Laird </em>(1857) 8 Cal. 469, 489 explained: \u201cThe responsibility is placed where the power exists. Having power to control, the superior or master is bound to exercise it to the prevention of injuries to third parties, or he will be held liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The common law, however, does not always govern a reference to employment in a particular statute. <em>(S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 351 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399].) Rather, employment \u201cmust be construed with particular reference to the \u2018history and fundamental purposes\u2019 of the statute.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> In contrast to the common law, section 1090 is not concerned with holding \u00e1 public entity liable for harm to third parties based on its agent\u2019s acts. Rather, it places responsibility for acts of self-dealing <em>on the public servant </em>where he or she exercises sufficient control <em>over the public entity, </em>i.e., where the agent is in a position to contract in his or her \u201cofficial capacity.\u201d Thus, the common law employee/independent contractor analysis is not helpful in construing the term \u201cemployee\u201d in section 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Section 1090, like all conflict of interest statutes, \u201ccannot be given a narrow and technical interpretation that would limit [its] scope and defeat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(People v. Honig </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 289, 314 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 555] <em>(Honig),) </em>Thus, in Honig, the court construed the \u201cfinancially interested\u201d element in section 1090 to include not only financial benefits the official personally received, but also those accruing to a nonprofit organization employing the official\u2019s spouse. Similarly, in <em>Stigall </em>v. <em>City of Taft </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 565, 569 [25 Cal.Rptr. 441, 375 P.2d 289], the California Supreme Court interpreted section 1090\u2019s imposition of liability for \u201cany contract made\u201d by financially interested officials to cover preliminary matters, such as \u201cnegotiations, discussions, reasoning, [and] planning.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Call </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 633, 644-645 [214 Cal.Rptr. 139, 699 P.2d 316] [successive, related agreements considered a single \u201ccontract\u201d under \u00a7 1090].) The court explained that applying the general rule that a contract is not \u201cmade\u201d until the parties mutually agree would frustrate section 1090\u2019s purposes. Accordingly, in construing section 1090 in any particular situation, \u201c \u2018[w]e must disregard the technical relationship of the parties and look behind the veil which enshrouds their activities in order to discern the vital facts. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Honig, </em>at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Courts have recognized that liability under section 1090 may apply to an outside attorney in a position of influence over the public agency. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gnass </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1271 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 225] <em>(Gnass), </em>the defendant was a partner in a private law firm acting as city attorney under a contract, which paid the firm a monthly retainer based on a set number of hours per month, and an hourly rate thereafter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1279.) The city and its redevelopment agency formed a public financing authority, for which the defendant also acted as counsel. The public financing authority then joined with other local public agencies to form a number of joint power authorities which issued a series of bonds. The defendant earned fees from the bond issues either for services rendered as disclosure counsel or for services rendered to another attorney who acted as disclosure counsel. The Court of Appeal determined the grand jury had probable cause to believe the defendant violated section 1090 based on the fees earned in connection with the bond issues. (101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1278-1279.) The court recognized that neither the city nor the defendant was a party to the contracts for the bond issues, but nonetheless concluded the defendant had acted in an official capacity because he \u201cwas in a position to exert considerable influence over the decisions\u201d of the public financing authority to enter into joint powers agreements and issue the bonds. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1298.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Similarly, in <em>Campagna v. City of Sanger </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 533 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 676], the defendant was an associate, and later a partner, of a law firm acting as city attorney. Under a written agreement, the city paid the firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>a flat monthly amount for general consulting, and agreed to pay for other services, such as litigation, \u201c \u2018on a reasonable legal fee basis, depending upon the type of service rendered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 535.) The city asked the defendant to retain an outside law firm to file a claim against several chemical companies. The defendant negotiated, and the city approved, a written contingency fee agreement with his own firm in association with another firm. The agreement disclosed the total contingency fee, but failed to reveal the associated firm had agreed to pay the defendant a referral fee of 35 percent of the total fee. The court recognized the defendant acted as a private attorney in negotiating the contingency fee between his firm and the city, but concluded he acted in an official capacity in choosing the associated firm and negotiating with it, rendering him liable under section 1090. (42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 541-542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In <em>Schaefer </em>v. <em>Berinstein </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 278 [295 P.2d. 113] <em>(Schaefer), </em>the city had contracted with an attorney to rehabilitate tax-deeded and \u201cspecial assessment frozen\u201d properties within the city. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 291.) The attorney had purchased many of these properties from the city through third parties at prices far below their fair market value, while assuring the city the price paid was fair. The court ruled the attorney violated a city charter provision similar to the current version of section 1090, which prohibited an \u201c \u2018officer or employee\u2019 \u201d of the city from having a financial interest in a transaction with the city. <em>(Schaefer, </em>at p. 287, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The court in <em>Schaefer </em>observed that even without the city\u2019s conflict of interest charter provision, the attorney\u2019s actions would have violated section 1090, even though the statute at that time did not expressly include \u201cemployees.\u201d <em>(Schaefer, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at p. 291.) The court observed: \u201cStatutes prohibiting personal interests of public officers in public contracts are strictly enforced. [Citation.] ... [][]... A person merely in an advisory position to a city is affected by the conflicts of interest rule. [Citation.] . . . [The retained attorney] was an officer and agent of the city and as such was in a position to advise the city council as to what action should be taken relative to the property involved.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>see also <em>Terry v. Bender </em>(1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 198 [300 P.2d 119] <em>(Terry) </em>[involving the same attorney and scheme].)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The California Attorney General has opined that a financial consultant retained on a temporary basis to provide advice in connection with a bond issue is an \u201cemployee\u201d under section 1090 despite being an independent contractor. (46 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 74 (1965).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relying in part on <em>Schaefer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>and <em>Terry, </em>the Attorney General observed: \u201cIt seems clear that the Legislature in later amending section 1090 to include \u2018employees\u2019 intended to apply the policy of the conflicts of interest law, as set out in the <em>Schaefer </em>and <em>Terry </em>cases, to independent contractors who perform a public function and to require of those who serve the public temporarily the same fealty expected from permanent officers and employees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Consistent with the above authorities, we conclude that an attorney whose official capacity carries the potential to exert \u201cconsiderable\u201d influence over the contracting decisions of a public agency is an \u201cemployee\u201d under section 1090, regardless of whether he or she would be considered an independent contractor under common law tort principles. (See <em>Gnass, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 1298.) Otherwise, the attorney could manipulate the employment relationship to retain \u201cofficial capacity\u201d influence, yet avoid liability under section 1090. Indeed, the evidence presented here suggests such a situation. McWhirk was CHFA\u2019s in-house counsel for six years, becoming its outside counsel before commencing the insurance skimming scheme with Schienle. Nothing in the record demonstrates McWhirk\u2019s change in title diminished his influence over the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The authority defendants rely on does not contradict our conclusion. Specifically, defendants misconstrue a footnote in <em>Gnass </em>to support the argument section 1090 does not apply to independent contractors. (See <em>Gnass, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 1302, fn. 10.) But the opinion merely described the trial court\u2019s response to the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the lawyer\u2019s independent contractor status deprived him of the defense in section 1091.5, subdivision (a)(9), which exempts \u201c[a]n officer or employee\u201d from liability from certain transactions where a full disclosure has been made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Recognizing the apparent incongruity of asserting section 1090 applied to the defendant, but the similarly worded section 1091.5 did not, the appellate court remarked: \u201cOf course, if Gnass was not an \u2018employee\u2019 for purposes of section 1091.5, neither was he for purposes of section 1090, in which case the conflict-of-interest statutes would not apply at all. We see no reason why one could be an employee for one and not the other.\u201d <em>(Gnass, </em>at p. 1302, fn. 10.) The <em>Gnass </em>court already had determined the attorney fell within the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>section 1090. Thus, the court simply questioned the prosecutor\u2019s argument that section 1091.5 did not cover the defendant\u2019s conduct, but did not suggest independent contractors are exempt from liability under section 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Also unavailing is defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Pacific Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Lynwood </em>(1931) 114 Cal.App. 509 [300 P. 50] <em>(Pacific Finance). </em>There, the city attempted to prevent payment to the assignee of an engineer retained by the city, arguing that public policy prohibited assignment of a public officer\u2019s unearned salary. The court rejected the city\u2019s argument that the engineer was a public officer, observing: \u201cThere is not a word in the contract between [the engineer] and appellant city which indicates that the parties were endeavoring to insert [the engineer] into the office of city engineer ... or to create for him any public office. He is not, by virtue of the contract, a public officer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 514-515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Pacific Finance </em>does not aid defendants for two reasons. First, the case never addressed when a contracting party could be considered an employee of a public agency. Thus, even if McWhirk was not an \u201cofficer\u201d under the holding of <em>Pacific Finance, </em>he still could be an \u201cemployee\u201d under section 1090. Second, defendants have not demonstrated any parallel between section 1090 and the policy against assignment of a public officer\u2019s unearned salary. As we have discussed, conflict of interest provisions \u201ccannot be given a narrow and technical interpretation that would limit their scope and defeat the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(Honig, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 314.) Absent some showing that the public policy at issue in <em>Pacific Finance </em>has a scope and purpose similar to the conflict of interest statutes, we decline to engraft the court\u2019s \u201cpublic officer\u201d analysis onto section 1090. In sum, we reject defendants\u2019 challenge to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that section 1090 may never apply to independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">E.-G.*</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>HI</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The judgment and orders are affirmed.
