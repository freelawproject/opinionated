Based on these facts, a jury found defendant Norman William Racy II guilty of residential robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>and elder abuse \u201cunder circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death.\u201d (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1).) The jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges of assault with a stun gun and intimidation of a witness, and the court declared a mistrial on those counts. Defendant was sentenced to prison for six years \"after the court refused to stay the punishment for felony elder abuse. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">On appeal, defendant contends his conviction for felony elder abuse must be reversed because it was not supported by substantial evidence or, in the alternative, because the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of elder abuse \u201cunder circumstances or conditions other than those likely to produce great \"bodily harm or death.\u201d (\u00a7 368, subd. (c).) Defendant also contends the trial court erred in punishing him for elder abuse in light of his punishment for robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">We disagree with defendant \u25a0 s arguments on the sufficiency of evidence and alleged sentencing error, but we agree that the court prejudicially erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of misdemeanor elder abuse. In reaching these conclusions, we touch on the interesting issues of the need for expert testimony on the effects of a stun gun, the need for jury unanimity on the \u201ccircumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death,\u201d and the court\u2019s alleged improper reliance at the sentencing hearing on defendant\u2019s statements in a probation report where similar statements were excluded at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">Seventy-four-year-old James Picaso, Jr., was at home on the afternoon of Christmas Eve 2005 when he heard a noise in his house. When he went to the hallway to investigate, he saw defendant coming into his house through the back door without knocking. Picaso recognized defendant as \"the soil of a tenant who had done \u201codd jobs\u201d for him at one of his rental properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">Upon entering the house, defendant demanded $500. When Picaso told defendant he did not have the money, defendant immediately \u201czapped\u201d Picaso in the leg with a stun gun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Picaso described the pain in his leg as similar to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>\u201cpoke\u201d from an ice pick and rated the pain as a seven or eight on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being \u201cdebilitating.\u201d Picaso is an insulin-dependent diabetic who is \u201chandicapped\u201d primarily in his knees and cannot run because he cannot \u201cget both feet off the ground at the same time.\u201d He is able to walk, though, and \u201cretreated\u201d to his bedroom where he tried to lock the door. Defendant was \u201cso close behind\u201d him that Picaso could not shut the bedroom door. Picaso reached for the telephone to call 911, but defendant \u201cimmediately pulled the cord out.\u201d \u201c[T]o protect [him]self,\u201d Picaso \u201clay down on [his] bed on [his] back and put [his] feet up in the air,\u201d so he \u201ccould kick, if necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\">For the next 10 minutes, defendant asked Picaso for money while he \u201czapped\u201d the stun gun eight to 10 times \u201cin the air.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant then \u201ctip[ped] [Picaso] over,\u201d exposing his wallet. Picaso tried unsuccessfully to fight off defendant. The struggle moved the bed approximately one foot away from the wall. Defendant grabbed Picaso\u2019s wallet, tearing Picaso\u2019s jeans pocket. At some point during the struggle, Picaso \u201ctripped.\u201d Defendant then ran out of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Picaso went to the basement where there was another telephone and dialed 911. He gave the dispatcher defendant\u2019s name and defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s address, where Picaso thought defendant was headed. Within minutes, police went to defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house and found defendant hiding in the bedroom closet underneath a pile of clothes. They found Picaso\u2019s wallet inside a fitted sheet on a bed. They could not find the stun gun. Picaso did not go to the doctor to have his leg examined, as there was no \u201cevidence of burning or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">\n<em>The People Presented Sufficient Evidence to Support Defendant\u2019s Conviction for Felony Elder Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">A defendant can be convicted of felony elder abuse when he or she \u201cknows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder . . . and who, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number><em>under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death, </em>willfully causes or permits any elder ... to suffer, or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering.\u201d (\u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1), italics added.) Defendant contends his conviction for felony elder abuse must be reversed because \u201cthere was no evidence that the pain inflicted on Picaso was under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death.\u201d We disagree because the People presented sufficient evidence under the applicable standard of review to support this element of felony elder abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">\u201c \u2018The standard of review \"is well settled: On appeal, we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid value\u2014from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond, a reasonable doubt. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanghera </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1567, 1572 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">\u201c \u2018Before the judgment of the trial court can be set aside for the insufficiency of the evidence, it must clearly appear that on no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the verdict of the [finder of fact].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanghera, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument is focused on the lack of expert testimony that use of a stun gun is likely to produce great bodily harm or death. He contends that a \u201clay juror is not situated to opine on whether [stun guns] are <em>likely </em>to cause great bodily injury,\u201d and argues that expert testimony is required when the facts from which conclusions are to be drawn are not a matter of common knowledge but are within an expert\u2019s knowledge. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 557, 573 [24 Cal.Rptr. 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">We agree with defendant that <em>in this case </em>the use of the stun gun by itself could not support the requisite \u201ccircumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death.\u201d (\u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1).) This is so because Picaso was not injured by the stun gun, and there was no expert testimony that a stun gun used on somebody similar to Picaso was likely to produce great bodily harm or death. If the only evidence of the \u201ccircumstances' or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death\u201d had been the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>stun gun, expert testimony would have been necessary because the effects of a stun gun, unlike the effects of more typically used weapons such as knives or handguns, are matters beyond the experience of average jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Notwithstanding the lack of evidence that the stun gun itself was capable of producing great bodily harm or death, the evidence presented at trial, taken in the light most favorable to the People, supported a felony elder abuse conviction because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded defendant willfully inflicted pain or mental suffering. on Picaso \u201cunder circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death.\u201d (\u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Defendant \u201czapped\u201d Picaso in the leg with a stun gun, causing him substantial pain. Presumably, to escape the situation and avoid more pain, Picaso retreated to his bedroom, and defendant gave chase following \u201cso close[ly]\u201d that Picaso could not shut the bedroom door. When Picaso moved to the bed, defendant repeatedly \u201czapped\u201d the stun gun \u201cin the air\u201d and then \u201ctip[ped] [Picaso] over\u201d and grabbed his wallet, tearing Picaso\u2019s jeans pocket. The struggle moved the bed approximately one foot away from the wall and caused Picaso to trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">From this evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded that defendant\u2019s close pursuit of Picaso (which prevented Picaso from locking the door) or the force defendant exerted on Picaso (which was strong enough to tip him over, tear his jeans pocket, and cause a struggle in which Picaso tripped and the bed moved one foot) likely could have caused Picaso to fall and break a bone, causing him great bodily harm. As stated, Picaso\u2019s knees are disabled and he is 74 years old, which, as a matter of common knowledge, is an age that carries with it an increased risk of bone fractures from a fall. The jury was in the best position to observe Picaso\u2019s condition at trial, and we will not second-guess the jury\u2019s finding that defendant inflicted pain or suffering on Picaso \u201cunder circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death\u201d where the record contains sufficient evidence to support that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">Defendant contends we cannot rely on this evidence because, according to defendant, at trial the People \u201cproceeded on the theory that the stun gun use was the infliction of great bodily injury, not the chase, not the opening of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>door, and not the arcing of the stun gun.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant continues that had the People argued these additional theories, the court would have been required to give a unanimity instruction, which would have told jurors they all must agree on which act constituted the offense. (CALJIC No. 17.01.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">To defendant we say, <em>\u201clegem cognosce,\u201d </em>or \u201cread the statute.\u201d In drafting the elder abuse statute, the Legislature specifically contemplated that the <em>\u201ccircumstances or conditions </em>likely to produce great bodily harm or death\u201d be examined to determine whether a defendant is guilty of felony elder abuse. (\u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1), italics added.) There was nothing, therefore, to prevent the jury from relying on any or all of the circumstances and conditions we have recounted to support the charge of felony elder abuse without the need for unanimous agreement on a particular circumstance or condition. Simply put, in a trial for elder abuse, a jury is not required to unanimously agree on one circumstance or condition that was likely to produce great bodily harm or death, but rather, may consider all the \u201ccircumstances or conditions\u201d that were likely to produce great bodily harm or death. As the People presented sufficient evidence in this case that defendant caused Picaso to suffer, or inflicted on him unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering \u201cunder circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death,\u201d we reject defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">\n<em>The Trial Court Prejudicially Erred in Failing to Instruct on Misdemeanor Elder Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">Our finding of sufficient evidence, however, does not end the inquiry into whether we must reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for felony elder abuse. In a separate argument, defendant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to instruct on misdemeanor elder abuse as a lesser included offense. On this point, we agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">As is relevant here, the difference between felony elder abuse and misdemeanor elder abuse is whether the abuse is perpetrat\u00e9d \u201cunder circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death.\u201d If it is, the crime is a potential felony. (\u00a7 368, subd. (b)(1).) If it is not, the crime is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>misdemeanor. (\u00a7 368, subd. (c).) Misdemeanor elder abuse is a lesser included offense of felony elder abuse. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sheffield </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 158 [166, 214 Cal.Rptr. 40] [misdemeanor child abuse is a lesser included offense of felony child abuse]; <em>People v. Heitzman </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 189, 204-205 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 886 P.2d 1229] [the language of felony elder abuse statute \u201cderives verbatim from the felony child abuse statute\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">A trial court must instruct on a lesser included offense if there is substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense, but not the charged offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 162 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].) \u201cIn deciding whether evidence is \u2018substantial\u2019 in this context, a court determines only its bare legal sufficiency, not its weight.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 177.) If there were such evidence, we as the reviewing court then ask whether the error requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s .conviction for the greater offense. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 177-178.) In a noncapital case, the error in failing to instruct on a lesser included offense is reviewed for prejudice under <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243] which requires reversal of the conviction for the greater offense \u201cif, \u2018after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence\u2019 [citation], it appears \u2018reasonably probable\u2019 the defendant would have obtained a more favorable outcome had the. error not occurred.\u201d <em>(People v. Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 178.) Probability under <em>Watson </em>\u201cdoes not mean more likely than not, but merely a reasonable chance, more than an abstract possibility.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Ghilotti) (2002) 27 Cal.4th 888, 918 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 44 P.3d 949].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">In this case, we do not need to separately analyze whether the court erred in instructing on the lesser included offense and whether it was prejudicial, because based on the record there was a reasonable chance the jury would have convicted defendant of misdemeanor elder abuse had the court instructed on this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Picaso did not suffer great bodily harm during the incident, so the jury was left to draw inferences about whether the circumstances or conditions under which defendant inflicted physical pain or mental suffering were likely to produce great bodily harm or death. As we have explained in part I of the Discussion, <em>ante, </em>the evidence could support such an inference. However, in assessing prejudice, it does not matter that the jury chose to convict the defendant of the greater offense over acquittal or that the defendant was convicted of the greater'offense on sufficient evidence. <em>(People v. Breverman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number><em>supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 178, fn. 25.) As we will discuss below, the evidence supporting the guilty verdict of felony elder abuse was not so compelling that the jury instead could have reasonably reached a guilty verdict of misdemeanor elder abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">From the facts that appear in the record, it is reasonable the jury could have viewed Picaso as a rather large man who was not likely to suffer great bodily injury or death during the incident despite his age and physical limitations. Picaso is six feet three inches tall and weighs 210 pounds and even after being \u201czapped\u201d with the stun gun and'pursued by defendant, he was able to retreat to the bedroom, attempt to make a 911 call, and li\u00e9 down on the bed in a defensive position. He emerged unscathed after being tipped and tripped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">Based on this evidence and the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict on whether defendant assaulted Picaso with the stun gun or intimidat\u00e9d him as a witness, there was a \u201creasonable chance\u201d defendant \u201cwould have obtained a more favorable outcome\u201d had the jury been instructed on misdemeanor elder abuse. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 178; see <em>People v. Superior Court (Ghilotti), supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 918.) We must therefore reverse defendant\u2019s felony elder abuse conviction. \u201cWhen a greater offense must be reversed, but- a lesser included offense could be affirmed,\u201d the People have the \u201coption of retrying the greater offense, or accepting a reduction to the lesser offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 528 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">\n<em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Punishing Defendant for Both Robbery and Elder Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">For the trial court\u2019s guidance on remand, we address defendant\u2019s last contention that the trial court erred in punishing him for both robbery and elder abuse because \u201cthe elder abuse was integral to the robbery.\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s contention because the court\u2019s implied finding that defendant had different intents and objectives for these crimes was supported by substantial evidence that was presented at trial and in the probation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">A defendant cannot be punished multiple times for convictions that arise out of \u201can indivisible transaction\u201d and have a \u201csingle intent and objective.\u201d <em>(People v. Avalos, </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1583 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 450].) \u201cA trial court\u2019s implied finding that a defendant harbored a separate intent and objective for each offense will be upheld on appeal if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blake </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 509, 512 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 308].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Here, the trial court\u2019s implied finding that defendant had a separate intent and objective for robbery and elder abuse was supported by defendant\u2019s own admissions in the probation report and the evidence at trial. As stated in the probation report, when defendant was interviewed in jail nine days before sentencing, he explained both orally and in writing that he drove to Picaso\u2019s house on Christmas Eve and \u201cconfronted\u201d him about Picaso\u2019s alleged \u201csexual[] assault[]\u201d on his mother that had taken place the previous day. According to defendant, on the morning of Christmas Eve his mother was \u201ccrying \u2018hysterically\u2019 \u201d and said Picaso had sexually assaulted her. When defendant \u201cconfront[ed]\u201d Picaso at his home later that day, defendant told Picaso \u201che was going to \u2018pay\u2019 for what he did to his mother.\u201d From this evidence and the evidence presented at trial, the court reasonably could have concluded that defendant had a separate intent and objective for the robbery and the elder abuse: one was to take Picaso\u2019s money as defendant demanded money immediately upon entering the house and another was to assault Picaso over his conduct toward defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Defendant contends it is \u201cunfair\u201d to rely on his statements in the probation report to show he \u201cpossessed dual motives in committing the robbery and the elder abuse\u201d because similar evidence regarding his motives in going to Picaso\u2019s house was excluded from trial as irrelevant and inflammatory. Although defendant is correct that the court excluded such evidence from trial, he is wrong that the court could not rely on similar evidence for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">Simply because evidence is excluded at trial from the jury\u2019s consideration does not mean a trial court cannot consider similar or even the same evidence in deciding whether a defendant had multiple intents and objectives when committing the crimes for purposes of determining the appropriate punishment. Defendant has produced no case law to the contrary, and we note that he was never prevented from challenging the contents of the probation report at the sentencing hearing. Indeed, at the sentencing hearing even defense counsel acknowledged \u201cthere were collateral reasons for [defendant] going to Mr. Picaso\u2019s home,\u201d citing defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s statement that she had been \u201cviolated ... the night before.\u201d On this record, then, the trial court did not err in punishing defendant for both robbery and elder abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Defendant\u2019s conviction of felony elder abuse (\u00a7 368, subd.

If, after the filing of the remittitur in the trial court, the People do not retry defendant on count 3 within the time limit set forth in section 1382, subdivision (a)(2)\u201460 days unless waived by defendant\u2014the trial court shall treat the remittitur as a modification of the judgment as to count 3 to reflect a conviction of misdemeanor elder abuse (\u00a7 368, subd. (c)), and resentence defendant accordingly. <em>(People v. Woods </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1570, 1596 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 231].)
