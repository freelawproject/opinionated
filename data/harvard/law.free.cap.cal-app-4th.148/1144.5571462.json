Code, \u00a7 115, subd. (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on December 9, 2003 (count 1), and with sending a threatening letter with intent to extort (\u00a7 523) on January 20, 2004 (count 2), charging Alan and Roger with sending a threatening letter with intent to extort (\u00a7 523) on January 24, 2004 (count 3), charging Alan with offering a false or forged instrument for filing (\u00a7 115, subd.

On July 6, 2004, the Jenans again appeared without counsel, the court proceeded with arraignments, and the Jenans pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">On August 4, 2004, the Jenans again appeared without counsel; the court noted that \u201cone of the concerns is that you need to have a lawyer represent you unless you want to represent yourselves,\u201d and a dialogue ensued:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-8\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: Your Honor, we\u2019re here because we respect you as\u2014as a [sz'c] individual who has subscribed and sworn to an oath of the office to duly protect the people of this country, especially this state and this county. We respect that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-9\">\u201cNow, you have information in front of you \u2019cause we\u2019ve delivered it to you, a copy of the fact that there\u2014the dispute or controversy has been resolved privately outside of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-10\">\u201cThe District Attorney\u2014now we\u2019re just waiting for them to give you an order to dismiss the case because without the subject matter jurisdiction, which this court is absent totally of, you can\u2019t move forward. So we don\u2019t need an attorney. What would we do with an attorney? What would he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Well, he would defend you in this case and hopefully keep you out of prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-5\">\u201cMr. Alan Jenan, is that your position, as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-6\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: Your Honor, the court has no jurisdiction. The case has been abated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That is your position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-8\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: And we have challenged the jurisdiction of this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, let me just interrupt you here. I have nothing filed with the court which has got a court stamp file on it that is in the file that I\u2019m responding to at this time because it hasn\u2019t been properly filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-10\">\u201cNow, you indicated something about the District Attorney has been contacted privately between yourselves and the District Attorney\u2019s Office to have this matter resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-11\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Let me ask the District Attorney\u2019s representative . . . whether the District Attorney is inclined to dismiss this complaint or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-13\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: No, we\u2019re not going to be dismissing the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That being the case, then we\u2019re going to have to go forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-15\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: There\u2019s one other matter. I\u2019m not arguing anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not, either. I\u2019m just informing you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-17\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: You were\u2014you were delivered by mail and by hand delivery yesterday, I believe it was, or Monday, a copy. Of course, it\u2019s not on file unless you put it there, but you have knowledge of the abatement, and I expect you to act on that knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t have knowledge in the sense that it\u2019s officially before the court because unless something is filed with the court clerk and a file stamp placed on it with the proper case number and the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>is also served upon the adversary, that being the District Attorney in this case, this court has nothing to respond to. You may deliver a thousand letters to the court, but that does not mean that they have any bearing on the case, itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Having informed the Jenans of the difference between delivering a letter and filing a document, the court asked if they wished to be represented by counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, that being the case, the District Attorney has indicated they are not going to dismiss. So we\u2019re going to have to proceed forward in the procedurally correct manner, and in order to get that procedurally correct manner underway, the first question is whether you have or want to be represented by an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-7\">\u201cSo Mr. Roger Jenan, what\u2019s your situation in that; are you desirous of having an attorney represent you, and if so, do you have the money to hire one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-8\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: No, sir, I do not want to hire an attorney because that will make me a ward of the court and put me in your jurisdiction, and I do not intend in any way or any manner to confer, convey, or any other way give you jurisdiction over me or the subject matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: So the bottom line of all that is that you are going to represent yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-10\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: If needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Now, Mr. Alan Jenan, what is your position in that regard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-12\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: I agree with that, your Honor, because the case is a sham pleading, to start with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-13\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: Don\u2019t argue the pleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-14\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: \u2014that requires no answer from us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-16\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: We can enter no pleading to\u2014anything that\u2019s not there. It\u2019s\u2014the case has been abated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: All right. So you\u2019re going to be\u2014I guess the bottom line of that is you\u2019re going to represent yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-5\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: Your Honor, we may need assistance of counsel\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-7\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: \u2014and we reserve the right to that assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, you can\u2019t say we because you have to speak for yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-9\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN:-Don\u2019t reserve any rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you wish to have a counsel represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-11\">\u201cMR. ALAN JENAN: Not at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. So both of you are indicating that you don\u2019t want counsel at this time. So you\u2019ll be proceeding pro per, as we call it, at this point in time. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">After a brief dialogue with the prosecutor about the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 pages of discovery, the court addressed the issue of entry of pleas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: So we\u2019re going to enter pleas of not guilty for both of you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-15\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: I don\u2019t agree to that, but you do what you have to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I have to do it. Even if you refuse to enter a plea, the law requires I enter a plea of not guilty and then set the appropriate motions\u2014or set the dates down the road here, and you can file whatever motions you wish to file ....\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">After the court and the prosecutor talked about finding consecutive dates for calendaring the preliminary hearing conference and the preliminary hearing around a pending death penalty case on the prosecutor\u2019s calendar, the court engaged in a dialogue with Roger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: The 26th of August would be a preliminary hearing conference. That would be a conference wherein you come in, the District Attorney is here. We decide if the case can be disposed of in some fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN; Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: If not, then we discuss whether or not the matter is ready to go forward for a preliminary hearing on the following day, following day being the 27th of August, which is the day we\u2019ll set for the preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-6\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: So on the 26th he could come in and dismiss the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, he could, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: Well, he owes us an awful lot of money, and he\u2019s caused you an awful lot of anguish, too, and expense to this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I have no anguish. I enjoy being up here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: But he\u2019s causing an unnecessary expense, and we\u2019ve already sanctioned it. It might be something you want to consider, also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: We\u2019ll take that all up at the appropriate time with the appropriate motions filed, but in the meantime, all parties are agreeable, this is going to be continued till the 26th of August for a preliminary hearing conference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">Once a problem with the availability of the prosecutor\u2019s primary witness came to light, the court and the prosecutor discussed moving the preliminary hearing conference and the preliminary hearing to the following week, after which Roger spoke on behalf of Alan and himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-13\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: I think that works for us. If something comes up, our medical condition or whatever, we\u2019ll let you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: If you do have a problem being here, be sure you communicate with the court so that we don\u2019t issue any warrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-15\">\u201cMR. ROGER JENAN: There are times when I have a problem of doing anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Very well. We\u2019ll see you on those days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-17\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And, your Honor, the Jenans have been informed that they have a right to counsel, and they are rejecting that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, I\u2019ve told them, and they\u2019ve indicated at the moment, they\u2019re going to represent themselves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">On August 22, 2004, Alan and Roger each executed notarized documents entitled \u201cdeposition\u201d and \u201ctruth affidavit.\u201d Each \u201cdeposition\u201d identified the signatory as, respectively, \u201calan dale; jenan a sovereign\u201d and \u201croger lewis; jenan a sovereign.\u201d Each \u201cdeposition,\u201d inter alia, cited \u201cGlass v.

Glass and others, agreeable to law and right, the said plea to the jurisdiction of the said court notwithstanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-8\">\u201cAnd the said supreme court being further of opinion, that no foreign power can, of right, institute or erect any court of judicature of any kind, within the jurisdiction of the United States, but such only as may be warranted by, and be in pursuance of treaties, it is, therefore, decreed and adjudged, that the admiralty jurisdiction which has been exercised in the United States by the consuls of France, not being so warranted, is not of right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-9\">\u201cIt is further ordered by the said supreme court, that this cause be, and it is hereby, remanded to the district court for the Maryland district, for a final decision, and that the several parties to the same do each pay their own costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>Each \u201cdeposition\u201d states, inter alia, that \u201c[n]o action can be taken against a sovereign in the non-constitutional courts of either the United States or the state courts,\u201d that \u201cany such action is considered the crime of Barratry,\u201d and that \u201cBarratry is an offense at common law,\u201d and cites \u201cState vs. Batson, 220 N.C. 411 [17 S.E. 2d 511, 512, 513].\u201d The cited case, inter alia, muses that \u00bf\u2018[t]he crime of -barratry seems to have had its origin in maritime law,\u201d notes that \u201c \u2018common barratry is the offence of frequently exciting and stirring up suits and quarrels between his majesty\u2019s subjects, either at law or otherwise,\u2019 \u201d and holds that the common law offense of barratry, \u201chaving never been the subject of legislation in North Carolina, and not being destructive nor repugnant to, nor inconsistent with, the form of government of the State, is in full force therein.\u201d <em>(State v.

Both defendants' are present without' counsel because, we\u2019ve been through this before, you both indicated on a previous occasion that you had not hired counsel, did not request that the court appoint counsel at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-14\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: We didn\u2019t testify to anything, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you wish to have counsel appointed for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-16\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: No, there\u2019s no case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-17\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: Not at this time, your Honor, because there\u2019s no case yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-18\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: We expect you, by your oath, to protect us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: There\u2019s no reason to get an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The court ended the dialogue about representation, summarized the procedural history of the case and the pending charges, and asked if Alan and Roger understood:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-6\">\u201c[THE COURT:] Do both you gentlemen understand the nature of the charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-7\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: Yes, I do. They\u2019ve been abated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Whether they have or haven\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-9\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: You have the information. They have been.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">The court expressed concern about Alan\u2019s and Roger\u2019s mental competence and lack of representation by counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Let me go on the record with what my concern is. I know you are unrepresented by counsel. Under 1368 of the Penal Code, there is a concern that nobody in this state can be proceeded on or proceeded against in a criminal case if they, number one, do not understand the nature of the proceedings against them. I just want to verify that you both understand the nature of the charges. Whether you agree with them or not is not my concern at the moment. I want to make sure you both understand the nature of the proceedings, what these charges allege.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: What I do understand is that you just used the term \u2018this state.\u2019 We are not in this state. We are sovereigns. We have expatriated. We do not come under your rules. It\u2019s up to you to protect us. We\u2019re holding you to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: That doesn\u2019t answer my question. My question is, whether you are under this state or not, do you understand the nature of what\u2019s being charged against both of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-14\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: Your honor, without\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-15\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: I believe if they are wrong, we\u2019re not going to argue right or wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t want to get to that. Do you understand the nature of the charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: I don\u2019t stand under either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I said do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: That means stand under and we do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Let me\u2014are you Roger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-8\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: I\u2019m Alan. Without granting jurisdiction, which the court does not have, these charges are so totally phony. We can\u2019t understand any of them. It doesn\u2019t identify any victim. It doesn\u2019t identify anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-9\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: We don\u2019t want to go there. Get on with whatever you have to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Otherwise, I\u2019d have to remand you and have a 1368 </em>proceeding\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-11\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: Just do\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014get involved in thos\u00e9 type of proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-13\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: D\u00f3 what\u00e9ver you have to do. We\u2019ll sit and watch it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: It wouldn\u2019t necessarily take place. [Addressing the prosecutor], are you ready to proceed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-15\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m ready to proceed. The concern I had was the defendants\u2019 ability to understand what\u2019s happening and to rationally assist in their defense in this case, rationally defend themselves. If the court is making a finding the court doesn\u2019t have concerns there, I\u2019m ready to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-16\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: If he\u2019s leading to evaluation thing; that\u2019s totally out of line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to determine. I have an obligation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-18\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: We understand enough to know what you are doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: Same with you, Mr. Alan Jenan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: I think Ido. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Then we\u2019ll proceed here. I do have to cover that one base because I want to make sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: I understand you have certain duties to do. We\u2019re watching, with witnesses.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">After the prosecutor put on his sole witness, a district attorney\u2019s investigator, the court asked the Jenans if either had any questions, and a dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-8\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: There\u2019s no case to respond to. I\u2019m sorry, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I take that as a no. Alan Jenan, do you have any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-10\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: Your Honor, without granting jurisdiction to the court, I would like to remind the court of case number 01-79256. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t know what that case is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: This [szc] is no discussing this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll take it as a no, there is no cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">Once the prosecutor stated he had no other witnesses, the court asked if the Jenans wished to put on a defense. Roger replied: \u201cNone needed. Thank you, though.\u201d When the prosecutor moved to hold the Jenans to answer, Roger stated, \u201cI\u2019d like to remind the court that the DA continues to dishonor the court, place you in jeopardy. And I\u2019m sure you have the answer at your fingertips. I hope you\u2019ll exercise that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">The prosecutor directed the court\u2019s attention to the California Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (UCC-1) in evidence and stated that the law required the debtor to agree to and to have notice of the filing but that neither had occurred. Roger interjected, \u201cIs the DA testifying?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s making an argument,\u201d the court answered. \u201cSounds like he\u2019s testifying,\u201d Roger retorted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">After the prosecutor argued his case at length, the court asked the Jenans for comments. Roger\u2019s reply was that \u201crepeatedly the DA continues to dishonor this court\u201d and that the \u201cDA fully is aware that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>controversy because they agreed to no controversy for the subject matter. Jurisdiction cannot possibly attach to this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">With the preface, \u201cLet me give you a little lesson here,\u201d the court' disparaged Alan and Roger\u2019s defense as \u201cnonsense\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: The DA\u2019s office in any county in this state has the ability to file a criminal charge against someone, if in fact there is reasonable belief or probable cause to do the filing. The DA in this case obviously determined there was probable cause to file charges against both of you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-7\">\u201cThis court must respond by having both of you brought to court, apprised of the charges, given the opportunity to obtain an attorney in a felony case, such as this. The next step is to have a preliminary hearing. Once a preliminary hearing is had, the People\u2019s obligation is to put on the evidence to show that a crime has been committed and that the people charged are reasonably likely to have been the persons committing that crime. The standard is not the same as a trial. It\u2019s not beyond a reasonable doubt. It\u2019s just a reasonable suspicion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-8\">\u201cThe DA has come in here, has done that in this case, at least so far in my opinion, absent any defense. My obligation is, if that has been done, to hold both of you to answer for trial. What that entails is the fact that I would order the DA\u2019s office to file what we call an information, which is another form of pleading. And you would be arraigned on that information two weeks from today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-9\">\u201cYou come in to court on that date, you enter a plea of either guilty or not guilty. If you enter a plea of not guilty, then the judge at that time will set a trial date. Then you can have either a court trial or a jury trial. And that\u2019s the way we proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-10\">\u201cAll this other nonsense about abatement, all this, I don\u2019t even have any concept of what you are talking about because I\u2019m obligated under my commitment as a judge here to follow the rules set down by the State of California. I\u2019m doing exactly that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-11\">\u201cI\u2019m giving you the opportunity here at this time to make any argument you wish to against [the prosecutor\u2019s] argument that he feels there\u2019s probable cause to hold you to answer. If you don\u2019t want to do that, that\u2019s fine. If you do want to do it, I\u2019m willing to listen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-12\">\u201cI do have some documents there that you have filed with the court indicating something about a notice to default\u2014a notice of default filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>against me indicating that there\u2019s some treasonous acts. I don\u2019t know what those are. I assume, from my reading of this, that you are saying I\u2019ve committed a treasonous act if in fact I allow this proceeding to go any further than today and not dismiss it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-5\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m acting under the laws I\u2019m obligated to uphold. Absent anything else, I\u2019m going to hold both of you to answer for trial. I don\u2019t know what you are planning to do against me or the DA or anybody else after this proceeding. But I would caution you that what you do may lead to further complications if, in fact, you commit any violations of the law, such as 115 of the Penal Code or 523 of the Penal Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">After the court asked if the Jenans had \u201cany statements or arguments\u201d to make \u201cagainst what [the prosecutor] set forth,\u201d a dialogue among the court, the prosecutor, Alan, and Roger ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: Yes, your Honor. Without conceding jurisdiction, I bring the court\u2019s attention to criminal case number 01-79256, in which all the charges have already been heard. They have all been found in my favor. The DA has no case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not on board with what that means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-9\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: All of the charges they have just made stem from that case in which I was found not guilty by a jury of filing a false UCC-1, claiming the bank and Boswell were indebted to me. The jury has declared me not guilty of that, filing a false form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-10\">\u201cWhen I refiled it, that\u2019s what they are claiming, is I filed a false form by refil[ing] one that a jury had already said was valid. They are\u2014I don\u2019t know where they are coming from. They have no claim. The issues have been heard by a jury and found in my favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Are you claiming double jeopardy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: I certainly am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t have that evidence before me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-14\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I can explain to the court in a second. There is one thing I wanted to put on the record, I neglected to do so earlier. I would ask the witness [district attorney\u2019s investigator] how many years he\u2019s been a sworn officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll allow you to reopen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Just to clarify the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: He is still under oath. How many years have you been a sworn peace officer? ' \u25a0 \"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-7\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Eighteen. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Any cross-examination on that issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-9\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: No. I\u2019ve known him since he was a kid. I think he still is. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: How about you, Mr. Alan Jenan, any cross-examination on that one question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-11\">\u201cDEFENDA\u00d1T ALAN JENAN: Not on that question, yo\u00far Honor. But I would like him, as an investigator, to get a transcript of case number 01-79256.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-12\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I can explain to the court what Mr. Roger Jenan is speaking about. I\u2019m sorry, Alan Jenan is speaking about. Mr. Alan Jenan filed a UCC-1 in 2001 on the same matters. But one of the things I did, I put in the court documents that were filed all in 2002.1 refiled charges \u00bfgainst him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-13\">\u201cThat case as to the UCC-1 that was filed in 2001 went to jury trial and the jury did not find there was evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. I\u2019m not exactly sure what the issue was, but there was not evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to his guilt on that 2001 UCC-1 filing. We are riot prosecuting him for the 2001 UCC filing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-14\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: That\u2019s totally false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-15\">\u201cPROSECUTOR: We are prosecuting him for the filing of the December 9 UCC-1 of 2003 and the UCC3 or 5\u2014UCC5 that was filed on February 18, 2004, as well as the newsletter, the letter to the bank and the letter to the Department of Financial Institutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: If I understand right, we\u2019re talking about the same UCC, it\u2019s just different filing dates. The first filing date being in \u201901. He or they were-both charged with that case, went through the process, they were found not guilty on that issue itself, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: On that document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: On the \u201901 filing. That case is dead and buried. We come down to \u201903 and \u201904 and that same UCC is again filed. Is that basically it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: It wasn\u2019t the same document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-8\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: It was exactly the same document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: The UCC-1 is a standard form. If you want to file a lien on a debtor because that debtor says, T acknowledge I owe this debt,\u2019 that gives a secured interest in that debtor, you can file a UCC-1 with the Secretary of State. They filed a UCC-1 standard claim in 2001. They now filed a UCC-1 in 2003, a separate UCC-1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Without the confirmation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-11\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Exactly. The claimed debtor did not acknowledge and in fact was not given notice at the time of filing. And they filed a correction, a UCC5, on February 18 of this year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: Your Honor, is he testifying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: He\u2019s going over the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">Alan asked for time to refer to a law book with which to counter the prosecutor\u2019s request that the court hold him and his brother to answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-15\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: Can you wait one minute until I get a book to settle some of his problems. It\u2019s right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: We\u2019ll do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-17\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: While he\u2019s getting his book, perhaps this would be analogous to taking a shot at somebody and getting found not guilty in 2001, taking another shot at them in 2003, there\u2019s a new case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-19\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: There\u2019s no new case. It\u2019s the same issue. Wait a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>\u201cWill counsel read this section right here, starting right here, number two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: What are we reading out of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: Parkers Company 1999 copy of Uniform Commercial Codes for California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: The problem\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Let\u2019s make a good record here. What section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: 9402. He was pointing out paragraph two. The book he\u2019s talking about is the 1999 Uniform Commercial Codes by Lexis. Specific reference for the court, it states, \u2018Financing statement which otherwise complies with subdivision one is sufficient when it is signed by the secured party debtor if it is filed per a security interest in or as a fixture filing covering any of the following . . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-10\">\u201cHowever, they have to be a valid debt. That\u2019s the issue. The bankruptcy court said there\u2019s no valid debt repeatedly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: It requires the debtor\u2019s agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-12\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: It doesn\u2019t if there\u2019s a valid debt but there\u2019s no debt value. It goes on to state, \u2018Any proceeds under 9306, which is proceeds from the sale of property,\u2019 and I certainly have those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t have any evidence here there is a valid debt. The only evidence I have is what\u2019s reflected in the various documents that have been marked and admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-14\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: In the court case, the jury found it was a valid debt. I have the case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t have that before me, and I think you are misinterpreting what a jury is to decide. They are deciding guilt or non-guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-16\">\u201cDEFENDANT ALAN JENAN: He has no idea what a UCC-1 really is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-17\">At that juncture, the court cut off Alan\u2019s effort to counter the prosecutor\u2019s argument and held him and his brother to answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m afraid you all will have to fight this out at a later time. If you really feel that way, I think you need to have an attorney represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>\u201cWith the evidence I have before me, I\u2019m going to make a finding that the crimes as charged have been committed, that the two defendants named are responsible for those crimes, and you are ordered to appear . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">After Roger informed the court of the \u201cappropriate action\u201d that he and Alan were going to take, the court warned that the alternative to keeping quiet was the initiation of mental competence proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: Just to reiterate again, we have witnesses here that have witnessed you violate your oath. We will take appropriate action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I can only advise you again, don\u2019t do something that might result in another filing against you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-8\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROGER JENAN: We asked you to do the same thing. You didn\u2019t do it today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not concerned with you taking me before the United States Supreme Court within ninety days, having this matter heard by Congress, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t know who the United States\u2014whatever you call it\u2014California Republic Court is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-10\">\u201cI assume that court, if there is such a thing that you have, is going to render some sort of a judgment. And I would just caution you as to a judgment against me, [the prosecutor] or anyone else connected with this case. I would just advise you to be very careful what you file, where you file things, and how you proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-11\">\u201cYou can have all the judgments you want to. Doing things such as filing in violation of 115 of the Penal Code and/or sending threatening letters, pursuant to 523 of the Penal Code, are crimes which, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-12\">\u201cMR.

Alan kept entirely quiet. At that moment, the proceedings ended abruptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Our analysis and application of the governing law will be as brief as the record is eloquent on the issues before us. As a defendant who is mentally incompetent cannot \u201cunderstand the nature of the criminal proceedings or,. . . assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner,\u201d so he or she \u201ccannot be tried or adjudged to punishment.\u201d (\u00a7 1367, subd. (a);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see. Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 162, 171 [43 L.Ed.2d 103, 95 S.Ct. 896].) The doubt. as to mental competence that arose in the court\u2019s mind at the preliminary hearing imposed on the court the duty to appoint counsel to represent Alan on that issue at that time: \u201cIf ... a doubt arises in the mind of the judge as to the mental competence of the defendant, he or she shall state that doubt in the record and . . . <em>[i]f the defendant is not represented by counsel, the court shall appoint counsel.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1368, subd. (a), italics added.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe failure to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant\u2019s right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives him [or her] of his [or her] due process right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>(Drope v. Missouri, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 172, citing <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 375, 385 [15 L.Ed.2d 815, 86 S.Ct. 836].) Congruently, the California Supreme Court has held that the \u201ccourt does not lose subject matter jurisdiction when it fails to hold a competency hearing, but rather acts in excess of jurisdiction by depriving the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Marks) </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 56, 70 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 389, 820 P.2d 613].) The record there \u201cestablished reversible error because the trial court failed to hold a competency hearing in compliance with section 1368, subdivision (b)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>], after expressing a doubt as to defendant\u2019s ability to proceed with the guilt phase.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Marks), </em>at p. 62, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Marks </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1335, 1340-1344 [248 Cal.Rptr. 874, 756 P.2d 260] (collectively the <em>Marks </em>cases).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The standard of mental competence to stand trial is the same as the standard of mental competence to waive the assistance of counsel. (See, e.g., <em>Godinez v. Moran </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 389, 399-101 [125 L.Ed.2d 321, 113 S.Ct. 2680]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 425, 513 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 656, 93 P.3d 271], citing <em>Godinez, supra, </em>at pp. 396, 399, 401, fn. 12; <em>People v. Welch </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 732 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 976 P.2d 754]; cf. <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806, 835 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525].) By denying Alan appointed counsel and by forcing self-representation on him at a time when his mental competence was at issue, the court\u2019s dereliction of statutory duty likewise denied him his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">In the <em>Marks </em>cases, the court expressed a doubt about mental competence and ordered a hearing but never held one. Here, not once, but twice, the court expressed a doubt about mental competence and warned of a hearing but never ordered one. That is a distinction without a difference. Here, the court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel at the preliminary hearing compels reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The judgment is reversed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Vartabedian, Acting P. J., and Cornell, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-12\"> In a companion case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenan </em>(Mar. 23, 2007, F048199) (nonpub. opn.), we adjudicate like arguments by his brother. On our own motion, we take judicial notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>entire record in that case. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 459; <em>Wagner Farms, Inc. v. Modesto Irrigation Dist. </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 765, 768, fn. 3 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 683].) In each case, the court denied probation, imposed a prison term, and suspended execution of sentence for five years, which the court fixed as the term of formal probation. For brevity and clarity, later references to each brother are by first name only. No disrespect is intended. Later collective references to both brothers are by last name only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-12\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-13\"> In propia persona, Alan and Roger each acted, at times expressly, at other times implicitly, on behalf of himself and his brother as to interests that were never adverse to, but were always identical to, those of the other, so we construe the arguments, documents, and statements of each as those of both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1010-11\"> Section 1367, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cA person cannot be tried or adjudged to punishment while that person is mentally incompetent. A defendant is mentally incompetent for purposes of this chapter if, as a result of mental disorder or developmental disability, the defendant is unable to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1010-12\"> Section 1368, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cIf, during the pendency of an action and prior to judgment, a doubt arises in the mind of the judge as to the mental competence of the defendant, he or she shall state that doubt in the record and inquire of the attorney for the defendant whether, in the opinion of the attorney, the defendant is mentally competent. If the defendant is not represented by counsel, the court shall appoint counsel. At the request of the defendant or his or her counsel or upon its own motion, the court shall recess the proceedings for as long as may be reasonably necessary to permit counsel to confer with the defendant and to form an opinion as to the mental competence of the defendant at that point in time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1011-7\"> Section 1368, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cIf counsel informs the court that he or she believes the defendant is or may be mentally incompetent, the court shall order that the question of the defendant\u2019s mental competence is to be determined in a hearing which is held pursuant to Sections 1368.1 and 1369. If counsel informs the court that he or she believes the defendant is mentally competent, the court may nevertheless order a hearing. Any hearing shall be held in the superior court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\"> In light of our holding, we will address none of the other issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
