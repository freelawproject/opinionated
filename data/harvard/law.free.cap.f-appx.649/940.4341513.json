Ballesteros appeals <em>pro se </em>the denial of a postconviction motion that the district court treated as a motion to vacate. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-22\">Ballesteros filed a belated motion for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct. The United States argued that Bal-lesteros\u2019s motion should be construed as a motion to vacate and that the motion was successive, untimely, and procedurally defaulted. <em>See id. </em>The district court denied Ballesteros\u2019s motion \u201cfor [the] reasons set forth in [the] Government\u2019s Response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-23\">Ballesteros\u2019s motion was untimely whether it was treated as a motion for a new trial or a motion to vacate. Balleste-ros had to file a motion for a new trial \u201cgrounded on newly discovered evidence ... within 3 years\u201d after his conviction on April 10, 2012, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P, 33(b)(1), but he waited until August 28, 2015, more than four months after the deadline expired, to file his motion. And if we construe his filing as a motion to vacate, Bal-lesteros failed to file his motion within one year after \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction became final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>We deem abandoned any challenge that Ballesteros could have made to the disposition of his motion. \u201cWhile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Bal-lesteros argues that his allegations of pros-ecutorial misconduct are meritorious, but he fails to challenge the decisions to construe his motion as a motion to vacate or to deny his motion as untimely and procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Ballesteros\u2019s motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
