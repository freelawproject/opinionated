After thorough review of the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ord and the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition, in part, and deny the remainder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">On July 22, 2015, Duran filed a motion with the BIA to reopen his removal proceedings, which had resulted in an order of deportation on February 26, 2010. Duran\u2019s motion raised two claims: (1) Duran\u2019s due process rights were violated when the immigration judge (IJ) \u201cessentially amended the charging document to include the charge of committing an aggravated felony,\u201d and (2) the \u201cpetty offense\u201d exception, see 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), should have applied to his prior conviction of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor because he was sentenced to only 90 days suspended imprisonment and probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The BIA characterized the motion as a motion to reconsider its prior order and denied relief on grounds that (1) whether characterized as a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, it was time-barred; (2) it failed to identify errors of law or fact that warranted reconsideration of the earlier order; (3) Duran did not offer any new, material, previously unavailable evidence; (4) all the claims raised could have been brought previously; and (5) no extraordinary circumstances warranted exercise of the BIA\u2019s sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings or reconsider the order. Duran then filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Duran argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion because (1) his due process rights were violated by the Id\u2019s erroneous amending of the Notice to Appear; (2) the proceedings before the IJ were biased; (3) he is now eligible for adjustment of status; (4) the IJ made erroneous factual findings; (5) both the IJ and BIA overlooked his eligibility for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and (6) although his motion is untimely, the doctrine of laches and equitable estoppel prevent his deportation because the government engaged in misconduct when it delayed twenty years in processing his asylum claim. Additionally, Duran moved to stay removal pending review. The Attorney General moved to dismiss in part and summarily deny the remainder. We denied Duran\u2019s motion to stay removal and carried the government\u2019s motion to dismiss in part with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">\u201cWe review [our] subject matter jurisdiction de novo.\u201d <em>See Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). \u201c[W]e retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims and questions of law raised in a petition for review.\u201d <em>Jeune v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>810 F.3d 792, 799 (11th Cir.2016); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). However, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s exercise or non-exercise of its sua sponte authority, <em>see Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.2008), or those claims not properly exhausted through the administrative process, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The exhaustion requirement applies to those cqnstitutional claims for which the BIA can provide a remedy. <em>See Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Duran\u2019s appeal raises no claim upon which we may grant relief. Although we would ordinarily have jurisdiction to review Duran\u2019s due process argument because it is a constitutional claim, we lack jurisdiction here because Duran\u2019s constitutional claim is of the type that the BIA could have remedied had the claim been properly exhausted. If Duran had raised his due process claim on direct appeal to the BIA in 2008, then the BIA could have evaluated its merits and determined whether the IJ erred in accepting the additional charges of removability contained in Form 1-261. However, Duran did not exhaust this claim \u2014 he raised it for the first time in the motion to reopen or reconsider. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review it today. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">All the other arguments raised in Duran\u2019s brief \u2014 including, <em>inter alia, </em>his eligibility for relief due to the doctrine of lach-es, equitable estoppel, or the IJ\u2019s brusque manner \u2014 were not but could have been brought either on direct appeal before the BIA or in Duran\u2019s motion to reopen. Although Duran describes these arguments in his brief as part of his due process claim, Duran cannot amend his motion through argument made in his brief. <em>Cf. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>716 F.3d 536, 559 (11th Cir.2013). Accordingly, Duran did not properly exhaust these claims and we lack jurisdiction to review them here. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Additionally, Duran argues about eligibility for deferral of removal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a), but he never raised that issue before this appeal. Therefore, the claim was not properly exhausted and we lack jurisdiction to address it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Lastly, Duran provided no briefing on the petty offense exception. We therefore treat this claim as waived on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A] legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Thus, Duran\u2019s petition is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\">. As we write for the parties, we set out only what is necessary to address Duran's arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
