Therefore, the court entered summary judgment for the Defendants. Charnley filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">On appeal, Charnley argues that she had a valid (1) First Amendment claim because citizen comments at a town hall meeting are core political speech and when she tried to express her views, her comments were interrupted and cut short, she was harassed, and, on one occasion, she was threatened with arrest; (2) Fourth Amendment claim because, when she refused to leave the podium after her allotted speaking time expired, the town\u2019s chief of police blocked her exit and prevented her from walking away, without probable cause; (3) equal protection claim, because the Defendants treated her differently than similarly situated individuals without a rational basis when they allowed other town residents to call out during town hall meetings, ask direct questions, speak off-topic, and exceed allotted speaking time, while she was gaveled out of order, interrupted, removed, or threatened with arrest for the same behavior; and (4) \u00a7 1985 claim, because the Defendants conspired to abridge her free speech and violate their oath to uphold the town charter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, Charnley asserts that none of the defendants is entitled to immunity and SPB is liable for failure to educate or train its officers to follow municipal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">After careful consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error as to any issue Charnley raised. For substantially the. same reasons given by the thorough opinion of the district court, we conclude that the court properly dismissed all Charnley\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-14\">. Because Charnley is proceeding pro se, we have \"liberally construed\u201d her filings \"to afford review on any legally justifiable bas[is].\u201d <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">. Charnley did not provide any briefing on her substantive due process claim. Thus, she abandoned that claim on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\"While we read briefs filed by pro se litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a pro se litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
