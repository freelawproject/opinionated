On appeal, Yedor argues that the government breached the terms of the plea agreement by requesting a sentence in the middle of the guideline range calculated by the district court rather than within the lower guideline range proposed by the parties. Yedor also argues that the district court erred by failing to give reasonable notice of its intent to upwardly depart from the guideline range in sentencing him. Finally, Yedor contends that the district court abused its discretion in imposing an above-guideline sentence based on factors already ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>dressed by the applicable guideline and enhancements. Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Yedor first argues that the government breached the terms of the plea agreement by arguing that the court should impose a 77-month sentence, which was in the middle of the guideline range found by the district court. He argues that the government instead should have advocated for an approximately 70-month sentence, which was in the middle of the guideline range contemplated by the parties in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government breached a plea agreement where the defendant preserved his objection in the district court. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2004). The defendant preserves an objection by \u201craising] that point in such clear and simple language that the trial court may not misunderstand\u201d the legal basis for the objection. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Where the defendant does not sufficiently object, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003). We reverse under this standard where \u201c(1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">\u201cThe government is bound by any material promises it makes to a defendant as part of a plea agreement that induces the defendant to plead guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>77 F.3d 368, 370 (11th Cir.1996). Where the terms of a plea agreement are in dispute, we apply an objective standard to determine whether the government\u2019s actions were inconsistent with what the defendant reasonably understood when he pleaded guilty. <em>Copeland, </em>381 F.3d at 1105. We do not rigidly construe the language of the plea agreement, and we resolve ambiguities against the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1105-06. In interpreting a plea agreement, we are \u201climited to the unambiguous meaning of the language in the agreement.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1106. If the language in the agreement is ambiguous, we then decide whether to enforce the agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">We review for plain error whether the government breached the plea agreement -with Yedor. Yedor argues that he objected to the government\u2019s breach, so review should be de novo. At sentencing, Yedor\u2019s counsel stated that, \u201cwe all thought the [guideline] range was going to be lower ... so the[ ] [government\u2019s] recommendation here is actually higher than what we had agreed to in terms of the number of months.\u201d This statement was not so clearly an objection as to sufficiently preserve Yedor\u2019s argument that the government breached the plea agreement. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Even accepting this statement as an objection sufficient to trigger <em>de novo </em>review we nevertheless conclude that the government did not breach the plea agreement. Under the plea agreement, the government agreed to \u201crecommend[ ]\u201d or \u201cstipulate^]\u201d that \u201c[t]he applicable offense guideline is [USSG \u00a7 ] 2B4.1.\u201d The government also agreed to \u201crecommend that [Yedor] be sentenced in the middle of the adjusted guideline range,\u201d although the agreement did not define any particular guideline range. And the agreement specified that \u201cthere are no agreements between the parties with respect to any Sentencing Guidelines issues other than those specifically listed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">At sentencing, the \u25a0 government, argued, as promised in the plea agreement, that the case should be governed by United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B4.1. The district court disagreed and found another guideline more appropriate. This guideline relied upon by the court established the range at 70 to 87 months imprisonment. The government then requested a sentence of 77 months, which was in the middle of this guideline range. Though the government opposed Yedor\u2019s request for a below-guideline sentence, this did not breach the terms of the plea agreement. The government made the recommendations required by the plea agreement, and did not otherwise breach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Yedor also argues that the district court erred by failing to give reasonable notice of its intent to depart upwards from the guideline range in imposing his sentence. Where the defendant fails to object at sentencing to the lack of notice of an upward departure, we review only for plain error. <em>See Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h), the district court \u201cmust give the parties reasonable notice\u201d before it \u201cdepart[s] from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h). Rule 32(h) does not, however, require the district court to give notice where it intends to impose a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 as opposed to a departure. <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 714, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). \u201c \u2018Departure\u2019 is a term of art under the Guidelines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the framework set out in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether the sentencing court applied a departure or a variance, \u201cwe consider whether the district court cited to a specific guideline departure provision and if the court\u2019s rationale was based on its determination that the Guidelines were inadequate.\u201d <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The district court imposed a variance rather than a departure in sentencing Yedor outside the guideline range. The court did not cite a specific guideline departure provision. The court also stated: \u201c[This] is not a guidelines case. The guidelines just don\u2019t adequately cover it.\u201d This suggests that the court applied a variance in imposing Yedor\u2019s sentence. <em>See Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d at 1316. Because the court\u2019s variance was not governed by Rule 32(h), it did not plainly err by failing to provide notice before imposing an above-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Yedor finally argues that the district court erred in imposing an above-guideline sentence because the upward variance was based on factors the court had already considered in establishing the applicable guideline and enhancements. We review the procedural and substantive reasonableness of an out-of-guideline sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d in determining whether a sentence is substantively reasonable, and \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence bears the burden of showing it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">Under \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to reflect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>seriousness of and provide just punishment for the offense, adequately deter criminal conduct, and protect the p\u00fablic from future crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the U.S. Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims of the offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a). The weight given to these factors is in \u201cthe sound discretion of the district court,\u201d and we will remand for resentencing only if we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error in judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Yedor did not demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in applying an upward variance to his sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court expressly justified Yedor\u2019s 120-month sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court noted that in varying upward to reach this sentence, it considered the need for just punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation for Yedor. It also considered the scope of Yedor\u2019s scheme in terms of the many years and large amount of money involved, Yedor\u2019s \u201cimpunity\u201d in carrying out the scheme, and Yedor\u2019s age and health. The weight given to these factors was within the district court\u2019s discretion, and its sentence was supported by the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
