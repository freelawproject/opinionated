Smachetti, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b879-10\">Pedro Perez, Miami, FL, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b879-12\">Before TJOFLAT, JILL PRYOR, and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b879-13\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">Pedro Perez, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction in his sentence for, <em>inter alia, </em>cocaine trafficking and firearm possession by an illegal alien, pursuant to Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. As relevant background, Perez was assigned at sentencing an offense level of 32 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) for his cocaine-trafficking convictions, which had a 10-year mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), because they involved at least 5, but less than 15, kilograms of cocaine. This yielded a guideline range of 121 to 151 months. In addition, Perez was subject to a mandatory five-year consecutive sentence for his firearm-possession conviction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The district court imposed a 181-month total sentence for Perez\u2019s offenses, which was 1 month above the cumulative 180 months\u2019 imprisonment mandated by statute. Notably, in its \u00a7 3582(c)(2) response in the district court, the government argued that Perez was ineligible for relief on the basis that he was sentenced to the ten-year mandatory minimum for the drug-trafficking offenses upon which his guideline range was based. Thereafter, in a one-page standard form order, the district court summarily denied Perez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, without explanation of the basis for The denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">On appeal, Perez argues that the court erred by denying him \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief pursuant to Amendment 782. Specifically, he notes that he is eligible for a two-l\u00e9vel reduction in his original \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level under that amendment and corresponding lower guideline range. Perez elaborates that the record reflects that he was sentenced to a 121-month imprisonment term for his cocaine-trafficking convictions, not to the applicable 120-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>mandatory minimum, as the government incorrectly had asserted in its \u00a7 3582(c)(2) response in the district court. As such, because he was sentenced to one month above his mandatory minimum, Perez argues that Amendment 782 has application in his case. In its response, the government concedes \u2014 contrary to its previous contentions in its \u00a7 3582(c)(2) response in the district court \u2014 that Perez is eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010). We review for abuse of discretion a court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Once pronounced, a district court\u2019s authority to modify a sentence of imprisonment is narrowly limited by statute, <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194-95. Nevertheless, a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. We have stated that a district court must engage in a two-step analysis when considering a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and holding all other guideline findings made at the original sentencing constant. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence and, if so, to what extent. <em>Id. </em>at 781. In exercising that discretion, the court must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)). The court also must consider the nature and seriousness of any danger a reduction poses to persons or to the community. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n,1(B)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">A district court need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Eggersdorf, </em>we deemed sufficient the district court\u2019s order in which it stated that it had reviewed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the government\u2019s response, the record, and was \u201cotherwise duly advised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23. We further noted that the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and response had discussed specific elements that were relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and also stressed that the sentencing judge and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) judge was the same. <em>Id. </em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">While the two-step analysis is required, the district court\u2019s decision of whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence is discretionary. <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257. We will vacate and remand \u201cif it is not possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Under the 2010 Sentencing Guidelines, a base offense level of 32 applies to offenses involving at least 5 kilograms, but less than 15 kilograms, of cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (2010). Such offenses are subject to a ten-year statutory mandatory minimum. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II). When a guideline range falls below the statutory minimum, the statutory sentence becomes the bottom end of the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782. In pertinent part, Amendment 782 lowered from 32 to 30 the base offense level applicable to offenses involving at least 5 kilograms, but less than 15 kilograms, of cocaine. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (2010), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5) (2014); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782. Amendment 782 became effective on November 1, 2014,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was made retroactive by Amendment 788 as of the same date. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 782 <em>&amp; </em>788; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Here, the district court\u2019s summary denial of Perez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was improper, because he was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782, which had the effect of lowering his \u00a7 2D1.1 guideline range from 121 to 151 months to 97 to 121 months. However, because of the statutory mandatory minimum, Perez\u2019s range is now 120 to 121 months. Moreover, the court\u2019s order does not reflect that it considered the requisite \u00a7 3553(a) factors in denying him relief, much less whether he was eligible for relief as a threshold matter, given the government\u2019s incorrect statement in its \u00a7 3582(c)(2) response before the district court that Perez was sentenced' to the statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the offense's nature and circumstances and the defendant's history and characteristics, (2) the need to reflect the offense\u2019s seriousness, (3) the need to afford adequate deterrence, (4) the need to protect the public, (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care, (6) the kinds of sentences that are available, (7) the advisory guideline range, (8) the pertinent U.S. Sentencing Commission policy statements, (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and (10) the need to provide victims with restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (a)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. Amendment 788, however, provides that any relief ordered under Amendment 782 could not take effect until November 1, 2015.
