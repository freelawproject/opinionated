Following his release from prison, the supervision of his behavior on supervised release was transferred to the Southern District of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-20\">In June 2015, the district court, granting Deloatch\u2019s probation officer\u2019s petition, issued a warrant for his arrest based on four violations of his supervised release: (1) committing the offense of false statements, in violation of 18 \u00da.S.C. \u00a7 1001, by failing to report business-related activities and income on monthly supervision reports, a 2015 financial statement, and his 2014 income tax return; (2) committing the offense of wire fraud, in violation \u25a0 of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and theft by deception, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>violation of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-8-3, by making false representations in obtaining seasonings and spices on credit from Zeno-bia Company, a wholesaler doing business as My Spice Sage and failing to make payment toward the debt; (3) incurring new credit charges or opening additional lines of credit without the approval of the probation office; and (4) leaving the judicial district without the permission of the court or probation officer. Regarding violation (2), the petition alleged that De-loatch had falsely represented to Zenobia that he was affiliated with celebrity chef Curtis Stone, and that he owned a restaurant and catering business which required exotic spices. The probation officer contended that based on these representations, Zenobia agreed to sell and ship De-loatch seasonings and spices on credit. The probation officer recommended that Deloatch\u2019s supervised release be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">At the revocation hearing that followed, Deloatch admitted violations (3) and (4), but denied violations (1) and (2). The district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to prison for 24 months followed by supervised release of 24 months. He appeals the court\u2019s decision, arguing that the court erred in finding that he violated the terms of his supervised release by committing the crime of theft by deception in violation of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-8-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2014). \u201cA district court\u2019s finding of fact made at a revocation hearing is binding unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">A district court may \u201crevoke a term of supervised release ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Where the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release is adequately supported by one alleged violation, any possible error in the consideration of other allegations is harmless. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>656 F.2d 1204, 1207 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An error is harmless if it \u201chad no substantial influence on the outcome and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the decision.\u201d <em>Rivers v. United States, </em>777 F.3d 1306, 1316 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 267, 193 L.Ed.2d 212 (2015) (alterations omitted) (quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a) (defining \u201charmless error\u201d as \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights\u201d). An error is not harmless if \u201cthere is a reasonable likelihood that [it] affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Rivers, 111 </em>F.3d at 1316 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide three grades of probation and supervised release violations: (1) Grade A violations include felony conduct that constitutes a crime of violence, controlled substance offense, certain firearms offenses, and any other offense punishable by more than 20 years\u2019 imprisonment; (2) Grade B violations include felony conduct not covered under Grade A; and (3) Grade C violations include misdemeanor conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>and violations of any other condition of supervision. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a). Where there is more than one violation, the ultimate grade is determined by the violation having the .most serious grade. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(b). Upon a finding of a Grade A or B violation, the district court is required to revoke the defendant\u2019s supervised release. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l). Upon a finding of a Grade C violation, the court may either revoke the defendant\u2019s supervised release, or extend the term of, or modify the conditions of, supervised release. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2). Section 7B1.4 provides the applicable guideline range for each grade as it corresponds to the defendant\u2019s criminal history category. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Under Georgia law, \u201c[a] person commits the off\u00e9nse of theft by deception when he obtains property by any deceitful means or artful practice with the intention of depriving the owner of the property.\u201d Ga.Code Ann, \u00a7 16-8-3(a). A person deceives if, <em>inter alia, </em>he \u201ccreates or confirms another\u2019s impression of an existing fact or past event which is false and which the accused knows or believes to be false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-8-3(b)(l). The Georgia Court of Appeals has determined that \u201cthe gravamen of theft by deception lies in obtaining the property of another by intentionally creating a false impression as to an existing fact or past event,\u201d and that \u201c[c]reating a false impression as to a future event ... by a promise of future payment, is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Ellerbee v. State, </em>256 Ga.App. 848, 851, 569 S.E.2d 902 (2002) (quotation omitted). It determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">[t]he reason for the rule [regarding existing or past events] is that if the party to whom the representations was made chose to rely upon the promise as to a future contingency, he is not deceived by deceitful means or artful practice, but his loss results from his absolute confidence in the party making the promise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 853, 569 S.E.2d 902 (alterations in original) (quotation omitted). It held that \u201cany promises, reassurances, or representations\u201d made by the defendant that he would make good on his checks, \u201ccould not as a matter of law constitute theft by deception\u201d because \u201c[a] promise of future performance cannot serve as the basis of a theft by deception prosecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The district court\u2019s finding that Deloatch committed theft by deception under \u00a7 16-8-3, arguably was not supported even by a preponderance of the evidence because the government failed to introduce any evidence to show that Deloatch created a false impression as to any existing fact or past event in obtaining the merchandise from Zenobia. Nonetheless, the court\u2019s error was harmless since its decision to revoke Deloatch\u2019s supervised release was premised on three other violations, any one of which could independently serve as a basis to revoke Deloatch\u2019s supervised release. <em>See Brown, </em>656 F.2d at 1207. Deloatch admitted to committing violations (3) and (4), and the court found that he had committed violation (1), which he does not challenge on appeal. Thus, despite any error in the court\u2019s finding that he had committed the theft by deception, the court had three other violations on which to revoke his supervised release, any one of which could properly serve as a basis for revocation, and one of which actually required the court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Deloatch\u2019s argument regarding ambiguity in his sentence is without merit. Violation (1), alone, resulted in a Guidelines sentence range of 21-27 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the court sentenced him within the middle of that range. Additionally, the court stated that despite the outcome on violation (2), it would have imposed the same sentence based on violations (1), (3), and (4). Thus, contrary to Deloatch\u2019s assertions, there is no indica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>tion that his sentence would have been lower, absent a finding that he committed the theft by deception offense. Lastly, although he contends that the court\u2019s error in finding that he committed the crime of theft by deception affects his substantial rights because it would \u201clikely\u201d have a bearing on Zenobia\u2019s civil case against him, he has not cited any case law or provided any legal support for that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The district court\u2019s decision revoking Deloatch\u2019s supervise release is</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">.
