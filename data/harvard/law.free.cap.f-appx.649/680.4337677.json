Perez requested a reduction to 64 months\u2019 imprisonment, but the district court reduced his sentence to 76 months\u2019 imprisonment instead. On appeal, Perez argues that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors before reducing his sentence. Because it is unclear from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when re-sentencing Perez, we vacate his sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">Section 3582(c)(2) grants a district court discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an incarcerated defendant if the defendant was sentenced based on a guidelines range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). This authority is limited to those amendments listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines. Under Amendment 782, which is included in that list, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>court had discretion to reduce Perez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">A district court considering a motion for such a reduction must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>Id, </em>\u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe next step is for the court to decide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In deciding whether to impose an amended sentence, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but \u201cis not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). If, however, \u201cit is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). Notably, a defendant is entitled to challenge a district court\u2019s failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors regardless of whether the court denied or granted a sentence reduction. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Nothing in the record indicates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in reducing Perez\u2019s sentence. The record establishes that Amendment 782 caused Perez\u2019s guidelines range to drop from 120 to 135 months down to 87 to 108 months. Because the district court did not hold a hearing on Perez\u2019s resentencing, the only thing in the record describing the court\u2019s reasoning is its order granting the sentence reduction. And although the order reduced Perez\u2019s sentence, it did so \u201csummarily\u201d and \u201cwithout discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1257. This is not to say the district court must hold a hearing but the district court in some way has to demonstrate that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The order does, admittedly, reference Perez\u2019s prior motions concerning his eligibility for a sentence reduction, as well as a memorandum from the United States Probation Office suggesting that Perez was eligible for a sentence reduction. But none of these filings discusses or even mentions the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, they cannot demonstrate that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3563(a) factors in making its reduction determination. <em>See Douglas, </em>576 F.3d at 1220 (concluding that the district court\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s motion, which cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>to \u00a7 3553(a), did not demonstrate that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the motion did not \u201cset forth the \u00a7 3553(a) factor\u2019s\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Because the record as a whole does not show that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we vacate Perez\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors that a district court must consider in ruling on a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to accomplish certain aims, such as reflect the seriousness of the offense, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the applicable sentencing range under the guidelines; (5) any pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statement; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>United States v.
