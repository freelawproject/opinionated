(\u201cVRC\u201d), brought suit in the Southern District of Florida against the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) and the Secretary of HHS Sylvia Burwell (\u201cSecretary\u201d) seeking the recoupment of payments VRC returned to Medicare after it was issued notice of an overpayment. Throughout the Medicare administrative review process, HHS upheld the ruling denying recoupment. The district court similarly affirmed HHS\u2019s decision. After careful review, we now affirm the ruling of the district court upholding the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\n<em>A Administration of Lucentis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">During the years 2007 and 2008, VRC served patients covered by Medicare Part B who suffered from age-related macular degeneration (\u201cAMD\u201d) and other retinal diseases. Among other treatment methods for AMD, VRC administered the in-travitreal injection of Lucentis. Lucentis is FDA approved for the treatment of AMD. It is manufactured and sold by Gen-entech, Inc., in 2,0-mg vials.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">The FDA-approved labeling on the drug instructs that a single 0.5-mg dose of Lu-centis be injected into the patient\u2019s eye once each month. The proper method for extracting the drug and administering the injection described on the label requires the healthcare professional to extract the <em>full contents </em>of the 2.0-mg vial into a syringe. The contents of the syringe are then to be expelled until the plunger tip is aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL (0.5 mg). Then the dose is to be injected into the patient\u2019s eye. The label further instructs that \u201c[ejach vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">First Coast Service Options, Inc., administers Medicare payment processing in Florida. SafeGuard Services LLC audits Medicare claims. In February 2008, First Coast issued its first Local Coverage Determination for Lucentis, acknowledging that the drug was \u201cmedically reasonable and necessary\u201d for the treatment of AMD. The Local Coverage Determination incorporated the label\u2019s instruction that \u201c[ejach vial should only be used for treatment of a single eye.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">VRC did not follow the Lucentis label\u2019s instructions limiting dosage to one per vial. Instead, VRC treated up to three patients from a single vial. It did so by extracting up to three doses of 0.5 mg each from one vial into three separate syringes. This process is referred to by the parties as \u201cmulti-dosing.\u201d VRC billed Medicare for every 0.5-mg dose of Lucentis it administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">The reimbursement rate for Medicare Part B drugs is capped at the lower of the physician\u2019s billed charge or 106% of the drug\u2019s average sales price. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-3a. The drug\u2019s average sales price, in turn, is calculated quarterly based on nationwide sales, divided by the total number of units of drug sold. <em>Id. </em>(c)(1), (5)(B). Physicians receive reimbursement based on the number of dosage units used to treat a patient. <em>Id. </em>(b)(1). Where a drug\u2019s administration results in wasted contents, Medicare reimburses the physician for the waste if it was a necessary part of administration. Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Pub. No. 100-04, Ch. 17,- \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The \u25a0 calculated reimbursement rate of Lucentis during the period at issue was approximately $405 per 0.1 mg administered or $2,025 for a standard 0.5-mg dose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This price was reached by determining the cost of an entire single-use vial of Lucentis. The average sales pnce for a vial was $2,025. \u25a0 This price was then assigned as the cost of one dose of 0.5 mg. The 0.5-mg dose was then broken down into individual units of 0.1 mg, with a reimbursement rate of $405 ($2,025 -s- 5). Hence, if administered according to the label, a provider would inject 0.5 mg into a patient\u2019s eye, dispose of 1.5 mg, and receive reimbursement in the amount of approximately $2,025 for the single vial \u2014 or the total average cost of the 20-mg vial. VRC billed Medicare at the allowed rate for every 0.5-mg dose it administered,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> resulting in a bill for approximately $2,025 for every dose. Because VRC was extracting up to three doses from a single vial, it was \u201creimbursed\u201d for approximately $6,075 per single Lucentis vial, three times the average cost of the vial and three times the amount it would\u2019 have received had it administered the drug according to the label.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">\n<em>B, Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A09\">In June 2009, SafeGuard issued to VRC a preliminary overpayment determination of approximately $8.9 million, representing the amount charged for two-thirds of the doses administered by VRC against the label\u2019s instructions. In July of the same year, First Coast published an updated Local Coverage Determination under the title \u201cArticle Clarification\u201d specifically aimed at eliminating payment' for multi-dosing from single-use Lucentis vials. This publication stated that \u201cwhen a single use vial is used and billed for three patients at 0.5 mg per patient ... [t]he physician is then overstating his/her expense.\u201d In addition, First Coast adopted SafeGuard\u2019s overpayment determination and concluded that VRC \u201cshould have known [it was] not entitled to\u201d the overpayment and was therefore liable to repay to Medicare $8,982,706.98. VRC\u2019s request for reconsideration was denied and VRC complied with the repayment demand. VRC also pursued administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) upheld the overpayment determination. The ALJ noted that VRC had not complied with the drug\u2019s label. As a result, the ALJ concluded, the injection of more than one dose from one vial of Lucentis was not \u201csafe and effective\u201d and was not covered by Medicare Part B. The Medicare Appeals Council subsequently affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appeals Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>held that Lucentis injections are \u201cmedically reasonable and necessary [only] to the extent the drug [is] administered consistent with its FDA-approved label.\u201d In addition, the Appeals Council held that VRC \u201cknew, or could reasonably be expected to know, that the' Lucentis injections ... would not be covered by Medicare,\u201d so it was liable for the overpayment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>C. District Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">VRC filed suit in the Southern District of Florida. The district court granted summary judgment for HHS. It gave deference to the agency\u2019s decision because \u201c[pjlaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the Secretary[\u2019]s decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d VRC now appeals,</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>grants of summary judgment, and we the same legal standards that bound the district court. <em>Whatley v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>189 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate when the record reflects show no genuine issue of material fact and demonstrates that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Connelly v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., </em>764 F.3d 1358, 1363 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">In a dispute related to Medicare reimbursement, \u201c[t]he findings of the [Secretary] as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1395ff(b)(l)(A). We therefore limit our review to whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s findings and whether the Secretary applied the correct legal standards. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(l)(A) (\u201cincorporating into Medicare Act the standard of review set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g)).\u201d <em>Gulfcoast Med.

Substantial evidence \u201cis \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Barnes v. Sullivan, </em>932 F.2d 1356, 1358 (11th Cir.1991) (citations omitted). \u2018We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">As for legal conclusions, the Administrative Procedure Act limits our review to determining whether the agency\u2019s actions were \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. \u201c[T]his standard is exceedingly deferential.\u201d <em>Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, </em>85 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.1996). As we have previously explained, \u201cthe arbitrary and capricious standard gives an appellate court the <em>least </em>latitude in finding grounds for reversal; \u2018Administrative decisions should be set aside in this context ... only for substantial procedural or substantive reasons as mandated by statute, ... not simply because the court is unhappy with the result reached.\u2019\u201d <em>Rice, </em>85 F.3d at 541-42 (citations omitted). We are not permitted to substitute our judgment for that of the agency \u201cconcerning the wisdom or prudence of the proposed action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have further recognized that our deference to the Secretary\u2019s judgment is especially warranted in the context of Medicare \u201c[b]ecause Medicare is a \u2018complex and highly technical regulatory program.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gulfcoast Med.

Medicare Part B creates voluntary supplemental medical insurance covering, among other things, doctors\u2019 services and outpatient care. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395k(a)(2). Under the program, Medicare beneficiaries receive .medical treatment, and providers submit claims for government reimbursement. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395n. To prevent abuse and to control costs, Congress has authorized Medicare reimbursement for \u201cmedical and other health services\u201d if they are \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d only. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395k(a)(l), 1395y(a)(l)(A). \u201cMedical and other health services\u201d include \u201cservices, and supplies [] furnished as an incident to a physician\u2019s professional service.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(s)(2)(A). Under the Medicare Act, the Secretary has the authority \u201cto determine what claims are covered by the Act \u2018in accordance with the regulations prescribed by him.\u2019\u201d <em>Ringer, </em>466 U.S. at 605, 104 S.Ct. at 2016 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \u2022Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) within HHS are responsible for the administration of Medicare Part B, including the determination of coverage for physician-administered drugs. <em>HHS, CMS Reorganization Order, </em>66 Fed. Reg. 35437 (July 5, 2001). CMS published the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual to provide guidance on Medicare Part B coverage. This manual instructs that \u201c[i]n order to meet all the general requirements for coverage under the \u2018incident to\u2019 provision ... the cost of the drug or biological must represent an expense to the physician.\u201d Pub.

CMS published the Medicare Program Integrity Manual to guide regional contractors in their local coverage determinations. Pub. No. 100-08, Ch. 13. This manual instructs that coverage determinations should be based on whether an item is \u201c[appropriate ... in terms of whether it is [fjurnished in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13.5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In the instant case, First Coast, the regional Medicare contractor for Florida, issued a Local Coverage Determination, acknowledging Medicare coverage for Lu-centis. As described above, the Local Coverage Determination incorporated the label\u2019s instruction: \u201cEach vial should only be used for. treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used.\u201d Based on this instruction, the Secretary, through First Coast and SafeGuard, determined that Medicare would not reimburse for multiple doses of Lucentis. administered from the same vial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">VRC argues that the Secretary\u2019s determination was unlawful. First, VRC asserts that the Secretary exceeded her authority in calculating the reimbursement allowance for Lucentis at anything less than full payment for every 0.5-mg dose, regardless of how many doses were administered per vial. Second, VRC contends that the Secretary\u2019s determination that administering more than one dose per vial was medically unreasonable and unnecessary was arbitrary and capricious and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>supported by substantial evidence. Finally, VRC maintains that even if the Secretary\u2019s decision was proper, it should be applied prospectively only, and VRC should not be held liable to repay Medicare the overpayment amount of $8.9 million. We do not find merit in VRC\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A. <em>VRC\u2019s Charge to Medicare did not Reflect its Expense and was Not Medically Reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The Secretary denied payment to VRC on two grounds. Initially, the Secretary-denied payment because VRC \u201coverstated [its] expense\u201d by billing Medicare for each 0.5-mg dose of Lucentis it administered, when it did not purchase and incur the expense of a full 2.0-mg vial for each dose. Later in the review process, the Secretary based her denial of payment on the finding that multiple doses were not medically reasonable and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Before addressing the merits, we consider a procedural argument urged by VRC. There is some indication that the two reasons offered by HHS were not offered contemporaneously. In the initial overpayment letter, HHS based its decision on \u201coverstated expense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Only later in the review process \u2014 on review before the Medicare Appeals Council \u2014 did HHS assert that multi-dosing was medically unreasonable. VRC insinuates that this history automatically indicates arbitrariness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">First, it is not clear that HHS ever surrendered its first reason. In the district court, the Secretary expressly relied on the overstated-expense theory. And on appeal, in its brief, HHS contests VRC\u2019s assertion regarding the fiscal effects of the Secretary\u2019s position, an argument closely related to the overstated-expense theory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But even if HHS had changed its reason for denying payment, that, in and of itself, would not necessarily make the Secretary\u2019s decision arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that an agency can change its position on an issue, so long as it gives a proper reason for doing so. <em>See, e.g., F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>556 U.S. 502, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009) (holding agency need not provide a more substantial reason for a change in policy than the arbitrary standard); <em>Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecommunications Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., </em>545 U.S. 967, 981, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 2699, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (\u201cAgency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to analyze the agency\u2019s interpretation under the <em>Chevron </em>framework\u201d); <em>see also Am. Petroleum Inst. v. E.P.A., </em>661 F.2d 340, 355 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cNothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>in the Administrative Procedure Act prohibits an agency from changing its mind.\u201d). Because it is not clear* that the Secretary intended to forgo her initial argument, we address both reasons that the Secretary proffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\n<em>1. Overstated Expense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">VRC argues that the Secretary\u2019s first rationale is flawed because Medicare reimbursement is not related to the physician\u2019s expense. For support, VRC cites <em>Hays v. Sebelius, </em>589 F.3d 1279 (D.C.Cir.2009). That case concerned whether the Secretary could deny payment for Duo-Neb, a drug used to treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. <em>Id. </em>at 1280. DuoNeb provides a combination of two separate drugs in one dose and is more expensive than purchasing the component drugs separately. <em>Id. </em>The Secretary argued that Medicare\u2019s \u201cleast costly alternative policy\u201d required that reimbursement be limited to the cost of the two separate drugs rather than the higher cost of Duo-Neb. <em>Id. </em>The District of Columbia Circuit held that the statute is unambiguous in its instruction to the Secretary: \u201ceither an item or service is reasonable and necessary, in which case it may be covered at the statutory rate, or it is unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case it may not be covered at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1282. As the court explained, \u201cNothing in the statute authorizes the least costly alternative policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">We think <em>Hays </em>inapposite. <em>Hays </em>construed the Medicare statute to require Medicare to pay for any drug it deems reasonable and necessary, without regard to alternative methods that would save Medicare money. Here, the Secretary did not demand that VRC administer a cheaper alternative than Lucentis. Instead, the Secretary demanded only that VRC\u2019s bill to Medicare reflect the expense incurred by VRC in purchasing the drug. Medicare\u2019s policy is that \u201c[t]he charge ... for the drug or biological must be included in the physician\u2019s bill, and the cost of the drug or biological <em>must represent an expense to the physician.\u201d </em>Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Pub. No. 100-02, Ch. 15, \u00a7 50.3 (emphasis added). Nothing in the statute forbids the Secretary from relating Medicare reimbursement to the physician\u2019s expense. On the contrary, the very concept of \u201creimbursement\u201d contemplates payment for money that was actually spent. <em>See Reimbursement, The Am. Heritage Dictionary </em>(4th ed.2000) (\u201c1. To repay (money spent); refund. 2. To pay back or compensate (another party) for money spent or losses incurred .... \u201d); <em>see also Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., </em>488 U.S. 204, 205, 109 S.Ct. 468, 470, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (\u201chealth care providers are <em>reimbursed </em>by the Government for <em>expenses incurred </em>in providing medical services to Medicare beneficiaries.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">VRC also points to a recent CMS publication that describes Medicare\u2019s policy for reimbursing medical providers. 81 Fed. Reg. 13229 (March 11, 2016). This publication explains that \u201cMedicare pays for most drugs ... at ASP + 6 [Average Sales Price + six percent].... The ASP payment amount does not vary based on the price an individual provider or supplier pays to acquire the drug.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13231; <em>see also id. </em>at 13253 (\u201cMedicare pays this price regardless of the price a provider pays to acquire the drug.\u201d). VRC argues that this publication contradicts the Secretary\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Again, we disagree. Under CMS\u2019s policy, once it has determined the Average Sales Price and calculated the 106% reimbursement rate for a given drug, CMS does not inquire into individual medical providers\u2019 costs when calculating reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>bursement. Instead, CMS reimburses at the 106% rate, regardless of the possibility that a given provider may have obtained the drug at a reduced rate. That is not what happened here. VRC\u2019s profits from treating AMD with Lucentis did not stem from the advantage of purchasing the drug at a reduced rate. VRC bought Lucentis at the market rate. Its extraordinary profits arose from using a single-dose-approved vial for three patients, in violation of the FDA-approved instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">VRC next suggests that Medicare\u2019s policy to pay for overfill runs counter to the position that HHS has taken with respect to VRC. Under the overfill policy, CMS \u201creimburse[s] suppliers for the total number of units administered.... CMS does not make any payment determinations based on the absence or presence of \u2018overfill\u2019 in a vial.\u201d \u201cOverfill\u201d is \u201c[a]ny excess free product ... provided without charge\u201d when a physician purchases a vial of a drug, in excess of amounts \u201cdefined by the product packaging.\u201d 75 Fed.Reg. 73170, 73466 (Nov. 29, 2010). VRC argues that if Medicare reimburses for overfill, even though overfill is obtained without cost, certainly Medicare should reimburse for the full contents of a vial of Lucentis in order to reimburse the full expense to the provider in purchasing the vial.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We are not persuaded. Medicare\u2019s policy to reimburse for overfill means only that where a manufacturer does not charge for excess drug, Medicare will not recalculate its unit price for the excess drug. But this policy is inapplicable in a situation where Medicare has calculated the unit price for a drug based on the presumption that some of a vial\u2019s content will necessarily not be used per the drug\u2019s instructions.' In such a case, if a physician does not comply with the instructions and multi-doses, the presumption for the calculation is lost and a recalculation is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Here, Medicare determined the unit price for Lucentis, taking into account the full contents of a Lucentis vial and the label instructions for administration. Because only 0.5 mg of a 2.0-mg vial should actually be administered under the FDA-approved labeling, the price of the full vial was assigned as the price of a single 0.5-mg dose. Therefore, every time a physician buys a single 2.0-mg vial and administers a single 0.5-mg dose from the vial (disposing of 1.5 mg of the drug), the physician is compensated for the full cost of purchasing the 2.0-mg vial, despite the fact that the doctor administers only 0.5 mg. Indeed, upon discovery of VRC\u2019s actions, First Coast issued an article clarification specifically recalculating the unit price of Lucentis if a physician used a single vial to administer more than one dose. '</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">We also reject VRC\u2019s argument that the Secretary\u2019s decision was arbitrary because the total amount of reimbursement would not have changed whether Medicare reimbursed at the full amount of $2,025 for three doses of a single vial or required that every dose be administered from separate vials. This argument fails to account for Medicare\u2019s lawful policy that reimbursement to providers should reflect more-or-less agtual expense to the physician. <em>See Bowen, </em>488 U.S. at 205, 109 S.Ct. at 470. And since that policy is not arbitrary or capricious, Medicare\u2019s decision to reimburse VRC for only its actual expenditure on Lucentis cannot be arbitrary or capricious, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">\n<em>2. Medical Reasonableness and Necessity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">As an alternative basis for denying reimbursement, the Secretary reasoned that multiple doses of Lucentis from a single vial were medically unreasonable, based on the FDA-approved labeling instructions al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>lowing for only a single dose from a single vial. VRC contends that this decision was arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">a.Medical Distinction between Doses</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">First, VRC argues that it is arbitrary for the Secretary to treat the first dose of Lucentis from a given vial as medically reasonable and the other two doses from the same vial as medically unreasonable. We disagree. The inquiry into whether a drug is medically reasonable and necessary in the Medicare reimbursement context is not limited to an assessment of whether the drug is suited to treat the disease or condition for which it was administered. The inquiry also accounts for whether a drug was administered properly. <em>See </em>Medicare Policy Integrity Manual, Pub. No. 100-08, Ch. 13, \u00a7 13.5.1. Because administering more than one dose of Lucentis from one vial violated the drug\u2019s FDA-approved labeling, the Secretary reasonably could have concluded that multi-dosing was medically inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">b.Local Coverage Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Next, VRC argues that its administration of multi-doses of Lucentis complied with the then-existing conditions for Medicare coverage. First Coast\u2019s 2008 Local Coverage Determination stated that \u201cMedicare will consider [Lucentis] medically reasonable and necessary for patients\u201d with AMD. VRC asserts that nothing in this initial Coverage Determination described the proper process for preparation of injections or prohibited multi-dos-ing. In support, VRC points to the fact that in 2009 First Coast published an \u201cArticle Clarification\u201d specifically reducing payment for multi-dosing, the implication being that until then multi-dosing was acceptable and would be reimbursed at the full rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">We disagree. The 2008 Coverage Determination expressly incorporated the drug\u2019s labeling: \u201cEach vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used.\u201d We cannot say that it was arbitrary or capricious for HHS to read this instruction as a prohibition against administering more than one dose from a single vial, regardless of whether VRC proposes another reasonable interpretation of the labeling. Nor does the Secretary\u2019s issuance of the 2009 \u201cArticle Clarification\u201d undermine the reasonableness of her original interpretation of the labeling. Rather, the Article Clarification is entirely consistent with the Secretary\u2019s original interpretation. We review the Secretary\u2019s decision for arbitrariness, and reading the instruction as prohibiting mul-ti-dosing is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">c.Practice of Multi-Dosing</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">VRC also contends that CMS encourages the practice of multi-dosing from single-use vials and that the practice is widely accepted in the medical community. In support of this position, VRC invokes the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, which states that \u201cCMS encourages physicians, hospitals and other providers to schedule patients in such a way that they can use drugs or biologicals most efficiently, in a clinically appropriate manner.\u201d Pub. No. 100-04, Ch. 17, \u00a7 40 [A162J. In addition, VRC relies on a response to a \u201cFrequently Asked Question\u201d (\u201cFAQ\u201d) that CMS published on its website in March 2011. The question asked whether Medicare would provide coverage \u201cfor a drug from a single dose vial if it is administered to more than one beneficiary[.]\u201d CMS responded that it \u201cencourages physicians ... to care for and administer to patients in such a way that they can use drugs or biologicals most efficiently, in a clinically appropriate manner.... [O]ur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>policies neither encourage or [sic] prohibit the administration of more than one dose from a single dose vial to one or more beneficiaries.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, VRC points to the Secretary\u2019s policy to reimburse physicians for multiple doses from single vials of Botox and Avastin. VRC contends that both of these drugs come in \u201csingle-use\u201d vials, yet Medicare reimburses for multiple doses.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">These arguments lack merit. Both publications on which VRC relies include the important disclaimer that multiple doses are acceptable only if administered \u201cin a clinically appropriate manner.\u201d And the CMS response to the FAQ explains that \u201cclinically appropriate methods\u201d are determined by \u201cnumerous factors, including but not limited to: approved labeling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">VRC\u2019s analogy to Botox and Avastin is misplaced as well. Botox is a vacuum-dried powder that is available in 100-unit vials only. Before administration, the physician must reconstitute all of the powder from the single vial with saline solution. Once reconstituted, the drug must be stored in a refrigerator and used within 24 hours. To prevent physicians from saving the drug for use beyond 24 hours, Botox is labeled \u201cSingle Patient Use.\u201d But the Bo-tox packaging insert instructs, \u201cA new, sterile, needle and syringe should be used to enter the vial on each occasion for removal of Botox.\u201d So the drug\u2019s instructions expressly contemplate multiple doses from a single vial. That, of course, is not the case with Lucentis.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">As for Avastin, it is sold in 100- or 400-mg vials, must be diluted before administration, and should be stored for no more than eight hours. Avastin is FDA-approved only for the treatment of certain forms of cancer; treatment of AMD is an off-label use. Therefore, although the Avastin instructions state that the physician should \u201c[withdraw [the] necessary amount ... [and] [discard any unused portion,\u201d these instructions apply only where the drug is used for the treatment of cancer, in which case a single dose varies between 100 mg and 400 mg. But Medicare has a separate procedure for determining coverage for off-label use, taking into account accepted standards of medical practice for that drug\u2019s off-label use, which often vary from accepted standards for on-label use. <em>See </em>Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Pub. No. 100-02, Ch. 15, \u00a7 50.2. When Avastin is used for the treatment of AMD, a single dose is as small as 1.25 mg. The accepted medical practice is to use multiple doses from a single vial of Avastin when it is being used to treat AMD. In this context, as with Botox, Avastin\u2019s admonition of \u201csingle use\u201d is intended to prevent physicians from using product that has been stored past the acceptable eight-hour timeframe.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Unlike Avastin, Lucentis\u2019s on-label, FDA-approved use is for treating AMD. Its label expressly states that each vial should be used for only the treatment of a single eye and the excess drug should be drawn into the syringe and expelled. VRC administered Lucentis for its on-label use and failed to follow the instructions regarding that use, without any support from an established medical practice that differs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>from the label\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In light of these distinctions between \u2022Lucentis and the other drugs VRC identifies, we cannot conclude that the Secretary\u2019s policy to treat Lucentis differently is arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">B. <em>The Secretary\u2019s Decision was Supported by Substantial Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">VRC argues that the Secretary\u2019s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was not based on substantial evidence. Above we have already discussed much of the basis for VRC\u2019s argument. In addition, VRC raises some additional points.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">First, VRC argues that the Secretary placed undue reliance on Lucentis\u2019s labeling because the Local Coverage Determination is the definitive determination by a Medicare contractor \u201crespecting whether or' not a particular item or service is covered.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(f)(2)(B). Since First Coast\u2019s initial Local Coverage Determination did not incorporate the instruction to discard unused Lucentis as a condition for payment, VRC contends it was not bound to follow the FDA-approved instructions to receive reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">But even assuming that the Local Coverage Determination is the definitive one, the Local Coverage Determination at issue included the instruction that each vial be used for a single eye only. This instruction necessarily implies that excess drug above the 0.5-mg dose should be discarded. In addition, the Local' Coverage Determination need not include all instructions regarding the administration of the drug. The purpose of the Local Coverage Determination is to instruct physicians under what terms they will receive reimbursement. To that end, First Coast described the basic method of administering the drug, describing the amount of a single dose and requiring a new vial for each eye. The additional instructions on the label were not necessary for the description of the terms for reimbursement and do not absolve VRC of its disregard of the instruction to discard remaining amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">In addition to Lucentis\u2019s label, the <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference </em>includes the instruction to discard unused product. Courts have recognized the <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference </em>as evidence of the medical standard for a given drug. <em>See Haught v. Maceluch, </em>681 F.2d 291, 303 (5th Cir.1982) (relying on <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference </em>to establish standard of care in a medical malpractice suit). While the <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference </em>is not conclusive evidence of the standard or accepted practice, the drug\u2019s label instructed that the excess drug should be discarded, the <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference </em>repeated the instruction, and VRC presented no evidence of a contrary accepted medical practice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">C. <em>VRC is Liable for the Overpayment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">Having determined that the Secretary\u2019s legal interpretation withstands judicial scrutiny and was supported by substantial evidence, we next consider VRC\u2019s argument that it is not liable for the overpayment because it acted in good faith when it accepted the payment. In support, VRC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>cites two sections of the Medicare Act: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp and 1395gg. Neither of these sections relieves VRC of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">a. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp(a), Medicare must reimburse a provider if the provider \u201cdid not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that payment would not be made for such items or services.\u201d VRC argues that it could not have reasonably been expected to know at the time that it administered the doses that the Secretary would not reimburse multi-doses of Lucentis.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In support of its argument, VRC once again relies on CMS\u2019s policy to encourage multi-dosing. But CMS does not maintain a general policy to encourage physicians to contravene FDA-approved instructions without evidence to support such a practice. And for the reasons we have previously discussed, VRC could have and should have reasonably known when it administered the doses that it would not be \u201creimbursed\u201d three times for a single vial.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">For the same reasons, we reject VRC\u2019s argument that the Secretary retroactively created policy through the HHS Medicare Appeals Council. Through the initial 2008 Local Coverage Determination issued by First Coast, Medical providers received sufficient notice that multi-dosing would not be covered at the rate of $405 per unit. In short, on this record, VRC could and should have reasonably known when it administered the multiple doses that it would be reimbursed for only the number of vials it actually paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">b. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395gg</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Section 1395gg of the Medicare Act provides that the Secretary may waive re-coupment where the provider was \u201cwithout fault\u201d when it received overpayment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395gg. The CMS Financial Management Manual instructs that a party is \u201cwithout fault\u201d when it \u201cexercised reasonable care in billing for, and accepting the payment.\u201d Pub. No. 100-06, Ch. 3, \u00a7 90. \u201cReasonable care,\u201d in turn, requires that the provider \u201cmade full disclosure of all material facts\u201d and that, \u201c[o]n the basis of information available to it, ... [the provider] had reasonable basis for assuming that the payment was correct, or, if it had reason to question payment; it promptly brought the question to [Medicare\u2019s] attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>VRC argues that HHS should waive its right to recoupment because VRC was without fault when it accepted the payment, and it dealt transparently with Medicare during the audit and review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">We do not agree. VRC did not have a reasonable basis for assuming the payment was correct because its practice of multi-dosing was contrary to the drug\u2019s instructions and was not based on established medical practice. At best, VRC \u201chad.reason to question payment,\u201d in which case it should have brought the question to the attention of First Coast to resolve the issue. VRC dealt transparently with First Coast and SafeGuard <em>after </em>receiving notice of overpayment. Transparency at this stage did not meet the standard of airing the question to the proper authorities before burdening them with an extensive review of VRC\u2019s records. We therefore agree with the Medicare Appeals Council that VRC was not \u201cwithout fault\u201d when it accepted the overpayment, and the Secretary was under no obligation to waive the right to recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-5\">. During 2007-2009 the average sales price of Lucentis fluctuated between approximately $405 and $407. The exact amount is immaterial for the purpose of this opinion,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. VRC\u2019s billed charge was higher than the 106% statutory rate, so the lower rate based on the average sales price was applied in accordance with the Medicare statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-3a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\">. The Appeals Council's decision refined the ALJ's decision in one detail. The ALJ found that VRC's administration of Lucentis was not medically reasonable and necessary. On the other hand, the ALJ calculated the proper payment for all three doses of Lucentis, allowing VRC to charge for all three doses from a single vial, but at a reduced billing rate that reflected a two-thirds decrease in the allowed rate. The Appeals Council held that this was contradictory: If VRC\u2019s administration of Lu-centis was not reasonable, it should not receive reimbursement for more than one dose per vial. The Appeals Council modified the decision accordingly and held that the administration of a single 0.5-mg dose of Lucentis from a single vial was reasonable and should be reimbursed at the full rate of $2,025, while the administration of second and third doses from the same vial was not reasonable because it did not comply with the drug\u2019s label.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">. In the initial overpayment letter from First Coast, HHS stated that \"medical necessity is not an issue in this case\u201d and that the only issue was the overstated expense. VRC attempts to argue that this statement waived the Secretary's subsequent position that multi-dosing was medically unreasonable. We disagree. Even without considering whether the Secretary can permissibly change her reasoning justifying a particular application of a rule in a given case, all that can be surmised from this single line in the letter is that the overpayment determination was not based on concerns that VRC was administering drugs to patients who did not need them. In other words, HHS was conceding that Lucentis is medically reasonable for the treatment of AMD in general. There is nothing in the letter indicating that HHS was condoning the practice of multi-dosing from single vials of Lucentis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b715-13\">. Below, we disagree with the Secretary\u2019s argument on this point and recognize the truth of VRC\u2019s position that the resolution of this case is fiscally neutral to Medicare. <em>See infra </em>Part I.A. However, the point here is that the Secretary did raise the overstated expense issue on appeal and it is appropriate for us to address in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\">. VRC also cites FDA publications permitting repackaging and multi-dosing from single-use vials, arguing that even if it was required to follow the drug's label\u2019s instructions, the FDA itself disregards them. The relevant publications address repackaging in specialized, licensed facilities with a high level of air quality to avoid contamination. <em>See Draft Guidance Mixing, Diluting, Or Repackaging Biological Products Outside The Scope Of An Approved Biologies License Application Guidance For Industry, </em>2015 WL 1735391. They are inapplicable to VRC, which is not a licensed repackaging facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\">, VRC attempts to analogize Lucentis to Ke-nalog as well. This analogy also fails because, unlike Lucentis, Kenalog does not include an instruction to withdraw the entire contents and expel the excess.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\">. VRC raises additional points regarding a letter sent from Lucentis's manufacturer and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards for repackaging that were relied on by the district court as a basis for affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision. We need not reach these points because sufficient grounds exist to affirm the Secretary's decision based on the drug's label and the <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
