After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Herron began experiencing back and neck pain after she was involved in a car accident in June 2000. In January 2001, Herron underwent a cervical discectomy and fusion, but continued to experience chronic pain for which she took high doses of OxyContin. In April 2010, Herron began treatment for chronic pain in her back that radiated to her right leg, and a spine x-ray revealed mild degenerative disc disease and mild facet degenerative joint disease at Herron\u2019s L4-5 and L5-S1 vertebrae.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">In October 2010, Herron filed an application for SSI alleging a disability onset date of September 11, 2010 due to her back pain, neck pain, and depression. In June 2012, Herron and a vocational expert testified at a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Afterward, the ALJ denied Herron\u2019s application. The ALJ found that: (1) Herron had the severe impairments of degenerative disc disease, polyarthralgia (i.e., joint pain), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and benzodiazepine and opiate dependence; (2) Herron could not perform her past relevant work; (3) but Herron had the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform unskilled light work with a sit/stand option. Based on the VE\u2019s testimony, the ALJ further found that there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that Herron could perform, including bench assembler, sorter, and bakery line attendant. Accordingly, the ALJ found that Herron was not disabled. The Appeals Council denied Herron\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>See Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">A. General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the ALJ uses a five-step, sequential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>evaluation process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920(a)(1), (4); 416.905. Using this process, the ALJ considers: (1) whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) if not, whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) if so, whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in the Listing of Impairments; (4) if not, whether the claimant has the RFC to perform her past relevant work; and (5) if not, whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, the claimant can perform other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920(a)(4) &amp; (g), 416.960(c). The claimant bears the burden to prove the first four steps. If the claimant does so, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to prove the fifth step. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">On appeal, Herron raises several related arguments with respect to the ALJ\u2019s determination, at steps four and five, that Herron had the RFC to perform light work with a sit/stand option. Specifically, Herron argues that the ALJ erred by: (1) disregarding objective medical tests and findings that substantiated her subjective complaints of back and neck pain and her treating physician\u2019s testimony about the severity of her orthopedic issues; (2) failing to consider her impairments in combination; (3) fading to accord significant weight to, and improperly discrediting, her treating physician\u2019s opinion that Herron \u201cmay have early signs of ankylosing spon-dylitis\u201d; and (4) partially discrediting Her-ron\u2019s own statements concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In determining at steps four and five whether a claimant can perform her past relevant work or other work, the ALJ must determine the claimant\u2019s RFC by considering all relevant medical and other evidence. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920(e), 416.945(a)(3). The ALJ must explain the weight given to \u201cobviously probative exhibits.\u201d <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981). However, there is no \u201crigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence, so long as the ALJ\u2019s decision..,. is not a broad rejection\u201d that leaves this Court with insufficient information to conclude that the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">In assessing RFC, the ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons for doing so. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). A treating physician\u2019s medical opinion \u201cmust be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2) (stating that the treating physician\u2019s opinion that is well-supported and not inconsistent with other evidence receives \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d). The ALJ must \u201cclearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight\u201d to a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2) (requiring the ALJ to give \u201cgood reasons\u201d for not giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>controlling weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">When the claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony about her pain or other subjective symptoms, a three-part \u201cpain standard\u201d applies. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002); SSR 96-7p, 62 Fed. Reg. 34483 (July 2,1996). The pain standard requires the claimant to show \u201c(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise\u201d to the claimed symptoms. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(a)-(b). If the ALJ determines that the claimant has a medically determinable impairment that could reasonably produce the claimant\u2019s pain or other symptoms, then the ALJ evaluates the extent to which the intensity and persistence of those symptoms limit the claimant\u2019s ability to work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(b)-(c). At this stage, the ALJ considers the claimant\u2019s history, the medical signs and laboratory findings, the claimant\u2019s statements, statements by medical sources, and other evidence of how the pain affects the claimant\u2019s daily activities and ability to work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.929(c). If the ALJ decides to discredit the claimant\u2019s testimony about her symptoms, the ALJ must adequately explain the reason for doing so. <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1561-62 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">B. The ALJ\u2019s RFC Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The ALJ found that Herron had the RFC \u201cto perform light work as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967(b) except the claimant would need a sit/stand option.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In so doing, the ALJ applied the pain standard and found that Herron\u2019s medically determinable impairments \u201ccould reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms,\u201d but that Herron\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> inconsistent with\u201d the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding. The ALJ stated that Herron \u201cestimated that she is able to sit continuously for fifteen minutes, stand ten minutes, and walk fifteen minutes,\u201d that \u201cshe lays down two to three hours\u201d on an average day, and \u201cshe is able to lift no more than ten pounds.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ found that Herron\u2019s \u201callegations of severe pain and functional limitations related to back and neck pain [are] not fully supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The ALJ reviewed Herron\u2019s medical history as to her back and neck pain, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Herron\u2019s \u201ccervical fusion with bone graft and plating in January 2001 ... was successful and she fully recovered despite failure to complete physical therapy\u201d; (2) Herron did not seek further treatment for back and neck pain until April 2010; (3) Herron\u2019s neurologist, Dr. Salah Uddin, performed a physical examination that found \u201ctenderness ... over [Herron\u2019s] SI joints and along the para-spinal muscles from the L4 level to S2,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>and that \u201c[straight leg raises were positive bilaterally at forty-five degrees\u201d; (4) Dr. Uddin diagnosed chronic low back pain with radiation into Herron\u2019s right hip and leg, prescribed medication which Herron reported helped, ordered x-rays that \u201cshowed mild degenerative disc disease at L4-5 and L5-SI with mild facet degenerative joint disease at [those] levels,\u201d and a nerve conduction study that \u201cdid not show radiculopathy and was noted to be normal\u201d; and (5) Herron\u2019s treating physician since June 2010, Dr. Scott Twilley, confirmed objective findings of back, neck and extremities pain with range of motion and diagnosed chronic musculoskeletal pain and degenerative disc disease, and his treatment notes indicated that Herron\u2019s \u201cpain is controlled with medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The ALJ noted Dr. Twilley\u2019s statement in his deposition that Herron \u201cmay have early signs, of ankylosing spondylitis,\u201d but the ALJ rejected this tentative diagnosis because the evidence did not support it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ALJ indicated that Dr. Twilley\u2019s own treatment notes did not contain \u201ca diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, or even a reference to ankylosing spondylitis,\u201d but instead referred only to \u201cdegenerative disc disease\u201d in Herron\u2019s cervical and lumbar spine. The ALJ also pointed to Dr. Ud-din\u2019s x-ray records that showed only mild degenerative disc and joint disease and did not mention ankylosing spondylitis or the vertebrae fusion that \u201cis usually a symptom[ ] of this impairment.\u201d Based \u201con the evidence as a whole,\u201d the ALJ found Her-ron\u2019s testimony about the severity and functional limitations of her back, neck, and leg pain to be only \u201cpartially credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The ALJ further found that Herron\u2019s testimony about her daily activities was \u201csomewhat inconsistent with\u201d Herron\u2019s October 2010 function report, in which she stated that she \u201cprepares quick foods, helps take care of her daughter\u2019s dogs, occasionally watches her granddaughter, does some house work, and normally shops for groceries once a week....\u201d The ALJ also noted that, although Herron testified that she complied with all treatment recommendations, there was no evidence in the record Herron had participated in the disc decompression therapy or trigger point injections recommended by Dr. Ud-din. In sum, the ALJ concluded that Her-ron\u2019s \u201cself-reported limitations [were] not consistent with the medical evidence and she simply allege[d] a greater degree of debilitation than what objective evidence can support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">C. Herron\u2019s Claims on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">After review, we conclude that the ALJ properly applied the pain standard by finding that Herron had \u201cmedically determinable impairments\u201d that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms.\u201d The ALJ then properly evaluated the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of Herron\u2019s symptoms and did not err in concluding that Herron had the RFC to perform light work with a sit/ stand option and that Herron\u2019s statements concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects were \u201cnot credible to the extent they were inconsistent with\u201d that RFC assessment. The ALJ also showed good cause for rejecting Dr. Twilley\u2019s testimony that Herron \u201cmay\u201d be showing early signs of ankylosing spondylitis when the ALJ explained that Dr. Twilley\u2019s tentative diagnosis was not supported by either his own medical records or other medical evidence in the record. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41; <em>see also Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (concluding ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit treating physician\u2019s opinion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>supported by substantial evidence where the physician\u2019s opinion was not supported by his own treatment notes). In addition, the ALJ adequately explained his reasons for partially discrediting Herron\u2019s testimony about the limiting effects of her back and neck pain, namely that her testimony was not fully supported by the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting Dr. Twilley\u2019s tentative diagnosis and partially discrediting Herron are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Herron\u2019s medical records indicate that she suffered from mild degenerative disk and joint disease, that she had range of motion with pain, but that her pain was effectively controlled with medication. Although Dr. Uddin\u2019s treatment recommendations included trigger point injections for tenderness and disc decompression therapy for long-term pain control, there is no evidence Herron ever pursued either of these additional therapies. Dr. Twilley\u2019s treatment notes, including notes of his June 2010 x-rays of Herron\u2019s spine, contain no mention of ankylosing spondylitis or spinal fusion unrelated to Herron\u2019s 2001 surgery. Instead, Dr. Twilley\u2019s x-ray notes are consistent with Dr. Uddin\u2019s April 2010 x-ray results, finding degenerative disc disease, bone spurs, some loss of the natural cervical lordosis curve, and some narrowing of disc layers, but no \u201cobvious acute findings.\u201d Further, a November 2010 physical RFC assessment based on Dr. Uddin\u2019s treatment records concluded that Herron could: occasionally lift or carry up to 20 pounds, frequently lift or carry up to 10 pounds, stand or walk about six hours in an eight-hour workday, sit about six hours an eight-hour workday, and could push or pull in an unlimited manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Herron also argues that the ALJ failed to consider her impairments in combination. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.923 (providing that ALJ will consider the combined effect of the claimant\u2019s impairments throughout the disability determination). This claim is without merit given that the ALJ found, at step three, that Herron did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met a listed impairment. <em>See Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir.1991) (explaining that the ALJ\u2019s statement that the claimant did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met a listed impairment \u201cevidences consideration of the combined effect of [the claimant\u2019s] impairments\u201d). Furthermore the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment, at steps four and five, demonstrates that he considered the combined effect of Her-ron\u2019s impairments, as the RFC accounted for Herron\u2019s physical and mental impairments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Contrary to Herron\u2019s argument, the ALJ also did not disregard objective medical evidence. In assessing RFC, the ALJ considered the entirety of the medical record, including the treatment records of both Dr. Uddin and Dr. Twilley, to which the ALJ assigned \u201csignificant weight.\u201d The ALJ specifically mentioned several objective tests, such as Dr. Uddin\u2019s April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>2010 x-rays and nerve conduction studies, and the clinical findings from Dr. Uddin\u2019s physical examination, including tender points and a straight leg raise test. Dr. Twilley\u2019s testimony and treatment notes about his June 2010 x-rays are consistent with Dr. Uddin\u2019s x-ray results. Dr. Twil-ley\u2019s nerve conduction studies, like those of Dr. Uddin, were normal. The ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment was not required to account for every piece of evidence. <em>See Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">Herron points to Dr. Twilley\u2019s testimony that Herron tested positive for HLA-B27, a protein found in the blood of people with ankylosing spondylitis. However, the Mayo Clinic, the source Herron cites for information about ankylosing spondylitis, states that there is no specific lab test to identify ankylosing spondylitis, the presence of HLA-B27 does not mean a person suffers from ankylosing \u25a0 spondylitis, and \u201cmost people who have the [HLA-B27] gene don\u2019t have ankylosing spondylitis.\u201d <em>See </em>Diseases and Conditions, Ankylosing Spondylitis, <em>http://www. mayoclinic. org/ diseases-conditions/ ankylosing-spondyli-tis/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20019766 </em>(last visited March 18, 2016). In other words, Herron\u2019s positive HLA-B27 test did not establish that she suffered from ankylosing spondylitis. Given that Dr. Twilley\u2019s own treatment notes did not include a diagnosis (or even a mention) of ankylosing spondylitis after Herron tested positive for HLA-B27, we do not think the ALJ\u2019s failure to explicitly address this piece of evidence is reversible error. <em>See Cowart, </em>662 F.2d at 735 (requiring the ALJ to explain the weight given to only \u201cobviously probative exhibits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decisions to reject Dr. Twilley\u2019s ankylosing spondylitis diagnosis and partially discredit Herron\u2019s testimony about the limiting effects of her pain. Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ s determination that despite her physical impairments, Herron retained the RFC to perform light work with a sit/stand option. For all these reasons, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s denial of Herron\u2019s application for SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles underlying the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, but review \u201cthe resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). \"Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-5\">. A claimant's RFC is a medical assessment of what she can do in a work setting despite any mental, physical, or environmental limitations caused by her impairments and related symptoms. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(a). With respect to physical limitations, the ALJ assesses the claimant's ability to do things like sit, stand, walk, lift, carry, push or pull. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.945(b). Light work, as defined in the regulations, involves lifting no more than twenty pounds at a time, with frequent lifting and carrying of objects weighing up to ten pounds and a good deal of walking, standing or sitting and manipulating of arm and leg controls. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.967(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-10\">.

To the extent Herron contends the ALJ should have considered the limiting effects of ankylosing spondylosis, the ALJ rejected Dr. Twilley\u2019s tentative diagnosis. In any event, there was no evidence in the record that Herron was experiencing any limiting effects from ankylosing spondylosis that were distinct from the symptoms of her degenerative disc and joint disease. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1213 n. 6 (\"[T]he mere existence of ... impairments does not reveal the extent to which they limit [the claimant's] ability to work or undermine the ALJ\u2019s determination in that regard.\"). Dr. Twilley's conclusory testimony that ankylosing spondylosis \"is 100% disabling\u201d was not entitled to any significant weight as it was not a \"medical opinion\u201d and addressed an issue reserved to the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
