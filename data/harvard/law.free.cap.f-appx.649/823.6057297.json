Evans challenges the three-level enhancement of his sentence for targeting a government officer or employee. United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3A1.2 (Nov. 2014). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">As a condition of his state sentence of probation, Evans was required to complete drug treatment at the Savannah Day Reporting Center. The Center is an outpatient substance abuse treatment facility operated primarily by probation officers employed by the Georgia Department of Corrections. The Center is housed in the Southern Oaks Professional Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-20\">On December 1, 2014, Evans called 911 and reported having \u201cvaluable information that the Southern Oaks Professional Building is going to be attacked between the days of 1 and 14, I don\u2019t know what day, but this is very certain.\u201d On December 22, 2014, Evans called 911 and stated, \u201cEverybody at the Savannah Day Reporting Center will be killed today. If you think New York was bad, wait until you see this.\u201d Evans visited the Center on January 12, 2015, and left an object in the men\u2019s restroom that appeared to be an improvised-explosive device, but the object did not contain any explosives. Attached to the device was a letter stating, \u201cGo boom pigs, shut this place down until after black history month or next one will be real, count on it niggers ... Grand Dragon.\u201d Later, Evans admitted to making the first call and planting the fake explosive device to avoid taking a urinalysis, which would have revealed that he had violated a term of his probation by using cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-21\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Evans\u2019s sentence for targeting a government officer or employee. A defendant is subject to a three-level increase in his base offense level if his \u201cvictim was a government officer or employee ... and the offense of conviction was \u2018motivated by such status.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.2(a). The district court was entitled to find that Evans\u2019s victims \u2014 whom he described as being \u201cEverybody at the Savannah Day Reporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Center\u201d and the \u201cpigs ... [in] this place\u201d \u2014 were the probation officers and other government employees who were responsible for administering and reporting the results of the drug tests that Evans sought to avoid. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>961 F.2d 180, 182 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Bennett, </em>368 F.3d 1343, 1358 (11th Cir.2004) (concluding that offense motivated by status of government officer when he and other officers announced their presence before executing warrant), <em>cert. granted, vacated, and remanded on other ground, </em>543 U.S. 1110, 125 S.Ct. 1044, 160 L.Ed.2d 1041 (2005), <em>opinion reinstated, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 657 (11th Cir.2005). Evans failed to object to, and is deemed to have admitted, the facts in his presentenee investigation report that his victims included the employees of the Center, <em>see United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006), and he conceded at sentencing \u201cthat the individuals inside the Savannah Day Reporting Center ... would be technical victims.\u201d Because Evans issued the threats to prevent everyone in the Center from performing their roles in the probation program, the district court reasonably determined that his conduct was motivated by the officers\u2019 and employees\u2019 positions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2 cmt. n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We AFFIRM Evans\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
