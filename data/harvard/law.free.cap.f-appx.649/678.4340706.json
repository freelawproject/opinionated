No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal under section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim, viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Id. </em>at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Under section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), the district court is authorized to dismiss a case filed by a prisoner proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>\u201cat <em>any </em>time if the court determines that ... the action or appeal fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Briefly stated, Roberts complains that Katz misrepresented or withheld material facts during a post-conviction proceeding. Roberts contends that Katz\u2019s conduct (1) rendered his guilty plea involuntary and .(2) caused him to serve a sentence in excess of the maximum possible sentence for his offense of conviction. As relief, Roberts seeks monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">\u201c[W]hen a state prisoner seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). If so, \u201cthe complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">Although Roberts\u2019s section 1983 complaint seeks only monetary damages, a judgment in Roberts\u2019s favor would imply necessarily that his underlying conviction and sentence were invalid. Because Roberts has failed to demonstrate that his conviction and sentence have already been invalidated, the district court dismissed properly Roberts\u2019s claim as not cognizable under section 1983. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">We reject Roberts\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s dismissal constituted a violation of Roberts\u2019s Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. <em>See </em>Garvie <em>v. City of Fort Walton Beach, </em>366 F.3d 1186, 1190 (11th Cir.2004) (no Seventh Amendment violation when the court grants summary judgment based on a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
