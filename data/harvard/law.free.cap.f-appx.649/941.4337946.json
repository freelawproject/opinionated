Moore challenges the administrative law judge\u2019s decisions to discount the opinion of her treating physician and a chiropractor while relying on the opinions of a psychologist and a physician who examined her and to discredit her testimony that her impairments were disabling. Moore also argues that the administrative law judge failed to consider the combination of her impairments when determining if she was disabled or to evaluate all of the evidence of record when assessing her residual functional capacity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s decision to discount the opinion given by Moore\u2019s treating physician, Dr. John Bivona, in July 2013 that Moore was disabled due to degenerative disc disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Dr. Bivona\u2019s assessment of Moore\u2019s back conflicted with his treatment notes in February, May, August, and November of 2012 and in May 2013 that Moore\u2019s back pain had decreased and her functioning had increased from complying with her medication regimen. <em>See Phillips v. </em>Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). And the doctor\u2019s portrayal of Moore\u2019s pulmonary disease was inconsistent with treatment notes reflecting that in August 2011 her lungs were clear and she did not have any rhon-chi, wheezes, or rales and that in February and August 2012 she did not exhibit any clubbing or cyanosis. Dr. Bivona failed to reference any objective medical evidence to support his residual functional capacity assessment that Moore was required during an eight-hour workday to sit for three to four hours, to stand no more than one hour, and to lay down for two to three hours. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004). When asked during a sworn statement if Moore\u2019s finances prevented her from undergoing additional tests, Dr. Bivona responded that Moore had \u201cnot recently\u201d been tested \u201csince back in 2006[ ] [she] had x-rays that note degenerative changes\u201d and he could \u201conly expect it [to] get worse with time,\u201d but that prognosis conflicted with magnetic resonance imaging tests and x-rays taken in February 2006 and August 2013 that showed minimal to mild degenerative changes in Moore\u2019s back. In addition, Dr. Bivona\u2019s opinion about the severity of Moore\u2019s limitations conflicted with the findings of a psychologist, Dr. James Lindsey, and of a physician, Dr. Johnathan Ledet, who examined Moore, respectively, in November and October of 2012. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1160. Dr. Lindsey reported that Moore walked with a normal gait without assistance and rose from sitting position without obvious difficulty. Similarly, Dr. Ledet reported that Moore could climb on and off the examination table, stand from a sitting position, dress and undress without difficulty, walk on her heels and toes, and rise from a squatted position without difficulty. Dr. Ledet also reported that Moore\u2019s lungs were clear and she did not have any edema, cyanosis, clubbing, or swelling. The administrative law judge had good cause to discount Dr. Bivona\u2019s opinion that Moore\u2019s impairments were disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Substantial evidence also supports the administrative law judge\u2019s decision to discount the opinion of Renee Bowen, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>chiropractor, that Moore\u2019s degenerative disc disease diminished her ability to work. Bowen\u2019s opinion was not entitled to great weight because she examined Moore once in August 2013 for the purpose of completing a functional capacity assessment form. <em>See id. </em>And Bowen\u2019s opinion that Moore had to lie down for two hours a day was inconsistent with x-rays Bowen had ordered that showed only mild degeneration in Moore\u2019s spine. <em>See id. </em>at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The administrative law judge was entitled to discredit Moore\u2019s testimony about the limiting effects of her impairments. Consistent with the three-part test used to assess credibility, the administrative law judge found that \u201cthe medical evidence established] that [Moore] [had] been treated for a variety of symptoms associated with [her] alleged impairments,\u201d but \u201cthe objective medical evidence [had] not validated] the asserted severity of [her] impairments and work related limitations\u201d and that \u201clack of substantiating evidence detract[ed] from [her] credibility.\u201d <em>See Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). Moore\u2019s testimony that she could not walk or stand for any length of time or perform most daily activities conflicted with her statements to Dr. Ledet that she could sit without difficulty, stand for 30-minute increments, and walk for 15-minute periods and that she could cook, clean dishes, shop in short intervals, and climb stairs. And Moore\u2019s testimony that she could not work because of back and shoulder pain and her pulmonary disease was irreconcilable with Dr. Bivona\u2019s treatment notes about Moore\u2019s decreased pain in and increased functioning of her back; Dr. Ledet\u2019s findings that Moore retained a normal range of motion in her extremities; and both doctors\u2019 reports that Moore did not present with any symptoms of pulmonary disease. That record supports the finding that Dr. Bivona remedied Moore\u2019s impairments with conservative treatment. <em>See Wolfe v. Chater, </em>86 F.3d 1072, 1078 (11th Cir.1996). The administrative law judge was entitled also to discredit Moore\u2019s assertion she could not afford additional testing as being inconsistent with her testimony about using discretionary funds to purchase cigarettes and with her doctors\u2019 treatment notes that reflect she declined to undergo tests. Moore also testified she was unable to work because of anxiety and depression, yet she did not report her mental impairments to Dr. Bivona. Both .Dr. Lindsey and Dr. Lee Blackmon, a consultant for the Administration, found that Moore suffered a \u201cmild impairment\u201d from her psychiatric conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">The administrative law judge considered the combination of Moore\u2019s impairments in determining whether she was disabled. In her decision, the administrative law judge stated that Moore did \u201cnot have an impairment or combination or impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments.\u201d Although the administrative law judge did not mention Moore\u2019s anxiety and depression when discussing the listing of impairments, those conditions did not warrant analysis because they did \u201cnot cause more than minimal limitation in [Moore\u2019s] ability to perform basic mental work activities.\u201d The administrative law judge also \u201ccareful[ly] considered ... the entire record,\u201d which included \u201call symptoms and the extent to which these symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence,\u201d when assessing Moore\u2019s residual functional capacity. The administrative law judge took into account Moore\u2019s complaints about, symptoms of, and treatment record for degenerative disc disease, pain in her back and shoulder, pulmonary disease, and mental impairments. The writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>ten decision \u201cevidenced] that [the administrative law judge] considered the combined effects of [Moore\u2019s] impairments.\u201d <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Moore has the residual functional capacity to perform some light work. The administrative law judge accounted for Moore\u2019s severe impairments of degenerative disc disease and pulmonary disease that were supported by objective medical evidence and treated her testimony about her symptoms and functional limitations as \u201cpartially credible.\u201d Based on that evidence, the administrative law judge rejected Dr. Blackmon\u2019s opinion that Moore could perform medium work and determined that Moore could perform only light work during which she could move from sitting to standing for one to two minutes an hour. In the light of the substantial evidence in the record and the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that a hypothetical individual with Moore\u2019s education, training, and limitations could perform work as a photocopy operator or packager, the administrative law judge had the necessary information to determine Moore\u2019s residual functional capacity and her ability to work. Moore argues that the administrative law judge \u201csubstituted [her] opinion for\u201d that provided by Dr. Bivona, but the task of determining a claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity and ability to work rests with the administrative law judge, not a doctor. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1546(c) (\u201cIf your case is at -the administrative law judge hearing level ..., the administrative law judge ... is responsible for assessing your residual functional capacity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">We AFFIRM the denial of Moore\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
