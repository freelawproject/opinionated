On appeal, Hall argues that the district court judge committed \u201cfraud on the court\u201d and was partial, such that she should have <em>sua sponte </em>recused herself from the case. He further argues that the district court\u2019s order contained several procedural errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">\u201c[T]he law is by now well settled in this Circuit that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). Additionally, arguments raised for the first time on appeal, that were not presented in the district court, are deemed waived. <em>Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1994). However, we have identified five exceptions to the general rule that we will not consider an argument made for the first time on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1526-27. These exceptions include: (1) whether the issue involves a pure'question of law, and refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice; (2) whether the appellant raises an objection to an order that he had no opportunity to raise at the district court level; (3) whether the interest of substantial justice is at stake; (4) whether the proper resolution is beyond any doubt; and (5) where the issue presents significant questions of general impact or of great public concern. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">To the extent that Hall seeks to raise a claim of error, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) for \u201cfraud on the court,\u201d such a claim is waived by Hall\u2019s failure to raise this issue before the district court. <em>See Narey, </em>32 F.3d at 1526-27. Hall does not allege that any of the exceptions to this rule apply, and none are evident. <em>See id. </em>Additionally, because Hall fails to argue that the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims \u2014 lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted\u2014 were erroneous, any such arguments are abandoned on appeal. <em>See Access Now, </em>385 F.3d at 1330. Thus, the remaining issues concern the judge\u2019s recusal and the procedural defects that Hall alleges in the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Generally, we review a district court judge\u2019s refusal to recuse herself for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Walker, </em>532 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2008). However, when a plaintiff fails to argue for a judge\u2019s recusal before the district court, we review the failure of a district court judge to <em>sua sponte </em>recuse herself for plain error. <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983). Thus, we will only correct an error that the plaintiff failed to raise in the district court if: (1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number><em>States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir.2004) (applying the plain error standard to a claim of failure to recuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">A judge is to recuse \u201ch[erself] in any proceeding in which h[er] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). The standard for recusal under \u00a7 455(a) is \u201cwhether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2003). In general, \u201cbias sufficient to disqualify a judge must stem from extrajudicial sources\u201d unless a \u201cjudge\u2019s remarks in a judicial context demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it constitutes bias against a party.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Tenneco Packaging Co., Inc. </em>293 F.3d 1306, 1329 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). The Supreme Court has held that \u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">As to Hall\u2019s claim that Judge Leigh Martin May should have recused herself, since Hall failed to raise this issue before the district court, we review the district court judge\u2019s failure to recuse herself <em>sua sponte </em>for plain error only. <em>See Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651. Hall\u2019s underlying contention appears to be that Judge May\u2019s bias is evident from her adverse ruling against him; however, such an adverse ruling is insufficient to raise an issue of bias. <em>See Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157. Additionally, although Hall asserts that Judge May omitted and misrepresented several \u201cmaterial facts,\u201d his only two examples of such \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d fail to identify any relevant mischaracterizations. Finally, Hall\u2019s contention that Judge May had various connections to State of Georgia officials and the .City of Albany is insufficient to create a \u201csignificant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>See Patti, </em>337 F.3d at 1321. Thus, Judge May did not plainly err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>recuse herself from hearing Hall\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Hall alleges three procedural defects with the district court\u2019s order: (1) the court failed to address Count 18 of the complaint, alleging negligent training against the City of Albany, (2) the court did not specify what capacity of defendant Lance Montgerard was dismissed, and (3) a notice of certificate to withdraw as defendant Robert Pinnero\u2019s counsel was neither granted nor denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">We may affirm a decision of the district court on any ground supported by the record. <em>Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>480 F.3d 1072, 1088 n. 21 (11th Cir.2007). Additionally, we may affirm the district court\u2019s decision for reasons different than those stated by the district court. <em>Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1433 n. 9 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Northern District of Georgia Local Rule 83.1 E(2)(d), dealing with attorney withdrawals, allows counsel to withdraw from a civil action (except class actions) without filing a motion to withdraw, \u201cby filing a Certificate of Consent with the court that has been signed by the client, the withdrawing attorney, and the substituting attorney, if one has been selected by the client.\u201d N.D. Ga. Local R. 83.1 E(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Generally, government entities \u201cmay not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.\u201d <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). A government entity \u201cmay be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only for acts for which the [entity] itself is actually respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>sible, that is acts which the [entity] has officially sanction or ordered.\u201d <em>City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, </em>485 U.S. 112, 123, 108 S.Ct. 915, 924, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988) (quotation omitted). Thus, to establish a government entity\u2019s liability under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege that his constitutional injury was the result of either (1) an officially promulgated policy, or (2) an unofficial custom or practice. <em>See Grech v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., </em>335 F.3d 1326, 1329 (11th Cir.2003). To establish liability through unofficial custom, the plaintiff must identify \u201ca persistent and widespread practice\u201d of constitutional deprivations. De<em>pew v. City of St. Marys, Ga., </em>787 F.2d 1496, 1499 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Initially, as to Hall\u2019s claim that the district court failed to resolve his claims against Montgerard in his individual capacity, although the district court did not explicitly state that it was addressing Montgerard\u2019s individual capacity, it found that all of Hall\u2019s claims against Montger-ard were without merit. Thus, the district court clearly resolved these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Additionally, as to Hall\u2019s claim that the district court failed to rule on an attorney\u2019s certificate to withdraw from the case, local rules make clear that an attorney may file a motion to withdraw, which the court must address, or in the alternative, file a certificate to withdraw with the client\u2019s consent. <em>See </em>N.D. Ga. Local R. 83.1 E(2)(d). In this case, the counsel attempting to withdraw filed a certificate of consent to withdraw, as opposed to a motion; therefore, the district court was not required to make any ruling on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">Finally, although the district court addressed the \u00a7 1983 negligent training claim against other defendants, i.e., the Georgia Department of Public Safety and Dougherty County, when discussing the \u00a7 1983 claims against the City of Albany, the court referenced only negligent supervision and negligent retention claims. Despite the district court\u2019s failure to address the negligent training claim against the City of Albany, we, nevertheless, affirm on other grounds. <em>See Bircoll, </em>480 F.3d at 1088 n. 21; <em>Turlington, </em>135 F.3d at 1433 n. 9. As the district court noted, Hall\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the City of Albany were based on the actions of employees, including Helen Williams, Nathan Davis, and Judge Willie Weaver, which requires a showing that Hall suffered a constitutional injury as a result of the government entity\u2019s (1) official policy or (2) unofficial custom. <em>See Grech, </em>335 F.3d at 1329. In his complaint, Hall failed to allege any official policy or unofficial custom of the City of Albany that resulted in a constitutional deprivation. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
