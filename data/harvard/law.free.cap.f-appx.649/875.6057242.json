A court can reduce a sentence if it was based on a sentencing range that has since been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, so long as the reduction \u201cis consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Jones\u2019s motion is based on Amendment 782, which the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on sentence reductions says applies retroactively. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). However, that statement also says a reduction \u201cis not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized\u201d if Amendment 782 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">Amendment 782 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering\u201d Jones\u2019s guideline range. Jones\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSI) calculated a base offense level of 26 based on USSG \u00a7 2D1.1. After Amendment 782, Jones\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 would be 24. Jones wasn\u2019t sentenced based on \u00a7 2D1.1 though. Rather, he was sentenced using USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 (the career offender guideline). The PSI calculated Jones\u2019s offense level at 34 based on \u00a7 4B1.1, lowered to 31 because Jones accepted responsibility for his crime. Jones didn\u2019t object to any of the facts in the PSI or to his career offender status, so the court sentenced him at offense level of 31. A failure to object to facts in the PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 843 (11th Cir.2009). Though Amendment 782 would reduce Jones\u2019s base offense level under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, his offense level would still be 31 because of USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. This means Amendment 782 wouldn\u2019t lower his sentence, so the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) bars a reduction. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (holding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) bars a sentence reduction when defendants \u201cwere assigned a base offense level under\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 but were then \u201cultimately assigned a [higher] total offense level and guideline range\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">Jones claims that his plea agreement said the government wouldn\u2019t argue for career-offender status, so this status shouldn\u2019t be assumed in deciding his \u00a7 3582 motion. But Jones\u2019s plea agreement never mentions the career offender guideline. All the plea agreement said on this topic is that the government would ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>for a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. This doesn\u2019t change the fact that Amendment 782 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d here. USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The district court correctly denied Jones\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
