(\u201cProtective Life\u201d), in her employment discrimination suit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, the Alabama Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cAADEA\u201d), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VH\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Kohser argues that the district court erred by: (1) denying her motion to reopen discovery; (2) failing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation to grant summary judgment; and (3) granting summary judgment in favor of Protective based on the fact that she failed to show evidence that Protective\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for demoting and terminating her were pretexts for age or sex discrimination. For ease of reference, we will address each point in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance of a summary judgment motion in order to conduct discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Burks v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>212 F.3d 1333, 1336 (11th Cir.2000). \u201c[A] ... court\u2019s decision to hold litigants to the clear terms of its scheduling orders is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir.2011);</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Rule 56(d) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">[i]f a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, [she] cannot present facts essential to justify [her] opposition [to a summary judgment motion], the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-12\">(1) defer considering the motion or deny it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-13\">(2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations to take discovery; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\">(3) issue any other appropriate order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8_\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d). Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-15\">[a] party requesting a continuance under [Rule 56(d)] must present an affidavit containing specific facts explaining [her] failure to respond to the adverse party\u2019s motion for summary judgment via counter affidavits establishing genuine issues of material fact for trial. The nonmov-ant may not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified, facts, but must show the court how the stay will operate to permit [her] to rebut, through discovery, the movant\u2019s contentions. The grant or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-16\"><em>Barfield v. Brierton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 931 (11th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). Additionally, where a nonmovant had ample time and opportunity to complete discovery, but failed to diligently pursue her options, a motion for additional discovery should be denied. <em>Id. </em>at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">The district court did not err in denying Kohser\u2019s motion for additional time to complete discovery because she was not diligent in completing her discovery. Koh-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>ser was aware that her discovery was in* complete, but failed to take any action with the court until seven weeks after the discovery period closed. Thus, the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for additional time was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">A district court\u2019s treatment of a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Stephens v. Tolbert, </em>471 F.3d 1173, 1175 (11th Cir.2006),</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The district court must make a <em>de novo </em>determination of those portions of a magistrate judge\u2019s report arid recommendation to which an objection is made. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b). However, where a litigant fails to offer specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s factual findings, there is no requirement of <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Garvey v. Vaughn, </em>993 F.2d 776, 779 &amp; n. 9 (11th Cir.1993). A specific objection must \u201cidentify the portions of the proposed findings and recommendation to which objection is made and the specific basis for objection.\u201d <em>Heath v. Jones, </em>863 F.2d 815, 822 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The district court did not err in its treatment of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation because Kohser\u2019s statement of facts in her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report made an ineffectual generalized objection, and the district court correctly reviewed her specific objections <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, viewing all of the facts in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id.; see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Evidence that is merely colorable, or not significantly probative of a disputed fact, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, </em>683 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Title VII prohibits certain 'employers from \u201cdischarging] any individual, or otherwise ... discriminating] against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). When a plaintiff offers circumstantial evidence to prove a Title VII claim, we generally use the analytical framework established by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1331 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, to prove a claim for discriminatory termination and replacement, a plaintiff may \u201cshow (1) that [she] was a member of a protected class, (2) that [she] was qualified for the position, (3) that [she] was fired, and (4) that [she] was replaced by one outside the protected class.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., </em>883 F.2d 977, 982 (11th Cir.1989). Under that framework, where a plaintiff-employee establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, and the defendant articulates a legitimate reason for its employment action, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to offer evidence that the reason is pretextual. <em>See Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1087-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">Likewise, the ADEA makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer\u201d to \u201cotherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). The ADEA applies to individuals who are at least 40 years of age. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 631(a). To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for an ANEA violation, the plaintiff may show that she (1) was a member of the protected age group, (2) was subject to adverse employment action, (3) was qualified to do the job, and (4) was replaced by a substantially younger individual. <em>See Kragor v. Takeda Pharms. Am., Inc., </em>702 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">A plaintiff can show pretext by demonstrating \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\u201d in the proffered reason for the employment action so that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence. <em>Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Group, Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1348 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cHowever, a reason cannot be proved to be a \u2018pretext <em>for discrimination\u2019 </em>unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, it is not enough to <em>\u201cdis </em>believe the employer; the factfinder must <em>believe </em>the plaintiffs explanation of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519, 113 S.Ct. at 2754 (emphasis in original). Moreover, \u201c[w]e are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, our sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivate[d] a challenged employment decision.\u201d <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">However, we have also held that the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>\u201cis not, and was never intended to be, the <em>sine qua non </em>for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion in an employment discrimination case.\u201d <em>Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2011). Rather, a triable issue of fact may also exist \u201cif the record, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, presents a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The circumstantial evidence must raise a \u201creasonable inference\u201d that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Protective Life. The record here showed that Protective Life fired Kohser after her subordinates submitted numerous complaints about her management style and her subsequent display of detached behavior. Kohser did not provide before the district court any probative evidence that Protective\u2019s reasons for demoting and terminating her were pretextual. Because Kohser presented no evidence showing that Protective Life was actually motivated by a discriminatory animus, the district court correctly concluded that no genuine dispute of material fact existed as to Koh-ser\u2019s age and sex discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\">. Kohser also alleged race discrimination, sex discrimination in violation of the Equal Pay Act (\u201cEPA\u201d), common-law negligence in failing to discipline, train or terminate employees that retaliated, discriminated, harassed, and conspired against her, and conversion of personal property, Kohser did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to grant summary judgment as to the race discrimination, sex discrimination based on the EPA, and conversion allegations, and has not articulated any argument regarding those issues on appeal, abandoning those claims. <em>Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown, &amp; Root Serv., Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1271, 1293 (11th Cir.2009). The district court granted summary judgment on her negligence claim, and Kohser has not articulated an argument regarding that claim on appeal, either. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
