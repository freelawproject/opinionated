The BIA ruled that Santiago-Jimenez was not eligible for withholding of removal because his fear of being harmed by gangs in Mexico was not based on his \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Santiago-Jimenez argued that these gangs would target him on the basis of his being a hard-working person and a freshly returned expatriate. Because Santiago-Jimenez has not proved that either of these characteristics count as \u201cmembership in a particular social group,\u201d we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">Santiago-Jimenez is a citizen of Mexico. On August 14, 2012, the Department of Homeland Security charged that Santiago-Jimenez entered the United States without inspection in 2006. Santiago-Jimenez conceded he was removable for that reason but applied for withholding of removal, as well as, for relief based on the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). His application alleged that gang members in Mexico had threatened to kill him if he did not join them.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">At a hearing before an immigration judge, Santiago-Jimenez elaborated on the extreme violence carried out by these gangs. He explained that he came to the United States to \u201crun[] away\u201d from the gangs. He admitted that no gang members ever threatened him or his family directly, though gangs targeted his neighbors. The gangs \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand it\u201d that his neighbors were working people, so gang members \u201cwould come to their home at night and rob them,\u201d killing \u201cwhoever put up resistance.\u201d Santiago-Jimenez named two neighbors who were killed this way. He also testified that the gangs targeted people who returned to Mexico from the United States because the gangs thought they had money.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">The immigration judge denied Santiago-Jimenez\u2019s application. She concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Santiago-Jimenez\u2019s fear, while \u201ccertainly understandable,\u201d was based on \u201cthe general violence and strife in his country.\u201d She explained that this was not a fear based on that Santiago-Jimenez\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. She also found that Santiago-Jimenez was not entitled to CAT relief because he \u201cdid not testify that he feared the government of Mexico\u201d and because he presented no evidence to establish that the government would target him for torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The BIA affirmed that decision. The BIA ruled that Santiago-Jimenez had not shown that either hard-working people or people returning from the United States were \u201ca cognizable particular social group within Mexican society.\u201d The BIA also ruled that Santiago-Jimenez\u2019s argument that the gangs specifically targeted these groups was not supported by evidence showing that this was the \u201cmotivation of the gang members.\u201d Instead, the BIA said, the \u201cgangs have directed harm against anyone and everyone in furtherance of their criminal enterprises conducted for their own pecuniary gain.\u201d The BIA ordered Santiago-Jimenez removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that \u201cthe Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Congress has not defined what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d But this Court has said that the term \u201crefers to persons who share a common, immutable characteristic \u2018that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodriguez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1310 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006)). To meet the statute\u2019s definition, a group also needs \u201csocial visibility,\u201d meaning the group\u2019s characteristics must be \u201chighly visible and recognizable by others in the country.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1194 (quotation omitted). Beyond that, a group can\u2019t be \u201ctoo numerous or inchoate,\u201d and it shouldn\u2019t be defined so broadly that it is \u201ca catch-all for all groups who might claim persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\"><em>Castillo-Arias </em>upheld the BIA\u2019s determination that a group defined as \u201cnoncriminal informants\u201d working against a drug cartel in Colombia was not \u201cparticular\u201d enough, in part because there was \u201cno evidence that the cartel would treat [these informants] any differently from any other person the cartel perceived to have interfered with its activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198. Also, \u201cvirtually the entire population of Colombia is a potential subject of persecution by the cartel,\u201d and \u201crisk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, <em>Rodriguez </em>upheld the BIA\u2019s determination that \u201cmembers of a family targeted by a drug-trafficking organization\u201d were not a particular enough social group because \u201cthe defining attribute of\u2019 this group \u201cis its persecution\u201d by criminals. 735 F.3d at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">When the BIA decides that someone is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal, we review that decision under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Seck v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir.2011). For findings of fact, this test re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>quires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). For legal questions (such as whether a particular group is covered by the language of the INA), our review is <em>de novo. See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision here. First, the record does not establish that criminal gangs in Mexico specifically target either hard-working people or expatriates returning from the United States. The documentary evidence in the record instead shows that the gangs choose their victims based on wealth and vulnerability, and that gang violence is motivated primarily by a desire to maintain power and impunity. Second, Santiago-Jimenez presented no evidence that either people returning from the United States or hard-working people who are making economic progress are distinct enough to be \u201chighly visible and recognizable by others\u201d in Mexican society. <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1194. Also, the latter group is defined with characteristics that are neither \u201cimmutable\u201d nor \u201cfundamental to its members\u2019 individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
