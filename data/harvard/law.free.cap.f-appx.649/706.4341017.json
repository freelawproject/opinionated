Following a jury trial, Sobolewski was convicted of being an unlawful user of a controlled substance in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(3) and 924(a)(2). On appeal, Sobolewski argues that the district court erred in rejecting his claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to introduce at trial certain evidence suggesting that he was not \u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AUc4\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">On February 6, 2013, Zachary Nichols, a law enforcement officer with the United States Forest Service (\u201cUSFS\u201d), pulled over Sobolewski\u2019s truck in Ocala National Forest after observing that the driver, So-bolewski, and his passenger, Charlie McIntyre, were not wearing seatbelts. Officer Nichols asked Sobolewski whether he had anything illegal in his truck. Sobolewski responded that he had a gun and a concealed weapons permit. Sobolewski showed the concealed weapons permit to Officer Nichols.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">Officer Nichols then asked Sobolewski if he had any open containers or illegal substances in the truck. Sobolewski initially responded that he did not, but after Officer Nichols requested to search the truck, Sobolewski voluntarily admitted that he had marijuana in the glove box. Officer Nichols searched the glove box and found a plastic baggie containing 6.8 grams of marijuana. Officer Nichols also found rolling papers next to the driver\u2019s seat, a gun behind the driver\u2019s seat, two bullets attached to the gun\u2019s holster, and three bullet casings in the driver\u2019s side cup holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">After the search, Everett Bane, another law enforcement officer with the USFS, asked Sobolewski what he and McIntyre had been doing before the traffic stop. Sobolewski answered that they had been shooting at the shooting range. Officer Bane then asked whether they had smoked any marijuana that day. Sobolewski responded that they had smoked some marijuana earlier that day. The officers seized the marijuana and eventually let Sobolew-ski go free.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>B. Indictment, Arrest, Drug Test, and Competency Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">On March 20, 2013, 42 days after the traffic stop, a federal grand jury returned a single-count indictment charging Sobo-lewski with \u201cbeing an unlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(3) and 924(a)(2). On April 18, 2013, Sobolewski was arrested. Sobolew-ski\u2019s trial counsel advised Sobolewski to obtain an independent drug test. On May 1, 2013, 84 days after the traffic stop, Sobolewski obtained that independent drug test, which returned a \u201cnegative\u201d result for the presence of drugs in his urine. Sobolewski provided trial counsel with the results of his drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In August 2013, Sobolewski and his trial counsel executed a written plea agreement whereby Sobolewski pleaded guilty to the one count in the indictment. In September 2013, Sobolewski\u2019s trial counsel filed an unopposed motion to determine Sobo-lewski\u2019s mental competency prior to the entry of the written plea agreement. Trial counsel alleged that Sobolewski had a cyst in his brain, was being treating by a therapist, and had previously suffered head trauma in a December 2012 motorcycle accident. Trial counsel also alleged that Sobolewski\u2019s primary physician and his therapist were both concerned about Sobo-lewski\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The district court granted the competency motion and ordered Sobolewski to undergo a psychiatric examination. On September 17, 2013, Dr. Almari Ginory, an Assistant Professor of Forensic Psychiatry at the University of Florida, examined So-bolewski. Sobolewski told Dr. Ginory that he had previously used marijuana on a few isolated occasions, but was not a habitual marijuana user with symptoms of withdrawal or tolerance. Sobolewski told Dr. Ginory that he last used marijuana the night before his arrest in order to help him sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In her written report, Dr. Ginory cited to the definition of substance abuse found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (\u201cDSM IV-TR\u201d), and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">According to the DSM IV-TR, substance abuse is defined as a maladaptive pattern of substance use which leads to impairment or distress as manifested by at least one of the following symptoms. Recurrent use resulting in a failure to fulfill major obligations, recurrent use in situations where it is physically hazardous, recurrent legal problems, and/or continued use despite recurrent interpersonal problems caused by the effects of the substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Dr. Ginory opined that Sobolewski \u201cdoes not meet criteria for cannabis abuse as he does not have recurrent impairment due to substance use.\u201d Dr. Ginory also opined that Sobolewski was mentally competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">Based on Dr. Ginory\u2019s report, the district court found that Sobolewski was mentally competent to stand trial. Sobolewski informed the court that he wished to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">C. Trial and Evidence of Prior Drug Use</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">At trial, Officers Nichols and Bane offered testimony describing the February 6, 2013 stop and search of Sobolewski\u2019s truck. The government then called three witnesses to testify about Sobolewski\u2019s history of marijuana use.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">Courtney McCrae, a special agent with the USFS, testified that he conducted an interview with Sobolewski and McIntyre immediately after the officers searched So-bolewski\u2019s truck. During the interview, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Sobolewski admitted that he began using marijuana because of relationship problems with his fianc\u00e9e. Sobolewski also executed a written affidavit after the interview. In the affidavit, Sobolewski testified that he had been smoking marijuana \u201coff and on\u201d since he was 19 years old. Sobo-lewski further testified that he had been \u201cusing\u201d marijuana more recently as a form of self-medication to alleviate headaches that developed after his December 2012 motorcycle accident. Sobolewski admitted that he smoked marijuana the day before and the day of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">McIntyre testified that he first met So-bolewski in December 2012. McIntyre testified that over the course of two or three weeks he saw Sobolewski use marijuana \u201c[m]aybe every other day,\u201d and that Sobolewski would replace the bag of marijuana in his glove box \u201c[mjaybe every other day.\u201d McIntyre also testified that So-bolewski would frequently give marijuana to McIntyre\u2019s sister, Angelina McIntyre, and she and Sobolewski would smoke it together.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Angelina McIntyre testified that she first met Sobolewski in October 2012 and eventually began working for him in late December 2012. She testified that from late December 2012 until Sobolewski\u2019s arrest in April 2013, she and Sobolewski went into the woods every day after work to smoke marijuana together. Sobolewski always provided the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Sobolewski called two witnesses to testify in his defense. Crystal Colbert, the mother of Sobolewski\u2019s niece, testified that she had known Sobolewski for three years and had interacted with him on a regular basis during that time. Colbert testified that she went into the woods with Angelina McIntyre and Sobolewski on at least 10 occasions. According to Colbert, on those occasions, she and Angelina McIntyre would smoke marijuana, but Sobolewski would not. Colbert further testified that she had never seen Sobolewski smoke marijuana in the three years that she had known him.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">George Asbate testified that he knew both Charles McIntyre and Sobolewski, but had not been friends with Sobolewski since 2011. Asbate testified that he spoke to Charles McIntyre in December 2013 to discuss the investigation that ensued after the February 2013 search of Sobolewski\u2019s truck. Asbate testified that Charles McIntyre told him that he had never seen Sobolewski consume marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Sobolewski\u2019s trial counsel did not call Dr. Ginory to testify, nor did counsel attempt to introduce into evidence Dr. Gino-ry\u2019s psychiatric evaluation report. Sobo-lewski\u2019s trial counsel also did not introduce into evidence Sobolewski\u2019s negative post-arrest drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Prior to deliberations, the district court instructed the jury that Sobolewski was charged with being an \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d in possession of a firearm. The district court further instructed that an \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d meant \u201ca person who, at the time he possessed or received a firearm or ammunition, was actively and regularly engaged in the ongoing use of a controlled substance or substances over a period of time that is sufficient to establish a pattern of conduct as distinguished from isolated and disconnected usages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">The jury found Sobolewski guilty of the one count charged in the indictment. In April 2014, the district court sentenced Sobolewski to serve a year and a day in prison. Sobolewski did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">D. Section 2255 Motion to Vacate</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">In May 2014, Sobolewski filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>under 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 2255. Sobolewski alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce as evidence at trial: (1) Dr. Ginory\u2019s opinion that Sobolewski did not meet the criteria for cannabis abuse, and (2) Sobolewski\u2019s negative post-arrest drug test. Sobolew-ski contended that this evidence would have bolstered his argument at trial that he was not an \u201cunlawful user\u201d of marijuana under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3), as it tended to show that he was not actively and regularly engaged in the ongoing use of a controlled substance. He alleged that counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the evidence at trial constituted deficient performance resulting in prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The district court denied Sobolewski\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3), it is unlawful for any person \u201cwho is an unlawful user of <em>or </em>addicted to any controlled substance\u201d to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3) (emphasis added). The term \u201cunlawful user\u201d is not defined in the statute. However, in the context of interpreting a sentencing enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, this Court has defined the term \u201cunlawful user,\u201d as used in \u00a7 922(g)(3), as a person whose drug use is \u201cregular, ongoing, and contemporaneous with his firearm possession.\u201d <em>United States v. Edmonds, </em>348 F.3d 950, 953-54 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">We evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Hunt v. Comm\u2019r, Ala. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>666 F.3d 708, 721 (11th Cir.2012). To establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">Under the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Osley v. United States, </em>751 F.3d 1214, 1222 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The defendant must carry his burden on both <em>Strickland </em>prongs to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">Here, we need not decide the deficient performance issues because Sobolewski has failed to show prejudice in any event. <em>See Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he court need not address the performance prong if the defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong.\u201d). Dr. Ginory\u2019s written report and potential testimony show only that Sobolewski did not meet the clinical criteria for marijuana abuse. Howeyer, this Court has recognized that the disjunctive form of \u00a7 922(g)(3) prohibits <em>either </em>unlawful users of controlled substances <em>or </em>addicts from possessing firearms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>Corona, </em>849 F.2d 562, 562-63 nn. 1-2 (11th Cir.1988). In this case, the indictment only charged Sobolewski with being an \u201cunlawful user\u201d of a controlled substance, not an addict. Consistent with instructive Eleventh Circuit precedent, the district court charged the jury to determine whether Sobolewski was an \u201cunlawful user\u201d because he \u201cregularly engaged in the ongoing use of [marijuana].\u201d A diagnosis that Sobolewski does not meet the clinical criteria for marijuana abuse does not show that he was not an \u201cunlawful user\u201d of marijuana. Further, Dr. Ginory\u2019s evaluation occurred on September 17, 2013, which was over seven months after the February 6, 2013 traffic stop. Because \u00a7 922(g)(3) criminalizes regular drug use that is contemporaneous with possessing a firearm, the relevant timeframe here is Sobolewski\u2019s unlawful use of marijuana at the time he possessed a firearm \u2014 which was during the traffic stop \u2014 not seven months later. <em>See Edmonds, </em>348 F.3d at 953-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In fact, the government presented evidence that Sobolewski had been consuming marijuana on a regular basis from December 2012 (the period surrounding his motorcycle accident) through February 6, 2013 (the date of his firearm offense conduct). Indeed, Sobolewski admitted that he began \u201cusing\u201d marijuana again after his motorcycle accident to treat headaches and had smoked marijuana on the day of the traffic stop and the day before. Additionally, there is not a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict had it known about the belated negative drug test taken on May 1, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In sum, Dr. Ginory\u2019s expert opinion and Sobolewski\u2019s negative drug test were not probative of whether Sobolewski was an \u201cunlawful user\u201d of marijuana during the time he possessed his gun on February 6, 2013. Even if this evidence was relevant, Sobolewski failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had trial counsel introduced it to the jury. <em>See Osley, </em>751 F.3d at 1222. Accordingly, Sobolewski did not satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-12\">.
