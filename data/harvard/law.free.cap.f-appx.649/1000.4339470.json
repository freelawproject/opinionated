Williams argues that there was not substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that she was not disabled, because the ALJ should have found that Williams is \u201cseverely and chronically mentally ill.\u201d After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Our review is limited in social security eases. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We review the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We may not reweigh the evidence or decide facts for ourselves \u2014 the ALJ\u2019s decision deserves deference \u201ceven if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">To be eligible for disability and social security benefits, a claimant must be considered \u201cdisabled.\u201d 42 NS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a)(1)(E), 1382(a)(1), (2). In determining whether a claimant is \u201cdisabled,\u201d the ALJ, in a sequential process, examines whether the claimant: (1) is engaging in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe and medically determinable impairment; (3) has an impairment or combination of impairments that satisfies the criteria of a \u201clisting\u201d; (4) can perform her past relevant work in light of her present abilities, which comprise her residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d); and (5) can adjust to other work in light of her RFC, age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">To apply this test, the ALJ evaluates the record before her, including relevant medical records and physicians\u2019 opinions. A treating physician\u2019s opinion must be given considerable weight unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to discount it. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). Good cause exists where: (1) the opinion was not bolstered by evidence; (2) the record supported a contrary finding; or (3) the opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own medical records. <em>Id, </em>The weight due to a non-examining physician\u2019s opinion depends partly on whether it is supported by clinical findings and is consistent with the record as a whole. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c), (e). \u201c[T]he ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">Williams never objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), so we review her claims for plain error. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 3-1. Plain error requires: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects the substantial rights of the party; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding. <em>Brough v. Imperial Sterling Ltd., </em>297 F.3d 1172, 1179 (11th Cir.2002),</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">The ALJ did not plainly err by finding that Williams was not disabled. Williams relies primarily on two medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>opinions in challenging the ALJ\u2019s determination: those of Dr. Abeles and Dr. Grauer. The ALJ properly did not consider Dr. Abeles\u2019s opinion because that opinion was prepared for Williams\u2019s previous, denied disability claim, which this Court affirmed. <em>See Williams v. Astrue, </em>416 Fed.Appx. 861, 863 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision to give Dr. Abeles\u2019s opinion \u201clittle weight\u201d). The ALJ had no occasion to revisit Dr. Abeles\u2019s opinion here, with respect to a separate disability claim covering a separate period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Neither did the ALJ plainly err by giving less weight to Dr. Grauer\u2019s opinion. Ordinarily, a treating physician\u2019s opinion would be entitled to considerable weight, but the ALJ had good cause to discount Dr, Grauer\u2019s opinion. <em>See Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. First, to the extent that Dr. Grauer purported to declare Williams \u201cfully disabled,\u201d this was not a medical opinion entitled to special significance, but rather a conclusory legal judgment \u201con issues reserved to the Commissioner.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d). Second, Dr. Grauer based his assessment largely on Dr. Abeles\u2019s opinion, rather than on his personal observation of specific functional limitations. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(c)(3). Finally, Dr. Grauer\u2019s opinion was not consistent with the record as a whole. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(c)(4). The ALJ did not plainly err by discounting Dr. Grauer\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The ALJ\u2019s finding as to Williams\u2019s mental RFC was supported by substantial evidence. One treating physician found that even without any psychotropic medication, Williams was cooperative, her memory was intact, her attention and concentration were adequate, and her judgment was fair. Many of her other examinations resulted in similar findings. Two non-treating psychologists confirmed that Williams had only mild to moderate mental issues, which did not significantly affect her ability to follow simple instructions, complete tasks, and work a normal workweek. Williams also acknowledged her ability to do household chores and yard-work, read the Bible and meditate, go to church, go shopping, manage her money, do puzzles, and drive. Finally, the ALJ noted instances in which Williams appeared to have given medical providers questionable information in order to build her benefits case. Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding as to Williams\u2019s mental RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">The ALJ\u2019s findings that Williams could either return to her past work or adjust to other work were also supported by substantial evidence. A claimant bears the burden of demonstrating that she cannot perform her past work. <em>Lucas v. Sullivan, </em>918 F.2d 1567, 1571 (11th Cir.1990). A claimant can perform her past work if her RFC is sufficient to meet the demands of the relevant job. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(b), 416.960(b). In making this assessment, ALJs may allow vocational experts to testify, <em>see id., </em>as the ALJ did here. Based on Williams\u2019s RFC and impairments, the ALJ asked the vocational expert hypothetical questions about possible work, and the expert testified that Williams was capable of performing her past jobs as a mail handler or an office helper. He also testified that Williams could adjust to work as a car wash assistant or a housekeeper based on her RFC. This was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order upholding the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
