After entry of that order, the Department of Justice classified Mack-ey\u2019s fine as past due and referred his debt to the Department of the Treasury, which later seized the proceeds of a settlement that Mackey had received in a civil action. Mackey moved to enforce the order that suspended collection of his fine, to terminate the referral as erroneous, and to recover the settlement proceeds. The district court denied Mackey\u2019s motion and ruled that the government was entitled to seize the settlement proceeds under a statute that requires an inmate to reduce an outstanding fine with funds he receives \u201cfrom any source.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(n). Mackey filed a motion to reconsider and repeated his argument that the referral was erroneous, but the district court summarily denied the motion. We vacate the order denying Mackey\u2019s motion to reconsider, and we remand for the district court to consider Mackey\u2019s argument to terminate the referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>We review an order denying a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Equity Inv. Partners, LP v. Lenz, </em>594 F.3d 1388, 1342 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cA person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The district court abused its discretion when it denied Mackey\u2019s motion to reconsider without considering his argument to terminate the referral. The district court was obligated to address Mackey\u2019s argument to \u201ccorrect what he deems to be an error by the U.S. Attorney of [referring] ... the ... court-ordered f\u00edne\u201d in order to determine whether the Justice Department could refer his debt and to determine the amount of that debt. The Justice Department may refer an outstanding f\u00edne to the Treasury Department to collect through its Treasury Offset Program. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716; 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 285.5. But the debt must be \u201cpast due,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(c)(6)(A), and the Justice Department must, upon request of the debtor, conduct an administrative review, <em>id, </em>\u00a7 3716(a)(3); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.12(d)(l)-(6), and give \u201cwritten notice of its decision to the debtor,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11.12(d)(6), before collecting through the offset program. The district court failed to consider Mackey\u2019s argument, raised in his motions to terminate and for reconsideration, that his f\u00edne was not past due because the collection process had been suspended. The district court also failed to consider whether the Justice Department complied with its obligations to conduct an administrative review and to give Mackey written notice of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">It is also unclear whether the referral affected the amount of Mackey\u2019s debt. In 1999, the district court imposed a fine of $25,000, and a statement that the Bureau of Prisons issued in 2003 stated that Mack-ey owed $24, 919.33, but the Justice Department referred a debt of $31,119.33. Nothing in the record explains the additional $6,200 sought. Although the United States may charge penalties when a fine is delinquent or in default, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3572(h), 3572(i), 3612(g), it must notify the debtor of the delinquency or default, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3612(d), (e), and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the United States provided notice to Mackey.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The United States argues that Mackey \u201cwas not denied the opportunity for review of his claims,\u201d \u201chis claims were without merit,\u201d and he \u201cfailed to supply a legal defense to his enrollment,\u201d but these arguments are misplaced. Even if there were sufficient information in the record to support these arguments, we would leave them to the district court to address them in the first instance. Documents submitted by the United States establish only that it gave Mackey notice of the referral and that Mackey timely requested an administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">The United States also argues that \u201cthere is no requirement under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716 that the government respond to a defendant\u2019s unsupported claims,\u201d but the statute provides that a government agency \u201cmay collect by administrative offset only after giving the debtor ... an opportunity for a review ... of the decision\u201d to refer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3716(a)(3) 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.12(d)(l)-(6). The record does not reflect that the Justice Department conducted an administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">We VACATE the order denying Mack-ey\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and we REMAND for the district court to consider Mackey\u2019s argument to terminate the referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
