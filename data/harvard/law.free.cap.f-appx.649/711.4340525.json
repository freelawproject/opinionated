Mesa <em>pro se </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his concurrent 120-month sentences on Counts 1 through 4. On appeal, Mesa argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction on these four counts based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. <em>Id. </em>A reduction is not consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements and thus is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not actually lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d such as a statutory mandatory minimum prison term. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A); <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Here, the district court properly denied Mesa\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 782 did not actually lower his applicable guidelines range. At Mesa\u2019s original 2010 sentencing, the district court grouped Counts 1 through 4 together and, based on 14 kilograms of cocaine attributable to Mesa, calculated a base offense level was 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4) (2010). After several adjustments, Mesa\u2019s total offense level was 31 and his criminal history category was I, which yielded an advisory guidelines range 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, Mesa was subject to a ten-year statutory mandatory minimum on Counts 1 and 2. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). Therefore, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c), Mesa\u2019s advisory guidelines range became 120 to 135 months, and the district court imposed concurrent 120-month sentences on all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">In 2014, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 782, which reduced by two levels the base offense levels for most drug quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 782. After Amendment 782, the base offense level for Mesa\u2019s drug quantity of 14 kilograms of cocaine is 30, rather than 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(5) (2015). Holding all other sentencing determinations the same, Mesa\u2019s total offense level would be 29 and his initial guidelines range would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>87 to 108 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. However, by operation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) and the ten-year mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), Mesa\u2019s advisory guidelines range would become 120 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) (providing that the mandatory minimum sentence is the guidelines sentence when it is greater than the high end of the otherwise applicable guidelines range). Thus, while Amendment 782 lowered Mesa\u2019s base offense level, it did not lower his advisory guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Mesa\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">. Mesa concedes that his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 782 did not implicate his mandatory, consecutive 120-month sentence on Count 5, his firearm offense, which was imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-13\">. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2),\" <em>United States v.
