In her motion, Bates argued that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when her sentence was miscalculated in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Use by the district court of the guideline governing theft offenses that was in effect at the time of Bates\u2019s sentencing, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.4(E) (Nov.2011), resulted in more persons being counted as victims of Bates\u2019s offenses, which resulted in a higher sentencing range than she would have faced under the guideline in effect when she committed her offenses, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.l (Nov. 2007). The government concedes that trial counsel was deficient in failing to object when the miscalculation of Bates\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>tence plainly violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, but argues that counsel\u2019s .error did not prejudice Bates because \u201cthe record suggests that it is unlikely the district court would have imposed a lower sentence.\u201d Because the district court imposed a sentence at the low end of Bates\u2019s advisory guideline range and there is a reasonable probability that her sentence would have been different if calculated correctly, we vacate the order denying Bates\u2019s motion to vacate her sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">We divide the background into two parts. First, we discuss Bates\u2019s conviction and sentence. Second, we discuss Bates\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">A <em>Bates\u2019s Conviction and Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">In 2011, a jury convicted Bates of one count of conspiring to defraud the United States, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286, eight counts of identity theft, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1028(a)(7), (b)(1)(D), two counts of attempting or conspiring to commit wire fraud, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1343, 1349, and two counts of aggravated identity theft, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Bates\u2019s offenses occurred between June 2006 and April 2007, but her presentence investigation report applied the 2011 version of the Sentencing Guidelines. The presentenee report identified as victims the 54 individuals whose personal identification information Bates stole, the Internal Revenue Service, and HSBC Bank. The report stated that Bates used 46 of the individuals\u2019 personal information to claim a tax refund. The report grouped Bates\u2019s convictions for fraud, identity theft, and wire fraud to assign her a base offense level of. seven, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l), and added four levels because her offense involved more than 60 victims, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B). With a total offense level of 27 and a criminal history of I, the report provided a sentencing range of 70 to 87 months for Bates\u2019s grouped offenses, and two 24-month sentences for her aggravated identity theft offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Bates objected to the four-level sentence enhancement. Bates argued that the report overstated the number of victims because the jury had acquitted her of some identity theft offenses charged in her indictment. Bates\u2019s argument led the district court to question whether the government had proved that every individual whose personal information Bates had stolen had suffered a pecuniary loss, as required to constitute a victim under the 2007 commentary to section 2B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.l (Nov.2007). The government responded that the proper inquiry was whether, under the expanded definition of victims of offenses involving means of identification that was included in the 2011 commentary to section 2B1.1, Bates used the individuals\u2019 \u201cmeans of identification ... unlawfully or without authority,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.4(E) (Nov.2011). When asked by the district court how to sidestep the newer definition of victim, Bates answered that the jury\u2019s verdicts established the number of victims. The district court overruled Bates\u2019s objection to the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">Bates requested a downward departure or a downward variance, both of which the district court denied. While considering Bates\u2019s request for a variance, the district court asked Bates\u2019s probation officer to recommend an appropriate sentence. The probation officer suggested that Bates receive a sentence of 70 months for her grouped offenses to run consecutively to a 24-month sentence for her aggravated identity theft offenses and that Bates receive a sentence at the. low end of her guideline range, but not a downward variance. The district court was troubled by Bates\u2019s apparent lack of remorse and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>ordination of a witness\u2019s perjury and thought that Bates had persuaded the witness to lie for her and had mistreated other people. The district court judge said, \u201cI can see giving [Bates] a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines, but I was thinking of giving her a variance.\u201d The district court judge also pondered why Bates resorted to criminal activities after having excelled at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The district court considered Bates\u2019s advisory guideline range and the statutory sentencing factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. The district court sentenced Bates to 70 months for her conspiracy, identity theft, and wire fraud offenses, and to a consecutive sentence of 24 months for her aggravated identity theft offenses. Bates did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">\n<em>B, Bates\u2019s Motion to Vacate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Bates moved to vacate her sentence on the ground that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the four-level enhancement of her sentence. Bates argued that none of the 54 individuals whose personal information she had stolen had suffered a pecuniary loss to qualify as a victim under the definition in effect at the time of her offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.l (Nov.2007). Trial counsel submitted an affidavit recounting that he had argued Bates had only two victims, the Service and HSBC Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">Later, Bates filed an amended motion to vacate and argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the four-level enhancement on the ground its application -violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Bates argued that' the district court plainly erred by applying the four-level enhancement in reliance on the definition of victim in effect at the time of Bates\u2019s sentencing in 2011 instead of the definition in effect when she committed her offense in 2007. Bates argued that trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness increased her sentence by 20 to 25 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">The government responded that Bates\u2019s counsel was not ineffective. Had Bates objected, the government argued, it would have submitted evidence that her victims suffered actual losses, either attributable to delays in receiving tax refunds, to correcting credit reports, or to difficulties obtaining loans, which \u201cwould likely [have made her] subject to the 4-level enhancement.\u201d Bates was not entitled to postcon-vietion relief, the government argued, because applying the definition of victim in effect in 2011 did not plainly violate the Ex Post Facto Clause and because her trial counsel was not expected to anticipate a change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">Bates replied that she did not have more than 50 victims, as that term was defined in the 2007 guideline. Bates argued that <em>United States v. Wetherald, </em>636 F.3d 1315 (11th Cir.2011), had made plain that the application of the definition of victim in effect in 2011 resulted in an unlawful sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">The district court denied Bates\u2019s motion to vacate. The district court ruled that Bates was not prejudiced by her trial counsel\u2019s failure to object because she could not establish that the 54 individuals would not have counted as victims when the government could have proved that each individual suffered a pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">The district court granted Bates a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The Sixth Amendment provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall ... have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. And \u201c[t]he right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel\u201d at trial and at sentencing. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (quoting <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970)). To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, a defendant must prove \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and that the \u201cperformance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">For Bates to obtain relief under section 2255, she must satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffectiveness. Bates must establish that a reasonably competent attorney would have objected to the sentence enhancement as a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause and that there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of her case. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The unobjected-to error \u201cmust at least satisfy the standard for prejudice that we employ in our review for plain error.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>518 F.3d at 1298. In other words, the error must have, affected Bates\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cA substantial right is affected if ... there is a reasonable probability that there would have been a different result had there been no error.\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831-32 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">The government concedes that Bates\u2019s tidal counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the plain error of the district court in misapplying the 2011 guideline, and we accept that concession. We have long recognized that the application of a Sentencing Guideline or its commentary retroactively must operate to the defendant\u2019s benefit. <em>United States v. Masferrer, </em>514 F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir.2008) (approving use of the guideline in effect at the time of sentencing as advantageous to the defendant); <em>United States v. Marin, </em>916 F.2d 1536, 1538 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (11th Cir.1990) (vacating sentence and remanding for the district court to apply the more favorable guideline in effect when the defendant was sentenced). Although \u201c[w]e apply the version of the sentencing guidelines and commentary in effect on the date of sentencing,\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>993 F.2d 214, 216 (11th Cir.1993) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)-(5)), \u201c[pjursuant to the Ex Post Facto Clause, if applying [that version of] the Guidelines ... would result in a harsher penalty, a defendant must be sentenced under the Guidelines in effect at the time when [she] committed the offense,\u201d <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1314 (11th Cir.2009) (error in applying newer guidelines was harmless); <em>see United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming use of the guidelines in effect at the time of the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Several months before Bates\u2019s sentencing hearing, we recognized that the application of a guideline retroactively could still violate the Ex Post Facto Clause even though the Sentencing Guidelines had been rendered advisory, <em>see United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Wetherald, </em>636 F.3d 1315, 1320-22 (11th Cir.2011). As we explained in <em>Wetherald, </em>\u201cthe application of the correct Guidelines range [remains] of critical importance\u201d under an advisory sentencing scheme, <em>id. </em>at 1322, because of the \u201csimple reality\u201d that the Guidelines \u201cprovide a starting point or \u2018anchor\u2019 for judges,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1321 quoting <em>United States v. Turner, </em>548 F.3d 1094, 1099 (D.C.Cir.2008), and \u201cserve[ ] to cabin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>the potential sentence that may be imposed,\u201d <em>id. </em>Accordingly, we held that \u201cwe will ... find an Ex Post Facto Clause violation when a district judge\u2019s selection of a Guidelines range in effect at the time of sentencing rather than that at the time of the offense results in a substantial risk of harsher punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322. Even so, we concluded that the failure of the district court to apply \u201cthe more lenient Guidelines sentence in effect at the time of [Wetherald\u2019s] offense\u201d did not entitle him to relief on direct appeal because he could not \u201cshow a substantial risk that the application of the [newer] Guidelines resulted in the imposition of a harsher sentence\u201d when the district court stated that it would have imposed the same sentence under, either version of the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Bates\u2019s trial counsel performed defi-ciently by failing to object to the use of the 2011 guideline as violative of the Ex Post Facto Clause, particularly when the district court asked counsel how to sidestep applying the newer guideline. The application of the newer guideline plainly constituted \u201can Ex Post Facto Clause violation ... [that] resulted] in a substantial risk of harsher punishment\u201d than what Bates faced when her offense ended in 2007. <em>See id. </em>at 1322. The district court increased Bates\u2019s offense level by four levels based on its determination that her offense involved more than 50 victims. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B). Using the 2011 guidelines, which expanded the definition of victim to include any person whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.4(E) (Nov.2011), the district court counted all 54 persons whose identification Bates stole, which resulted in a total offense level of 27. But under the commentary to the 2007 guidelines, which required that a person suffer a pecuniary loss, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.1 (Nov.2007), Bates\u2019s victims included only the 46 individuals whose personal information she used to claim tax refunds and the two entities that incurred losses because of her offense. Had the district court applied the 2007 guideline, the government concedes, Bates would have received a two-level enhancement for an offense that involved more than 10, but less than 50 victims, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), (B), which would have produced a total offense level of 25. Counsel\u2019s failure to object to the miscalculation of Bates\u2019s offense level was an error sufficiently serious to label him as \u201cnot functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed [Bates] by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Our decision turns on whether Bates can establish that her counsel\u2019s error affected her substantial rights. \u201cErrors do affect a substantial right of a party if they have a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the outcome of a case or leave \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether they affected the outcome of a case.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1276 (quoting <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1268 n. 20 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc)). We have held that the miscalculation of a defendant\u2019s offense level, which resulted in a greater sentencing range than he otherwise would have faced, affected his substantial rights and entitled him to resentencing. <em>Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 834. Although Bennett\u2019s sentence fell within the corrected guideline range, we concluded that the miscalculation affected his substantial, rights because the district court had expressed a desire to impose a sentence \u201ctoward the low end\u201d of Bennett\u2019s guideline range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">The United States Supreme Court held recently in <em>Molina-Martinez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1338, 194 L.Ed.2d 444 (2016), that \u201ca defendant sentenced under an incorrect Guidelines range ... [can] rely on that fact to show a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under the correct range\u201d so as \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>establish an effect on substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349. Based on the same concerns we identified in <em>Wetherald, </em>636 F.3d at 1321-22, about the significant role the Guidelines play, <em>Molina-Martinez, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1345-46, 1349, and the inability of some \u201cdefendants] [to find] evidence of the Guidelines\u2019 influence beyond the sentence itself,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1347, the Supreme Court concluded that defendants \u201cwho [have] shown that the district court mistakenly deemed applicable an incorrect, higher Guidelines range [have] demonstrated a reasonable probability of a different outcome\u201d under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), <em>id. </em>at 1346. \u201cThere may be instances when,\u201d the Court acknowledged, \u201cdespite application of an erroneous Guideline range, a reasonable probability of prejudice does not exist\u201d to substantiate a claim for relief because the record establishes that \u201cthe district court thought the sentence it chose was appropriate irrespective of the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1346-47. Then again, if \u201cthe record is silent as to what the district court might have done had it considered the correct Guidelines range,\" the Court explained, \u201cthe court\u2019s reliance on an incorrect range in most instances will suffice to show an effect on the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The Supreme Court concluded that the miscalculation of Molina-Martinez\u2019s sentencing range affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1347-48. The district court, without stating anything \u201cspecific about ... it[s] chose[n] ... sentence,\u201d adopted an erroneous calculation of Molina-Martinez\u2019s criminal history level and imposed a sentence that was at the low end of the sentencing range, but that would have been in the middle of the sentencing range, had it been calculated correctly. <em>Id. </em>Based on those facts, the Supreme Court decided that \u201cthere [was] at least a reasonable probability that the District Court would have imposed a different sentence had it known [a shorter sentence] was in fact the lowest sentence the Commission deemed appropriate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1348, and that Molina-Martinez was entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">In the light of <em>Molina-Martinez </em>and <em>Bennett, </em>we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance affected Bates\u2019s substantial rights because there was a reasonable probability that, had her counsel objected, she would have received a different sentence. The district court remarked that it could \u201csee giving [Bates] a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines\u201d and it considered Bates\u2019s request for a downward variance. The district court obtained a recommendation from Bates\u2019s probation officer to impose a sentence at the low end of the guideline range and weighed the reasons underlying the recommendation. With this information in hand, the district court sentenced Bates to 70 months, which was \u201cthe lowest sentence within what [it] believed to be the applicable range,\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1347. Under the 2011 guideline, Bates received a four-level enhancement, which produced a sentencing range between 70 and 87 months. Had Bates received only the two-level enhancement applicable under the 2007 guideline, her sentencing range would have been 57 to 71 months. Based on the opinion expressed by the district court and its decision to impose a sentence at the low end of the incorrect guideline range, there is a reasonable probability that it would have imposed a lower sentence had it used the correct sentencing range. <em>See Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 834. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the application of the 2011 guideline affected Bates\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">The district court should have granted Bates\u2019s motion to vacate her sentence based on the ineffectiveness of her trial counsel. As conceded by the government, trial counsel performed deficiently by fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>ing to object to the four-level enhancement on the ground it violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. And Bates was prejudiced by her counsel\u2019s deficient performance because there is a reasonable probability that, but for the failure to object, the district court would have sentenced Bates differently. Bates is entitled to be resen-tenced using the correct total offense level of 25, which results from applying a two-level enhancement for having more than 10 and less than 50 victims who suffered a pecuniary loss, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n.l (Nov. 2007), and the corresponding advisory sentencing range of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">We VACATE the order denying Bates\u2019s motion to vacate her sentence, and we REMAND with instructions to resentence Bates using the correct total offense level of 25 and the corresponding sentencing range of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
