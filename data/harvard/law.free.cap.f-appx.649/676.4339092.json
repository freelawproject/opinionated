Manzanares-Saldana argues that he was persecuted and targeted as a member of a cognizable social group because members of his family and their neighbors had been kidnapped, killed, or extorted by a gang. He contends that his family meets the definition of a protected \u201csocial group\u201d because membership in his family is immutable. Additionally, he argues that he is also a part of a cognizable group of native Mexicans who are singled out and preyed upon after returning to Mexico from the United States. After careful review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Because the BIA issued its own opinion in' this case, we review the BIA\u2019s opinion only. <em>Id. </em>We lack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies by raising those claims before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions, including its determination of whether a group qualifies as a particular social group under the INA, <em>de novo. Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). The BIA\u2019s determination that a petitioner is ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal is reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that his life or freedom would be threatened in his country of origin because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant must demonstrate that he would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be persecuted based upon a protected ground, such as membership in a particular social group, upon being returned to his home country. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Congress has not defined what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA, but in <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>we approved the BIA\u2019s definition of the term as a group of persons who share a common characteristic that is either immutable or fundamental to its members\u2019 individual identities or consciences. 446 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2006). Furthermore, the group must have sufficient \u201csocial visibility\u201d but must not be \u201ctoo numerous or inchoate.\u201d <em>Id: </em>at 1197-98. Significantly, \u201c[t]he risk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">In <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>we affirmed the BIA\u2019s determination that noncriminal informants working against cartels were not a particular social group, in part because no evidence revealed that the cartels would treat the informants any differently from other persons the cartels perceived to have interfered with their activities. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, virtually the entire population of the country was subject to persecution by the cartels, and risk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the meaning of the INA. <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>we held in <em>Cendejas Rodriguez v. U.S. Attorney General </em>that a proposed family-member group did not constitute a particular social group, noting that the defining attribute of the group was persecution by a drug-trafficking organization. 735 F.3d 1302, 1310 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Here, the BIA did not err in determining that Manzanares-Saldana\u2019s proposed group, to the extent one was identified with particularity, did not constitute a particular social group under the INA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Like the proposed social group in <em>Cendejas Rodriguez, </em>Manzanares-Saldana\u2019s proposed family-member group\u2019s defining attribute is its persecution by the criminal gangs, and \u201cthe risk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group.\u201d <em>Cendejas Rodriguez, </em>735 F.3d at 1310 (quoting <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1198). Manzanares-Saldana\u2019s alternative argument \u2014 that he qualifies as a member of a social group of returnees from the United States \u2014 is unexhausted because he did not raise it before the BIA, so we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Furthermore, the record supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Manzanares-Saldana failed to show that the harm he feared from the criminal gangs arose from his membership in a particular social group. \u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). Manzanares-Saldana\u2019s evidence reflects that the extorters were motivated by financial reasons and that members of his family were beaten or killed for failure to comply with the extort-er\u2019s demands. While we can understand Manzanares-Saldana\u2019s concerns, the evidence simply does not reflect persecution based on a <em>statutorily protected </em>ground. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Manza-nares-Saldana failed to establish a nexus between his membership in a particular social group and the harm he feared in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">For these reasons, we must deny Man-zanares-Saldana\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-26\">. Manzanares-Saldana also sought withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16. He does not challenge the denial of CAT relief in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>brief to this Court, though, so we do not address his CAT claim. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 577 </em>F.3d 1341, 1352 (11th Cir.2009) (deeming abandoned petitioner\u2019s CAT claim to which petitioner\u2019s brief made only a \u201cpassing reference\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. In fact, Manzanares-Saldana\u2019s attorney seemed to concede this point in closing argument at the merits hearing: \"I do understand case law in this circuit and I do believe that my client doesn\u2019t really fit in any particular social group.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
