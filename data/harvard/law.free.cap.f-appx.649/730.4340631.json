Anderson seeks expungement of the disciplinary report from his record and restoration of the good-conduct time he lost. On appeal, Anderson argues that: (1) there is no evidence to support finding him guilty of fighting with another inmate; (2) the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) violated his due process rights by not providing him with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>video of the fight that was the subject of the disciplinary hearing; and (3) he was denied his right to present witnesses, two inmates who would have exonerated him, by the BOP\u2019s failure to timely conduct his hearing before the discipline hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Bowers v. Keller, </em>651 F.3d 1277, 1291 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cA district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. Pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Because exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a jurisdictional requirement in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, we can deny a \u00a7 2241 petition on the merits without addressing exhaustion. <em>Santiago-Lugo v. Warden, </em>785 F.3d 467, 475 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Supreme Court has held that the following minimum due process procedures are required in a prisoner\u2019s disciplinary proceeding: (1) at least 24 hours\u2019 notice of the charges so that the prisoner can prepare for the hearing; (2) a written statement by the factfinder detailing what evidence was relied upon and why disciplinary action was taken; and (3) the qualified right to call witnesses and present documentary evidence, if not \u201cunduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.\u201d <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). In determining whether a prisoner has received due process, in the context of revocation of good-time credits, a court is not required to examine the entire record, weigh the evidence, or independently assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105. S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). The relevant question is only whether the hearing officer\u2019s findings are supported \u201cby some evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">In this case, Anderson\u2019s disciplinary proceedings satisfied the due process requirements outlined by the Supreme Court in <em>Wolff. </em>Anderson was notified of the DHO hearing more than two months beforehand, the DHO Report explained the evidence it relied upon, and Anderson was allowed to present documentary evidence. Although the two inmate witnesses Anderson sought to present were not available, that was because one had been released from custody and the other could not be located by the BOP based on the identifying information provided by Anderson. Anderson acknowledged on his Central Office Administrative Remedy Appeal that he initially waived the right to witnesses until he learned that there was no video of the incident. On this record, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s factual findings \u2014 that Anderson initially waived his right to call witnesses and that a delay in the DHO hearing was caused by attempts to identify Anderson\u2019s requested witnesses \u2014 were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Moreover, regardless of whether the two witnesses would have testified as Anderson says that they would, the incident report contains one staff member\u2019s statement that Anderson and the other inmate were exchanging punches and striking each other in the head and upper torso area. Because the staff member\u2019s statement in the incident report constitutes \u201csome evidence in the record,\u201d this evidence is sufficient to support the DHO\u2019s findings that Anderson fought with another inmate. <em>Id. </em>Finally, although Anderson argues that his due process rights were violated by the BOP failing to turn over video of the incident, there was no due process violation since the record indicates that video of the incident does not exist. Accordingly, we af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>firm the denial of Anderson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habe-as corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
