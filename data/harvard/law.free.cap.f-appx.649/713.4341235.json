Mackey argues that the district court erred by relying on the testimony of a cooperating witness to support his sentencing enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">\u201cIn reviewing a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, we \u2018give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Alred, </em>144 F.3d 1405, 1417 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)). Thus, we defer to the decision of the fact finder \u2014 here, the district court \u2014 as to the credibility of a witness \u201cunless the witness\u2019s testimony [i]s unbelievable on its face.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">Mackey avers that the testimony of cooperating witness Aisha Lawal was not credible and thus could not be relied upon by the district court to support the sentencing enhancements. He points to; <em>inter alia, </em>Lawal\u2019s \u201cextreme motivation to fabricate evidence\u201d as a \u201cscorned ex-lover\u201d and \u201cinconsistencies, as to her former statement\u201d to a special agent. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>district court found Lawal credible, and we must defer to this determination here. Lawal appeared in court to testify, which gave the district court judge the opportunity to observe her. Hence, \u201cthe fact finder personally observe[d] the testimony\u201d and was in the best position to assess her credibility. <em>See id. </em>And, although Mack-ey characterizes Lawal as a \u201cscorned ex-lover,\u201d we are not convinced that bias tainted her testimony. As the district court noted, Lawal was advised of her Fifth Amendment rights and was not provided any type of immunity from the government in exchange for her testimony. Nevertheless, she still testified and admitted to her involvement with drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Additionally, independent record evidence corroborated Lawal\u2019s testimony. Lawal gave specific details about the cocaine trafficking business, testifying that she saw Mackey take a \u201cbrick\u201d of cocaine, then break it down into smaller packages wrapped in plastic baggies, grease, and electrical tape. This was precisely what Mackey had in his possession when he was arrested, which gives corroborative substance to Lawal\u2019s testimony. Therefore, we cannot say Lawal\u2019s testimony is \u201cunbelievable on its face.\u201d <em>See Rivera, </em>775 F.2d at 1561 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in finding Lawal credible. Given that Mackey solely challenges the enhancements on that basis, we cannot conclude that the court clearly erred in applying the sentencing enhancements to Mackey\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.2012) (clear error review applies to district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes); <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006) (district court\u2019s determination for sentencing purposes that a defendant possessed a firearm subject to clear error review). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. Indeed, it is worth noting that Mackey fails to account for the corroborative evidence upon which the district court also relied in making its sentencing determinations. The district court found that holding Mackey accountable for over two kilograms of cocaine was a \u2018\u2018conservative estimate ... based not on some abstract calculation, but based on what others physically saw, further corroborated by the audio, further corroborated by other evidence in the case.\" The district court additionally considered testimony from Special Agent Vickers, which it found credible and reliable, and we have no reason to question that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
