Loan Corp., </em>552 Fed.Appx. 908, 912 (11th Cir.2014). We concluded that Mr. Wane had failed to plead a sufficient factual basis for rescission. <em>See id. </em>Mr. Wane and his wife had mailed a notice of rescission, which was sufficient to contemplate a right to rescind, but had not pled enough sufficient facts to provide a substantive right to rescind. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Following our decision, Mr. Wane filed a motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4-6). The district court denied that motion, and Mr, Wane now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Wane\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. Mr. Wane relied on a new Supreme Court case, <em>Jesinoski v. Countrywide Rome Loans, Inc., </em>574 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 790, 190 L,Ed.2d 650 (2015) (holding that Truth in Lending Act only requires written notice of intent to seek rescission within the three-year period for rescission), but that case does not affect the basis for the dismissal of his rescission claim. <em>See Wane, </em>552 Fed.Appx. at 912. The district court therefore did not err in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
