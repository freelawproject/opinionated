The BIA concluded that Sorto-Lopez is not eligible for asylum or to have his removal withheld, because he did not demonstrate that he suffered persecution in El Salvador or, alternatively, that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution there. On appeal, Sorto-Lopez argues that these findings were erroneous. Because we find that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence, we affirm the decision and deny Sorto-Lopez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA]\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA issued its own opinion and did not adopt the opinion or reasoning of the IJ expressly, so we only consider the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>factual determination by the BIA that an alien is statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding is reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Perlera-Escobar v. Exec. Office for Immigration, 894 F.2d </em>1292, 1296 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam). As such, we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks omitted). This standard is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). And, \u201cwe may reverse only when the record compels it.\u201d <em>Li Shan Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>672 F.3d 961, 964 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">II. ASYLUM</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">The INA provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States ... irrespective of such alien\u2019s status, may apply for asylum.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General may grant an alien\u2019s asylum application if it \u201cdetermines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of\u2019 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-15\">[A]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of <em>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution </em>on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added), The applicant bears the burden of proving that he is a refugee, which requires him to present \u201cspecific and credible evidence\u201d demonstrating either \u201cpast persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor\u201d or \u201ca well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Pjersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">A. <em>Past Persecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKs\">Sorto-Lopez asserts that he established past persecution based on his religion and his membership in a particular social group. In support of this claim, he points to his testimony that (1) two to three times per week, gang members in El Salvador told him that God did not exist when he was on his way to church; (2) he had to transfer schools because other students harassed him by saying that God did not exist and that he should change his religion; (3) a few days before he left El Salvador for the United States, a car swerved towards him while he was on the sidewalk and someone in the car yelled that God would not protect him; (4) when he worked at a prosecutor\u2019s office \u2014 his \u201cparticular social group\u201d \u2014 gang members and corrupt police officers threatened him; and (5) on one occasion, he was extorted for $1,000. However, Sorto-Lopez also testified that he was never physically harmed by any of his alleged persecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Considered as a whole, this evidence supports a finding of \u201cmere harassment,\u201d coupled with a \u201cfew isolated incidents of ... intimidation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the record does not require a determination that Sorto-Lopez suffered past persecution. <em>See id. </em>(holding that \u201cmenacing telephone calls and threats ... do not arise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of [a BIA] decision\u201d); <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Pjersecution requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, unaccompanied by any physical punishment, infliction of harm, or significant deprivation of liberty.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">B. <em>Future Persecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Sorto-Lopez also claims that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in El Salvador due to his religion and association with the prosecutor\u2019s office. To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant must demonstrate that his fear is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. While Sorto-Lopez may genuinely fear persecution in El Salvador, the record does not compel a finding that such fear is objectively reasonable. His previous experience did not amount to persecution, and he has failed to \u201cdemonstrate .specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1289-90 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">In sum, the record does not require a determination that Sorto-Lopez suffered past persecution or that he has a well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>founded fear of future persecution. Thus, we must uphold the BIA\u2019s finding that he is not eligible for asylum. <em>See Li Shan Chen, </em>672 F.3d at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">III. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">To be eligible for withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant must show that, if he was removed, his life or freedom would be threatened because of his \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (internal quotation marks omitted). This standard is \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the above-discussed standard for asylum. <em>See id. </em>Hence, \u201cwhere an applicant fails to meet the burden for asylum, he necessarily cannot meet the ... burden for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Because Sorto-Lopez has not met his burden for asylum, his challenge to the BIA\u2019s \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d decision likewise fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
