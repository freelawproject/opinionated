He also argues that if he returns to Moldova he will face future persecution because of those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determination that an alien is ineligible for asylum under the substantial evidence test. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 (11th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision\u201d and must affirm if \u201cit is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>marks omitted). A \u201cfinding of fact will be reversed only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">To establish that he is eligible for asylum, 'Birsa must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence,\u201d show \u201c(1) past persecution on account of a .statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). An alien\u2019s political opinion is a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment' or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Birsa did not suffer past persecution on account of his political opinion. Birsa, who supports Moldova\u2019s liberal party, testified that he was at a demonstration against the communist party when four or five people kicked and punched him, which resulted in some injuries and scarring. He also received several telephone calls after that incident informing him that he would go to prison if he continued his political activities. As the IJ and BIA found, neb ther the attack nor the telephone calls amounted to persecution. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a beating resulting in scratches and bruising, along with an arrest and 36-hour detention, was not persecution); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1229, 1231 (holding that telephone calls involving death threats and orders to stop political activity did not amount to persecution). Birsa argues that the beating and telephone calls together amount to persecution, but the facts do not compel that conclusion. <em>Cf. Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 763, 766 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of two beatings, death threats, and an 18-day kidnapping amounted to persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">He argues that he also suffered persecution because after he left Moldova in 2012 he was fraudulently convicted of hooliganism, disturbing the peace, and destruction of property. Even if his convictions were fraudulent, however, substantial evidence supports the finding that they were not based on his political opinion. He was not convicted until 2013, four years after the communist party he opposed lost power. He testified that he was prosecuted merely because he was in \u201cthe wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d and that if the liberal party government had not prosecuted him, it would have found a \u201cdifferent person that would be held as the scapegoat.\u201d As the IJ and BIA pointed out, being prosecuted as a scapegoat does not mean that he was being prosecuted for his political opinion. Birsa\u2019s arguments to the contrary ask us to reweigh the evidence, which we cannot do. <em>See Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Birsa also' contends that he will suffer persecution if he returns to Moldova because the authorities will detain him based on the allegedly fraudulent convictions. To show a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, he must \u201cestablish a causal connection between [his] political opinion and the feared persecution, presenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he .,. will be singled out for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (emphasis omitted) (quotation marks omitted). He cannot meet that standard because substantial evidence supports the finding that his convictions were not based on his political beliefs. Even if he is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>tained when he returns to Moldova he has not shown that it would be because of his political beliefs. Because substantial evidence supports the findings that Birsa failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, he has not established eligibility for asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\">. He also challenges the denial of CAT relief, but because he did not raise that claim before the BIA, we have no jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). As a result, that part of his petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-18\">. \"We review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\" <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.
