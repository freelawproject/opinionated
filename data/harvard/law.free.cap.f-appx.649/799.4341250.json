Robinson argues that the district court erred in rejecting his claims that: (1) the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to state the weight given to the treating physicians\u2019 opinions, resulting in a lack of substantial evidence; and (2) the ALJ failed to develop a full and fair record. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">We normally review the Commissioner\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is the relevant evidence that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Falge v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 1320, 1322 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">First, we are unpersuaded by Robinson\u2019s claim that the district court erroneously concluded that the ALJ provided substantial evidence for her conclusions and properly stated the weight she gave to the treating physicians\u2019 opinions. It is undisputed that the ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. However, there is no rigid requirement \u201cthat the [ALJ] specifically refer to every piece of evidence in [her] decision,\u201d so long as the decision is not \u201ca broad rejection\u201d that leaves the district court or us with insufficient information to conclude whether the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). When the ALJ\u2019s articulated reasons for assigning limited weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion are supported by substantial evidence, there is no reversible error. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Here, Robinson says that one of his diagnoses was rejected without being weighed: \u201cthe diagnosis of Dr. Guillermo Allende of chronic post-traumatic headaches, which was bolstered by primary care provider, Dr. Sam Korley, and neurologist, Dr. Hasan Mousli.\u201d However, the record reveals that the treating doctors\u2019 headache diagnosis was in fact considered by the ALJ, along with contrary evidence, including clean CT scans, discharges from emergency rooms, treatment with Trama-dol, and the expectation of improvement by a treating physician. After considering all of this, the ALJ determined that Robinson\u2019s headaches were impairments and specifically stated that the impairment was accounted for in the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). The ALJ similarly summarized the medical records for Robinson\u2019s alleged spinal impairments, diabetes, and depression \u2014 including Drs. Eon-ley\u2019s and Mousli\u2019s relevant treatments and diagnoses \u2014 and provided relevant evidence to support her conclusion. Thus, the ALJ articulated reasons supported by substantial evidence for giving limited weight to the treating physicians\u2019 opinions. She also provided sufficient information for us to conclude that she considered Robinson\u2019s medical condition as a whole. There is no reversible error on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">We also reject Robinson\u2019s claim that the district court erroneously concluded that the ALJ developed a full and fair record concerning Robinson\u2019s complaints of right side pain, his testimony of medication side effects, and the effect of the combination of impairments. We recognize that the ALJ has a basic obligation to develop a full and fair record, <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981). While the ALJ has a duty, to develop the record as appropriate, she is not required to order a consultative examination if the record contains sufficient evidence for her to make an informed decision. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1269 (11th Cir.2007). In addition, we may conclude that an ALJ properly considered a combination of impairments if the ALJ stated that the appellant is not suffering from any impairment or a combination of impairments of sufficient severity. <em>Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The ALJ must \u201carticulate specific reasons for questioning the claimant\u2019s credibility\u201d if subjective symptom testimony is \u201ccritical\u201d to the claim. <em>Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cA clearly articulated credibility finding with substantial supporting evidence in the record will not be disturbed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cThe credibility determination does not need to cite particular phrases or formulations but it cannot merely be a broad rejection which is not enough to enable ... [us] to conclude that the ALJ considered [the] medical condition as a whole.\u201d <em>Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1210 (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Here, the ALJ developed a full and fair record and made an informed decision. As for Robinson\u2019s complaints of right side and hand pain, the ALJ held that Robinson\u2019s statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of his symptoms were not credible to the extent they were unsupported by and inconsistent with the objective medical evidence of record, the claimant\u2019s own self reporting, and the RFC assessment. The ALJ supported this finding by explaining that Robinson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ability to do daily activities, including his ability to drive 45 minutes, shop at Wal-Mart, go to church, vacuum, do the dishes, cook light meals, and live alone indicated that he was not limited to the \u201cextent one would expect given [his] complaints of disabling symptoms and limitations.\u201d The ALJ further explained that in order to qualify for unemployment benefits, which Robinson continued to receive, Robinson had to attest that he was ready, willing and able to work, calling in question his position that he was disabled and unable to work. In fact, Robinson testified that he had applied for jobs as a driver, nursing assistant, roofer, construction worker, and janitor, which all required significant physical exertion and indicated that he was less functionally limited than he indicated. The ALJ also acknowledged that Robinson complained of right side body pain, making it difficult to dress and groom, and that the pain allegedly lasted on and off all day. She accounted for this in the RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">On this record, the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding concerning Robinson\u2019s statements of symptoms \u2014 including those regarding his right hand and side pain \u2014 was articulated with substantial supporting evidence in the record. Moreover, because the ALJ based her decision rejecting his complaints of right side and hand pain on'sufficient evidence, she did not err by not ordering a consulting exam for Robinson\u2019s right hand and side pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">As for Robinson\u2019s alleged medication side effects \u2014 which the ALJ did not specifically mention \u2014 the ALJ stated that she had considered <em>all </em>of Robinson\u2019s symptoms based on the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529 and Social Security Ruling 96-4. This regulation specifies that any alleged medication side effects must be considered in evaluating the credibility of a claimant\u2019s statements concerning his limitations and acknowledged the various medications that the claimant took. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(iv). Furthermore, while Robinson testified to medication side effects and reported medication side effects once, he also repeatedly declined to report any medication side effects. Therefore, the ALJ did not fail to consider Robinson\u2019s medication side effects because she said she was required to do so and because she discredited Robinson\u2019s testimony regarding medication side effects when he did not consistently complain of them to doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">As for the combined effects of Robinson\u2019s impairments, the ALJ acknowledged her obligation to consider them, and found that Robinson did not have a combination of impairments that met a listing. These statements show that the ALJ considered Robinson\u2019s impairments in combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order upholding the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
