The.eighth section of the act of Congress of 1863 (12 Stat. at Large, 764), to reorganize the courts of the District of Columbia, and which says, \u201c that if, upon the trial of. the cause, an exception be taken, the bill containing it need not be sealed or signed,\u201d does not dispense with a regular bill of exceptions in the way usual in Circuit Courts of the United States when the rulings of the court, .in admitting or rejecting evidence, or in giving or refusing instructions, are meant to be brought from the Supreme Court of the District to <em>this </em>court for review. The provision has reference to carrying such rulings from the special to the general term of the Supreme Court of -the District <em>itself.</em>\u2014Pomeroy's <em>Lessee </em>v. <em>Bank of Indiana </em>(1 Wallace, 602), approved.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b675-9\"><em>2. A </em>customer of certain bankers at Washington, D. C., in times when, specie payments having been lately suspended, coin was acquiring one value and currency \u00a1(paper money) another and .less, deposited with them both coin.and paper inoney; the different deposits being entered in his pass-book, the one as \u201ccoin\u201d the other as \u201ccurrency,\u201d &amp;c. Debts being at this time payable by law only in coin, the bankers requested their customer to make his' full balance coin, which he did. Congress passed, about eight months afterwards, an act making certain treasury notes lawful money for the payment of debts. The depositor went on depositing \u201ccoin,\u201d and \u201ctreasury notes\u201d then regarded as currency', and both were entered accordingly. He afterwards drew for \u201ccoin,\u201d for a part of his deposit, exceeding the coin deposited <em>after </em>the legal tender act, and his. check was paid in coin. He afterwards drew for \u201ccoin,\u201d \u2014 the bulk of his coin balance deposited <em>before </em>the legal tender act. Coin was refused and tender made of the notes declared by Congress a legal tender. On suit brought to recover the market-value of the coin drawn for \u2014 the bank teller having testified among other things that \u201c after the suspension, and particularly after the act making' treasury notes a legal tender, his employers uniformly made with customer \u25a0 depositing with them a difference1, in receiving and paying their-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>deposits, between coin or specie and paper money, and in all cases when the deposit was in coin they paid the checks of their customers in coin when they called for coin, otherwise they paid currency, treasury or bank notes \u201d \u2014 the plaintiff offered evidence to show \u201c that the usage and mode of dealing between the said parties as set out in the testimony of the teller was uniformly used and practised by all the banks and bankers of the District of Columbia with their customers\u201d\u2014</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b676-6\"><em>Held, </em>that the evidence was rightly excluded.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-7\">Error to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-8\">Riggs &amp; Co. were bankers in the District of Columbia: Thompson was a business man there, keeping a bank account with them, depositing specie, treasury notes, bank notes, bills for collection, in, the ordinary way of bank customers. Prior to April, 1861, no distinction apparently had been made in the mode of entering, in his pass-book, credits of coin and credits of current bank notes, then payable throughout the country in coin, on demand. All kinds of money deposited had been entered in the pass-books alike. In April, 1861, the banks generally suspended specie payments, and a difference between the value of coin and of bank notes, or \u201c current funds,\u201d as these were called, began to show itself, becoming by degrees, for some time, greater. Riggs &amp; Co., at that date, began to make \u00e1 difference in receiving and paying deposits, paying in coin when the deposit was made in coin, and in currency when made in currency. .

Bradley arid Wilson, for the plaintiff in error:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-10\">I. Of course, independently of the act of Congress which organized the Supreme Court of the District, exceptions, in order to take up a case on error, must be signed and sealed by the judge. But that act, in its eighth section, dispenses with this ancient, cumbrous, and really quite useless formality. It declares in terms that if made part of the record (as they were here) bills of exception \u201c need not be sealed or signed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-11\">II. The instructions asked for, and those given, involving the constitutionality of the legal tender act, so far as it makes paper lawful money, are therefore before this court for adjudication. [The counsel then argued in support of the unconstitutionality of this provision of the legal tender act.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-12\">III. The evidence of the usage ought to have been received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-13\">In the latter part of 1861 it had become evident, as every one knows, that coin was ceasing to be the circulating medium of commerce, and was daily appreciating in value. There was a daily increasing difference between gold and silver, which, although a circulating medium, had an <em>intrinsic </em>value, and <em>currency, </em>which was merely the -representative of value. Apprehending that this difference would continue and increase, it was quite natural for all parties dealing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>bankers and customers, to say the one to the other: \u201cIn our dealings we will, for our mutual benefit, distinguish coin from bank and other bills \u2014 both shall be returned in kind\u2014 gold.we will repay with gold, the other we will repay in currency.\u201d Indeed, such agreements were made essential to. commercial safety by. the events that were-then taking place. .They.were modifications of the usual relations between banker and customer, and adjustments to the exigencies of the times; ' \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-6\">The natural inference, .then, from the.entries found in this pass-book, in such a state of the currency \u2014 never made in any pass-book in ordinary times and when gold is not at a premium \u2014 was that such had been the understanding here. The entries of themselves imported as much. As the short entry of numbers in the money columns signified not only that so many dollars had been deposited,,but that so many dollars also were .to be returned, so the most natural import pf the words \u201c coin\u201d and. \u201c treasury notes,f written at the same time and by one pen with, and in immediate juxtaposition to those.numbers, meant not only .that that \u201c coin\u201d or \u201ctreasury notes\u201d had been deposited,:but also that coin and treasury notes were to be paid. Especially was this the most natural meaning, when coin was worth double of treasury notes. The words, indeed, in connection with the known state of the currency, could not well have, any, other-meaning than that which we asserted, unless, we suppose that a man deposits $6600 expecting when he calls for it \u2014 the next hour perhaps \u2014 to receive just $3300..</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-7\">Even the. testimony of Riggs &amp; Co.\u2019s teller, it may be remarked \u2014 though this is not important:, for the whole .matter was' for- the jury \u2014 is direct to the effect of the entries; for he \u2022 states that with-all their other customers Riggs &amp; Co. uniformly paid coin or currency, as one or the other was de~. posited, and, of course, entered in the pass-book. Nor; is this affected by his statement on cross-examination \u2014 that \u201c the <em>same </em>money was never returned to the customer.\u201d Of course it was not. &lt; But only \u201c the like kind\u201d of money. It was not set up at all by Thompson that,he had made a \u201c spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>cial, deposit\u201d in the law s^nse of that word. His money was not marked with an ear-mark, nor in a box or bag. Such deposits are hu\u00ed a charge to bankers. But in times when' gold .is undergoing fluctuations of valu\u00e9 they want gold not the less on .deposit. Going into the, general.funds of the bank, it is theirs. They use it as they' do other deposits, viz., to lend out; and when gold is worth twice as much as currency to lend out at double the rates of currency. In other words, they borrow it as they do'deposits of currency, to 'pay back on draft; not, of course, the identical pieces of gold but only the same number of dollars in gold coin;,in both cases the deposit being in the nature of what the civil law call's a <em>.mutuum. </em>The teller states that \u201cthe books of the bank and the pass-books were- kept as before the suspension <em>\u2014except </em>that the different deposits were designated as being marked respectively coin and currency.\u201d In the exception consists the basis of the claim. He says also that -deposits of \u201c currency\u201d went into the general funds of the bank. But he does not say that deposits of gold ever went into the general mass of the \u201c currency,\u201d or into the general mass 'of anything' except- of the gold itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-4\">The offer was, -therefore, not to contradict or vary a contract, or even to supply an omission in it; but the form of it being very curt and. <em>technical </em>\u2014 in the style of..bankers\u2014 to explain it by showing in what way it \\vas acted'on universally by bankers aud their customers in the District; a way, as ihe teller showed, in which it had been uniformly acted on by these same bankers with their customers generally. This was allowable. The uniform custom of banks in the District of Columbia constitutes a part of the contracts between bankers aud depositors.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The offer, in fact, was iii support of that which, apparently, formed and was the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-5\">Neither was the evidence offered to .vary general law. That, of course, cannot be done. But there is no law that when-gold money is worth twice as much as paper money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>a man depositing goid money and paper money in the same bank may not agree that when he asks for gold money back he shall have it, to the extent of his deposit; being bound also when he has deposited but paper to take paper back.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b684-6\">\n<em>Messrs. Carlisle \u00a3 W. S. Cox, contra, for the hankers, defendants in error :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-7\">I. The objection suggested from the Bench, as to the-absence of any proper bill of exceptions to raise the principal question, the question of constitutionality of the legal-tender act, seems to us well taken. <em>We </em>are instructed, however, to waive any such objection if it be competent for us to do so. The point is not made upon our brief. The argument in support of it may be briefly stated thus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-8\">Final judgments in the Supreme Court of the District are to be examined here, not only in the same cases, but \u201cin the same <em>manner </em>\u201d as formerly. The provision in the eighth section dispensing with seals and signature had reference to appeals from the special term to the general term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-9\">II. Accordingly no question as to <em>instructions </em>can arise here. The case then stands thus \u2014 of an act of Congress making certain notes a legal tender, of a tender in them, and of a refusal; there being no allegation in the court below, so far as appeal\u2019s here, that the law authorizing a tender in notes was not constitutional and of course binding ou all. However, we are ready to argue the constitutional question. [The counsel then argued at length accordingly.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-10\">TTT- To resolve the remaining question \u2014 the admissibility of the supposed usage \u2014 it is only necessary distinctly to understand the true state of facts upon which it arose-</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-11\">This suit is not brought to recover a balance of deposits made in coin <em>after </em>the passage of the legal-tender act. All such deposits were repaid, and largely overpaid, in coin, on the check of May 8th, 1863, for $750. The balance sued for is that which the,passage of the act fouud in the banker\u2019s hands, and which, if it were, as the law contemplates, used in banking, could thereafter only be recovered by the banker for his debtors, in legal-tender notes. The plaintiffs theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>is, that he had only to allow that balance to remain to his credit and thereafter make his demand for gold when the premium should be highest; thus compelling the banker, <em>nolens volens, </em>to be- his broker, and to secure for him all the advantages, with none of the risks, of speculation upon the national currency. The check for $6600 was drawn upwards of two years after the passage of the act; and might with like supposed results have been delayed till gold was at 300. As there was no evidence tending to show that any of this balance was deposited, after the passage of the legal-tender act, it was impertinent to offer proof of the usage where such deposits were made and received as coin. -If the act was to have any operation or vitality at all, it must needs apply to bankers\u2019 balances due-at its passage. Plainly, it was binding on the banker as to debts due.him growing out of the legitimate use of the sums which had been so deposited. To apply it to his receiving hand* and not to his paying hand, would be absurd. The offer was, to defeat the statute by proof of a supposed usage. This was inadmissible.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b685-6\">\n<em>Reply.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV0\">\u2014 That the coin deposits, were made before the tender act passed is unimportant.

Parties went to trial at a special term of the court and the verdict and judgment were for the defendants. Objection was duly taken by the plaintiffs to one of the rulings of the court in excluding certain-testimony offered by them to show the usage' and mode of dealing of'other .banks, and the bill of exceptions to the ruling was regularly drawn out and duly signed and sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Prayers for instructions to the jury were duly presented by the plaintiffs and-they were refused by the court, and other and different instructions were given in their place, but no bill of exceptions in'that behalf was tendered by the plaintiffs, or signed or sealed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Statement in the minutes is that the plaintiffs excepted in-law as well to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury as requested, as to the instructions given, and that the exceptions and -the evidence \u00e1re hereby made record. Plaintiffs also made a.motion for new trial, assigning two causes : \u2022 (1.) Because the'court refused to instruct the jury as prayed by the plaintiffs. (2.) Because the court instructed the .jury as prayed by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Order of the court was that the motion should be heard Defbre the' court at general term. Both parties were heard before the full bench, and. the court afiirmed the judgment as rendered at the special term. , Writ of error to this court was sued out by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">2. Principal questions discussed at the bar are presented, if at al ,,in the prayers for instructions which were refused, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>and in the instructions which were given to the jury. Defendants. contend that neither the prayers for instructions nor the instructions given are before the court, as they are not exhibited in any bill of exceptions signed and sealed by' ,the justice who presided at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A1E\">Settled practice in this court is that neither..the rulings of the court in admitting or rejecting evidence, or in giving or refusing instructions can be brought here for revision,in any other mode than by a regular bill of exceptions. Final judgments in a Circuit Court may be re-examined in this court and reversed or affirmed upon a writ of error, founded upon an agreed statement of facts, a special verdict, a demurrer to a materia] pleading, or a demurrer to evidence, as well as by a bill of exceptions; but none of the other modes will enable the appellate court to revise the rulings of the court in refusing to instruct the jury as requested, or the instructions as given, or the rulings of the court in admitting or rejecting evidence. Such rulings rest in parol and can. only be incorporated into the record by a bill of exceptions, and of course cannot be re-examined in any other way.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">None of the other modes suggested, say the court, in the case of <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Bank of </em>Indiana,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> enable th\u00e9 complaining party to review or re-examine the rulings of the court, except that of the bill of exceptions, and we'reaffirm that rule.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Instructions requested or given rest in parol and do not, in the practice of this court, or in any other court where the common law prevails, become a part of the record, unless made so by a regular bill of exceptions, sealed by the judge who presided at the trial; and it is the well-settled practice in this court that an entry of the ruling in the minutes cannot be of any benefit to the party unless he seasonably re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>duces the same to form and causes it .to be sealed by the judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Views of the plaintiffs are that the bill of exceptions is not necessary in cases removed here from the Supreme Court of this District. Reference is made to the eighth section of the act to organize the courts in this District, as furnishing support to the proposition, but it is quite evident that the section referred to relates exclusively to the practice in the subordinate court, and not to the proceedings for the removal of the cause into this' court for examination and revision. \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Exceptions taken in the trial at the special term, before a single justice, as there provided* may be reduced to writing at the time, or may be entered in the minutes of the justice and settled afterwards in such manner \u00e1s the rules of the. court provide. \u25a0 Such exceptions must be \u201c stated in writing in a case or bill of exceptions, with so much of the evidence as may be material to the-questions to be\u2019raised; but the case or bill of exceptions need not be signed or sealed.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Motion for new trial may also be entertained by the justice who tries the cause, at the same term, in the manner therein described.' \"When such motion, however, is made upon the minutes, an appeal to the general term may be taken from the decision, in which case a bill of exceptions or case shall be settled in the usual manner. Our only purpose in referring to that section is to show, that no part of it has anything to do with the question before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">No one of the clauses mentioned make any provision whatever for a writ of error or appeal to this court. Regu-' lations upon that subject are made by the eleventh section of the same act, which provides that any final judgment, order, or decree of the court may be re-examined, and reversed or affirmed, in the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of error or appeal in the same cases and in like manner as is now provided by law .in reference to the final judgments,- orders, or decrees of the Circuit Court of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>States for this District. Writs of error and appeals were required'to be prosecuted under that law, in the same manner, and und\u00e9r the same regulations as in the case of writs of error or appeals from judgments and decrees rendered in the Circuit Court of th\u00e9 United States.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Conclusion is, that the regulations respecting the removal of cases from the Supreme Court of this District, on writs'of error or appeal, are the same as from the Circuit Courts o'f the United States, and, of course, the questions presented in the prayers for instruction, and in the instructions given to the jury in this case, are not before the cburt, as neither the prayers for instruction, nor the instructions given, are any part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">3. Remaining question arises under the exception to the ruling of the court, in excluding the testimony offered by the plaintiffs to show the usage and mode of dealing of other bankers in this city. The teller of the defendants, called by the plaintiffs, testified that the defendants, prior to the suspension of specie payments in April, 1861, paid all checks drawn upon the bank by their customers iu gold, or its equivalent, except when the deposit had been made in depreciated paper;' that after that time they uniformly made a difference with their customers in receiving and paying their deposits, between coin, or specie, and paper money, and that in all cases where the deposit had been made iu coin, if requested, they paid the chocks in coin; that after the suspension of the banks the defendants refused to receive currency as the equivalent of specie; that currency Continued to be received and credited to customers as before, but went into the general funds of the bank, and the same money was never returned to the customer, and it was not received oh special deposit; that the plaintiffs had never made any special deposits with the defendants; that the books of the bank, and the pass-books were kept as before the suspension, except that the different deposits were designated as coin, cash, checks, or treasury noces.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">4. Testimony of the teller of the bank is express to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>point that the plaintiffs never made any special deposit with\" the defendants, and there is no testimony in the case to support any such theory. Oil the contrary, it is clear that'they made their - deposits for their own, convenience, and were credited for the amount in the usual way on- the books of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"AxH\">Clear inference from the whole testimony is that the deposits of the defendants were made without condition or special agreement off any kind, and\u2019 in such cases the law is well settled that the depositor\" parts with the title to his mdney, and loans it to the bank.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Deposits may be made under circumstances where the legal conclusion would be that the title to the thing deposited remained with the depositor, and in that case the bank would become the bailee of the depositor, and the latter might rightfully demand the identical money deposited as his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Contracts between a banker and his customers are doubtless required to be performed, and must be construed in the same way as contracts between other parties. When the banker specially agrees to pay in bullion or in coin he must do so or answer in damages for its \"value, and so\" if one agrees to pay in depreciated paper, the tender of \"that paper is a good tender, and in default of payment the promissee, can recover only its market and not its nominal value.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">But where the deposit is general, and there is no special agreement proved, the title of the money deposited, whatever it may be, passes to the bank, and the transaction is unaffected by the character of the money in which the deposit was made, and the bank becomes liable for the amount as a debt, which can only be discharged by such money as is by law a legal tender.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Moneys deposited with the bank in this case were entered in a pass-book in figures, expressing the amount in dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>and cents, and it appears that the- character of the money deposited'is marked against each.sum as coin, cash, check, or treasury notes, as the fact was' in each particular instance. Such marks, however, are wholly insufficient to overcome the testimony of the teller, who was introduced by the plaintiffs, and who was the only witness examined upon the subject. Proof that those words were written against the several deposits for any such purpose as is supposed by the plaintiffs is entirely wanting; and in the absence of-such proof it.is much, more reasonable to infer that they were put there as matter of convenience to the depositor, or to assist the memory as to the amount of the respective credits, in case of misrecollection or dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">No evidence of general usage or custom, in the ordinary sense of those terms, was offered by the plaintiffs or appears in the record. Customary rights and incidents universally attaching to the subject-matter of the contract in the place where it was made are impliedly annex\u00e9d to the language and terms of the contract, unless the custom is particularly and expressly excluded. But evidence of usage is not admitted to Contradict or vary express stipulations restricting .or enlarging the exercise and enjoyment of the customary right. Omissions may be supplied, in some cases, by the introduction of such proof, but it cannot prevail over or nullify the express provisions and stipulations of the-contract. So where there is no contract usage will not make one, as it can only, be admitted either to interpret the meaning of the language employed by the parties in the absence of express stipulations, or where the meaning is equivocal or obscure.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Judge Story expressed himself strongly against local usages or customs in -particular trades or kinds of business, set up to controvert or annul the general liabilities of parties under the common law as well as. under the commercial law, and remarked that there was great dang\u00e9r in admitting evidence of such loose and inconclusive usages and Customs often un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>known to parties, and always liable to great misunderstanding and misinterpretations, and allow it to outweigh the well-known and ivell-settled principles of law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Usage contrary to law, or inconsistent with the contract, is never admitted to control the general rules of law or the real intent and meaning of the parties.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aua\">Evidence of local usage to sell commercial paper, pledged as a security for a loan, at private sale after demand of payment, and notice that such sale would be made in case of default, was hold to be inadmissible in the Court of Appeals in the State of New York, all the judges concurring.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Evidence &gt;f the usage of banks to regard drafts drawn upon them, payable at a day certain, as checks, and not entitled to days of grace, is inadmissible as evidence to control the rules of lawr in relation to such paper.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">General rule of law is, that if a merchant deposits money with a bank, the title to the money passes to the bank, and the latter becomes the debtor of the merchant to that amount; and it is not perceived that the evidence offered, if it had been admitted, could have had any other effect .than to control that general rule of law, as it is not pretended that the evidence showed a special deposit or any special contract. Viewed in any light consistent with the other evidence in the record, the testimony was either entirely immaterial or inadmissible, as tending to control the well-settled rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\"> Suydam <em>v. </em>Williamson, 20 Howard, 432.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\"> 1 Wallace, 602.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b687-11\"> Bulkeley <em>v. </em>Butler, 2 Barnewall &amp; Cresswell, 434; Seward <em>v. </em>Jackson, 8 Cowen, 406; 2 Tidd\u2019s Practice, 896; 4 Chitty\u2019s General Practice, 7; 2 Institutes, 427; Dougherty <em>v </em>Campbell, 1 Blackford, 24; Cole <em>v. </em>Driskel, Id. 16; Strother <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 4 Bingham, N.
