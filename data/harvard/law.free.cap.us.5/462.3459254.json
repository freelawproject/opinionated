He demurred to the indictment, and the division of opinion arose upon the question presented by the demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-9\">In the five cases from New Jersey, citizens and residents of that State were severally indicted for the same offence. They set up, by way of plea, the statute of New Jersey prohibiting the'business, for carrying on which, without obtaining a license and payment of the required duty, they were .indicted. The district attorney demurred to each of these pleas, and in each case there was a j udgrnent-for the defendants upou demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-10\">In the case from Massachusetts, the defendant was in-dieted for carrying on the business of retailing liquors without license, to which indictment there was a demurrer. A statement of facts was agreed on to the effect that the' defendant- was a retail dealer as charged,-and that this business was prohibited by the laws of the commonwealth. And the division of opinion occurred on the question presented by the pleadings and this agreed statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-11\">The'general question in these cases was: Can the defendants be legally convicted upon the several indictments found against them for not having complied-with the acts of Congress by taking out and paying for the required licenses'to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>carry on the business in which they were engaged, such business being wholly prohibited by the laws of the several States in which it was carried on ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">In one of the two remaining cases 'the defendant was indicted for being .engaged in the business of a lottery dealer, and in the other for being engaged in the business of a lottery ticket dealer, in New York, without having paid the special tax required by law. In each case there was a demurrer and joinder in demurrer. The division of opinion occurred upon the pleadings, and the question certified was the same in each case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">In these two cases, therefore, the general question was: Could the defendants be legally convicted upon an indictment for being engaged in a business on which a special tax is imposed by acts of Congress, without having paid such a special tax, notwithstanding that such business was, and is, wholly prohibited by the laws of New York?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\">The different cases were argued here for the different defendants by different counsel, <em>Mr. W. M. Emrts </em>representing the defendants in the New York cases, <em>Mr. Senott </em>the defendant in the case from Massachusetts, and <em>Mr. Woodbury </em>(by brief), one of the defendants in the cases, each like the other, from New Jersey.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-9\">\n<em>Argument for the defendants :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-10\">The provisions of the acts of Congress under which these indictments are found, if regarded as <em>legislation for the suppression and punishment of crime, </em>which selling lottery tickets is regarded in New York and New Jersey to be, as retailing liquor is also regarded in Massachusetts, would be consistent with morality, but, being beyond the competency of Congress, under the Constitution of the United States, would be void; for no question can be made that the whole jurisdiction over domestic crimes and misdemeanors within its territory rests with each State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-11\">The validity and the construction, therefore, of the acts of Congress, the violation of which, within the States of New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, is imputed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the defendants as a crime, must depend upon considerations appropriate to these acts as <em>Revenue Laws.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-6\">How, in this aspect, are they to be regarded ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-7\">1. Congress cannot, constitutionally, punish for a refusal to pay for a license to commit crime, or constitutionally levy a tax for the privilege of committing it. Such a mode of raising revenue would be palpably against public policy. It matters not whether the crime or offence was <em>malum in se </em>or <em>malum prohibitum. </em>Vending lottery tickets and vending liquors appear to be regarded in some of the States, \u2014 perhaps from the consequences to which vending them often lead \u2014 as <em>mala in se. </em>But whether or not, with the States,\u2014 not with Congress, \u2014 rests (confessedly, we suppose) a complete and exclusive right to say whether such acts are criminal or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">2. The various acts of New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, on the subject of dealing in lotteries and retailing liquor, were perfectly known to Congress; and it is apparent that the frame and purpose of the scheme of taxation made by Congress in regard to the two matters now before the court, assume the business of lotteries and vending liquors to be open and lawful pursuits, in the gains of which the Federal government\u2019may rightfully participate, and which can endure the regulation in protection of the tax imposed, which these provisions of law establish, and yet yield the revenue sought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-9\">But such a scheme of taxation applied to communities whoso exclusive and paramount legislation proscribes the taxed pursuit as common and public nuisances, imputes .every step in such pursuit as a crime, and punishes every transaction out of which the tax is raised by fine and imprisonment, and requires every grand jury to be specially charged to inquire into every perpetration of these crimes* is an absurdity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-10\">If the acts of Congress had, in terms, provided \u201c that no person should, within the different States of New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, perpetrate the crime of selling lottery ti'ckets or liquor, without having first paid.to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>United. States $100, and registered his name and the place where he intended to perpetrate these crimes, and given bond that he would account to the United States for a fair share of the lucre which the crimes brought him,\u201d &amp;c.,- \u2014 o\u00ed all this were expressed in the acts of Congress, it would have been no more a taxation of crime than it is now asserted to be in reference to these different. States by the attempts made in the courts below to punish for the non-impetration of a license or to enforce the collection of the tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-6\">Suppose that a State, while proscribing and punishing all dealing in liquor or in lottery tickets, should enact as its law the scheme of taxation upon selling liquor and upon lotteries which Congress has adopted. Could a more absurd example of cross-purposes in legislation be imagined ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-7\">But the absurdity is .in the absolute repugnancy of the two courses of legislation, and is inherent in them. This repugnancy is equally great, though the Federal government is the author of one and the State government of the other of the opposing laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-8\">In this repugnancy between an act of Congress raising a revenue from crime in a State, and the legislation of the State suppressing the crime, there can be no doubt of the supremacy of the State legislation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-9\">Whatever room for argument there may be as to the competency of State legislation to extinguish material products, as sources of internal revenue to the United States, by proscription of their <em>legal </em>use while their <em>actual </em>use continues, it can never be tolerated that personal vice and guilt constitute a fund for Federal taxation, which ousts the States of police and penal regulation of the personal conduct of their inhabitants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-10\">Hence, upon the natural construction of these acts of Congress, not less than upon the foregoing reasons, it is to be inferred that this revenue is sought to be\u2019 raised only when and where the pursuit taxed is a lawful occupation, and admits of the methods for its regulation and the collection of the tax prescribed by Congress.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>3. If this is not a correct view; if Congress meant to exact the license and lay the tax wherever lotteries or liquors were dealt in, \u2014 whether declared crimes by the States or not, \u2014 :there remains another argument:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-6\">A license to carry on a particular business is an authority to carry it on. The licensee pays a valuable consideration and gets, or rather \u201cpurchases, a right\u201d to do what he is licensed to do.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The trades or businesses here licensed were part of the internal trade of the States; a sort of trade over which, as we have said, Congress has no jurisdiction. And the States have declared them nuisances and crimes, and forbidden them to be carried on at all. The license proffered, and the special tax attempted to be laid, were thus void, and no penalty could he imposed for refusing either to accept the license or pay the tax</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-7\">Indeed, it is obvious that if a State, by prohibitory legislation, withdraw a large class of articles from taxation, Congress must either lose the revenue or. protect the citizen in its violation of the State law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">But Congress, as we have said, cannot dictate the domestic law of any State. And this court has decided, recently,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> that a license from the United States is no protection to the licensee against acts forbidden by the State laws.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-9\">\n<em>Mr. Speed, A.

There are, undoubtedly, fundamental principles of morality and justice which no legislature is at liberty to disregard; but it is equally undoubted that no court, except in the clearest eases, can properly impute the disregard of those, principles to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">And it is difficult to perceive wh,erein the legislation we are called upon to consider is contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">This court can know nothing of public policy except from the Constitution and the laws, and the course of administration and decision. It. has no legislative powers. It cannot amend or modify any legislative acts. It cannot examine questions as expedient or inexpedient, as politic or impolitic. Consid\u00e9ratious of that sort must, in general, be addressed to the legislature. Questions of policy determined there are concluded here.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">There are cases, it is true, in which-arguments drawn from public policy must have large influence; but these are eases in which the course of legislation and administration do not leave any doubt upon the question what the public policy is, and in which what would otherwise be obscure or of doubtful interpretation, may be cleared and resolved by reference to what is already received and established.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">The cases before us are not of this sort. The legislature has thought fit, by enactments clear of all ambiguity, to impose penalties for unlicensed dealing in lottery tickets and in liquors. These enactments, so long as they stand, unrepeal\u00e9d and unmodified, express the public policy in regard to the subjects of them. The proposition that they are contrary to public policy is therefore a contradiction-in terms, or it is intended as a denial of their expediency or their propriety. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>intended in the latter sense, the proposition is one of which, courts cannot take cognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We come now to examine a more serious objection to the legislation of Congress in relation to the dealings in controversy. It was argued for the defendants in error that a license to carry on a particular business gives an authority to cany it on; that the dealings in controversy were parcel of the internal trade of the State in which the defendants resided; that the internal trade of a State is not subject, in any respect, to legislation by Congress, and can neither be licensed nor prohibited bj^ its authority; that licenses for such trade, granted under acts of Congress, must therefore be absolutely null and void; and, consequently, that penalties for carrying on such trade without such license could not be constitutionally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">This series of propositions, and the conclusion in which it terminates, depends on the postulate that a license necessarily confers an authority to carry on the licensed business. But do the licenses required by the acts of Congress for selling liquor and lottery tickets confer any authority whatever ?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">It is not doubted that where Congress possesses constitutional power to regulate trade or intercourse, it may regulate by means of licenses as well as iu other modes; and, in case of such regulation, a license will give to the licensee autnority to do whatever is authorized by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Thus, Congress having power to l\u2019egulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes, may, without doubt, provide for granting coasting licenses, licenses to pilots, licenses to trade with the Indians, and any other licenses necessary or proper for the exercise of that great and extensive power; and the same observation is applicable to every other power of Congress, to the exercise of which the granting of licenses may be incident. All such licenses confer authority, and give rights to the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">But very different considerations apply to the internal commerce or domestic trade of the States. Over this commerce and trade Congress has no power of regulation nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>any direct control. This power belongs exclusively to the States. No interference by Congress with the business o\u00ed citizens transacted within a State is warranted by the Constitution, except such as i.s strictly incidental to the exercise of powers clearly granted to the legislature. The power to authorize a business within a State is plainly repugnant to the exclusive power of the State over the same subject. . It is true that the power of Congress to tax is a very extensive power. It is given in the Constitution, with only one exception and. only two qualifications. Congress cannot tax exports, and it must impose direct taxes by the rule of apportionment, and indirect taxes by the rule of uniformity. Tnus limited, and thus only, it roaches every subject, and may be exercised at discretion. But it reaches only existing subjects. Congress cannot authorize a trade or business withiu a State in order to tax it.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">If, therefore, the licenses under consideration must be regarded as giving authority to carry on the branches of business which they license, it might be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the granting of them with-the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">But it is not necessary to regard these laws as giving such authority. So far as they relate to trade within State limits, they give none, and can give none. They simply express the purpose of the government not to interfere by penal proceedings with the trade nominally licensed, if the required taxes are paid. The power to tax is not questioned, nor the power to impose penalties for non-payment of taxes. The granting of a license, therefore, must be regarded as nothing more than a mere form of imposing a tax, aud of implying nothing except that the licensee shall be subject to no penalties under national law, if ho pays it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak4\">This construction is warranted by the practice of the government from its organization.- As early as 1794 retail dealers in wines or in foreign distilled liquors were required to obtain and pay for licenses, and renew them annually, and penalties were imposed for carrying oh the business without compliance with the law.* In 1802 these license-taxes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the other excise or internal taxes, which had been imposed under the exigencies of the time, being no longer needed, were abolished.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In 1813 revenue from excise was again required, and laws were enacted for the licensing of retail dealers in foreign merchandise, as well as to retail dealers in wines and various descriptions of liquors.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> These taxes also were abolished after fhe necessity for them had passed away, in 1817.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> No claim ivas ever made that .the licenses thus required gave authority to exercise trade or carry on business within a State.\" They were regarded merely as a convenient mode of imposing taxes on several descriptions of business, and of ascertaining the parties from whom such taxes were to be collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">With this course of legislation in view, we cannot say that there is anything contrary to the Constitution in these provisions of the recent or existing internal revenue acts relating to licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Nor are we able to perceive the force of the other objection made in argument, that the dealings for which licenses are required being prohibited by the laws of the State, cannot-bo taxed by the National government. There would be great force in it if the licenses were regarded as giving authority, for then there would be a direct conflict between National and State legislation on a subject which the Constitution places under the exclusive control of the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">But, as we have already said, these licenses give no authority. They are mere receipts for taxes. And this would be true had the internal revenue act of 1864, like those of 1794 and 1813, been silent on this head. But it was not silent. It expressly provided, in section sixty-seven, that no license provided for in it should, if granted, be construed to authorize any business within any State or Territory prohibited by the laws thereof, or so as to prevent the taxation of the same business by the State. This provision not only recognizes the full control by the States of business carried on within their limits, but extends the same principle, so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>as such business licensed by the National government is concerned, to the Territories.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">There is nothing hostile or contradictory, therefore, in the acts of Congress to the legislation of the States. What the latter prohibits, the former, if the businesses found existing notwithstanding the prohibition, discourages by taxation. The two lines of legislation proceed in the same direction, and tend to the same result. It would be a judicial anomaly, as singular as indefensible, if we should hold a violation of the laws of the State to be a justification for the violation of the laws of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">These considerations require an affirmative answer to the first general question, Whether the several defendants, charged with carrying on business prohibited by State laws, without the licenses required by acts of Congress, can be convicted and condemned to pay the penalties imposed by these acts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The remaining question is, Whether the defendant, in-dieted for carrying on a business on which a special tax is imposed by the internal reveuue law, but which is prohibited by the laws of New York, can be convicted and condemned to pay the penalty imposed for not having paid that tax?</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">What has been already said sufficiently indicates our judgment upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Congress, in framing the act of 1866, has carefully guarded against any misconstruction of the legislative intention by substituting throughout the term \u201c special tax\u201d for the word \u201c license.\u201d This j udicious legislation has removed all future possibility of the error which has been common among persons engaged in particular branches of business, that they derived from the licenses they obtained under the internal revenue laws, an authority for carrying on the licensed business independently of State regulation and control. And it throws, moreover, upon the previous legislation all the light of a declaratory enactment. It fully confirms, if confirmation were needed, the view we have already expressed, that the requirement of payment for licenses under former laws was a mere form of special taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>The act of 1866 contains the same provision in respect to the effect of special taxes which the original act of 1864 contained in respect to licenses. It provides expressly that the payment of the taxes imposed by it shall not exempt any person carrying on a trade or business from any penalty or punishment provided by State laws for carrying on such trade or busiuess, or authorize the commencement or continuance of any such trade or business contrary to State laws, or prevent the imposition of any duty or any tax on such trade or business by State authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">It was insisted by counsel that whatever might be the power, it could not have been the intention of Congress to tax any business prohibited by State laws. And the argument from public policy was much relied upon in support of this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We think it unnecessary to repeat the answer already made to this argument, when urged against the requirements of licenses. It is, if possible, less cogent against the direct imposition of a tax on a prohibit\u00e9d business than against the indirect imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">It may, however, be properly said that the law of 1866 was enacted after the arguments of the last term, and that Congress imposed these special taxes with the distinct understanding that several branches of business thus taxed were prohibited by State legislation. This is conclusive as to the intention. The hypothesis we are asked to adopt would nullify some of the plainest provisions of the act, and is inadmissible. The question must be answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Upon the whole, we conclude\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">1.
