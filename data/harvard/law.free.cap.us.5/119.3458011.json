Whether words in a devise constitute common law conditions annexed to an estate, a breach of which or any one of which, will work a forfeiture, defeat the devise, and let in the heirs, or whether they are regulations for the management of the estate, and explanatory of the terms under which it was intended to have it managed, is a matter to be gathered,' not from a particular expression in the devise, but from the whole instrument.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b131-8\">2. The word <em>Provided, </em>though an appropriate word to constitute a common law condition, does not invariably and of necessity do so.

A full argument will be allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agd\">Three questions arise:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-12\">I. Had the society power under the will itself, to sell and convey this property to Colt without incurring a forfeiture?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>II. If it had not such power under the will, was it enabled so to do by the act of the legislature of 1852 ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-6\">III. If the society had no power .to. convey from either source, what consequence results from its violation of the condition of the devise ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-7\">That the legal, estate is in the church must, we suppose,. b\u00bf conceded. The devise is, in plain terms, to it-in fee: \u201c I give and devise the whole of my <em>\u00e9state. </em>. . <em>unto the Second or South Ecclesiastical Society </em>... to be and remain to the use and .benefit of said Second or South' Society and their successors forever.\u201d No legal estate is given to the trustees. They are but to \u201c superintend, direct, and manage.\u201d This is exactly what any mere agent of restricted powers would do in regard to any estate, of which confessedly the fee would be in-his constituent. Mere directions to.,one person to superintend, direct, and even to manage, cannot carry to <em>him </em>the legal estate given in plain, appropriate, and even technical terms to another in fee; even assuming that it might do so, if the legal estate were left undisposed of; \u2014 . which we do not admit. Inference cannot control direct expression. The trustees were'to have no powers but what were necessary to the office of superintendence, direction, and management of an estate that was never \u20206 be \u201c divided,\u201d but which was \u201cto remain entire and fot ever to the said Second Society.\u201d The legal estate then was given to the church.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A8x\">The heirs of Stanley say then :</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-9\">I. The society, under the provisions of the will, could not sell without'violating the condition upon which they held the property, and thus, incurring a forfeiture of their title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-10\">Both by the obvious <em>intent </em>of the testator and by the legal effect of the words used, this devise is of an estate upon condition subsequent, a breach of which destroys all right of the society in the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-11\">1. The will shows that the testator <em>meant </em>to deprive the society of the power to sell. He meant that this property should <em>always </em>remain in the hands of the society. He believed that the property would increase in value, and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>a sure increasing fund would supply the society\u2019s increased wants, while if the land was sold and the money invested, the society would receive no larger amount a hundred years thereafter, than at that day. He also d\u00e9sired that he should be-remembered in connection with this society forever. He had an obvious pride of family name and estate, and an attachment plainly to\u2019this particular Second or South Church. He desires his \u201carms\u201d and name to be put upon a sacramental tankard \u201cto be kept forever.\u201d He leaves to his niece a piece of land that belonged to his \u201chonored father, Colonel Nathaniel Stanley, deceased.\u201d To his sister, he leaves for life another piece, \u201c but she shall not cut any of the trees.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">The bulk of the real estate he leaves in fee to the church, separating the real estate from all power to manage it, and giving neither to the devisee nor to the trustees a power to sell the estate; but on the contrary, showing- that he meant it should never be sold or disintegrated. He looks forward to the possibility of a divisioil of the religious body, and provides against any <em>division </em>of his estate from even that cause; declaring that if the society should <em>uever </em>hereafter\u201d be divided, his real estate left to the existing body should \u201c be not divided, but remain entire and <em>-forever </em>to the said Second Society.\u201d ^</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">The courts in Connecticut have held, that where land was devised to an ecclesiastical society, the intent of the donor s shown <em>by that very act </em>to be that it should not be sold.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-8\">The means adopted by the testator to accomplish this intent, are the most effectual that cjould be conceived for his purpose. He did not intrust the accomplishment of his object to the society, to the legislature, or even to courts of equity. He determined to make it the <em>interest of the society and its members </em>to use the gift as he directed, by causing a forfeiture to follow their misuse.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-9\">He used apt words to carry out this intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-10\">In construing wills, courts are governed by certain well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>settled rules.. Oiie of these rules, the seventeenth in Mr. Jarman\u2019s series, is :<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">\u201c Where a testator uses technical words, he is presumed to employ them in their legal sense, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">The obligation of the rule is nowhere more recognized than in Connecticut, where in <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Judson,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court say: \u201cWe are <em>bound </em>to suppose the testator used language in its usual legal sense.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-8\">The word <em>Provided </em>is a technical word: its meaning has been settled by innumerable decisions, and ithas always.been held that a devise to <em>Aprovided </em>he should or should perform certain acts, is a devise upon a condition subsequent, and the estate vests in A., subject to being divested if he does or does not perform the acts specified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-9\">This is the rule in Connecticut.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-10\">In <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Tuttle,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Swift, J., says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-11\">\u201cThere is no word more proper to import or express a condition, than the word provided, and it shall always be so taken unless it appear from the context to be the intent of the party that it shall constitute a covenant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-12\">These words were cited and approved in the subsequent case of <em>Rich </em>v.

Walker.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-13\">This decision is the more obligatory, as it has been affirmed by subsequent Connecticut decisions,<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> and has, ever since.they w'ere made, been considered as fixing the law in the State of Connecticut on this subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-14\">.

In relation to wills, he says:<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">\u201c So words in a will make a condition which will not make it in a deed. So a devise to A. <em>provided, and my will is that he keep it in repair, </em>makes a condition; so there shall be a condition in a will though there be no words that the estate shall cease, as a devise to a wife, <em>provided that she shall have a rent only if she departs out of London.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-10\">Similar decisions as to the effect.of the word \u201c provided \u201d have been made in most if not all the States, and in England.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-11\">In <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>a case in Maine,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> the expression was <em>\u201cprovided </em>they (the grantees) fence the land and keep it in repair.\u201d' The question arose whether this word created a condition, and the court say :</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-12\">.\u201c\u25a0We may-assume that the <em>proviso </em>in the deed created a condition subsequent, and in this we are sustained by most if not all the authorities ancient and modern.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-13\">In the New Hampshire case of <em>Chapin </em>v.

The possibility of reverter, being a vested interest in real property, is capable at all times of being released to the person holding the estate on condition or his grantee, and if so released vests an absolute and indefeasible title thereto.

There a devise of land was made-to an orphan asylum, with a provision that the land be never sold, but the rents and profits only be applied to- the use of the asylum. . The legislature, by a special act, directed that part of the .land be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-9\">The court held unanimously that the act was void and- unconstitutional..</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-10\">If the legislature can, by a special act, dispense with the performance of one condition of a devise, they can with any.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-11\">Such an act as this is different from those enabling or healing acts often passed, such as those authorizing a sale of minors\u2019 lands,.or those of lunatics, &amp;c. In-all such cases they merely remove a <em>personal disability.</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Acts, too, will be cited on the other side in which power has been given to corporations to sell, where in the gifts to them no such power was expressly given. Such eases are from the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pose. To say nothing about the constitutionality or safety of this sort of legislation in general, it may be noted that'in many cases the legislature has only aided an intent of a donor left unexpressed or but insufficiently given, or cases in which perhaps the legislature was itself the donor. But can any case be found where, <em>without' the assent of the heirs, </em>a power to destroy the identity and substance of the gift has been given in any case where it was, plain that the testator meant to keep the laud <em>in specie, </em>forever undivided in the corporation, beneficiary, and devisee? What is proper to be done in any case where heirs may have an interest, and what the legislature of Connecticut itself has done, may be seen in the Acts of Connecticut, May Sessions, 1850, at page 82. There Thaddeus and Eunice Burr, she owning it, had granted a lot for a parsonage. An act reciting that the land was not now and never could be wanted for a parsonage, and that a sale was desirable and expedient, authorized a sale. But how ? It declares the sale is to be made \u201c with the assent of the <em>heirs of the said Eunice;\u201d </em>and the act authorized the heirs to release a condition in the deed, in <em>the presence of witnesses; </em>and such release, it was_ enacted, \u201c shall operate to forever estop said heirs, and all claiming under them.\u201d This is the right way; and in no other way, assuredly, in a case like the present, could a sale be authorized and the right of property in the heirs he duly respected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">It will be argued that a legislature has power as <em>.parens patrice </em>to interfere and authorize a sale of land in cases like the one at bar; but the authorities say'that the legislatures in this country have no such power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">In <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a Kentucky case, the court say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-8\">\u201cWe do not admit that the commonwealth as. <em>parens patrice </em>can rightfully interfere, unless there has been an escheat to her, and then she can become absolute and beneficial owner.

In that case there was a devise to a town upon condition that they erect a school-house, which they neglected to do, and the land was thereby forfeited. An action to recover it was brought by the heirs of the residuary devisee, and the court held that there was a <em>contingent interest </em>left in the devisor, which by the residuary devise he gave to the residuary devisee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-11\">This accords with the law in Connecticut.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-12\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Pendell,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in that State, the court say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-13\">\u201cThe right of H., therefore, was more than a naked possibility like that of an heir apparent; <em>it was an interest in the </em>estate, though a contingent one.

The court held, in a very well-considered opinion, that an act affecting this exemption from, taxation was contrary to this clause of the Constitution of the United States, and based their opinion upon the case of <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>Wilson,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in this court, and quote and affirm the words above cited from <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Woodbridge.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-11\">These cases have been affirmed by decisions in Connecticut down to the present time.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-12\">The decisions of this court equally establish the proposition, especially the case of <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward,</em><footnotemark><em>\u01c1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where Marshall, C.

They then say, that this being a question of exemption from taxation, they shall construe the conveyance strictly and so as not to extend such exemptions. And they find a distinction between this and the former cases, that in them \u201c the donor' had, by the express terms of the grant, impressed upon the property a perpetual sequestration' for the maintenance of the ministry, &amp;c.\u201d They say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-12\">\u201cNothing of this is to be found in the deed of Mrs. Burnham, but, on, the other hand, the deed expressly declares the gift is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Bure and absolute feo simple, without any manner of condition. Of course the'grantor does not require that the property should\" be sequestered, or kept, or used for the maintenance of the ministry, nor does she declare any particular intent whatever, unless the general character and corporate powers of the society imply one, which we think is not the case. .' . . We are unable to distinguish this grant from any absolute'purchase made by the society generally, or from any unqualified gift made to it. . . . We discover in Mrs. Burnham\u2019s deed-nothing but an unqualified transfer of property, which may be used at the pleasure of the grantees;-no restriction, no sequestration, for any public object. The society may do with it as they please; they may sell it, or use it, or give it away, without-being liable to any one.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-7\">The case at bar differs therefore entirely from the case of <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Hartford </em>in the very points mentioned by the court as the ones in which that case differed from those theretofore decided. <em>This </em>property <em>was </em>sequestered and restricted. If the donor had any intent, it was that this land should be perpetually sequestered for the use of the society. If Mr. Stanley had merely devised this property <em>to the society, </em>saying no more, it might be argued that <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Hartford </em>applied, especially if he had said that he devised it \u201c without any manner of condition,\u201d instead of annexing, as' he has done, this express condition to it, and repeating it over and over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-8\">But if this devise does not come under the expression, \u201c for the maintenance of the ministry of the Gospel,\u201d it cer: t-ainly does under that of \u201c other public and charitable use.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-9\">III. This devise being upon condition that the society should not sell and convey this land, and they \u25a0 having broken the condition, what is the effect of such violation?</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-10\">Of course, that the heirs of the devisor may enter, declare the devise forfeited by the breach, and recover the property devised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-11\">In <em>Hayden </em>v. Stoughton,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> already cited, and affirmed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Shattuck,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and again in <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Cambridgeport,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>land was given for a school-house, provided it was built in a certain spot. It was not so built, and the residuary devisee entered for breach, and brought this action to recover the land. The court held the devise conditional, and found that there had been a breach, and thereby the estate was forfeited and went to the claimants.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-6\">It may be argued that even if the society have broken the condition of the devise, the land is not thereby forfeited, but that a court of chancery, either under the principle of <em>cy pres </em>or its authority over trusts, is the only power that can interfere with the sale. But in Connecticut the courts of chancery have not adopted and do not apply the principle of <em>cy pres.</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And this court will follow the rule in Connecticut.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-7\">Nor would the principle of <em>cy pres, </em>or its jurisdiction over trusts, ever empower a court of chancery to authorize or relieve against a breach of the condition of a devise.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-8\"><em>Messrs.

The public have an interest in the execution of public charities, and the beneficiaries have an interest, and if the directions contained in the will of the testator, either as to the manner of enjoyment or the objects who are to be benefited by his bounty, are departed from, either the public or the beneficiaries, if they are sufficiently certain, and have a sufficient vested interest, may have a remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-6\">But the heir has no interest and no right, and therefore can have no remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-7\">There are certain elementary rules that are to be.applied in order to determine whether such a condition has been created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-8\">1. That it depends upon the intention of the testator, to be gathered, not from particular phrases having a technical import, but fro-m an examination of all the provisions of the will which can have any bearing on the matter in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWE\">2. That although the <em>law </em>allows testators to impose conditions subsequent, a breach of ivhich will create a forfeiture, yet the law deems it improbable that testators will do so, and therefore leans against any construction which would result in such a condition. Courts will not give it that effect by construction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-10\">Words of proviso and condition will be construed into words of covenant when such is the apparent intention and meaning of the parties.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-11\">Formerly courts of law did not recognize or admit the power of the court of chancery to enforce the performance of covenants and the execution of trusts, and therefore words which would not now be construed to import a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>condition were allowed to have that effect when such a construction was necessary to give a remedy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">Charities are favored in law, and they have always received a more liberal construction than\u2019 the law will allow in gifts to individuals; and the same words in a will, when applied to individuals, may require a different construction when applied to \u00e1 charity.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-7\">But there is a preliminary question which, if answered one way, would seem to be decisive of the case in any aspect of it, and that question is, In whom was the legal title to the estate which was devised vested by the will?</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-8\"><em>We </em>contend that the legal estate vested in the trustees, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-9\">1. It is\u2019 a rule of law that where trustees are named in a will it is not necessary that the testator should say in terms that he gives the legal estate to them. Nor that he should describe the quantity of legal estate which he intends to give them. If trustees are namfed the law looks to see what powers are conferred upon them and what duties are required of them, and then considers that.it was the testator\u2019s intention to give them such a legal estate as would enable them to execute those powers and discharge those duties.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-10\">2. Such powers are conferred upon these trustees and such duties required of them as to make it necessary that they should take a legal estate, to enable them to execute those powers and perform those duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-11\">This will is inartificial, and, perhaps, confused, but reading the whole instrument, \u2014 taking all its provisions together, \u2014 \u2022 we find that the testator appoints three of his friends <em>trus</em>tees, that to these trustees he gives the possession of this real estate. The tankard is to be bought from the first rents issuing from his lands, \u201c by my trustees after it comes to their possession.\u201d . . . He provides that they are to hold the estate and to rent the same, and receive the rents and profits, and to do all other legal acts for the \\vell ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>and management of said estate. The office, powers, and duties of the trustees, like the trust, are made perpetual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">The trustees, and they alone, are to have the possession of this estate. The trustees, and'they alone, are to have the power to lease and manage it. They are to collect the rents. They are to pay them over to the society; and, of course, to enable them to discharge these duties, and execute these 'powers,and to do all other legal acts for the well managing of the property,\u201d it was necessary that they should take the legal estate, and therefore the law will presume -that the testator intended them to take it,'and will declare accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-7\">In .order to show that there has been any breach of condition by reason of the alienation of this land, the plaintiffs themselves must show that the legal title wa3 vested in trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-8\">The conveyance of this land purports to have been made by four persous, three of whom were trustees under this will, and a fourth was \u00e1 gentleman nominated by the legislature, to represent the public interest. Upon these four persons, the legislature, by their act, undertook to confer the authority to make this conveyance, and when they make the conveyance they say they act by force of authority conferred upon them by the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-9\">The defendants' contend that this act of the legislature was unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-10\">\u25a0 They are obliged to say so, for if the act was constitutional, then the sale was legal, and passed a title to the property;</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-11\">If the act was unconstitutional and void, and the legal title was in the corporation, it still remains there, and there has been no sale, and consequently no breach of condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-12\">The corporation could be divested of the legal title only by a conveyance made in the name of the corporation, and under-the seal of the corporation, by some person expressly authorized by the corporation to make it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-13\">The agents of the corporation, as such, have no power to convey the real estate of the corporation. But this convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>anee was not made by these persons under any authority conferred on them by the corporation. They did not affix the seal of the corporation. They say in the deed that they act. by virtue of authority conferred upon them by the .act of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">If then, by the terms of the will, the legal title vested in the society, and if the act of the legislature is void, the legal title still remains in the'society, and there has been no breach of condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-7\">We have said that the plaintiffs, in order to recover, must show that the devise was upon some condition, the. breach of which would be attended by a forfeiture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-8\">We submit how,- that upon the whole will, and looking at all its provisions, no such condition can be found. It is true that the word <em>\u201cProvided\u201d </em>in certain connections, and undercei\u2019tain circumstances, is competent to raise a condition\u201d, and it is equally certain that the same word, used in a different connection, and under different circumstances, will not create a condition. The court will therefore seek to discover the intention of the testator' in this particular, not by considering what legal force some particular word' in the will might have in the abstract, but by looking at all the provisions of the will, and the connection in which the word is used, and thus from an examination of the whole, will ascertain the sense in which the word was probably employed by the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-9\">On the face of this will, it is plain that the Second or South Ecclesiastical Society were the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty, in respect to .this land, and that he intended this bounty to be perpetual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-10\">Now, if we keep in view this intention to create and perpetuate a trust for this society\u2019s benefit, a trust which he ex peet\u00e9d would endure forever, and consider that it was also his purpose to give very particular directions for the administration of it, and then observe the connection in which this word \u201cprovided\u201d is used, it\u201dwill be evident,'that the testator could not have used the word in the sense set up by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The testator, in the beginning of the will, after the decease of his sister, Mrs. Whitman, devises his real estate ex-eept, &amp;c., to the Second or South Ecclesiastical Society, \u201cto be and remain'to the use and benefit of said Second or South Ecclesiastical Society, forever.\u201d But the society is not to have the management and control of this property: no power to lease it and receive the rents and profits directly. The entire management of it the testator gives to certain trustees to be appointed by him, and these trustees are to execute their trust according to his directions; therefore the testator, after the words last quoted, and in th.e same sentence, proceeds to give those directions, and says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">\u201c.Provided, that said real estate be not ever hereafter sold or disposed of, but the same be leased or let, and the annual rents or profits thereof applied to the use and benefit of said society, and the letting, leasing, and managing of said estate to be under the management and direction of certain trustees hereafter named by me, and their successors, to. be appointed in like manner as hereinafter directed.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">It will be observed that every word here quoted is directly and essentially connected with this word \u201c provided,\u201d which is supposed to create the condition. If there is <em>any </em>condition here, then it is plain that there are <em>several </em>conditions, and if a breach of one would cause a forfeiture of the estate, it must be admitted that the same result would follow from a breach of any other. The plaintiffs say there is a condition against alienation, the \u25a0 breach of which will cause a forfeiture of the est. te. If so, there is a condition that the estate shall be leased or let, and also that the annual rents and profits shall be paid to the society, and also that the leasing, letting, and managing of the estate shall be under the direction of trustees appointed by the testator, \u201c <em>in manner as hereinafter </em>directed,\u201d the breach of either of which conditions would likewise cause a forfeiture of the estate; yet it is most improbable that the testator should have devised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>this estate to this society, and endeavored to impress upon his bounty perpetual duration, and should have hedged it about by so many careful and minute directions as to its control and management, and should at the same time have intended that the society should forfeit the estate in case his trustees whom he had appointed to control and manage the estate, and in whom the legal title was vested, should be guilty of a breach of trust in violating any of these provisions. Such could hardly have been the intention. The true interpretation, in this particular, is this: The testator here creates a trust for the letting, leasing, and managing of this estate, and appoints trustees. It was his intention to give directions to those trustees for the management of it; they were not to sell but only to lease it, and the language which is supposed to raise the condition, occurs in the course of the directions he gives to his trustees, and was not used with any intention of creating a forfeiture in case the trustees should fail to obey those directions, or commit a breach of trust. Thus we find these words:</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">\u201c And said trustees and their successors shall have full power to lot and lease said estate, and to do all other legal acts for the well ordering and managing of said estate, under the <em>limitations and restrictions </em>as hereinbefore expressed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">Now these limitations and restrictions are, that they should not sell, that the estate should not be divided in case part of the society should secede, that they shall lease the estate, but shall not give a lease for more than thirty years. Undoubtedly he desired that these directions should be strictly obeyed, but that the testator intended that the society should forfeit the estate in the event that the trustees should disobey any of these directions, cannot be maintained with any plausibility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-8\">Let us advert to precedents. In the recent Massachusetts, case of <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Harris,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a writ of entry was brought to recover certain real estate and water power, the title to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the plaintiff claimed had reverted to him by reason of the .breach of a condition annexed to the land. The clause in the deed which was-claimed to raise the condition, was as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">\u201c Provided said draw shall be so built as to answer for a street to the railroad,- and Spring Street is to be opened.three rods wide across said farm, to the south line of said railroad, and the said Stearns is to make the road.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">The court decided that this clause did not raise a condition, the breach of which would be attended by a forfeiture of the estate, and.among other things they say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">\u201cIt is true, as the demandant contends, \u2018provided\u2019 is an apt word to create a condition, and it is often used by way of limitation or qualification only, especially when it does not introduce a new clause, but only seems to qualify or restrain the generality of a former clause.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-9\">Such is the connection in which the word is used, and such its office in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-10\">A recent English case is <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Wilkin,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A testator, after bequeathing legacies, devised to the defendant and to his heirs, &amp;c., \u201call the real^state,\u201d and all the \u201cresidue of his personal estate,\u201d <em>upon this express condition:</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-11\">\u201c That if my personal estate should bo insufficient for the purpose, they do and shall within twelve months after my decease, pay and discharge the legacies before bequeathed, and I feel confident that he Will comply with my wish, it being my particular desire that the above legacies shall be paid, and I hereby make chargeable all my said real and personal estate with the payment of the aforesaid legacies.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-12\">It was held in the K. B.,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and afterwards on appeal in the Exchequer Chamber, that the devise was not upon a condition, the failure to. comply with which created a for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>feiture, but merely a charge or trust in favor of the legatees, and that although the words \u201c upon this express condition,\u201d if they had stood alone, would have created one, yet when the testatrix went on to say, that she trusted to his good faith and honor to pay them, and very much desired that they should be paid, and when afterwards she said she made them a charge upon her personal and real estate, that was inconsistent with the idea that she intended the property should be taken away by condition, because there was. a trust to be fulfilled, and that inconsistency was so great that they held that these words, \u201c upon this express condition,\u201d must yield, and the trust must be fulfilled,.but the legal estate must remain unaffected by the words of condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">Important deductions are to be drawn from these decisions. They say (as we submit the law clearly is),</p>\n<p data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">1st. That the case is not to be decided by looking to particular provisions in the will, but by looking at the whole will to ascertain the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">2d. That words much stronger than those used in the will in question, will be controlled, if the court can see that there was an intention to create a trust, a.nd that the trust will be defeated if the words shall be held to create a condition instead of a trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">' That there was an intention to create a trust here, does not admit of controversy. The tqstator appoints trustees and provides for perpetuating the trust, for the use and benefit of the society. Could it then have been his intention at the same time that he created this trust, and said it was to be perpetual, to insert a provision by which it could be defeated at the will of the trustees ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">II. If this is a condition it is void as being in restraint of alienation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-11\">If this was an ordinary devise, either to an incorporation or an individual, a condition against any alienation of the property devised would be merely void as contrary to the policy of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-12\">This is not a devise under the statute of Connecticut, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>argued on the other side. If it were, that statute has not empowered devisors to make such conditions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\">1. Upon the question whether this devise is within the statute of Connecticut we rely upon <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Hartford.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That was the case of a deed of land to this same society by Anne Burnham, dated July 7th, 1762. The land was conveyed Ih these words:</p>\n<p data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">\u201cI therefore by these presents fully, freely, ahd absolutely give, grant, release and confirm unto the said South Church or Society called Congregational, and to their successors forever, all the aforesaid house, homestead, and premises, with their appurtenances, to have and to hold unto them and their successors forever, as'a good, sure and indefeasible estate in feo simple, without any manner of condition.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">A part of the land included in this deed came by sundry conveyances to the plaintiff. The town of Hartford had laid a tax on it, and compelled him to pay the tax. The plaintiff then brought\u2019this action to recover back the money thus paid, claiming that this land was not liable to taxation, on the ground that by the deed o'f Anne Burnham it was granted \u201c for the maintenance of the ministry of the gospel,\u201d or for some other public- and charitable use, within the meaning of the statute ofl702, and therefore by the express terms of that statute was exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">This claim was not sustained by the court, and it was decided that the mere fact that the conveyance was to an ecclesiastical society did not bring it within the provisions of the statute. <em>\u2018 </em>That the statute requires the grantor to dedicate the property to some of the particular uses therein specified, and the.general character and corporate powers of an ecclesiastical society do not imply that it is dedicated to any of those uses; for whatever implication might be drawn from the general character and limited powers of the corporation at the'time when the grant is made, .yet that character and, those powers might be thereafter essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>changed by the legislature. That the statute requires the grantor to declare the use, and he cannot leave it to the law to do it for him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">\u2022' It was therefore decided in that case that a grant of land to this society, or to any ecclesiastical society, without any other declaration of. the use than may be implied from the character of the grantee, is not within the statute, because it is not a dedication or sequestration of. land to any of the uses specified in the statute. That case is decisive of the case at bar, for the material facts are the same in both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">But if the devise were within the statute of Connecticut, a condition in restraint of alienation would not be a valid \u25a0condition, the breach of which would work a forfeiture, because that statute does not authorize a grantor or devisor to impose such a condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-8\">In order to show that it does, the plaintiffs must maintain and must show to the court that this statute not only repealed the statutes of mortmain existing in England before the emigration of our ancestors, and which upon general principles would be brought over to this country by them, but authorized any proprietor of land to sequester it forever, to render it inalienable forever, and to take it out of commerce forever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-9\">This, we submit, cannot be shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-10\">In <em>Bible Society </em>v. <em>Wetmore</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided that this statute of 1702 was virtually a re-enactment\u2019 of the statute of Elizabeth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-11\">Under the statutes of mortmain a devise to a corporation or to the use of a corporation, whether lay or ecclesiastical, was void.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-12\">The Connecticut statute, commonly called the statute of. 1702, was passed at the October session of the General Court, 1684, and was as follows; \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-13\">\u201c For the encouraging of learning and the promoting of publique concernments, it is ordered by this court, that for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>future, that all such houses and lands as are, or shall, by any charitable persons, be given or purchased for, or to help on, the maintenance of the ministry or schools, or poor, in any part of \u25a0this colony, they shall remayne to the use or uses for which they were given forever, and .shall be exempted out of the list of estates, and be rate free,.any former law or order notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\">The history of this law is instructive upon the question of its interpretation, and shows, we think, that we are correct as to the object of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">The charter granted by Charles II constituted the only title of the colony to .the lands within its limits, the Indian titles which they had acquired from time to time previous to the grant of the charter being, as Governor Andross said, no better than \u201c the scratch of a bear\u2019s paw.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">The colonial legislature or General Court had, however, before the grant of the charter, assumed to make numerous and large grants of land to townships, individuals, and for public, charitable, and piotis uses. The charter conveyed to the colony in fee simple all the lands within its boundaries, but at the time the statute in question was passed, the grants mlide by the colonial legislature before the charter was granted had not been confirmed. The efforts which were being made to .deprive them of their charter created the greatest anxiety-and alarm in the colony. \"While they were in no danger of losing their charter, a confirmation of these grants by the colonial legislature was not deemed important; as soon as the people-discovered that they were in danger of losing their only muniment of title, they deemed it important to confirm them by law, while they yet had power to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-9\">Under these circumstances the statute in question was passed, at the session of the General C\u00f3urt held in October, 1684. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-10\">In February of the ensuing. year, James II succeeded to the crown', and at the-following May session of the General Court, another statute was passed, of the following tenor:</p>\n<p data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-11\">\u201cThis court, for the prevention of future trouble, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>every township\u2019s grants of lands, as it hath been obtained by gift, purchase, or otherwise, of the natives, or grant of this court, may \u201cbo settled upon them, their heirs, successors and assigns forever, according to our charter granted by his late majesty of happy memory; this court doth order that every township in this colony shall take out patents for their said grants of the Governor and Company, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">\u201c The like course may be taken for all farms granted to any person or persons whatever within this colony.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"224\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">The fears of the colony were well founded, for in June of the same year, a <em>quo warranto </em>was issued to the Governor and Company of Connecticut, citing them to appear before the king'within eight days of St. Martin, but this writ was not served until after the day named for their appearance had passed.. On the 21st of December of the same year another writ was issued, citing them to appear before the king within eight days of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"225\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">These facts, some of which are matter of history and others gathered from the records of the colony, show beyond any question, that the object of this statute was to confirm existing grants to the uses specified in the statute, and to authorize future grants to the same uses by exempting them from the operation of the English statutes pf mortmain, and placing them on the same footing merely as grants of land to individuals, or for any qther lawful purpose, and not with any view to render lands so granted forever inalienable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-9\">It is said that because this statute was in conflict with the English statutes of mortmain, and might on that ground be made an additional cause of complaint against the colony, it was not recorded with the other public acts at the time it was passed, but withheld from record for several years, until the agitation in respect to the charter bad ceased. It first appeared \"among the public acts in the revision of 1702, and thus came to .be called the statute of 1702. In tho revision the phraseology of the act was slightly changed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The words of perpetuity employed in it are those only '.which- in substance are employed in all deeds and grants, and such as it is customary and proper to employ where titles are to be confirmed by statute,' and where natural 01 artificial persons incapable of holding lands \u00e1re authorized by-law t\u00f3 do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">Our-views in regard to the object and true construction of this statute are further confirmed by the history of a case that arose very soon after the act was passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">In 1689, John Live\u00e9n, of New London, died, leaving a will made just before his decease, by which he bequeathed and devised the greater part of his estate to the \u201c ministry of New London,\u201d to be improved for them by his executors who were General Fitz John Winthrop and Major Edward Palms. The executors treated the devise as void, on the ground that it was within the English statutes of mortmain, and they contended that the Connecticut statute of 1684 was void, because in conflict with the laws of England.</p>\n<p data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\">A suit was brought against the executors by the town of New London on behalf of the ministry, and the town recovered judgment. The cause was taken by app.eal to England, and was in litigation there for several years, but the records of the colony.do not disclose the result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\">W\u00e9 have already shown that the Connecticut statute of charitable uses has been held by the Supreme Court of that State to be-substantially a copy of the statute of Elizabeth concerning charitable uses. Both should therefore receive the same construction; but it has never been held in England that lands given to charities were thereby rendered'inalienable. - On the contrary, it has always been the practice of the Court of Chancery to order a sale of such lands when a. sale -is shown to be for the interest of the beneficiaries.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\">The Connecticut statute being \u00e1 re-enactment of the statute of Elizabeth, should, as we have said, upon general prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ciples receive the same construction, and it always has <em>r&amp; </em>ceived the same construction by the .legislature of the Colony and of the State, in the exercise of the jurisdiction in regard to the sale of charity lands, exercised in England by the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-6\">The records of the State show that betwecn the years 1610 and 1862, five hundred and seventy-five private acts, authorizing the sale of lands, were passed. A great number of these acts were for the sale of charity lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-7\">Charities are under the perpetual guardianship of the sovereign power. The general superintendence of them in England is delegated to the Court of Chancery.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-8\">In Connecticut this superintendence is mainly exercised by the legislature. In Connecticut, as in England, it is a rule of public policy to require trustees for a charity to obtain the assent of the public authority exorcising this guardianship to a sale of charity estates, in order to protect the charity against imprudent sales. This alone is the object of the law. It is a rule established for the protection of the <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"236\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">Lands, as we have endeavored to show, are not rendered inalienable by being given to charitable uses, but set apart as constituting a fund to be used in a provident and judicious manner, to promote the object for which they are given, and this provident and judicious manner as much requires a sale, when by chance of circumstances the property has become unproductive, but can be made productive by a sale, as under other circumstances it requires the property to be preserved and kept.</p>\n<p data-order=\"237\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-10\">When the statute says, therefore, that lands given to charitable uses \u201c shall forever remain to the uses to which they have been or shall be given or granted, according to the true intent and meaning of the grantors, and to no other use whatever,\u201d it is to be understood not as meaning that the land should never be sold, not as giving the donor power to say that, but as providing and declaring that the fund shall never be diverted from the use to which it may be dedi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>cated, subject, however, to such changes from time to tinie as the interest of the society may require.</p>\n<p data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-6\">A statute which rendered all charity lands forever inalienable, or which gave the donor power to render them so by imposing conditions against alienation, would be so clearly contrary to public policy, that the court would never so construe it if it admitted of any other rational interpretation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">We say in the next place that it cannot be presumed that this testator intended to impose a condition against a legislative sale, even if he did against a sale by his trustees or by the society.</p>\n<p data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amy\">When this will was made the charter of Charles II was the organic law of the State. Under this charter the General Assembly had the same power of legislation as the Parliament of Great Britain.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">The testator knew that whatever his wishes .might be in regard to a sale, the legislature had power to authorize a sale, and that a sale by authority of law would not work a forfeiture. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-10\">It must therefore be assumed that he made his will and imposed this condition (if it be a condition) in subordination to the power of the legislature to order a sale.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-11\">III. Assuming that this was a conditional devise, and that the condition was valid if, as we have endeavored to show, at the time when this will was made, and when the trusts of the will took effect, the legislature had power to authorize a sale, and to control, in this respect, the intention of the testator, it must be admitted that the legislature possessed the same power when it did authorize a-sale, unless in the meantime it -had been deprived of it by some constitutional restriction. It is for the plaintiff to show that by some provision in the Constitution of the United States or of the State of Connecticut, the legislature of Connecticut was prohibited from the exercise of this power, and that the act m question was therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Courts will not declare an act of the legislature void, unless it is a clear and unequivocal violation of the Constitution.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">The constitution of the State of Connecticut is not a grant of legislative power; it is merely a limitation imposed upon pre-existing power.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"246\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">Assume that it is beyond the scope of legislative power to pass a law taking away or impairing a. vested right of property', and that upon general principles, such a law would be void, the question remains, whether the act in question is of that character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"247\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">A right of property, in order to be within the protection of this principle, must not only be a vested right (not a mere possibility), but it must also be a beneficial- interest. If, as we assert, the legal title of the land vested in the trustees, the heirs of the testator could have no beneficial interest in a breach of condition by the trustefes.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"248\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-9\">Suppose there had been no act of the legislature, and the hfeir at law had entered for condition broken, all he would gain by an entry would be the naked right to hold the legal estate for the beneficiaries till -a court of chancery should exercise the'power of appointing new trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"249\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-10\">Therefore, if the court should come to the conclusion that the legal estate was- vested in these trustees to hold upon trust, and that there was a breach of a condition attached to that legal estate,'and an entry by which the heir vested himself with that legal estate, but for the act of the legisla-. ture, there cannot be the least difficulty in saying that the legislature might control that interest either before or after breach.</p>\n<p data-order=\"250\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-11\">But if the court should come to the conclusion that the legal estate vested in the society, and not in the trustees, we insist that the heirs at law of the testator, by virtue of a conlition against alienation, would not in that case, before con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>dition broken, have an interest in the property beyond the control of the legislature..</p>\n<p data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-6\">Admitting that the power of the legislature is so far limited and restricted by general principles' of law that it cannot, by any act of legislation, destroy or impair a vested and beneficial right in property, it would not follow that the act in question was void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1l\">The plaintiffs, in order to show to the court that this act was void, must go much further than this, and maintain that the power of the legislature is so limited and restricted that any act is void, the effect of which would be -to destroy or impair (for whatever cause) not a vested and beneficial interest in property, but the most remote and contingent interest. The interest of which they say this act deprives them was .both contingent and remote, a mere possibility of reverter, and so little regarded by the common law that it could not be conveyed or devised.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"253\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-8\">This the plaintiffs cannot show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"254\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-9\">It cannot-be maintained that the legislature of Connecticut has any less power to unfetter estates by cutting off remote and contingent interests of this character than the Court of Chancery in England. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"255\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-10\">Yet in <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Sprigg, </em>reported by Vernon,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> trustees were ordered to join in cutting off a contingent remainder to the heir at law. Again: In <em>Fruwin </em>v. <em>Coulton, </em>in 1st Equity Cases Abridged,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> also in <em>Winnington </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>in 1st Peere Williams.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> <em>Tipping </em>v. <em>Piggot, </em>in 1st Equity Cases Abridged,<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark> is a very strong ease. There the trustees, without any order of the court, joined in making a new settlement, thereby cutting off a contingent remainder to the heir at law. On \u00e1 bill filed by the heir at law to have this new settlement set aside the court declined to set it aside, the chancellor saying, that although it was an imprudent thing for the trustees to do without the sanction of the court, yet as he approved of the settlement he would not disturb it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"256\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In these cases the right of which the heir at law was do prived by the court was a mere naked possibility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"257\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\">In this case the right of which he has been deprived by the legislature was the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"258\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">In this country, laws affecting such contingent rights in property have never been held to be beyond the scope of legislative power. Cases' sustaining such laws are very numerous. We shall refer to only a few of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"259\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL9\">Thus it has been held that the legislature might take away a contingent right of dower or courtesy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"260\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-9\">Also, the contingent right of the husband in the choses in action of the wife.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"261\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-10\">Also, the possibility \u00f3f reverter to the owner of the fee, in land taken for a street in a city, on the ground that the interest thus taken is too remote to be deemed an interest, in property-&gt;of any value.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"262\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-11\">So an act of the legislature by which an estate in fee tail was declared to be afee simple in the grantees of the tenant in tail, who were infants, and which authorized a sale of the land, was declared valid.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"263\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-12\">So a law empowering a court of equity to order the sale of real estate owned in common, where partition would not, in the opinion of the court, be advantageous to the owners.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"264\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-13\">And so, a statute validating the levy of execution in\u2019 cases where the levy was void, for the reason that the officer had included in his return fees not allowed by law.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"265\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-14\">It must be admitted that the act under consideration in the last ease was not only retrospective, but affected essentially vested rights of property; yet inasmuch as those rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>property were not unjustly affected, the act was declared to be valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"266\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">So .a private act of the legislature, divorcing a woman from her husband, was held to be valid, though its effect was to deprive a creditor of the husband of a vested estate in the lands of the wife acquired by the previous levy of an execution on the husband\u2019s estate therein.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"267\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">These last three cases arose in Connecticut. In Massachusetts and in Pennsylvania<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it has been decided that a law which changed the tenure of estates by declaring au joint tenancies to be tenancies in common, was constitutional and valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"268\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\">Private acts authorizing tenants for life and trustees to support remainders, to sell real estate devised, and convert the same into personal estate, to be held subject to the same provisions and trusts as the land, are numerous, and have always been sustained, though in opposition to the will of \u25a0the testator; and although the effect was to compel those in remainder to take personal estate instead of the real estate devised, and in which they had both a vested and valuable interest.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"269\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\">It cannot be denied that in each of the cases just referred to, and given in the note.below,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> the law took away or modified and controlled interests in property more immediate and tangible than any which the plaintiffs had under the will in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"270\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-10\">Prom the whole tenor of Mr. Stanley\u2019s will it is apparent that this society was the sole object of the testator\u2019s bounty in respect to the land in question, and that this condition (if there be a condition) was imposed for the purpose of protecting the society in the enjoyment of it, and not to enable the heir at law to deprive them of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"271\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>There is no limitation in favor of liis heirs at law,- no devise over, nor any other provision in the will tending to show that the testator ever intended or expected that his heirs al law would succeed to the estafe in any event.</p>\n<p data-order=\"272\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-6\">From the authorities already cited it appears that it is the constant practice of the legislature where the p.ower has not been delegated by the legislature to the courts, and of fhe courts where the power has been delegated, to authorize a sale of the lands of infants, idiots, lunatics, and others, who are not <em>sui juris. </em>This is done in the exercise of a. tutelary authority on the part of the legislature as <em>parens patries. </em>C. J. Parker, of Massachusetts, says that \u201cthis power must rest in the legislature in this commonwealth, that body being alone competent to act as the general guardian and protector of. those who are incompetent to act for themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"273\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\">Now the power to authorize the sale of the lands of a charity is derived from the, same source, and rests upon the same principles. A charity is never, so to speak, <em>sui juris ; </em>it is under perpetual guardianship, and its guardian is the State. It is for this reason that the trustees are- <em>primS, fade </em>guilty of a breach of trust in selling the estate of a charity without authority derived from the State. And we submit that it is not in the power of a donor to a charity so -to fetter the State as to prevent the sovereign power from authorizing a lawful disposition of the estate given to the charity, its ward, when it is clearly made t\u00f3 appear that it will be for the interest of the charity. This never has been done, and we contepd that it cannot be done. We do not mean to assert that -the State may divert'the fund from the use to which it. is giyen. What -we say is, that the State may authorize such-modal changes in the property from time to time as may be found to be necessary and proper, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>it-is not in\u2019the power of a donor to provide that this shall not be don\u00e9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"274\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-6\">Ev\u00e9n if this were a law impairing the obligation of any contract, how could it avail the plaintiffs ? If there is any compact it is that the land shall forever be devoted to pious or charitable uses. Is the heir at law asking to have this compact observed and performed? Is he intending to devote the land to those uses? Clearly,not; he is seeking to recover the land, not for the use of the society, in order that the supposed compact may be executed, but for his own private use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"275\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-7\">The courts of Connecticut, in some early cases, involving the right of the State to tax such land, may speak of the ex- , emption contained in the statute as a compact or pledge on the part of the State that lands given should be forever exempt from taxation. These decisions have, we think, recently been overruled, and in <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>Town of Colchester,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court say, that \u201c there is nothing in the language of the statute which makes it differ from ordinary statutes specifying what should or should not be subject to taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"276\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-8\">The notion that any general law of the State is in the nature of a compact between the State and the citizen, is erroneous, and there is no force in the suggestion that this statute of 1702 created anything in the nature of a compact between the State and any one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"277\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-9\">The power which the legislature of Connecticut exercised \u25a0in this case it has exercised unquestioned for two hundred years, and this in itself \\yould be a sufficient vindication of its right to continue to exercise it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"278\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-10\">There is an additional consideration, growing out of the long-continued practice of the legislature in passing such-' acts as this, of so much importance as to have been deemed worthy of special consideration by courts in similar cases. That consideration is the effect which a decision against the validity of this act would have in unsettling other titles to land. In <em>Davidson </em>v. Johonnot,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> the court declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the vast amount of property now held under titles derived from similar legislative acts should lead us to proceed most cautiously in the investigation of this subject, and to deal with it in a liberal spirit when called upon judicially to declare that this course of legislation conflicts w.itli the constitution, and that all the special acts of this character are of no validity. And in Norris v. <em>Clymer,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Chief Justice Gibson, speaking of the consequences in his own single State, says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"279\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">\u201cIt is not above the mark to say that ten thousand titles depend on legislation of this stamp, for many of those statutes contained provisions for more than twenty distinct estates, and could not the ruin that wonld be produced by disturbing them be arrested by anything less than a convention to effect a constitutional sanction of them, the consummation would not be dearly bought.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"280\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\"> Brainard <em>v. </em>Colchester, 31 Connecticut, 411.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"281\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-15\"> Jarman on Wills, vol. ii, p. 526 (side page 744).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"282\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b139-16\"> 21 Connecticut, 625.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"283\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"A9k\"> 4 Day, 326.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"284\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b139-17\"><em> </em>16 Connecticut, 419.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"285\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"\u01c1\">\n<p id=\"AL8\"> 2 Id. 201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"286\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"\u00b6\">\n<p id=\"b139-18\"> Judd <em>v. </em>Bushnell, 7 Id. 205;

The estate is not to be soldi or disposed of, but to. be leased by trustees, and the rents paid over to the society.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">2. The leas\u00e9s .are \u2018not to exceed thirty years in any one term.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">8. The estate is not to be divided in- the event of a division of the society; and\u2014 \u2022 . \u25a0 \"</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">4. It is to be managed, and directed exclusively by trustees who are appointed in the will\u201dand by their successors; the surviving trustees to appoint \"when a vacancy happens.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">The question is, whether these are strict common law conditions annexed to the estate, a breach of which, or of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>any one of them, will work a forfeiture, defeat the devise, and let in. the heir <em>;\u25a0 </em>or, whether they are regulations for the guide of the trustees, and explanatory of the terms under which he intended the estate should be managed, with a view to the greatest advantage in behalf of the society ?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The difference between the two interpretations and the consequences flowing from them, is very material. As we have seen, a condition, if broken, forfeits the estate, and forever thereafter deprives the society of the gift; and not only7 this, but the heirs become seized of the first estate, and avoids, of course, all intermediate charges or iucumbrances, and takes also free and clear all the expenditures and improvements that may have been laid out on the property:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">On the other hand, if these limitations are to be regarded as regulations to guide the trustees, and explanatory of the terms upon which the devise has been made, they create a trust which those who take the estate are bound to perform; and, in case of a breach, a court of equity7 will interpose and enforce performance. The estate is thus preserved and devoted to the objects of the charity or bounty' Of the testator, even in case of a violation of the limitations annexed to it. A fraudulent or unfaithful trustee will be removed, and another appointed to his place. A diversion of the fund will be arrested, and an account compelled for any waste or improvident use of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Mr. Sugden, speaking of conditions, observes, that what by the old law was deemed a devise upou condition would now, perhaps, in almost every case, be construed a devise in fee upou trust, and, by this construction, instead of the heir taking advantage of the condition broken, the <em>cestui que trust </em>can compel an observance of the trust by a suit in equity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">In the recent case of <em>Wright </em>v. Wilkin, in the Queen\u2019s Bench, the court approved of this observation of Mr. Sugden, and in that case construed a devise, <em>on express condition in terms, </em>looking through the whole will, and regarding the intent of the testator as falling within this rule. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>relied very much upon the words following the condition aa explaining away the strict common law meaning of the term, and as importing a meaning inconsistent with a strict interpretation.. This judgment was affirmed in the Exchequer.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">It is true that the word \u201cproviso\u201d is an appropriate one to constitute a common law condition in a deed or will, but this is not the fixed and invariable meaning attached to it by the law in these instruments. On the eoutrai\u2019y, it gives way to the intent of the parties as gathered from an examination of the whole instrument, and has frequently been thus explained and applied as expressing simply a covenant or limitation in trust. Several cases were referred to, on the argument, to this effect, and many more might have been added.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In looking at the explanatory part of the will in this case, it will be seen that the testator had in his mind a settlement of the estate in trust, for the beneficiaries, and with this view established a code of regulations to guide the trustees in the management of it that would continue through all time, and which is wholly inconsistent'with the idea that the estate might be defeated by a breach of any one of them. After appointing the three trustees, he adds: \u201c I do give authority and power to nominate their successors to said trust, which is to be done in the manner following: That immediately after my decease they . . . shall appoint some meet persons, ... as the occasion may require, into said trust or office, so be it that at no time more than three pei\u2019sons shall act in said trust or office; . . . and all persons, successors hereafter to said trust and office, shall at all times in future have like power to superintend, direct, and appoint their successors in said trust and office, and to perpetuate said trust for the benefit aud use of said society, as occasion may from time to time require.\u201d And he closes by saying that the said trustees and their successors shall have full power to lease the estate, and \u201c do all other legal acts for the well-ordering and management of said estate, under the limitations and restrictions as hereinbefore expressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">This interpret\u00e1tion of the devise was sought to be avoided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>on the argument, by separating all the limitations and restrictions in respect to the enjoyment of the estate from <em>that </em>forbidding the sale or disposal of it, thereby conceding that they were limitations in trust, but insisting that the other constituted a condition for a breach of which a forfeiture was incurred. But the difficulty, in' the argument is that the same clause embraces not only the prohibition to sell, but enjoins the duty to lease, and the application of the rents to the use of the society, and also the management of the estate by the trustees, and which management contains the prohibition to lease for terms not exceeding thirty years. The separation is, therefore, not only arbitrary, but in disregard of the express words of the testator. The injunction to lease is as positive\" as that not to sell, and both are embraced in the same clause; and if the term \u201cproviso\u201d is to be construed.as a condition in respect to the one, it must consistently bo so construed in respect to the other. And the same observations are also applicable to the other limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">This devise to the Ecclesiastical Society is in some respects peculiar. The possession\", management, and control of the- estate are given exclusively to the trustees, who, according to the regulations, are invested with power to perpetuate their authority indefinitely. The only active duties of the society \u2014 the beneficiaries \u2014 is to receive the rents and profits for their own use and benefit. Of course, the trustees, subject to the limitations and restrictions annexed to the enjoyment'of the estate, possess all the power'and dominion over it that belongs to an owner, and are bound to take the same care of it and exercise the same attention, skill, and diligence in its management that a prudent and vigilant owner would exercise over his own. They are bound to rent the property, collect the rents, and pay them over to the society, to protect the possession, prevent waste, see that the taxes are paid, and, in the words of the testator, \u201c do all other legal acts for the well-ordering and management of the estate.\u201d Being thus in the exclusive possession and control of the property, and having devolved upon them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the manifold duties incident thereto, it is quite clear that the trustees are clothed with the legal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Mr. Jarman states the general principle: \u201c The mere fact that they are made agents in the application of the rents is sufficient to give them the legal estate, as in the cas\u00e9 of a simple devise to A. upon trust to. pay the rents to B.; and it is immaterial, in such case, that there is ho direct devise to the trustees, if the intention that they shall take the estate can be collected from the will. Hence, a devise to the intent that A., shall receive the rents and pay them over to B. would clearly vest the estate iu A.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The same effect where the-duty is devolved upon them to pay taxes and make repairs.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> And it is laid down generally that whenever a trust is created^ legal estate sufficient for the execution of the trust shall, if possible, be implied.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> Indeed, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the trustees in the present case to execute their various and multiplied duties over this property without being clothed with the legal estate, under a mere naked power.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The distinction between a power and a trust is marked and obvious. Powers, as Chief Justice Wilmot observed, are never imperative; they leave the act to be done at the will of the party to whom they are given. Trusts are always imperative, and are. obligatory'upon the conscience of the party intrusted.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Our conclusion is, that the construction urged by the plaintiffs, of the will, importing a condition, a breach of which forfeits the devise, is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">There is another ground of defence to this action that we arc of opinion is equally conclusive against the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">On an application of the society and trustees to the legislature of Connecticut to be permitted to sell the premises in question, setting out the reasons at large in support of it, the application was granted,- and an act passed accordingly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>This act authorized the trustees, together with a-third person, to sell the lands in the manner therein prescribed, and to invest the proceeds at interest, in bonds and mortgages of real estate of double the value of the amount invested, appropriating the interest to the use of the s\u2019ociety, in the same maimer, and subject to the same use, as the rents or income of said property are by the will required to be appropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendant is in possession under the title derived from a sale in pursuance of this act of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"A0F\">In England, and in this country where a court of chancery exists, a charity of the description in question is a peculiar subject of the jurisdiction of that court, and in cases of abuse, or misuse of the charity by the trustees or agents in charge of it, this court wdll interpose to correct such abuses, and enforce the execution of the charitable purposes of the founder. So, by lapse of time, or changes as to the condition of the property and of the circumstances attending it, have made it . prudent and beneficial to the charity to alien the lands, and vest the proceeds in other funds or in a different manner, it is competent for this court to direct such sale and investment, taking care that no diversion of the gift be permitted. Lord Langdale, the master of the rolls, observed, in <em>The Attorney-General </em>v. <em>The South Sea Company,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cIt is plain that in ordinary eases a most important part of this duty is to preserve the property, but it may happen that the purposes of the charity may be best sustained and .promoted by alienating the specific property. The law has not-forbidden the alienation, and this court, upon various occasions,.with a view to promote interests of charities, has not thought it necessary to preserve the property <em>in </em>specie, but has sanctioned its alienation.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">This power, in the State of Connecticut, it appears, is exercised by its legislature, as in the present instance. Many acts of the kind have been referred to in .the argument, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tending through a long series of years .down to the present time;</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We cannot doubt that the power exists in the legislature, and it is not for this court to revise the facts upon which it has seen fit to exercise it.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-7\">Mr. Justice DAVIS dissented.</judges>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Judgment aefirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\"> 1 Sugden on Powers, 123, 7th London ed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-11\"> 2 Jarman on Wills, 202, Perkins\u2019s Ed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A9l\"> Id. 201, and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"Ay4\"> Lewin on Trusts and Trustees, 164.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"AjJ\"> 2 Sugden on Powers, 588.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\"> 4 Bevan, 458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b181-10\"> See also Lewin on Trusts and Trustees, 373, and cases; and Shelford on Law of Mortmain, 687.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
