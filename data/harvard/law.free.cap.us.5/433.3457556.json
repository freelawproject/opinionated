The only difference was that caused by the death of the tenant for life, Beal Basley. When the decree was rendered, these appellants had a vested remainder in the lands, after the death of Beal Basley. No change took place after this decree and before the executions were issued, except that by his death the remainder vested in possession. But his death did not change the case. A remainder is as much liable for the satisfaction of judgments as_ an estate in possession ; for a legal estate in remainder may be sold under execution, and an equitable remainder may be subjected, by proceedings in equity, to be sold for debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-9\">The suit in the Chancery Court was between the same parties. It is true that not all the defendants in this cause were parties to the cause in the Chancery Court (thirty of the thirty-seveu being parties), but this latter suit was upon a creditor\u2019s bill, to which all had a right to be made parties upon motion, and are, consequently, bound by the decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-10\">If this be not so, still those who were parties are bound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-11\">II. <em>If the appellees are not estopped, and the question is to be treated as an original one in this suit, still the estate of the appellants in the lands toas not subject to be taken in execution.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-12\">On this question the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, if not an estoppel, is a controlling authority, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ing a decision upon the construction of a statute of that State, and.laying down a. rule of real property therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQD\">The intent and legal effect of the deed was to vest the legal estate in the trustee until the debts of the <em>cestui que trust </em>should be paid, and upon the happening of that event to convey the lands to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and in the meantime the lands should be enjoyed by those persons described in the deed. During the continuance of the trust it was made the duty of the trustee to protect the possession of the lands against a specified class of persons, and to defeat any attempt on the part of the <em>cestui que'trust </em>to' apply the property or its proceeds to a certain specified and prohibited object. It was clearly the requirement of the donor that the trustee should in certain contingencies interfere actively in the execution of his intentions \u2014 to eject, for instance, former creditors, to whom the <em>cestui que trust </em>should have conveyed the land in satisfaction of a then existing debt, or even the purchasers who might'buy at sheriff\u2019s sale, under the executions which it is now sought to enjoin. Moreover, the trustee was to ascertain when a certain event had occurred \u2014 the final ex-tinguishment of certain debts of the <em>cestui que trust </em>\u2014 and upon the happening of that event he was to make a conveyance in one or the other of the two modes prescribed by the deed of gift. These provisions and conditions, <em>if valid, </em>constitute a <em>special trus.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-7\">These provisions and conditions were valid, and especially that providing for a future conveyance of the land.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-8\">These positions do not conflict with the authorities which hold that all a debtor\u2019s property must be liable to his debts. But the remedy is in equity, where the interest of the debtor <em>under the trust </em>can be reached \u2014 not by execution at law, whereby the trust is destroyed.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-9\">The trust in this case being executory, and the trusts im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>perfectly declared, equity will carry the intentions of the parties into effect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>Messrs. Bradley and </em>Wilson, <em>contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">I. <em>The decree of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is not an estoppel.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">The essential qualities of an estoppel are that the judgment shall be between the same parties, upon the same subject-matter, and this must appear by the record, or be proved, and is not to be inferred by argument.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-9\">The parties are not the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-10\">We have here thirty-seven creditors as parties. In the suit in the State court of Tennessee there were but thirty. If the decree is a bar, it is a bar only as to the parties to the suit in the State court. The matter must be passed on here for. the remaining seven.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-11\">It was not on the same subject-ihatter.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-12\">In those cases an effort was made by certain judgment creditors to create a lien in equity upon and subject to sale certain property in which it was alleged the defendants had an \u00e9quitable interest. The court decided in substance that they had no estate at <em>that time </em>cognizable in a court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-13\">It was a bare possibility. The donees took no interest <em>in present\u00ed. </em>It was to depend on their surviving the donor. ITe reserved a life estate to himself, and after his death a use to the donees for their lives, to be enlarged upon a certain contingency into a fee. It was a use for life limited upon a use for life and dependent on their surviving the donor. It was an interest too remote, depending on a possibility only, and did not vest any estate in the donee. It was not an estate or interest in the donees which could pass by assignment, whether voluntary or involuntary. It could not pass even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>by will, because no estate could arise on which the devise could operate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">The Supreme Court therefore was right in the decision which it made in the <em>then </em>condition of the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">But on the death of the donor, the donees surviving, the interest of the donees becomes a vested interest, subject to the disposition of a court of equity and subject to execution at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-8\">II. J.s <em>an original question.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-9\">This being a voluntary conveyance by the donor in trust for the donees to \u201c have, possess, use, occupy, and enjoy said property, and receive the rents, issues and profits thereof,\u201d upon the termination of the life estate' of the donor they became seized in fee of the lands, and by virtue of the statute of 29 Charles II, the same became liable to levy and sale upon execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-10\">The condition annexed to the estate made it inalienable except on' a contingency, which was too remote and uncertain and against public policy. It was a contingency which not only might never happen, but which was so uncertain that it could not control the enjoyment and transferable character of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-11\">There is no restraint of alienation in the deed of trust, nor any limitation over to defeat the estate in the event of a conveyance by the <em>cestui que trust </em>before the payment of the debts provided against by the said deed. If then the <em>cestui que trust </em>had united with the trustee after the death of the grandfather in a conveyance of the property in fee, before execution levied, the purchaser would have taken unincumbered title. It follows that the <em>cestui que trust </em>took the full interest and estate as the land, subject only to the outstanding* legal title, and such estate and interest was necessarily subject to sale under execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-12\">Where a grant or devise is made of the rents, issues and profits of an estate, the legal estate being vested in a trustee, with a condition annexed, that they shall not be subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>present or future,, debts, whether the estate gr\u00e1i\u00edted .or devised be an estate for life or in fee, the condition is void as against public policy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-6\">This is not a special trust. The trustee had nothing to do but to <em>hold </em>the legal- title, <em>permit </em>the parties sto occupy, and when the trust was ended, <em>convey </em>the legal title to them in such manner as <em>they </em>might determine. A more passive trustee can hardly be conceived of.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> Mott <em>v. </em>Buxton, 7 Vesey, 201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\"><em> As to liability for debts, </em>see Fisher <em>v. </em>Taylor, 2 Rawle, <em>33; </em>Vaux <em>v. </em>Park, 7 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 19; Braman, <em>v. </em>Stiles, 2 Pickering, 460. <em>As to future conveyance, </em>see Bank <em>v. </em>Forney, 2 Iredell\u2019s Equity, 181.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b450-12\"> Mebane <em>v. </em>Mebane, 4 Iredell\u2019s Equity, 131; Dick <em>v. </em>Pitchford, 1 Devereux <em>&amp; </em>Battle\u2019s Eq. 480.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-14\"> Duchess of Kingston\u2019s case, 20 State Trials, 355; Hitchin <em>v. </em>Campbell, 2 W.

It is a settled rule of law that ihe beneficial interest of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>whatever it may be, is liable for the payment of his debts. It cannot be so fenced about by inhibitions and restrictions as to secure to it the inconsistent characteristics of right and enjoyment to the beneficiary and immunity from his creditors. A condition precedent that the provision shall not vest until his debts are paid, and a condition subsequent that it shall be divested and forfeited by his insolvency, with a limitation over to another person, are valid, and the law will give them full effect. Beyond this, protection from the claims of creditors is not allowed to go.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">According to these -principles the restrictions in the deed of Beal Basley as to the creditors of the appellants are wholly void.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">But the case does not turn-upon these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Two other questions are presented, and our judgment must be determined by their solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">One of these questions is, whether the appellees, who were complainants in the bills filed to reach the interests of the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>appellants in the property in question, are not concluded by the decree rendered in those cases by the Supreme Court of .Tennessee. The cases were consolidated in that court, and decided together. The bills were filed in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, and addressed to the presiding chancellor. They contained this averment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201c From the foregoing statement of facts your honor will readily perceive that said James B. and John Nichol, Jr., are invested with at least a remainder interest in fee in said tract \u00f3f 808f acres allotted to them as aforesaid; that the legal title to said tract being in John Nichol, Sr., or his heirs, the'same is'not subject to execution at law:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Hence the aid of \u00e1 court of equity was invoked. The prayer of the bills was that the \u201c interest \u201d of the appellants in the property should be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The chancellor decreed against the complainants, upon, the grounds, that the restriction in. the trust as to the liability of the property for the debt's of James B. and John Nichol was valid; that .the creditors could not compel the conveyance of the legal title when the beneficiaries themselves were not in a condition to demand it; and that \u201cthe provisions of the deed were within the purview of the act of' 1882;\u201d and the property thus protected from the claims of the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The complainants appealed to the Supreme Court. That court held \u201c that said property is not liable for such debts and judgments of the complainants, and that the same may not be subjected'to the payment and satisfaction of said debts and judgments,\u201d and the decree of the chancellor was affirmed. As regards the complainants in that case, who are defendants in this, the parties were the same, and the question to be determined was the same. But it is said that Beal Basley was living when that litigation was begun, and dead when this bill was filed. That Basley was living could have made no difference in the result of the former suits, and .cannot affect the bar arising from them in this suit. As' averred in the bill, the beneficiaries had a vested re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>mainder in fee. Their right to the property was as perfect *'hen as it is now. Their estate was an equitable one, but alienable and descendible, and subject to be conveyed by the same instruments as a legal estate. It was not then vested in possession. The time of possession was dependent upon the termination of the life estate of Beal Basley. But this only lessened its value for the time being. Its liability to their creditors ivas not in the least affected. It is impossible that the Supreme Court of Tennessee should-have held otherwise, and the decree have proceeded upon a different view of the subject. The language of the decree repels the suggestion. \u00a5e cannot give any weight to an objection which assumes as its basis such a reflection upon that enlightened tribunal. The decree as to the property and questions here in controversy is <em>res judicata, </em>and it has every element of conclusiveness as to those who were parties to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Several defendants in this suit were not parties to that litigation, and hence are not bound by the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">This brings us to examine the second question presented for our consideration. It relates to the effect of the act of 1832, referred to by the chancellor in his decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The Supreme Court of Tennessee held that it had no power to subject stocks, choses in actions, or equitable interests, to the payment of j udgments at law. The legislature of the State thereupon passed the act in question.*</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The first section declares that a bill may be filed \u201cto compel the discovery of any bank stock, or other kind of stock, or any property, or thing in action, held in trust for him\u201d (the defendant), \u201c and to prevent the transfer of any such stock, property, monej, thing in action, or the payment or delivery thereof to the defendant, except where such trust has been created by, or the fund has proceeded from, some person other than the defendant himself, and is declared by will duly recorded, or by deed duly proved and registered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4R\">The second section authorizes the court to decree payment of the judgment out of \u201cany property,.stock, money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>or things in action, belonging to the defendant or held in trust for him, with the exception above stated, which shall be discovered by the proceedings in chancery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The fourth section provides that when service cannot be made at law, and a judgment cannot be obtained, and also where the demand is of a purely equitable nature, \u201c a court of equity shall have jurisdiction to subject legal and equitable interests in every species of stock and other property, with the exception hereinbefore stated, and also in real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The Supreme Court of the State decided, in the suits referred to, that this statute embraces trusts of real estate, and that it exempted the property in question from liability to the judgment creditors. There can be no doubt of the power of the legislature to pass the statute. Its wisdom and policy are considerations with which we .have nothing to do. Being a local statute and involving a rule of property, we adopt the construction which has been given to it by the highest judicial tribunal of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">This is decisive of the case as to those of the appellees who were not parties to the former suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the ' cause will be remanded to that court with directions to enter a decree</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">In conformity to this opinion.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"ADc\">Session laws of 1832, p. 22; Ewing <em>v. </em>Cantrell, Meigs, 364.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
