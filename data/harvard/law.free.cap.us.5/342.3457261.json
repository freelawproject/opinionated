The liability of property, the product of an enemy country, and coming from it during war, is irrespective of the <em>status domicilii, </em>guilt or innocence of the owner. If it come from enemy territory, it bears the impress of enemy property. If it belong to a loyal citizen of the country of the captors, it is nevertheless as much liable to condemnation as if owned by a citizen or subject of the hostile countiy or by the hostile government itself. The only qualification of these rules is, that where, upon the breaking out of hostilities or as soon after as possible, the owner escapes with such property as he can take with him, or in good faith thus early romoves his property, with the view of putting it beyond the dominion of the hostile power, the property in such cases is exempt from the liability which would otherwise attend it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"AHb\">6.

The steamer had 'gone out of Mobile Bay on the previous night in the dark, and endeavoring, as the captors alleged, to escape, was pursued and on the next morning captured by the Kennebec for breach of blockade. She was, at this time, in a disabled condition owiug to a storm in the night, and on the firing of a gun across her bows hove to, without resistance, and without having changed her course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">Being sent into New Orleans for adjudication, her captain (one Meaher), who owned her;.the mate, named Flynn, and her chief engineer, were examined <em>in preparatorio, on the standing interrogatories. </em>These were all the witnesses thus examined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-9\"><em>In reply to these interrogatories, </em>Meaher, the captain, stated that he was born in Maine, but had lived thirty years in Mobile. \u201c I am a citizen,\u201d he continued, \u201c of the <em>State of Alabama, to which I owe my </em>allegiance.\u201d IIo stated that the vessel came out of harbor with the American flag flying; that he was owner of the vessel and <em>\u00f3f the cargo ; </em>\u201c that the voyage began at Mobile, and was to have ended at Havana;\u201d that in case the vessel had arrived there, he thought that he should have reshipped the .cargo to some place where he could have received a better price for it than he could in Havana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-10\">Flynn, the mate, examined after Meaher had been, made the same statement as to the destination of the vessel and cargo. He stated, however, that the vessel sailed \u201cunder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>English colors and had no. other.\u201d As to their ownership, he said: ..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">\u201c The owners of the vessel were Captain Meaher and <em>brother. </em>They also owned <em>half </em>the cargo. <em>The balance was for Confederate government account. </em>The greatest part of the cotton was produced upon Meaher\u2019s lands. I understood they had built the Gray Jacket expressly to carry their own cotton to Havana, but they had to allow the government an interest of one-half; otherwise they would not have been permitted to leave Mobile.

She could not have left it otherwise than secretly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-7\">The cotton, it appeared, was the product of Alabama.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-8\">The depositions in which these statements were made, were taken on the 26th of February, 1864. About a month afterwards, Meaher filed what he called a \u201c claim, and <em>answer </em>\u25a0 to the libel.\u201d It'presented a narrative in its material parts, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-9\">\u201c That he, the said Timothy, is the true and <em>bond fide </em>owner \u2022 of the said steamer, and of the cargo thereon, and that no other person is the owner thereof..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-10\">\u201c That he was living in Mobile, at the time the rebellion broke out, and that he had resided there for upwards of thirty years prior thereto; that after the breaking out of the said rebellion he gave no aid to the same; that he had previously, by a life of industry and economy, and the prosecution of legitimate business, acquired a large amount of property; that after the breaking out of the rebellion he became anxious to adopt some measure by which he might be able to withdraw the same to a place of security; that with that object he built the said steamer with his own means, and loaded her with the goods constituting her cargo, and then procured a clearance from the so-called Confederate authorities, exercising all the powers of a government <em>defacto </em>in Mobile,'State of Alabama,- from the said port of Mobile to the port of Havana, in the island of Cuba, then and now a port of.\u2018a country in amity with the United States, as-the only means by.which he could be enabled to effect the withdrawal of his property from the limits of the so-called Confederacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cAnd lie now avers the truth to be that his right of property in the said steamer and in her <em>cargo, </em>which was <em>full and complete while the same were in the port of Mobile, </em>continued to be full and complete after he had gotten upon the high seas with the intent of escaping from the power and control of the States in rebellion to a port in a country in amity with tho United States, and that the said steamer and cargo were not at any time after their escape from the said port of Mobile, rightfully subject to capture, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">\u201c And further answering, he says that the President by a proclamation dated the 8th December, A.

It was an oath of loyalty, promising thereafter faithfully to support the Constitution of the United States, &amp;c., being an oath prescribed in the proclamation of President Lincoln of December 8th, 1863, referred to in the answer, and by which the said President, reciting that it was desired by some persons heretofore engaged in rebellion, to resume their allegiance to the United States, \u201cproclaimed and made known to all persons who had directly, or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is granted to them, and each of them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves, and <em>in property cases loliere rights of third parties shall.have </em>intervened, and upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath,\u201d ,&amp;c.

Meaher declares that he was at all times a loyal citizen of the United States, and yet relies on the proclamation of President Lincoln, in favor of those \u201c who have participated in the existing rebellion;\u201d declares that he has ever acted a patriotic part, and then sets up a \u201cfull pardon\u201d for treason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-12\">The proclamation and pardon was never meant for persons such as Meaher describes himself to be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-13\">But for whomever meant, it excepts \u201cproperty cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the right of third parties had intervened.\u201d Here.the right of the captors, by the act of seizure, intervened.

The ease is no better on the remission from the Treasury. The vessel was not \u201cfound\u201d at sea within one section of the act of July 13,1861. She was captured when sailing, a flag flying, her officers and crew aboard; nothing derelict about her; seized, not found. Neither were the vessel and cargo coming from a rebellious State or section \u201c into the other parts of the United States\u201d so as to come within the other section. The voyage was unquestionably to Havana. Going from Mobile to Maine, <em>via </em>Havana, the plan Anally set up, was plainly all an afterthought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-8\">Besides, the present condemnation was incurred by virtue of the public law of war, and not under the statute of July 13, 1861, and is therefore, by the terms of the warrant, excluded from its operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-9\">Even if this were not so, the Secretary\u2019s power to remit forfeitures incurred by virtue of the statute of 1861 is limited' by the words of the statute to cases of seizure and proceedings to enforce forfeitures <em>under the statute, </em>and does not extend to and cannot be exercised in cases of maritime captures of vessels and cargoes under the law of war, adjudicated under that law, and in the prize jurisdiction, and then condemned 'as prize of war on account of breach of blockade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-10\">Recent cases in this court show vessels captured and condemned as prize of war, though at the time of capture, and until so captured, liable also to seizure and forfeiture under the statute of 13th July, 1861, as belonging, in whole or in part, to citizens or inhabitants of the insurrectionary States, and found at sea.

He was captured on the high seas, outside the lino of the block ading vessels, steering to Havana, trying, as the captors re port, and, as seems obvious, to escape. If he could bring a host of witnesses to show what he was and what he meant before sailing; that he was then a loyal man, wishing to return to loyal regions and loyal friends, these facts contradict them all, in a way past any power of -refutal. Why did he not first <em>seek </em>the blockading squad ron ? Indeed, the matters set up in his affidavits seem to have been quite an afterthought. There is nothing even in <em>his </em>deposition taken <em>in preparatorio, </em>which so much as adumbrates the scheme subsequently set up as the true history. If ever a claimant showed a character and a case where further proof ought <em>not. </em>to be allowed, it is Meaher. He has shown that he can make proof <em>ad libitum. </em>He first gives evideuce and files an answer,-showing one case, sufficient, as he supposes, for the then necessity. But the mat\u00e9 contradicts him as to ownership, and the government produces the document found on board, which confirms what the mate had declared. He then files a second affidavit, setting' up a further case, and explaining away the evidence against him. He next petitions the Secretary of the Treasury, setting forth his ease as he thought needful. Objection is made by the Attorney-General that his case is radically defective in its facts, the non-existing facts being pointed out. And lo!' Meaher immediately interlines and states the required facts. Allowance for further proof in such a case would be a direct encouragement to perjury. Courts of admiralty are most careful not to lay snares in this way for defective consciences.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\"><em>We </em>may, moreover, well doubt\" whether Meaher was an honest or a loyal man at all. He confesses that he meant to cheat the Confederacy for his own benefit, not for the nation\u2019s. And why does he state that his allegiance was due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>to the State of Alabama? Did he not know that Alaba na was then in rebellion against the nation ? But\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-6\">2. If he were ever so loyal, and if his narrative, in its last elaborated and interlineated form, were true, it would be no defence:</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-7\"><em>(a) </em>The law of war denounces, as being a trading with the enemy, the withdrawal by a citizen of this country of any property without license, from the enemies\u2019 territory after a considerable time has elapsed since the beginning of hostilities.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In that case, this court held that goods purchased in Eugland before hostilities, and shipped to the purchaser in this country by his agent, eleven months after the declaration of war, were confiscable in a prize court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-8\"><em>(0) </em>In Meaher\u2019s affidavits his purpose of removing this property \u201c <em>to aplace of </em>security, beyond the power and control of the States in rebellion,\u201d is presented in such a way as that an intention to return to his residence and business in Mobile is consistent with it; nor arc there any facts alleged in that document' tending to show a dissolution of the commercial establishment and domicil in Mobile (proved by Flynn\u2019s deposition <em>in preparatorio </em>to have existed), prior to or at the time of his sailing on this voyage, or any suspension of the mercantile pursuits in which he had been engaged during the entire period of war. If the claimant was a- member of a house of trade in Mobile, engaged in the enemy\u2019s commerce, then, independently7 of personal residence, a continued connection with such a house would operate in law to prevent any divestiture of that enemy quality impressed upon him by7 residence and commerce during the war in Alabama.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-9\">(c) Mealier alleges that this cotton, \u201c had been produced on his own plantation.\u201d Now, no doctrine is better settled than that the produce of a person\u2019s own plantation in the enemy\u2019s country is considered, in a prize court, as the property of the enemy, independent of his own.personal residence and occupation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-10\">Every way the case is against the claimant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\n<em>Mr. B.

No man has; or can have, any interest but what he takes as the mere gift of the crown. Beyond the extent of that gift he has nothing. This is the principle of law on the subject, founded on the wisest reasons. The right of making'war and peace is exclusively in the crown. <em>The acquisitions of war belong to the crown, </em>and the disposal of these acquisitions may be of the utmost importance for the purposes both-of war and peace. This is no peculiar doctrine of our constitution; it is universally received as a necessary principle of public jurisprudence by all writers on the subject. <em>Bello parta cedunt rep\u00fablica}.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-9\">\u201cAnd I must add, that though I have suffered a party to stand before the court for the purpose of arguing the question, f do not know the party who can legally stand before it, pray<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ing a condemnation to the crown, which the crown itself pub licly renounces.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-6\">\u201c When I state the position contended for on the part of the captors to be in effect this, that it shall be in the power of every man who has made a capture, \u2014 of the pettiest commander of the pettiest privateei*, \u2014 to force on, in spite of all the prudence of the crown, opposed to such an attempt, the discussion and decision of the most delicate questions, the discussion and decision of which may involve the country in the most ruinous hostilities, I state a -proposition that must awaken the apprehension of every man who hears me as to the extent of the danger which would attend the establishment of such a principie.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">III. <em>Is the case me for further proof ? </em>.Opposing counsel argue that it is now attempted to show a different case from that presented by .the proofs <em>in preparatorio. </em>This is not so-; though we may wish to show a fuller one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-8\">The standing interrogatories are not adapted to reach the facts in all cases of capture, in a war so special as oursv What are these standing interrogatories ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-9\">To ascertain the legal <em>status </em>of a vessel in relation to her neutrality, a limited number of questions called \u201c standing interrogatories \u201d were prepared many years ago by Sir William Scott, and have been adopted by the courts of the United States without substantial change. No better illustration of their occasional ill adaptation to elicit the facts necessary to the understanding a capture arising under a rebellion, Buch as was ours, can be had than the answer they cause Meaher to give in reply to the first interrogatory when the question is not read in connection therewith. On that answer the captoi\u2019s found an ax\u2019gument of disloyalty. The answer which the witness makes is :</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-10\">\u201cI was born in Maine; I live in Mobile, and have lived there thirty <em>years; </em>I am a citizen of the State of Alabama, to which I <em>owe my allegiance.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-11\">The matter is explained when you see to what question the answer is made. It is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>\u201c </em>Where were you born, and where do you now live, and how long have you lived there ? Of what prince or <em>state </em>are you a subject or citizen, and to which do you owe allegiance?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-6\">So it is with all the proofs <em>in preparatorio. </em>They are responsive to specific questions, and are not adapted to get out a history in a case where a history may well exist. Any exfoliation of the responsive facts \u2014 that which would make the history \u2014 would, as responsive to these interrogatories, be irregular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-7\">We concede that, in a foreign war and a blockade of a foreign port, where there are no circumstances of license or withdrawal of friendly property to be proved, there would be no such doubtful <em>status </em>of the <em>res </em>as would allow further proof. But the case, we repeat, is not one of this sort. It is the case of an insurrection by certain people in certain parts of one nation; a case where many people in the insurrectionary district remained loyal, and wished to leave the district. Certainly a capture here presents a different case from one of an enemy\u2019s vessel, and enemy property, of a claimant enemy by domicil in enemy country, pursuing a voyage in the interest of the enemy government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-8\">The few discrepancies in the testimony are easily reconcilable. Meaher testifies that he owns the whole vessel and cargo. Flynn testifies that it belongs to Meaher, that the owners were Meaher &amp; Brother. The explanation is that Meaher knew the fact that he was sole owner, and that Flynn did not know. Meaher knew that he put his own cotton on board, and, although forced to consent to ship half on government account, this did not change the ownership, and it, in fact, was all his own. This he now offers to prove, and has proved, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-9\">So as to the paper found on board.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-10\">The document is not signed by the claimant, and therefore ought not to affect him unless it is shown that he agreed to it. It is an offer by the Confederate government to furnish the whole cargo on joint account with Meaher Brothers, upon certain conditions. This was under date of October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>22d, 1863, more than two months before the voyage, while the vessel was fitting out. That this contract was not accepted nor acted on is shown by Flynn :</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I understood they built this vessel expressly to carry their own cotton to Havana, but they had to allow government an \u25a0interest of one-lialf in the cargo, otherwise they would not have been permitted to leave. Mealier had necessarily to <em>appear </em>to accept it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-7\">The claimant makes no contradictory cases. The facts which he seeks to prove are only those which he set forth in his claim and answer, explained,-and by proper filling up, enlarged. No one of them is'contradictory to anything he testified to in his deposition <em>in preparatorio.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\">IV. <em>Is the </em>history, <em>if it were in </em>proof, <em>no clef mee ? </em>We submit, in opposition to the captor\u2019s counsel, that it is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-9\">(a) The right of withdrawal of person and goods by a citizen from hostile territory, has always been recognized, and applauded as an act of loyalty. The only question has been, what is a <em>reasonable </em>time ? ' That question must always be decided by the circumstances of each case. Nothing can be deduced from rules in a foreign war, as applicable to this rebellion. The citizen had a right to suppose that his government would put down the rebellion within a reasonable time, so that he would not be obliged to quit home and property, as was hoped by all, and so wait. The Confederacy did not allow their citizens to leave it if the intention so to do was known. All were retained .-for conscription and taxation. Undeniably, a reasonable time is to be given to collect property, but here the very collection of it tended to lead to suspicion and confiscation. The war was carried on by the r'obels in an unusual and barbarous manner towards persons disposed to be loyal. If this course of the rebels furnishes no reason for relaxation of the rule by the courts, it certainly tends to excuse delays, and accounts for inconsistencies in the conduct of the claimant not to be judged by the rules of foreign warfare.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>In the case of <em>The Si.

The darkness of the night enabled the steamer to avoid the pursuing vessel. In the morning she was seen endeavoring to escape to the southward and eastward. The Kennebec fired a gun across her bows. She hauled down her colors and hove to. The captors took possession of her. Her cargo was found to consist of about five hundred bales of cotton and a few other articles of small value. She was put in charge of a prize crew and sent to New Orleans for adjudication. The claimant, Meaher, was examined <em>in preparatorio. </em>lie states that he was born in Maine; he had lived thirty years in Mobile; he was a citizen of Alabama, and owed his allegiance to that State; he was captain of the Gray Jacket, and owned the vessel and cargo; the vessel was bound for Havana; he built her near Mobile; the cotton with which she was loaded was raised in Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Elynn, the mate, was also examined. According to his affidavit, she sailed under English colors; her machinery had broken clown, and she was in a disabled condition when Naptured. He says, \u201cShe was taken running the blockade.\u201d \u201c The- owners of the vessel were Captain Meaher and brother.\u201d . . . \u201c They also owned half the cargo. The balance was for Confederate government account.\u201d . . . \u201cI know the Gray Jacket, on the trip on which she was captured, had attempted to sail covertly and secretly from Mobile, then under a blockade. She could not have left otherwise than secretly.\u201d . . . \u201c J. M. and T. Meaher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>owned the vessel and half the cargo. The Confederate government owned the other half.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Among the papers found on board was an agreement between the claimant and Meyers, a military officer and agent of the rebel government, whereby it was stipulated that \u201c the government will furnish the whole cargo of cotton, and will make over to the owners of the vessel one-half of the cotton, in consideration of which the owners do agree to deliver the other half belonging to the government at Havana, free of charge, except half of the expenses of pressing and storing incurred at Mobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">That \u201c the said steamer is to return to Mobile, if practicable; if not, then to some other Confederate port; and the government is to be allowed one-half of the carrying capacity of the steamer on the return voyage,\u201d at rates specified.-</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">And that \u201c in the event of a pai\u2019tial loss of the outward cargo, the portion of cotton saved is to be equally divided between the parties at the port of destination; and any loss on the inward cargo to be settled on the principle of general average, so far as the cargo is concerned.\u201d \u25a0 Meaher\u2019s affidavit <em>in preparatorio </em>was taken on the 26th of February,' 1864. It ignored the interest of his brother in the vessel and cargo, and alleged the property of both to be in himself. -It concealed the ownership of half the cargo by the rebel government and the contract between him and the rebel military agent. Upon these subjects not a word was uttered. \u25a0 On the 21st of March he filed an answer and claim, which do not differ materially from his affidavit <em>in preparatorio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The court ordered the paper to be stricken from th'e files, but gave him leave to file an affidavit, which was accordingly done on the 29th of August following. This affidavit sets up an entirely new state of facts. According to its averments, he never sympathized with nor gave any aid to the rebellion; the steamer was built to enable him to\u2019get away with as much as possible of his property; he did not take his family with him, lest it might excite suspicion and defeat hi? object; the rebel government furnished none of the cot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ton with which his vessel was laden; he was compelled to agree that one-half of it should be taken on account of that government, and also to assent to the provisions of the contract with the rebel military agent; otherwise, he would not have been allowed to depart; it was his intention, upon reaching Havana, to claim all the cotton as his property, and to appropriate the proceeds entirely to himself; on the 18th of March, 1864, he took the oath prescribed by the President\u2019s proclamation of the 8th of December, 1863; he is not within any of its exceptions, and is entitled, by its provisions, to tho restoration of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The court below condemned, the vessel and cargo as prize, of war, and the decree is before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In this court a motion was made at the hearing, and argued at length, for an order for further proof, to enable the claimant to establish the facts sot forth in the affidavit as to his loyalty to the United States, and the motives and object of his departure from Mobile with the vessel and cargo, and also to enable him to bring before this court the remission by the Secretary of the Treasury, bearing date of the i?6th of March, 1866, of all right and claim to the property as forfeited to the United States, \u201cso far as such forfeiture was incurred under the provisions of the act of July 13, 1861, and not otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The court consented at once to receive this paper without further proof, and it is properly in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">The questions for our consideration are:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The effect of. the amnesty proclamation of the 8th of December, 1863, in connection with tho oath of the claimant ?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">The propriety of making an order for further proof?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">And whether the remission by the Secretary of the Treasury entitles the claimant to the restoration of the vessel and cargo ?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">The proposition as to the proclamation and oath was not pressed in the argument here. If it were relied upon, the answers are obvious and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">There is no satisfactory proof that the claimant is not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>one of the classes of excepted persons. His own affidavit under the circumstances, is clearly insufficient to establish the negative. \u201c Property cases, where the rights of third persons shall have intervened,\u201d are excluded in terms by the proclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The proclamation is founded upon the act of July 17,1862, and has reference only to property subject to confiscation as there denounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Both the statute and proclamation are wholly silent as to maritime captures like the one before us, and neither has any application to that class of cases. In no view of the subject can this proclamation be held to extinguish the liability of a vessel and cargo running the blockade, and seized <em>in flagrante delicto. </em>It would be a straDge result in such a case if the subsequent oath of the claimant were allowed to establish his innocence and compel the restitution of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">This is not a proper case for an order for further proof. The order is always made with extreme caution, and only where the ends of justice clearly require it. The claimant forfeited all right to ask it by the guilty concealment in his first affidavit, and in his subsequent affidavit and claim. The allowance would hold out the strongest temptation to subornation of perjury. There is nothing to warrant such an exercise of our discretion. \"We are entirely satisfied with the testimony in the case, and entertain no doubt of the correctness of the conclusions we draw from it. If the allegations of the claimant are true, he postponed his effort to escape too long to derive any benefit from it. The law does not tolerate such delay. The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The order of the Secretary of the. Treasury does not affect the case. It is limited in its terms to the rights of the United States, arising from forfeiture under the act of July 13,1861. That act provides \u201cthat all goods and chattels, wares, and merchandise, coming from a State or part of a State in rebellion\u201d into the other parts of the United States, . . . . \u201c by land or water,\u201d . . . . \u201c shall, together with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>vessel or vehicle conveying the same,\u201d . . . . \u201c be forfeited to the United States.\u201d It contains nothing as to goods and vessels going from a rebel to a foreign or neutral port.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The Gray Jacket was not proceeding to a loyal State. It is true that after this objection was taken by the Attorney-General to the authority of the Secretary to interpose,-the claimant amended his petition by interlining the averment that he was attempting to take the property \u201c into the loyal States by way of Havana, if his vessel should prove fit for the voyage.\u201d But this does not recall what he had before sworn, nor change the facts as they are-disclosed in the record. In his first affidavit he said, \u201c The voyage began in Mobile and was to have ended at Havana.\u201d \u201cIn case we had arrived at our destined port, I think I should have reshipped the cargo to some port where I could have obtained a better price for it than 1 could obtain there.\u201d The mate also testified \u201c that the voyage began at Mobile and was to have ended at Havana.\u201d The claimant in his affidavit speaks of going to Havana, but was silent as to going beyond there, to any of the loyal States; and nowhere disclosed such a purpose until he amended his petition to the Secretary under the pressure of the occasion. \"We are satisfied that at the time of the capture no such intention existed. This brings the vessel and cargo within the exception prescribed by the Secretary. The order does not reach the case. But if the order of the Secretary were unqualified that the property should be released and discharged, the result would be the same. The power of the Secretary to remit forfeitures and penalties is defined and limited by law. The jurisdiction is a special one and he may not transcend it. If he do, his act is void. He has no power to remit in any case of property captured as maritime prize of war. The subject lies wholly beyond the sphere of his authority. The liability of the property is irrespective of the <em>status domicilii, </em>guilt or innocence of the owner. If it come from enemy territory, it bears the impress of enemy property. If it belong to a loyal citizen of the country of the captors, it is nevertheless as much liable to condemnation as if owned by a citizen or sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ject of the hostile country cr by the hostile government itself. The only qualification of these rules is, that where, upon the breaking out of hostilities, or as soon after as pos-' sible, the owner escapes with such property as he can take with him, or in good faith thus early removes his property, with the view of putting it beyond the dominion of the hostile power, the property in such cases is exempt from the liability which would otherwise attend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Such, with this limitation, is the settled law of this and of all other prize courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The case before us, as we view it, has no redeeming feature. It has no claim to the benefit of the exception we have mentioned. The vessel and cargo were properly condemned as enemy property and for breach of the blockade. There is nothing persuasive to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The decree of the court below is</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
