Yocum, who went'on board the said schooner as supercargo, and express instructions were given by claimants to their agents to bring the said schooner, with her cargo, to this port of New .Orleans; that it always was their design and intention to cause said schooner and her cargo to be brought to New Orleans and not to be taken to any other place whatsoever; and that it was their intention to ship the said cargo from this port <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>according to law, to the best market.

That the cargo and vessel were the property of loyal citizens of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-14\">2. That the voyage was authorized by the civil and naval authorities of the United States, and was undertaken solely with the view of giving up the vessel and cargo to the blockading fleet, in accordance with such authorization.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-15\">3. That the permit in favor of the claimants was employed in good faith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-16\">The evidence as meant apparently to be relied on in support of the decree below, points to two matters only as giv-. ing the case'a bad aspect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-17\">1. An argument will perhaps be made against the claimants from the documented character of the vessel. But Worne, acting for Brott, Davis &amp; Co., necessarily employed as agents, such persons as could be useful in the business about which they were employed. Embarked in a transaction such as this was, \u201c compelled,\u201d in the language of Lord Stowell, applied to persons similarly situated, \u201c to pick their way in fear and silence,\u201d walking, as it were, at every step, over burning ploughshares, these agents had necessarily to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>employ great caution and a certain amount of subterfuge. \u201c This,\u201d said Lord Stowell, in a case like this,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c is not very much matter of surprise or of serious judicial animadversion.\u201d They were obliged, <em>in order to accomplish their agency, </em>to deceive the enemy. That, of course. If they had avowed their purpose, proclaimed that the vessel and cargo were the property of loyal citizens of the United States, and documented the vessel in accordance with the facts, it is easy to perceive that both agents and agency would have been strangled in the outset. The master and crew believed tba.t they were destined on a voyage to Havana; the Confederate military and civil authorities believed the same thing. On that belief alone could the vessel have obtained her clearance. That all this was a deception, and that the real destination was New Orleans, the testimony of Mr. Hubb\u00e9ll, a witness above all question, makes certain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">There is no motive that can be well suggested or conceived that could induce the claimants or their agents to act a part that was not open, fair, and consistent with the main and avowed design. They wished to bring out from Mobile this cargo of cotton, and being authorized to do so, they had no motive to evade the blockade. Their only concern was to get safely past the hostile batteries and place their property under the protection of the blockading fleet. There was no spoliation of papers or cargo, no attempt at resistance or escape; but an open, voluntary surrender.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">2. An argument may be attempted from the memorandum as to the $150,034, and from Yocum\u2019s letters of introduction. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-8\">The former was simply an acknowledgment, on the part of J. Hohenstein &amp; Co., that Yocum had credit on their books for $150,000, subject to settlement between the partners. As to the letters, it is, so far as this case is concerned, of no sort of importance what purposes Mr-. Yocum had in view at New' Orleans. The letter to Mr. Pilcher relates to Mr. Yocum\u2019s business and purposes, and not to the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ness and purposes of Brott, Davis &amp; Shons. It is true, Mr. Pilcher is informed that Yocum is under heavy bonds to take his shipment to Havana, and he is requested to have it released and cleared for that port. The meaning is easily explained: In order to get this cotton out of Mobile, the civil and military requirements of the port had to be complied with. Among others, a bond had to be given that it should be taken to the asserted port of destination. The letter means to say, that if it should be understood in Mobile that the cargo was taken to New Orleans, and there protected, Yocum\u2019s bondsmen would be prosecuted for the penalty. Hence the anxiety for the reshipment of the cotton to Havana.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-6\">3. The fact that the departure from Mobile was so timed as to bring the Sea Lion out to sea at <em>night, </em>argues nothing against fair purpose. The vessel had, of necessity, to escape under cover of the darkness. Does any One suppose that the civil and naval authorities at Mobile would have permitted her to go out in broad day, in full view of the fleet, and to have thus rendered her capture certain ? The attempt to have done so would 'have disclosed the purpose of the voyage, and have induced the seizure of the vessel and cargo, and death to every person concerned in the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">The conduct, then, of the claimants throughout this transaction, we assume to have been open and fair.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-8\">II. <em>As to the law.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-9\">1. The order of Admiral Farragut to his commander of ;he Mobile blockade, not to capture vessels and cargoes in the situation of the Sea Lion and cargo, together with his indorsement of the \u201cpermit\u201d of the acting collector, were acts incidental to his position, and privileged this vessel and cargo from capture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-10\">In <em>The Hope,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the commander of one squadron gave a license with a view to exempt a ship and cargo from capture by another squadron, Lord Stowell expressly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>dared that the admiral on a station has power relative to the ships under his immediate command, and can restrain them from committing acts of hostility; though he said that the commander could not grant a safeguard of this kind beyond the limits of his own station.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-6\">Admiral Farragut did not go beyond tbe limits of his own station, but was acting within them. And he had given explicit orders to the commander of his squadron, \u2014 orders which must have been communicated at the time of the seizure in question to every vessel of the squadron, \u2014 that property in the predicament of that of the claimants should not. be regarded as hostile, but be sent to New Orleans for an examination of the facts. Besides, by indorsing the permit of the acting collector.he adopted and made it his own, and every officer of his command was bound to respect and enforce it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-7\">2. Even if the act of Admiral Farragut, in privileging the property of the claimants from capture, was irregular, it by no means follows that such property is condemnable as prize. Where the owners stand clear of any intention of fraud their act is not illegal, although its authorization may have been irregular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-8\">In the <em>Vrow </em>Barbara,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the vessel was taken on her voyage from l\u00edavre to Hamburg. She had been stopped and examined in going to Havre, and had been informed in effect that she might go there. The master knew \u00a9f the blockade, but understood it had been relaxed. Lord Stowell restored the property, on the ground that she had been permitted to go in.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-9\">In <em>The Henricus</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the master had been permitted by one of the blockading fleet to go in with a cargo of coal, and was captured in coming out. The court held that the permission to go in with a cargo included the permission to come out with a cargo: that is to say, a mere inferential permission to bring out a cargo was respected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-10\">In <em>The Venscab,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the'same principle was applied: \u201cI beg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>it may be understood,\u201d said Lord Stowell, \u201c that I hold the blockade to have existed generally, though individual ships are entill\u00e9d to an exemption from penalty, in consequence' of the irregular indulgence -shown them by the blockading force.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\"><em>The Juffroiv Maria Schr\u0153der</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>stood on the same ground, and was decided on the same principle..</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">In <em>The Johanna </em>Maria,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Dr. Lushington, referring to the cases j ust cited as applicable to the blockade of the Baltic norts. said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-8\">\u201c If it can be shown that any vessel has been permitted improperly to enter or come o\u00fat, I shall confer the benefit of restoration on a vessel so circumstanced.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-9\">He held, too, in accordance with Lord Stowell, and in accordance with universal .public Jaw, that such restoration, in .consequence of . improper or irregular indulgence on the part of a blockading force, or in consequence of a more regular and formal license, did not have the effect to vitiate a blockade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-10\">Further: The order of General Banks, approved and adopted by Admiral Farragut, was a legitimate exercise of their authority. In granting these special licenses, they had in view only public objects; they sought to obtain possession of an article which, by the policy of the hostile government, had become contraband of war, an article which this court, in Mrs. Alexander\u2019s case,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> held liable to capture from' its peculiar .character and the position given it by hostile legislation. \u201cIt is well known,\u201d said the Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, \u201c that cotton has constituted the chief reliance of the rebels for means to purchase the munitions of war in Europe. It is matter of history that, rather than to permit it to come into possession of the National troops, the rebel government has everywhere devoted it, however owned, to destruction. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>value of that'destroyed at New-Orleans, just before its capture, has been estimated at $80,000,000. The l\u2019ebels regard it as one of their main sinews of war, and no principle of equity or just policy required, when the National occupation was itself precarious, that it should be spared from capture, and allowed to remain in case of the withdrawal of the Union troops an element of strength to the rebellion.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-6\">It was this peculiar property, this element of power and strength, this support of the Confederate treasury at home and abroad, that the military commanders sought to withdraw from the control of the eiiemy and subject to the control of the government. It was a means of coercing the hostile power; -an operation of war under the guise of trade. It will not be denied that General Banks could organize military expeditions to capture this property, so important to the enemy and so important to us also. Could he not accomplish the same object by calling to his aid-traders, who, under the stimulus of gain, would penetrate the hostile territory and bring out this support of the hostile existence? General Banks and-Admiral Earragut were not thinking of commercial intercourse, but of crippling the enemy, and depriving him of his chief resource and main' reliance. They were acting and prosecuting\u2019 the war in one of the modes which, in the exercise of the large discretion incident to their position, they were entitled to select. They did not authorize general trade, general commercial intercourse irrespective of time or place or commodity (that to which neutrals might have objected); but what may be called a -belligerent trade in its objects and purposes, limited to a particular article, and that everywdiere within .the hostile territory liable to capture.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b654-7\">\n<em>Mr. Ashton, Assistant Attorney-General, and Mr. Gushing, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\"> Not set forth in the records or briefs, nor as the ease was decided essentially important to be set out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"> The Goede Hoop, Edwards, 327.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-11\"> 1 Dodson, 226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\"> Reported, in the notes to The Juffrow Maria Schr\u0153der, 3 Robinson, 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-11\"> 3 Robinson, 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"ADV\"> Deane on the Law of Blockade, 86, 115</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b653-12\"> 2 Wallace, 404.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-8\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b654-8\">Mr. Justice SWAYNE</author>\n<p id=\"A2x\">delivered 'the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The vessel and cargo were', captured and condemned as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>prize of.war. The appellants seek to'reverse the decree upon the ground that both were protected by a license. The validity and effect of the alleged license is the main question to be considered. Before proceeding to examine that subject, there are several other features of the case which invite remark and must not be passed by in silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The vessel was'fitted out and loaded at Mobile, which was then enemy territory, and in a state of stringent blockade. The cargo consisted of two hundred and seventy-two bales of cotton, and seven barrels of turpentine. She left Mobile on the 8th of May, 1863, under the Confederate flag. She had no other. About 12 o\u2019clock in the night of the 9th of May, and about four miles southeast from Fort Morgan, she was discovered, fired upon, stopped, seized, and sent to Key West, where the decree of condemnation was subsequently pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Netto was her captain, and Yocum the supercargo. There were on board, besides them, a crew of seven men and two passengers. Certain papers were found which passed into the hands of the captors, and to which it is proper to advert.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The ship\u2019s register set forth that it had been sworn by M. D. Eslava, that Yocum &amp; Hohensteiu, a firm in Mobile, under the name of J. Ilohensteiii &amp; Co., were the sole owners of the vessel. The shipping articles engaged the crew to navigate the vessel from Mobile to Havana. The manifest sworn to by Netto, stated that the cargo was intended to be conveyed to that port.\" The Spanish consul certified that the goods named in the manifest, were on board and destined for Havana. The clearance, signed by the deputy collector, was for the same place. ' A letter from Oliver &amp; Worne introduced Yocum to Brott, Davis &amp; Shons, of New Orleans, and expressed the hope that lively business transactions between the two houses would follow. Another letter from the same firm to Pilcher, the'President of the Bank of New Orleans, asked him to aid in Yocum\u2019s business, which it was said Yocum would explain to him. A memorandum, signed by Holienstein &amp; Co., stated that Yocum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>had credit on their books for $150,000, and for $17,000, subject to a settlement between him and Hohenstein. The paper, relied upon as a license, was also found on board, and delivered over by Yocum to the captors. After the vessel was libelled, a claim was interposed by Netto and Yocum in behalf of Brott, Davis &amp; Shons. It is under oath, and states that they believe the vessel and cargo are the property of that firm. Yocum states that he was put in charge of the cargo by one Worne, whom he believes to be a partner of Brott, Davie &amp; Shons. They further say that the vessel was bound in good faith to New Orleans, there to deliver her cargo in pursuance of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Brott and Davis gave their affidavit <em>in preparatorio. </em>They insist upon the license, and allege that it was their intention to cause the vessel and cargo to be taken to New Orleans. They aver that they are loyal citizens, and that no enemy of the United States had any interest in the vessel or cargo. The affidavit is very full as to the procuring and transmission of the alleged license, and as to the loading of the vessel at Mobile by their agents; but is wholly silent-as to who are the owners, and does not allege the whole or any part of the ownership to be in themselves. Under the circumstances, this omission can hardly be deemed accidental. It has very much the appearance of the caution of a special plea. Netto and Yocum were also examined <em>in preparatorio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">They repeat their belief as - to the ownership-, except that Netto states the turpentine to have belonged to himself and the crew. Netto also states, that after they had passed Fort Morgan, Yocum told him New Orleans was their destination, and that he would have obeyed Yocum\u2019s order to take the vessel \u25a0 there. Yocum testifies that he was only supercargo, that he was to receive $500. for his services, and that he. had no interest in the propei\u2019ty. He said further, that from what he had heard Worne say in Mobile, his understanding was, that the vessel and cargo belonged to Brott, Davis &amp; Shons, and Oliver &amp; Worne. His instructions were to proceed to the mouth of the Mississippi \u2014 thence to communicate with Brott, Davis &amp; Shons, and to await orders from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>them. ITubbel, one of the passengers, in his examination <em>in </em>preparatorio, says that the clearance was taken for Havana as a blind to enable the vessel to got away. Yocum told him at Mobile that she was going to New Orleans. As evidence of Yocum\u2019s intention to take her to the blockading fleet, he says, that when she started the wind was so low that she could not make more than two miles an hour, and that hence it was difficult to prevail on the pilot to take her out.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In regard to the important fact last mentioned the captain and supercargo are wholly silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">In the light of this testimony, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that -the vessel left Mobile, with alternative purposes; one, if possible to evade the blockading fleet anti make Havana; the other, if intercepted and seized, to set' up the license and insist upon the pretext, that she was proceeding, under its authority, in good faith to New Orleans. As we shall uot place our judgment upon this ground, it is unnecessary further to pursue the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The license relied upon is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Custom House, New Orleans,</p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Collector\u2019s Omice, February 16th, 1863.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The United States military and other-authorities at New Orleans permit cotton to be received here from beyond the United States military lines, and such cotton is exempt from seizure or confiscation. An order is in my hands from Major-General Banks approving and directing this policy. The only condition imposed is that cotton or other produce must not be bought with specie.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">All cotton or other produce brought hither from the Confederate lines by Brott, Davis &amp; Shons will not be interfered with in any manner, and they can ship it direct to any foreign or domestic port.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">George S.

Farragut,</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Bear Admiral.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">The effect of this paper depends upon the authority under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>which it was issued. The fifth section of the act of July 13th, 1861, authorized the President to proclaim any State or part of a State in a condition of insurrection, and it declared, that thereupon all commercial intercourse between that territory and the citizens of the rest of the United States, should cease and be unlawful, so long as the condition of hostility should continue, and that all goods and merchandise coming from such territory, into other parts of the United States, and all proceeding to such territory by land or water, and the vessel or vehicle conveying them, or conveying persons to or from such territory, should be .forfeited to the United States: \u201c <em>Provided, however, </em>That the President may, in his discretion, license and permit commercial intercourse with any such part of said State or section, the inhabitants of which are so declared in a state of insurrection, in such articles, and for such time, and by such persons, as he, in his discretion, may think most conducive to the public-interest; and such intercourse, so far as by him licensed, shall be conducted and carried on only in pursuance of rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">There is no other statutory provision bearing upon the subject, material to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">On the 16th day of August, 1861, the President issued his proclamation declaring the inhabitants of the rebel States, including Alabama, to be in a state of insurrection.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">On the 28th of the same month the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to the provisions of the act referred to, issued a series of regulations upon the subject of commercial intercourse with those States.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">These regulations continued in force until the 31st of March, 1863, when a new series were issued by the same authority. The former were in force when the. alleged license bears date; the latter when the vessel and cargo left Mobile and when they were captured. It \u00cd3 unnecessary to. analyze them. It is sufficient to -remark, that they contain nothing which affords the slightest pretext for issuing such a paper. It is in conflict with rules and requirem\u00e9nts con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tamed in both of them. It finds no warrant in the statute The statute prescribes that the President shall license the trade. The only function of the Secretary was to establish the riles by which it should be regulated, when thus permitted. ' The order of General Banks is not produced. If it were as comprehensive as the special agent assumed it to be, it covered shipments to New Orleans from 'Wilmington, Charleston, and all other.points in the rebel States. It embraced merchandise, coming alike from places within, and places beyond his military lines. With respect to the latter it was clearly void. The President only could grant such/a license. Mobile was then in possession of the enemy. The vessel and cargo bore the stamp of the e tie my property. The paper relied upon was a nullity, and gave them no protection. They were as much liable to capture and condemnation as any other vessel or cargo, leaving a blockaded port and coming within reach of a blockading vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The decree below was rightly rendered, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-9\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b659-7\">Mr. Justice GRIER:</author>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">I do not concur in this judgment.
