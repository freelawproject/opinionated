Their rights, under the contract, depended upon the accounts assigned. The accounts were to -be put into speedy collection. The first'count of the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, alleges that this was done. If more was collected than Quigg should award, the plaintiffs-were to pay the balance to .the defendants below; if less, the defendants below-were to make up-the deficiency. The contract without .the schedule had .no certain meaning.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The absence of the schedule made a patent ambiguity which' cannot be supplied by parol evidence.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b800-6\">\u2022 If this contract -cou-ld- have been: rendered competent by extrinsic evidence, that evidence should have been first introduced, before the contract was received in. evidence.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b800-7\"><em>2. By </em>-the contract .of September 13th, 1861, Quigg was to determine the balance due the plaintiffs from ,the defendants as shown by the books <em>at the time they were submitted, to him. </em>Instead of so finding the balance he changed the books; introduced new and original matter in them, and in making up the balance-sheet included .this matter. In.doing this he exceeded the submission. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b800-8\">Now, an award -not in pursuance of the submission, or \u2022based upon matters not submitted, is void.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b800-9\">\n<em>Mr. Merrick, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b800-10\">The court is now asked to reverse this judgment, not because of any injustice done the d\u00e9fendants, or that the judgment and finding of the jury are not fully supported by the pleadings and proofs in the case, or that the jury were in any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>wise misled by the direction of the court, or would not be justifiable in coming to the same conclusion under any aspect of the case consistent with the facts, or that substantial justice has not been done to the defendant; nothingof the kind is assigned for error. On the contrary, there being no errors assigned in this court, the plaintiffs in error substantially admit that the defendants in error made out their case. The allegation is that the court erred technically in permitting the defendants in error to introduce and read in evidence to the jury, the contract of September 13th, 186vl, and the books of Kelly &amp; Co. There is really nothing else. There was no substantial error in what was done, and none even in a technical view. There was no dispute about anything. Quigg was not an arbitrator; but was a mere accountant, fixed on to find the sum due on the books of Kelly &amp; Co.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-11\"> Dennis <em>v. </em>Barber, 6 Sergeant &amp; Rawle, 425; Sloan <em>v. </em>Ault, 8 Clark (Iowa), 229; Shields <em>v. </em>Henry, 31 Alabama, 53; Miller <em>v. </em>Travers et al., 8 Bingham, 244 (21 English Common Law, 524); Jackson v.

The parties executed the agreement, and acted upon it without this document being attached. The agreement cannot, therefore, be treated as incomplete in the absence of the exhibit; it was only ineffectual to pass the amounts specified in'that paper; it was effectual to pass all other matters mentioned. The contract was not intended merely to transfer certain assets; it had for a further object to ascertain the amount of the indebtedness of the defendants from the examination of their books by an 'accountant. It was clearly admissible in connection with the statement of the accountant to show the amount of such indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">To the second objection the answer is equally brief and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>conclusive. The agreement was admitted, \u201c subject to the proof to be given thereafter,\u201d and it was subsequently proved that the agreement was ratified by the other partner of the firm of Kelly &amp; Co., and the fact of ratification is specially found by. the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The principal objections urged for a reversal of the judgment rest upon the idea that the agreement of September 13th, 1861, was a submission to arbitration, and the report or statement of Quigg was the award of an arbitrator; and that both are to be judged by the strict rules applicable to arbitrations and awards. This is, however, a mistaken view of the agreement and report. As observed by counsel, there was no dispute og controversy between the parties to be-submitted to arbitration; nor was anything to be submitted to the judgment or discretion of Quigg; The books of account-of the defendants were to determine'the amount due; about these there was no controversy. The only duty of Quigg was to examine them as an accountant and to st,ate what they exhibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The objection that the report was not made from the accounts as they stood on the books at the time they were placed in the hands of Quigg, is not one which can aft'ect the result. The object of submitting the books to him for examination was to ascertain the exact amount of the indebtedness of the defendants to the' plaintiffs. For this purpose it was in his power to write up the books, to correct errors discovered, and make entries of what had been omitted by oversight or mistake. It is to be presumed that the parties-desired to arrive at a just result, not to have a balance struck from the books without- regard to their correctness. The agreement provides- that the amount due was to be ascertained by Quigg, under the supervision of .the parties, and the proof shows that this was done under the immediate supervision of one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Besides, Quigg-was examined as a witness in the case, and exhibited the' books, and testified as to the balance they showed and the entries made by him-. These books were, of themselves, admissible as evidence.of the balance due by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>the defendants* independent of the agreement of September 13th, 1861. Upon the evidence they furnished, taken in connection with the testimony of Quigg, the verdict of the jury may be sustained without reference to his report. They showed the amount received from the sales of coal furnished to the defendants to which the plaintiffs were entitled ; and for such amount the recovery can be upheld under the common counts, for money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Judgment affirmed...</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
