A grant in the nature of a fief and seigniory was made to private individuals by the French government in 1750, of a tract of\u2018214,000 acres at the Saut de St. Marie, in what is now Michigan, but was then called Canada, on condition of improvement and occupancy; one of the objects of the grant having been to afford a refuge for travellers in a region then a wilderness and inhabited by Indians only. In 1760, the region passed by conquest from France to Great Britain, and in 1783 in the same way from Great Britain to the United States. The grantees took possession immediately after the grant, occupying and improving the tract to a certain extent for four years, but no longer. They then came away, leaving there a person who had gone out and been there with them, but who did not claim under them. One of them went away from this continent in 1764, and died in France; apparently abandoning all interests on this continent: his heir (\u00e1 French subject and in the naval service of France) received and considered in 1790, 1796, and 1804, offers of purchase more or less definite for his half, and in 1800 had made an <em>acte de notoriUi, </em>or solemn declaration, <em>in peipeluam memoriam rei, </em>of his claim to the estate; <em>doing however nothing more. </em>The other grantee was killed in 17G0, and the alienee of his descendants sold, in 1796, the land to British subjects who had been always resident abroad, and who never in any way looked after the land. In 1824 or 1825, forty-two years after the territory within which the lands are situate had come into her possession, the parties in interest by derivation from the original grantees, made a claim to the United States for the land ; this having been the first notice which the United States had of any title adverso to her own. In the meantime the United States had, in 1828, built a fort there for the protection and encouragement of settlers; her laws had been extended over it, the Indian title extinguished, the lands surveyed and put op sale, and were now and had been in a large part for years, covered with inhabitants.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-10\"><em>Held, </em>that even under an act of Congress which directed an adjudication to bo made, among other ways, on principles of natural justice, the claim could not after such a lapse of time, and so considerable a failure to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ply with the conditions on which the grant was made, be sustained against the United States.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b225-4\">6.

The bill set forth a grant, with certain conditions of occupancy, as a fief or seigniory, on the 18th October, 1750, to Repentigny and De Bonne, by the Marquis de la Jonqui\u00e9re, Governor of Canada, then a French province called New France, and by Monsieur Bigot, intendant of the same, of a large tract at the Saut de St. Marie, describing its nature and extent; a subsequent ratification by Louis XV, and the\u2019descents and purchases by which it was now- vested in the petitioners. It set forth further that the Chevalier de Repentigny had entered upon the fief in October, 1750, and remained there till 1754; had caused clearing to be done there, put cattle on it by himself or his tenants, and had occupied the place as required by the terms of his grant, and that when withdrawing, about the year 1755, had left agents of the grantees in possession, who or whose representatives were still in occupancy of some parts of the tract; that the claim had never been abandoned; though, owing to the domicil of the parties in foreign countries, and occupations in the armies and navies of such countries, and in remote public service, the owners had not been aware of any mode in which their rights could be defined and specifically assured; that they had from the first relied implicitly upon the faith of treaties existent, as they averred, in the case, and upon the justice of the government of the' United States to protect their rights and shield them from wrong; and, as respected some of the petitioners, women, descendants of Repentigny, that' owing to their helplessness and the helplessness of their ancestors in respect to pecuniary means, they had been uttei\u2019ly unable to come to the United States and assert their rights, but had been obliged to remain absent and to trust to such exertions' as their friends had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>from time to time voluntarily made in their behalf to recovei the said lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">The answer of the United States denied generally most of the allegations of the bill; asserted more particularly that the claimants were all aliens; that the conditions of the alleged grant had not been fulfilled by the grantees; and that by the laws of ancient Canada the land had become reunited to the king\u2019s domain; that the fief had moreover been abandoned and deserted in fact, and stood possessed by the United States, no judicial forfeiture thereof having been, under the circum-. 'stances, necessary; that none of the parties in interest had ever complied with any of the acts of Congress, prescribing in what way claimants of lands in that region should indicate their possessions; that thus, in fact, as well as of right, the fief so abandoned and deserted was reunited to the supreme domain, vested in the people of the United States of America; and that the burden and cost of bringing the same into a productive and profitable estate by the general administration, survey, and settlement thereof, by extinguishing the Indian title thereto, by improvements in the way of public works, and otherwise, had ever since, that is to say, for sixty years and' upwards, been thrown upon and borne by the United States.

Those who propose them are never short of specious and plausible reasons for their adoption. They always have in -view the good of commei'co, or the importance of restraining some Indian nation, but the most often it has been pi\u2019oved that they act under private interest. These posts however cost a great deal to the king as well for their establishment as for their keeping, and serve sometimes only to occasion movements and disorders-Thus the king desires not only that you should not bind yourself to any new establishment of that sort excejDt after having well recognized its advantages, but also that you should examine if among those which have been made for some years past there are not some that it will bo good to suppress.

This neckless was carried into all the Saulteux villages, and others at the south, and at the north of Lake Superior, in order to make all these nations enter into the conspiracy concerted between the English and the Five Nations, after which it was put and remains in deposit at the Saut St. Marie.

This guarantee of the British crown was in favor of its conquered subjects. It followed the title when Great Britain and the United .States settled their boundaries in 1782 and 1783. The right to emigrate within eighteen months was a personal privilege, to prevent the inhabitants becoming British subjects, as they would have done by remaining longer. *</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">Besides, by the laws of war, the conqueror is bound to protect the property of his conquered subjects.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">The common law of Englaud as to alienage did not prevail in Canada, but the French laws of the colony were preserved by the Quebec act of 1774, annexing the region in question to the province of Quebec, to be held at the king\u2019s pleasure; by the third section of which all rights of property in land were declared \u201c to remain and be in force and to have effect as if this act had never been made.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-8\">Those French laws allowed aliens to purchase and hold lands during their lifetime; and alienage can only be established upon a judicial proceeding and sentence.

Those \u201cprinciples\u201d can mean only the provisions of the act and the legal consequences flowing from them. That act did not apply at all to cases where the title was complete and perfect under the foreign government, but only to inchoate or unperfected titles.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> But it applied to cases of <em>concessions, </em>and plainly embraced the concession in this ease, but only the concession. The act of 1860 does not refer to the <em>ratification, </em>which was dated in 1751, but only to the \u201c <em>alleged grant </em>in 1750,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the concession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-9\">In passing upon the present validity of the title, the court is not allowed to consider whether, since its emanation, anything had occurred to defeat it, such as lapse of time or other matter of defeasance. Congress intended the title should be judged of as of the date of its emanation. Why else would they have subjected it to the test only of the laws of nations and of the country from which it was derived ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-10\">The construction which Congress and their commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>have placed upon similar language in other acts of a nature similar to this one of 1860, affords argument in support of our view. . .</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">Thus the act.of March 26, 1804, for the adjustment of private claims at Detroit, &amp;c.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> gave the commissioners power to decide \u201caccording to justice and equity\u201d upon claims depending solely .upon \u201c <em>legal </em>grants.\u201d They found only six such; and they confirm these six grants for the reason, as they remark in their report,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> that they \u201c consider the government right as completely transferred by these grants, and affirm the claims grounded upon them, with reservation of individual rights in contested cases.\u201d-</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">The act of 1804 involved no inquiry respecting possession or occupation, and it nowhere appears that the board entertained any such inquiry, but simply the question whether the title was \u201c legal.\u201d The ground of confirmation was, that it transferred all the government right. -Accordingly, no inquiry was made into the fulfilment of the conditions embodied in the grant, nor into the effect of lapse of time, of non-occupation, of alienage, or any such objection, dehors the title-papers by which the title passed to the claimant. And this construction is binding on the government.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\">Could the present claim have been acted upon by them, it is impossible to perceive a reason why it would not have been confirmed, as the six others had been.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-8\">It should be noticed that the original brevets of ratification, under which the land was claimed in those cases, imposed certain conditions upon the grantees, feudal in .their character, \u201cupon pain of the nullity of these presents.\u201d In the ratification in the present case it is \u201c in default thereof the same shall be reunited to his majesty\u2019s domains.\u201d There can be no difference in meaning and effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-9\">On the report of the commissioners, Congress, by their act-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>of March 3, 1807,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> confirmed these six decisions, and thus made known their views of what was a \u201clegal grant\u201d and what was a decision \u201caccording to justice and equity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">So, under the Missouri act of 1824, the petitioner\u2019s claim was founded upon some French or Spanish grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, legally made, and which might have been perfected into a complete title under the former laws; and the act provides that the validity of such title or claim may be inquired into by the court; which, however, had no jurisdiction in cases of complete title. Yet, in <em>Chouteau's Heirs </em>v. <em>United </em>States,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> this court held that the power of the District Court was confiued to the \u201cvalidity of the grant,\u201d and would not allow the United States to go back of the warrant of survey to prove that Chouteau had not complied with the government regulations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">If we are right in supposing that it is the validity of the grant as made which is to be judged, then all that can be said about abandonment, escheat, &amp;c., is of no pertinence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">But the United States took as assignee, chargeable with notice of the graut, and liable in justice to recognize whatever Great Britain or Virginia was. They found white persons, descendants of Cadotte and others, in possession of the seigniory. They had no ground to presume that these persons were there without right. Finding them there, they were bound to presume they held, or claimed to hold, under a legal grant from some sovereignty, either British or French, and that the persons in possession held under that grant either as tenants or assignees of the original grantees, to whose grant the possession was referable. Such is the presumption of law.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">If this be so, with what justice can the United States set up to be tho owners by lapse of time ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\">Again : the act of 1860 saves from the effect of a decree in favor of the validity of the grant three classes of lands, including lands which have been sold, as those which cannot be recovered by the petitioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Of course the court has not the means of designating these lands. That duty belongs to the General Land Office, which, having designated them, is required to perform its other duty of issuing warrants for the same area of land. The whole extent of the court\u2019s power is to ascertain the representative character of the petitioners and the validity of the title or grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">Now, had it been the intention of Congress to claim by abandonment and prescription, would' they have made this saving? They knew the claim dated back more than a hundred years, for the act speaks of the \u201c alleged grant in 1750;\u201d and they knew, therefore, that no claimant in possession could, by a private suit, be ousted or disturbed by these representatives. All claimants in possession could set up lapse of time successfully against the suit now'authoriued, and therefore needed no such exception for their protection. Congress knew, also, that if mere non-occupation by the grantees and their representatives afforded the United States a good ground for continuing to hold possession, they themselves were protected by the same state of facts; indeed, if they intended to avail themselves of if, this great lapse of time and non-occupancy was a defence, and the passage of the act was a worse than useless ceremony; for it invited and led parties to undertake a lawsuit which Congress <em>knew </em>must fail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">Such could not have been the intention of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">Many of the claims protected by this exception were of very ancient date, and were acted upon by the commissioners under the act of February 21,1823, as will be seen in the seventh volume of the Report of the Commissioners on the \u201c <em>Claims, at Saut Si. Marie\u201d </em>all founded on occupancy, which, in some instances, was asserted to have commenced nearly a century before the passage of the act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\">Now, look at the posture of the case after proof of the validity of the grant has been made, if the defence of aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>donment and prescription by the United States is enter-mined. The court is well satisfied that the original grant was valid and perfect, giving a complete right of possession and enjoyment \u201cin perpetuity,\u201d as the grant expresses it. \u2022 But the court proceeds to allow the grant to be defeated by an alleged act of abandonment of indefinite subsequent date, and declares that although thus satisfied, the claimants have lost their once valid title, and are, therefore, not authorized \u201cto receive the warrants.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">Is it not clear that, if such a defence is permitted and successfully made out by proof, the question of \u201cthe validity of the title\u201d becomes an immaterial question? and that the question of possession is the only true one ? Is not the-paper title thus treated as of no importance ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">It may be said that by the 'terms \u201c validity of the title\u201d Congress intended the present and not merely the former validity of the title, and that to make out a valid title the proof must show that the ancient formal title has been kept alive and in vigor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">But such is not their language; such was.not their policy in the Michigan act of 1804, nor in the Missouri act of 1824.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\">Advert to historical facts. Virginia, it is known, took actual possession of the Northwest Territory in 1778 and 1779, under Colonel George Rogers Clark. He captured Fort Vincennes in February, 1779, made a prisoner of Hamilton, the British Governor of Detroit, and sent him to Virginia.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The United States have claimed the region as rightful owners since the cession by Virginia, and were in <em>actual \u00a1possession </em>of it from July, 1796, when the British garrison was withdrawn from the fort at the Saut, a <em>de jure </em>possession of seventy-six and an actual possession of sixty-four years \u2014 using the tract for their own purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-10\">The construction contended for implies that possession by the grantees or their representatives was and is essential to this present valid title. But how absurd to enact such a law in their own favor while the United States well knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>they, and not we, had possession for three-quarters of a century, they using it and selling it in spite of us, the lawful owners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">Besides, the most natural meaning of the expression \u201cvalidity of the title,\u201d is the legal regularity and force of the original title-papers referred to. We say, both in common and legal parlance, that a deed, barred by a statute of limitations or matter <em>ex post </em>facto, is not good; but seldom say that it is not valid. ' The term \u201c valid,\u201d as used in the expressions a \u201cvalid deed,\u201d a \u201cvalid bond,\u201d a \u201cvalid note,\u201d a \u201cvalid agreement,\u201d a \u201cvalid contract,\u201d refers \u2019usually to the effect of the instrument at the time it is made, and not to its effect when destroyed or impaired by subsequent matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">Is it- not inconceivable that Congress, with the full knowledge of all the facts of the case, except as to the validity of the original grant, about which they wished judicial decision, intended to rely upon abandonment and prescription, when not one word is contained in the act. indicating such a purpose \u2014 a purpose which, as we have said, if sustained by law and-fact, utterly defeats us? Did they intend to say to .the claimants: \u201cWe well knew you had the legal title, but we knew, at the same time, that we held the-land, not by grant or cession, but by mere <em>lapse of time ? </em>Such is our, reply, and our only reply, to your legal grant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">It is not easy to conceive of an artifice so little worthy of a government, a plea so wanting in frankness and fair dealing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-8\">Moreover, we deny that there is any law of the United States assuming to give to the government this right to the lands of private owners, growing out of lapse of time. Under the laws of nations there is no prescription as between a government and its subjects, although in municipal codes it is allowed as between private persons for the sake of repose. Ordinarily, it is the sovereign political power that gives the title. IIow strange would be the anomaly of its retaining the right to, use its omnipotent power to turn the grantee out and resume the possession as against his heirs at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>But, in point of fact, the grantees entered into possession and held and cultivated the tract for several years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-5\">It is an historical fact that from the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, there had been disturbances of a threatening character between the English and French colonies in America, which ended in the formal war known as the \u201c French\u201d or \u201c Seven Years\u2019 War,\u201d of which England did not make her declaration until May, 1756, the year after the battle of the Monongahela, under Braddock and the then Colonel Washington.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">The Chevalier de Repentigny was ordered to the Sant St. Marie by Governor La Jonqniere in 1750. The purpose of his being sent there was to afford an asylum to the French travellers who were constantly passing from -Quebec and Montreal up the Ottawa River, crossing over the portage to Lake Huron, and coasting along its northern shore to the Sant St. Marie, one of the central points for intercourse with the natives, aud, which had been taken possession of by the French nearly a century before; and thence visiting the missionary and trading-posts on Lake Superior at Point Iroquois, Missipocoton (on the northern shore), Point St. Esprit (now La Pointe), Green Bay, and other places settled by the Jesuits.

Henry staid with Cadotte during the winter of 1762-63, and he says that during the season a small detachment of troops under com mand of Lieutenant Jemet arrived to garrison the fort;\u2014 he states also that on the 22d of December, 1762, while Cafiotto was in possession as interpreter, a fire broke out and consumed all the. houses (except Cadotto\u2019s), a part of the stockade, all the provisions for the troops, and part of the fish Henry' himselfiliad taken.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\">During the spring of 1763, Henry ivas made a prisoner at Mi'chillimackinac, in the \u2018\u00a1\u2018Pontiac \"War,\u201d but was liberated by a friendly' Indian, and returning to the Saut in company with Madame Cadotte, found Cadotte there.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">In July, 1765, Henry arrives at the Saut from Michillimackinae with goods for the'Indians, and took Cadotte in as partner.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">When Mr. Alexander McKenzie<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> ivas there in 1787 or 1788, ho found there a Canadian trader, receiving, forwarding, and storing goods. Was not this Cadotte?</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-8\">The evidence of G-ornon and his wife, and of Biron, is admissible to show the traditionary existence of the seigniory,- and that old Cadotte was the employb of the Chevalier.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">The letter of La Jonqui\u00e9re to the minister in France, October 5th, 1751, establishes that the Chevalier had \u201c engaged,\u201d or employed a Frenchman, whose wife was an Indian woman, to take a piece of land and raise Indian corn. We hear of no other <em>such </em>Frenchman, and this statement of Governor Jonqui\u00e9re corroborates the testimony of the three Saut St. Marie witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-10\">In a transaction so ancient this proof of the identity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>old Cadotte with the husband of the Indian woman ought to be considered satisfactory; and if so, it follows that his possession was our possession, and we are entitled' to the benefit of it and of that of the grantees or claimants under him. For it is quite manifest that old Cadotte assumed rights which belonged to the grantees, knowing them to be such, if his granddaughter and her husband and Biron are to be believed; for they all testify that he was a voyageur, and obviously but a mere seTvant of the Chevalier.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">Thus the fact of actual possession, improvement, and occupation, by himself, for six years commencing in 1749, is proved by the direct as well as the historical and traditionary evidence; and it was a fulfilment of the <em>condition subsequent </em>contained in the ratification, relating to possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">Authorities show that the \u201c abandonment\u201d must be on the part of the owner a complete renuneiatiou and giving up of the thing, with intent not henceforth to reassert any dominion over it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">Thebe never was an intention to abandon here on the part of either grantee. This appears from all the actings of the claimants and their ancestors; and the circumstances of their situation excuse their actual occupation after the time that they did actually occupy it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">Both grantees were officers in the French army. The post was very remote and exposed. The French war had been brewing all along the frontier for \u2022 years, as history shows, rendering occupation difficult' and dangerous. Captain De Bonne, one of the grantees, was killed in De Levi\u2019s attempt.to retake Quebec in 1760.' \u2022 The Chevalier was in the same battle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\"><em>De Bonne </em>left his only child and heir at law, then an infant not two years old. By the.act of the Provincial Parliament of January 1, 1783, this child did not come of age till 1779, during the Revolutionary war, during all of which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>was of course an alien enemy of the United States. But he was-not indifferent to his rights. Before the close of the war, and on the 13th of February, 1781, he did faith and homage for the tract. That act was strong evidence, not perhaps of title, but against abandonment, and shows clearly an intention not to renounce the claim, and it was, under the circutnstances, all De Bonne could do. Its acceptance by the British governor was clear evidence of an official recognition of his title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\"><em>The Chevalier </em>was engaged in active service during the French war, and long before its declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">In the spring of 1763 the Pontiac war broke out, in which the whole frontier was desolated by the Indians, from Lake Superior to the wilds of Western Pennsylvania and the Mississippi River, and almost all our frontier posts captured. The garrison at Michillimackinac, within forty miles of the Saut St. Marie, was cruelly butchered, at which time there was no white man at that post but old Cadotte, whose wife was an Indian woman.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Parkman<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> says, that, except the garrison at Detroit, not a British soldier now remained in the region of the Lakes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">These Indian troubles did not cease to agitate the frontier during the whole of the Revolutionary war; nor did they cease with the war. It is well known that the British government, desirous to bring the boundary of Canada down to the river Ohio, as defined by the Quebec act of 1774 for the province of Quebec, persisted in withholding from us the Western posts, and stirring up the savages against us; and that the Indian wars were incessant down to the conclusion of the treaty of Greenville, August 2d, 1795.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">It would be absurd to require the grantees to have held possession of this remote and exposed point during all this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>dangerous period. The Indians loved the French. The protection of that government was withdrawn, and from 1763 down to 1796 (the date at which, by the second section of the treaty of commerce of 1794, Great Britain withdrew her troops and surrendered the posts), the place was in the actual possession of the English, whom the Indians disliked. Here was a term of thirty-three years during which it was plainly unsafe to attempt, to hold and occupy the tract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">While the Revolutionary war was in progress it was unreasonable to expect young De Bonne, a British subject,-or the Chevalier, a French subject, to occupy it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">In 1783, the year of the peace, he was sent off Governor of Senegal on the coast of Africa. He remained there till 1785, when he asked a furlough to return to France for his health. In 1786, he died at Paris. On his leaving Canada for France, in 1764, his wife remained behind, with a general power of attorney executed in 1759. And under this power she acted in 1766.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">Gaspard, the son of the Chevalier, from 1786 until his death was in the marine service of France, fighting its battles and being wounded in its cause, yet from 1798 we find him giving his attention to the property, as well as a French sailor in distant parts of the world possibly could do to such a sort of estate. He makes an <em>acte de </em>notori\u00e9te, a <em>caveat </em>and solemn declaration of rights, which should remain <em>inperpetT uam memoriam rei.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-8\">The Saut St. Marie, Michillimackmac, and other feeble settlements on the upper lakes, were unknown, and so remained uutil Schoolcraft visited them in 1820. He found them merely fur-trading establishments. He says of the Saut, <em>\u201c </em>The dwelling-houses on the north side of the 'Strait, six or seven in number, belong to the French and English families.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-9\">McKenzie,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> who visited the Saut between 1787 and 1793, says, that \u201c the village on the south shore, formerly a place of great resort for the inhabitants of Lake Superior, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>consequently of considerable trade, is now dwindled to nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">In their memorial to Congress of December, 1811, the principal citizens of Detroit do not even enumerate the Saut as a settlement of Michigan. They say the whole population of the territory then amounted to 4762 souls, of whom four-fifths were French.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There was no means of reaching the Saut from the lower lakes except through immense pathless forests, or by means of bark canoes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">In June, 1812, war broke out between the United States and Great Britain, and continued until December 24th, 1814. The first blow in this war was struck at Mackinac, which at once fell into the enemy\u2019s hands; and that point, as well as the Saut, were held by the British troops until they left the country, in 1815. In point of fact, the Saut had been under British authority from the time Jemet, in behalf of British arms, then victorious over France, took possession in 1762, down to 1815. The attention of our own government seems not to have been directed to this remote spot until 1820, when the Secretary of War, Mr. Calhoun, in a letter to Governor Cass, of April 5th, instructed him to acquire a small piece of land from the Indians for military purposes. And there is no historical evidence that the American jurisdiction was exercised there until the organization of the County of Chippeway, in 1827,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> the year after the caveat on behalf of De Bonne was filed in the General Land Office, and the memorial of Mrs. Slacke was presented by Mr. Cambreling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWP\">The whole region was an unreclaimed wilderness, and the place inaccessible save by means of canoes, and wholly occupied by the Northwestern Fur Company and their agents. No one then but old Cadotte and his family had any knowledge of the grant to De Bonne and De Repentigny. Such was the condition of the Saut.</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">The British thus held it in their possession for more than Bixty years \u2014 wrongfully, from 1783 to 1796 (if they left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>it then, which they did not), and wrongfully from 1814 onward. Did Congress, m passing the act of 1860, intend to avail themselves of this wrongful possession of Great Britain ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-5\">It cannot be pretended that the United States were .in actual possession longer than from 1796 to 1812 (16 years), and from 1815, the close of the war, down to 1825 (10 years), when the king\u2019s grant w\u00e1s presented; making an actual occupancy of only 26 years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">But in this very act the United States limit the claimants to two years for the institution of their suit. Was not this a yielding up of all objection on account of the lapse of time, during which the alleged abandonment and prescription had run ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARb\">The fact that the government of the United States has extinguished the Indian title is without, weight. It was the duty of the government to extinguish it. Private persons could not treat with the Indians.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">As to non-fulfilment of the condition to improve the fief and cause it to be held and possessed by the tenants of the grantees, \u2014 that urns a condition subsequent. And it was fulfilled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-9\">We have as we think proved our personal possession till 1754, and that old Cadotte, who was in possession aiterwards, was really our agent or tenant. If his heirs or grantees were in court insisting upon their individual claims as against us, they could not be allowed to change, by mere intention and without notice to us, the character of the original possession; and we should bo able to insist that that possession was ours; for where the possession is jointly held by the owner and the tenant, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the tenant\u2019s adverse possession has become notorious, precluding all doubt of the character of the holding and all want of knowledge iu the owner.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-10\">In point of fact the seigniory has never been vacant. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>original possession under the grant was ours, and the government were bound to take notice of the fact that the grant was made, and bound by the legal presumption that the possession was \u00fauder and by virtue of it. They could not presume that the white settlers there were mere \u201csquatters\u201d claiming by tortious entry. ....</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">We have a right to claim not only that the grantees actually took possession and made improvements, but that all persons subsequently in possession held under them; and that therefore not only the condition of taking possession under the grant but also that of continuing it, has been performed. Thus the title \u25a0 becomes absolute' by the performance of the condition.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-6\">In the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arredondo,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the grant was a perfect 'grant conveying the fee of the land, the condition was that the grantee should establish on the land 200 Spanish families, with all the requisites, &amp;c., and should carry this into effect in three years, this court held the condition void by the act of the grantor, Spain, by whom Florida was ceded to the United States within the two years. The Florida treaty of 1820<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> provided that the lands should be confirmed to persons in possession of them. And the court say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">\u201c The law deems every man to be in legal seizin and possession of land to which he has a perfect and complete title. The seizin and possession is coextensive with his right and continues until he is ousted thereof by an actual adverse.possession. This is a settled principle of the common law recognized and adopted by this court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-8\">If, in our case, the grantees failed in continuing in possession, they failed because France herself failed to hold possession of the country.' Such failures should be excused.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-9\">By the laws of nations the conqueror acquires only the public and political rights belonging to the sovereign whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>he opposes.

Independently of which, Judge Badgley, at present perhaps the most learned jurist in the province, tells us that under the arr\u00e9t of 1711, the proceedings -were strictly judicial. And so Chief Justice Lafontaine, discussing the subject in a printed work,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">\u201c I have already stated that under the operation of the different arr\u00e9ts of retrenchment it seemed to me necessary, to proceed regularly, previously to pronounce the reunion to the crown domain, even when the word <em>reunion </em>was not written in the arr\u00e9t.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">[The learned counsel then, in reply to the allegation of the answer, argued that the grant was abundantly certain and could be located, the Franquet map of 1752, with the description of the grant and ratification, indicating it sufficiently.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-8\">\n<em>Mr. Sianbery, Attorney- General, and Mr. Alfred Russel, District Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">If the construction of the act of Congress set up by the other side is the true one, that is to say, if the only question which was to be passed upon, was the original validity of the grant, nine-tenths of the discussion have been irrelative; and there neither is nor ever has been any question in the ease. It required no courts to settle whether the deed was a genuine one; andAhe strong attempt to place the matter on such a view concedes away, in fact, the case. It admits that the difficulties, if any other view be taken, are insurmountable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-10\">It is no such question that the act meant that the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>should settle. We are not here to resuscitate a dead title, but to inquire whether there is one now existing. We are discussing an actual thing, considering not what <em>toas </em>a century and a quarter ago, but what <em>is </em>at this time. Blackstone,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> adopting Coke\u2019s definition, tells us, <em>uTitulus est justa causa possidendi id quod nostrum est.\u201d </em>And Congress never meant that its courts were to recognize as \u201ca title\u201d that which now is' defective in law, defective in equity, defective in moral justice, defective every way, merely because the deed, which conveyed it one hundred and sixteen years ago was genuine. We admit that the act of 1824, enabling claimants of lands in Missouri and Arkansas to try the validity of those titles, did not apply to perfect titles; but Congress, by putting this claim, in the act of 1860, under that act, declared this title not to be a perfect one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-4\">The questions, theu, of lapse of time, abandonment, nonfulfilment of conditions,, extinguishment of Indian titles, reunion to the crown; &amp;c., are most proper to be inquired into.</p>\n<p data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">As to-limitations by prescription, the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arredondo </em>settles that this proceeding is substantially a bill in equity. The petitioners are barred by the rules of equity proper, which are in strict \u201c analogy with the rules of law, whenever any statute has fixed the period of limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">This court has repeatedly held that reasonable diligence is necessary, even if no statute of limitations exists which is applicable.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">This claim had its origin when George II was King of England, aud Louis XV King .of France, twenty-six years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>jeforo the United States took their place in the family of nations; and the reports, English and American, may be searched in vain for an instance of the upholding of a claim of one-half the age of this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\">A lapse of forty years and change of value renders a claim stale, though there be no fraud.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And possession which would bar an ejectment will also bar an equitable title.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">Now, De Bonne 'never had possession at all, and of the Chevalier de Repentigny we never hear again in this region after his improvements were burned in 1762. The British crown took possession in that year.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">De Bonne rendered homage in 1781, but that was not a substitute for actual seizin, still less for compliance with the conditions subsequent; and at all events it could not enure to the benefit of his co-grantee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-8\">De Bonne\u2019s representatives first petitioned Congress in December, 1826. De Repentigny\u2019s representatives in May, 1841. No <em>effectual </em>proceedings were had by hither before Congress until 1860.</p>\n<p data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-9\">Under these circumstances, a possession acquired by the government of the country, existing for a century, and acquiesced in for so many years by those whose interest and duty it was to disturb it, if it had been -wrongful, is not now to be presumed, in the absence of all proof, to have been wrongfully or illegally,\"or even irregularly acquired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-10\">Does Cadotte\u2019s occupancy .affect the case?,. There is, it appears, partly from public records and ancient printed books of travels, and partly from the depositions of living witnesses, evidence that between 1750 and 1762 the French and English governments, and at a date subsequent to 1762, among others a person named Cadotte, and his descendants, through whom the petitioners do not claim, were seized of the most prominent and important part of the lands; but there is no evidence of Cadotte\u2019s being the agent of De Repentigny\u2019s descendants, and still less of any privity of title of any kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>between Do Repentigny and him. It was customary for the French settlers in general to take Indian wives; in fact, their lives were insecure otherwise; and it is almost as likely that Cadotte was <em>not </em>the person referred to in the mention of the Frenchman who had married an Indian as that he <em>was. </em>Certainly the court cannot so strongly presume that this Frenchman was Cadotte as to give a decree on the strength of it. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">1. <em>The tract was not occupied, </em>and reverted, by natural law, to the superior domain. The only occupation alleged, and the only effort to comply with the conditions, was on the part of the Chevalier de Repentigny, one of the grantees, and who, it may be added, appears from a very early period to have held his share in severalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\">Yet De Repentigny\u2019s was only a temporary, and to some extent a mere <em>official </em>occupation.\u2019 Henry<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> says that under the French government there was kept a small garrison, commanded by an officer who was called <em>the </em>Governor, but was in fact a clerk, who managed the Indian trade on government account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\">The letter of October 5th, 1751, from La Jonqui\u00e9re to the Minister of Marine and the Colonies (see it, supra, pp. 219-20), shows that Repentigny went more as an ambassador from the French to the Indians than in any other manner. The letter from. Versailles of June 16th, 1752, and signed T. (see it, <em>supra, </em>pp. 217-19), shows as clearly that settlement on private account was a thing that was specially guarded against by the French crown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-9\">The most liberal interpretation of the case will not warrant the court in assuming more than that from 1751 to 1755, 1100 pickets were got out and \u00e1 stockade fort \u2019built, that Borne few acres were cultivated and some six or eight head of cattle pui\u2019chased; while, on the other, hand, it is certain that the whole was abandoned by Repentigny in or about 1755, and if our idea of C-adotte\u2019s relation to the matter is a true one, has remained so ever since; De Bonne\u2019s moiety never having been entered at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>To hold that such improvement- of the land, and then ceasing to improve, satisfies the condition of the grant, would effectually render null those considerations of public policy which prompted the grant in the first place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">\u25a0 On the treaty of 1783, between Great- Britain and the United States, the land, assuming it to have been once occupied, had then been for twenty-eight years wholly unoccupied, and being thus derelict, an <em>her editas jacens, </em>it passed with the rest of Michigan to the United States..

He granted much and expected'much. The grantees gave no money, they rendered no service. The king\u2019s purpose was to found a colony. He contemplated sub-grants. The coneessees held by homage. They had from time to time to renew that homage. They were to make a place of refuge for travellers. None of the ends were accomplished, or for more than four years were attempted to be. The substance of .the consideration has thus been withheld.</p>\n<p data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">The case of <em>United States </em>v. Arredondo, relied on by the opposite counsel, only goes so far as to declare a grant discharged of conditions when their performance becomes impossible by the act of the grantor, but that is not the case here; there was no necessity whatever for either Be Repentigny or Be Bonne or their successors neglecting the performance of the conditions; the true reason appears from the evidence. \u2019 Repentigny, like a gallant soldier, was not willing to desert his king. It was \u201c too hard for his heart\u201d to swear allegiance to the new master. Pie deliberately made a sacrifice of his property to his sense of loyalty. As for the alienees of Be Bonne, it seems to have been a matter of selfish calculation simply. They calculated that, under the rule of the United States and by the energy and enterprise of its citizens, it would be more profitable for them to wait, as absentees, the development of the resources of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The case falls completely within the expressions in <em>Fremont </em>v. <em>United </em>States,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> where it is said, that, \u201c if there were any unreasonable delay or want of effort to fulfil the conditions, it may be justly presumed that the claimant .... is now endeavoring to resume his ownership after the lands have become enhanced in value under the government of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">And thus \u2014 after a century\u2019s absence by the grantees from the soil on which they could be sued, a century\u2019s repudiation of their duties, a century\u2019s abandonment of their rights, and a century\u2019s acquiescence in adverse possession, they found a claim for restitution; they now wish to realize the result of the calculations, by w\u2019hich the inaction of some of the parties is sought to be excused, and to reap the fruits of the exertions of others in promoting the settlement, developing the resources, and increasing the value of. the property during their absence; exertions to which, though bound before and beyond all persons to contribute most, they have, of all persons, contributed the least.</p>\n<p data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">The intention of De Repentigny to abandon is evident from his documents and letters.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">4. <em>The fief reverted, by feudal law and the custom, of Paris.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-8\">The grant, as we have said, was subject strictly to feudal conditions, a class of conditions, as we know, common by the laws of France in the time of Louis XV. They were obviously founded in'the nature of such a vast gift. We' need not quote authorities to show that by the feudal law,\u2014 a law of France as much or more than of England, for the feudal system came to England from France, \u2014 the lands would revert for condition broken. The answer against this reversion is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-9\">1st. That by the feudal laws of Canada, no forfeiture could take place under the practice or without the judgment of a peculiar court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-10\">2dly. That this judgment has never been obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"236\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>, 3dly. That until-it shall be obtained they are entitled to the benefit of the grant of 1751.</p>\n<p data-order=\"237\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">\u25a0 The .petitioners assume, gratuitously, perhaps, that .no legal, proceedings were ever taken by the British government to obtain a judicial decree.or judgment of reunion ot forfeiture; it being to be remarked, that the records on which the proof of this depends were never at any time under the control of.the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-6\">We do not acknowledge the practice of Canada to be as stated. The fief, we suppose, upon being deserted in 1755, reverted to the crown, <em>ipso </em>facto.. It would certainly have done so by our own law. In a case quite similar to this, the mere fact of leaving the country and becoming domiciled abroad was held to work forfeiture <em>ipso facto </em>without necessity for adjudication of forfeiture.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\">But if the formality of a judgment is necessary, the court in adjudicating has. power to make this decree of forfeiture and reunion now, and without any substantive suit or pleading in the nature of a cross-bill for the purpose. A judgment of reunion is matter of form,- and may be pronounced at the present as well as any past time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">These remarks apply to both moieties. But as we have seen that the Chevalier de Repeutigny\u2019s half was lost, because, in form and with deliberation, abandoned after the conquest, so another cause operated upon the residue : the arr\u00e9t of 1732, whereby any attempt to sell .wooded lands, such as these then were,' absolutely reunited the fief by operation of law to the superior domain. Thus De Bonne\u2019s share in A.D. 1796, and A.D. 1798 upon his and Caldwell\u2019s attempts to sell it, stood reunited <em>pleno jure (demeurait r\u00e9unie de plein droit), </em>by that sale, without any special judicial decree, previously made, being necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">5.

The grant of the land'was made on the 18th October, 1750, by the governor and intendant-gcneral of Canada (then called New France), Jo Louis De Bonne, a captain of infantry, and Count Repentigny, an ensign, in the Freuch army. The complainants derive title under them. It was confirmed by the King of France .the next year, on the 24th June, 1751.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The grant, was to De Bonne and Repentigny, their heirs and assigns, \u201c in perpetuity by title of fertf and seigniory-,\u201d with all the customary rights belonging to that species of estate. Repentigny went into possession about the date of the grant, at the Saut, having about the same time\" received an appointment to command the military post established there. He constructed a small stockade fort, and made some improvements in connection with it, such as the clearing\u2018of a few acres of land and the erection of huts for the people with him, and continued thus engaged till'1754. When war broke out between France and England he was called' away into active military service of the government, and never afterwards returned. De Bonne never took personal possession, or possession of any other character, except that derived from the transient occupation of his co-tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The bill was filed on the 9th January, 1861, one 'hundred and ten years since the date of the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We will now refer to the act of Congress, passed April 19th, 1860, under which the bill was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">It provides that the legal representatives of the original grantees may present their petition to the District Court of the State of Michigan, setting forth the nature of their claim to .certain lands at the Saut St. Marie, under an alleged grant in 1750, with evidence in support of it, and praying that the validity of the title may be inquired into, and the court is authorized to examine the same; and, in adjudicating upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the validity as agaiust the United States, to be governed by the law of nations and of the country from which the title was derived, and also by the principles, so far as they are applicable, which are. recognized in the act of Congress.of the 26th May, 1824. This act, which was passed to enable claimants to lands situate within the State of Missouri to try their titles before the United States District Court, directed that the.claims should be heard and determined in conformity with the principles of justice, and according to the laws and ordinances of the government under which the titles originated; also, according to the law of nations and the stipulations, of treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">This act of 1860, which authorizes the institution of these proceedings, was passed in pursuance of petitions to Congress by the representatives of the original grantees. The first notice to this government of any claim to the lands on their behalf was in the year 1825 or 1826, some seventy-five years after the date of the grant. Since then the subject has, from time to time, been brought to the attention of Congress, and finally disposed of by the passage of the act in question. The act, as we have seen, refers the claimants to the judiciary for. relief, and prescribes the principles which shall govern it in hearing and adjudicating upon the case. They are\u2014 .</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">1. The law of nations.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">2. The. law's of the. country from which the title was derived!</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">3. The principles of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">4. The stipulations of treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">In the light of these principles, we'shall proceed to an examination of the claim; and, first,'as to the claim of the representatives of Repentigny. He was a native of Canada, and-a captain in the French army at the close of the war, which terminated in the surrender of that province to the British forces, in 1760. His family was among the earliest emigrants to the country after possession had been taken by the King of France, and held high and influential positions in the government. Soon after the execution of the definitive treaty of peace of 1763, the Governor of Canada opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>a correspondence with Repentigny to induce him to remain in the province, and become a subject of Great Britain, promising him protection and advancement in his profession. \u25a0 He was then about thirty-eight years of age. But he declined all the advances made to him, and soon after left the country, by order of his superior officer, to take a command on the Island of Newfoundland, where the Indians were disturbing the settlers, and spent the rest of his life in the military service of France, having risen to the rank of Major-General and Governor of Senegal, on the Island of Goree, and its dependencies. He died in 1786,. leaving a son, Ga3-pard, an officer in'the French naval service, from whom the present claimants descended, and Avho reside in the Island of Guadaloupe. The preliminary treaty of the 3d November, 1762, at the surrender of Canada, provided in the second article, in behalf of his Britannic majesty, that the French inhabitants, or others who would have been subjects of the Most Christian King, in Canada, may retire in all safety and freedom, wherever they please, and may sell their estates, provided it be to his Britannic majesty\u2019s subjects, and'transport their effects, as well as their persons, without being restrained in their emigration, under any pretence whatsoever, except debts or criminal prosecutions, \u2014 the term limited for this emigration being the space of eighteen months, to be computed from the day of the ratification of the definitive treaty. The definitive treaty of the 10th February of 1763 contained a similar article.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The articles of capitulation at Montreal, dated 8th September, 1760, when the Canadas were given up to the British forces, secured to the inhabitants their property movable and immovable; and the proclamation of the king, under date of 7th October, 1763, pledged to his loving subjects of Canada his paternal care for the security of the liberty and property of those who are, or should become, inhabitants thereof. These pledges, both before and after the treaty, were but the recognition of the modern usages of civilized nations which have acquired the force of law, even in the case of an absolute and unqualified conquest of the enemy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>country. But the rule is limited, as in the pledge of the king, in his proclamation to the inhabitants of the conquered territory, to those who remain and become the subjects or citizens of the victorious sovereign, \u2014 those who, in the language of Chief Justice Marshall, change their allegiance, and where the relations to their ancient sovereign are dissolved. Speaking of the cession of Florida, he observed: \u201c Had Florida changed its sovereign by an act containing no stipulation respecting the property of individuals, the right of property in all those who became subjects or citizens of the new government would have been unaffected by the change.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Another rule of public law, kindred to this one is, that the conqueror who has obtained permanent possession of the enemy\u2019s country has the right to forbid the departure of his new subjects or citizens from it, and, to exercise his sovereign authority over them. B\u00c9ence the stipulation in the capitulation and treaties of cession providing for the emigration of those^ inhabitants who desire to adhere to their ancient, allegianc\u00e9, usually fixing a limited period within which to leave?the country, and frequently extending to them the privilege, itj the --meantime, of selling their property, collecting their debts, and carrying with them their effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Now, in view of these-principles, it is apparent that Repentigny, baving refnsed.to continue an inhabitant of Canada, and to become a subject of Great Britain, but, on the contrary, elected to adhere in his. allegiance to his native sovereign, and to continue in his service, deprived himself of any protection, or security of his property, except so far as it was secured by the treaty. That protection, as we have seen, was limited to the privilege of sale or sales to British subjects, and to carry with him his effects, at any time within eighteen months from its ratification. Whatever property vas left unsold was abandoned to the conqueror. Repenigny acted upon this view of his rights. Besides the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>erty in question, he owned and possessed a seigniory situate above Montreal, on the River St. Lawrence, called La Chenay, which he sold to Colonel Christie, a British officer, and in the deed it is recited that he had a mind to go to France,' and therefore, as allowed by the late treaty of peace, was disposed to sell, &amp;c. This was in 1766, although it appeal\u2019s that steps had been taken in respect to the sale at an earlier day. It is evident, also, that he had been engaged in negotiating for the sale of the seigniory in question, as in a memorial of his services presented to the chief of the bureau of the French colonies, he states, under date of 1765, that the establishment, \u2014 referring to that at the Saut St. Marie,\u2014 was burnt in 1762 by the Indians, at the time his attorney was negotiating at Montreal with the English for the sale of it. And, in 1772, in a communication to the French authorities on the subject of military services and sacrifices, he observes: \u201c I thought that after a lease of thirty years of services, fulfilled with honor in the colonies, and the sacrifice of a fortune more than reasonable, in leaving Canada, my native country, I should be able at forty-five years of age to claim a regiment in the colonies without too much ambition.\u201d And again, in answer to an intimation that the king would give him permission to retire, he observes: \u201cIf I had not calculated upon dying in the service, I should not have sacrificed more than four-fifths of my fortune, my well-being, and that of my family, in abandoning Canada, my country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">And, further, in a communication to his government, supposed to be about 1773 or 1774, he observed:' \u201c The cession of Canada, my country, has overturned a fortune more than moderate, which I could preserve only by an oath of fidelity to the new master, which was too hard for my heart.' The filers of the English ministry made to my eldest brother to etain us in their service ai\u2019e unequivocal proofs of the con\u25a0ideration we enjoyed in Canada.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Repentigny was a gentleman of education and high intelligence. He rose to the rank of general in the army, and aspired to that \"of Marshal of France; was Governor of Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>egal and its dependencies, and, as is obvious from his coi\u2019respondence with his government, comprehended fully the principles of public law which forfeited all his property left unsold at the time he retired from Canada, under the provisions of the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">lie died in 1786, twenty-three years after the date of the treaty; and, during all this time, not only set up no claim to this seigniory, but, on the contrary, repeatedly, as we have seen, urged the patriotic sacrifice of it to his government, as a merit for her favorable consideration of himself and family. And we may add that his only son, an officer in the French navy, and who died in 1808, at the age of fifty-five, also never set up any claim or right to it to this government, and the first notice she had of it, so far as the record discloses, was in 1824 or 1825, from the descendants of this son residing in the Island Guadaloupe, and who are the complainants in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We will now examine the other branch of this case, \u2014 the moiety claimed under He Bonne. lie was a captain in the French service, and fell in the battle of Sillery, in 1760, under Count de Levi, in an attempt to recapture Quebec. He left a son, P. A. He Bonne, who was then only two years old. The family were inhabitants of Canada, remained after the treaty of 1763, and became subjects of Great Britain. He was of age in 1779, and, in 1781, rendered faith and homage at the Castle of St. Louis, in Quebec, before the governor, as required by one of the conditions of the grant of the seigniory, and which was accepted, and a record made of it. Ho became an eminent barrister in the lower province of Canada, was attorney-general, and afterwards one of the justices of the King\u2019s Beueh. In 1796 he sold his interest in the seigniory to James Caldwell, of Albany, New York, a citizen of that State, and conveyed to him the title. In 1798, Caldwell quit-claimed the premises to Arthur Noble, an Irish gentleman and an alien, who resided at the time in the State of New York. He afterwards returned to Ireland, and died in 1813 or 1814, leaving a will, by which he devised all his lands in the United States to his nephew, John Slacke, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>a barrister in the city of Dublin. Slacke devised the same, in 1819, to Agnes, his wife, with power to dispose of this and other property as she might think fit, and by sundry-deeds and devises, the estate passed to John- Button, the present claimant, and a lieutenant-colonel in the British army. All of these parties wore British subjects and aliens.' The territory within which the premises in question -are' situate, passed from France to Englaud by the treaty of 1763, and from England to the United States by th.e definitive treaty of 1783, according to the boundaries there agreed-upon. And assuming, for the sake of the argument, that the ninth section of the subsequent treaty of 1794 protected the interest of P. A- De Bonne in the seigniory, the question arises, whether the present claimant has established any valid title to it?</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The conveyance by De Bonne to Caldwell, a citizen of the United States, passed out of him whatever title he may have had, and vested it in the grantee. It was no longer a French' or English, but an American title, held under the laws of the United States, and subject to them. The transmission by deed, devise, or descent, must be according to those laws, and not according to the laws of France or of England. Caldwell held the lands as he \u2022 held other real property, under the laws of the government within which they were situate, the same as if they had been conveyed to him by a native citizen. .The intention of the parties to the treaty was, that the citizens and subjects of each should be quieted in the enjoyment of their estates, in the same manner as if they and their heirs had been native citizens and subjects. And having conveyed to Noble, who, together with those claiming under him, were, aliens, the complainant is i let with the objection of alienage.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">It appears, however, that since 1805 laws have been passed, first, by the legislature of the Territory of Michigan, and afterwards by the State, conferring upon aliens the righ r, to hold lands \u201cby purchase, devise, or descent,\u201d which, it is insisted, remove the objection. Whether or not these laws apply to lands claimed by the United States as a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>public domain, is a question we shall not enter upon; as we are inclined to think, upon a liberal construction of the act of Congress under which this suit is brought, this objection may be regarded as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We have thus far stated, somewhat in detail, the present state of this branch of the title, \u2014 the moiety claimed by Rot-ton, as derived from Do Bonne. And it appears that more than a century has elapsed since the original grant; and, during all this time, there has been but some four years\u2019 actual possession or occupation by the grantee or those claiming under him, and that immediately succeeding the grant. The seigniory has been held under and subject to the laws of three governments \u2014 thirteen years under the French, twenty under the English, and seventy-seven under the United States. The first notice this government had of the title or claim was in 1824-5, forty-two years since the territory within which the lands are situate came into her possession. In the meantime her laws have been extended over it, the Indian title extinguished, the lands surveyed and put on sale, and are now, and have been for years, covered with inhabitants. As early as 1823, before this claim was presented to the government, as appears from the recoi\u2019d, a large part of this tract was possessed and occupied by settlers, and the possession afterwards confirmed by Congress, aud a military post established at the Saut for their protection and encouragement in that remote section of the country. If these grantees, their descendants or assignees had .fulfilled the conditions of the grant, introduced aud established tenants upon the seigniory, and thus occupied and improved the lands, they would have been among these cherished inhabitants, and their titles and possessions alike protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The purposes for which this grant was made, and the conditions annexed to it, are specifically stated upon its face. It recites that Repentigny and De Bonne \u2014 entertaining the purpose of establishing a seigniory \u2014 had cast their eyes upon a place called the Saut St. Marie; that a settlement in that place would be most useful for voyageurs from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>neighboring ports and those from the western sea, who could there find a safe retreat, and by proper precautions, which the petitioners proposed to take, would destroy in those parts the trade of Indians with the English; and (after the words of concession of six leagues in front on the river at the Saut, and six in depth) it provides that the grautees shall hold and possess the same by themselves, and cause the same to be held and possessed by their tenants, and cause all others to desert and give up the land, and \u201cin default thereof the present concession shall be and shall remain null.\u201d Iu the deed of confirmation, by the king, is the following clause: \u201cThat they (the grantees) improve the said concession, and use and occupy the same by their tenants. In default thereof the same shall be reunited to his majesty\u2019s domain;\u201d and, in a subsequent clause: \u201cHis majesty ordering that the said concession shall be subject to the conditions above expressed, without any pretext that they should not have been stipulated in the said concession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">There is a letter in the record from the Governor-General of Canada, under date of October 5, 1771, to the government at Paris, giving the reasons for this concession. He wi\u2019ites: \u201c I had the honor to let you know (by a former letter) that in order to thwart the movements that the English do not cease to make to seduce the Indian nations of the North, I had sent Sr. Chevalier Eepentigny to the Saut of St. Marie, to make there an establishment at his own expense, and to build a palisade fort to stop the Indians of the northern posts, who go to and from the English, to intercept the commerce they carry on, and to stop and prevent the talks, and also the presents which the English send these nations to corrupt them and get them in their interests. Moreover, I had in view in that establishment to secure a retreat to the French voyageurs, especially those who trade m the northern parts, and for the purpose to clear the lauds which are proper for the production of Indian corn, and to sustain thereby the victualling the people of the said post, and even to the needs of the voyageurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>And in a letter, by the minister at Paris, to a high official in Canada, he alindes to that of the governor above referred to, and observes, \u201cIn one of my despatches last 3\u2019oar to the governor, I had intimated to him that I had approved the construction of a fort at the Saut of St. Marie, and the project of cultivating the land there, and raising cattle. We cannot but approve the dispositions which have been made for the execution of that establishment, but it must be considered that the cultivation.of the lands, and the multiplication of cattle must be the principal object, and that trade must be only accessory. As it can hardly be expected, he observes, that any other grain than corn will grow there, it is necessary, at least for a while, to stick to it, and not to persevere stubbornly in trying to raise wheat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The purposes and conditions of the grant are too obvious to require further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is admitted by1 the learned and intelligent jurists of Canada, who have been examined as witnesses in this case, that the legal liabilities to seignioral reunion to the royal domain exists in cases of the non-fulfilment of the conditions of settlement,\u2019and which is rigorously enforced if there be no cleared lands and 110 settlers on the seigniory. That the right to, resume the grant applies only to unimproved seigniories, to all those that have been neglected, as it respects the establishment of tenants upon the lands, and the consequent absence of cultivation, such as clearing the forests, converting them into fruitful fields, laying out and working public roads, building mills for the convenience of the tenants, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">We agree to this interpretation of the conditions. We cannot, however, assent to the next position taken, namel3\u2019, that the possession and improvement of Repentigny, during the four years that he occupied the seigniory at the Saut, should be regarded as a fulfilment of this condition. It contained over two hundred thousand acres of land, and the. whole of the improvements claimed in his behalf, besides the stockade fort, consisted in the erection of three or four temporaiy huts for laborers, the clearing of a few acres of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>around the fort, and planting the same with Indian corn. Ilis stock consisted of seven head of cattle and two licrses, and, since 1754, over a century before the commencement of this suit, there has been no possession or occupancy by either of the grantees, or their descendants, tenants, or as-: signs, or further trace of improvements. The primeval forest remained unbroken till settlers entered upon it and established themselves under the protection of the laws, and regulations in pursuance thereof, of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">It is argued, however, that according to the customs and usages of France in respect to these conditions of settlement, that no reunion to the royal domain could bo assorted except by a judicial-determination; that the king was disabled by 1ns own ordinances from decreeing a reunion. Wo think,, upon the proofs in the record, this may well be doubted, in the case of such prolonged neglect to conform to the conditions of settlement, as in the instance before us. It furnishes cogent,- if not, irresistible evidence of the abandonment of the duties and obligations arising out of the conditions of the grant, and consequently of the grant itself; aud invites a direct resumption by the sovereign, the lord paramount. Assuming De Bonne\u2019s title to have been valid under the treaty of 1794, thirty-one years elapsed before this government had any notice of its existence, and in the meantime neither De Bonne nor those claiming under him had taken any steps in fulfilment of the conditions. They could at least have applied to the government for the privilege of fulfilling the conditions, or to obtain a remission of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">But we do not intend to put this branch of the case on this ground. The United States succeeded to all the rights to this territory that existed in the King of France, under the treaty of 1783, with Great Britain, at the close of the Revolution. The United States then became the lord paramount of this seigniory, and were thereby invested with the power to deal with the seigniorial estate, the same as the King of France, had it continued under his dominion; and we agree that before a forfeiture or reunion with the public domain could take place, a judicial inquiry should be instituted, or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>iu the technical language of the common law, office found, or its legal equivalent. A legislative act, directing the possession and appropriation of the land, is equivalent to office found. The mode of asserting or of assuming the forfeited grant, is subject to the legislative authority of the government. It may be after judicial investigation, or by talcing possession .directly, under the authority of the government, without these preliminary proceedings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the present instance we have seen the laws have been extended over this tract, the lands surveyed, and put on sale, and confirmed to the occupants or purchasers, and, in the meantime, an opportunity given'to all settlers-and claimants to come in before a board of commissioners and exhibit their claims. Thi3 is a legislative equivalent for the reunion by office found.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Upon the whole we are quite satisfied that, consistent with the principles, in the light of which we are directed by the act of Congress to examine into the validity of this title, the complainants have failed to establish it. We have felt justified in applying to the case these principles with reasonable strictness and particularity, as it is nearly, if not wholly, destitute of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Decree of the court below reversed, and case remanded with directions to</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Dismiss the bill.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> United States <em>v. </em>Percheman, 7 Peters, 51-87.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-14\"> Fairfax <em>v. </em>Hunter, 7 Cranch, 603, 622, 631; Smith <em>v. </em>Maryland, 6 Id. 286</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
