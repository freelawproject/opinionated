Appellant was convicted of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and one count per alien of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(I), (a)(2)(B)(ii), and (a)(2)(B)(iii). At sentencing, the district court relied upon the five-year minimum mandatory provision of \u00a7 1324(a)(2) to impose a five-year sentence for aliens three through seven on the \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii)-(iii) violations, overruling Appellant\u2019s objections that the penalty provision is unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. We agree with the district court that the statute clearly imposes its penalties on a per-alien basis and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-16\">On appeal, Appellant renews his contention that the penalty provisions of \u00a7 1324(a)(2) are unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous, and argues the rule of lenity requires that his sentence be vacated and he be resentenced solely on the basis of his applicable Guidelines range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1. He essentially argues that because he smuggled all seven aliens at one time, rather than in separate transactions, his 22 separate convictions were all part of one \u201cviolation\u201d of the statute, and the convictions should therefore be considered a \u201cfirst violation\u201d for sentencing purposes. The parties do not offer, nor has this Court found, any cases where this Circuit or other circuits have addressed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-17\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute de novo. <em>United States v. Grigsby, </em>111 F.3d 806, 816 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). In doing so, the plain meaning of the statute controls unless the language is ambiguous or would lead to an absurd result. <em>United States v. McLymont, </em>45 F.3d 400, 401 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-18\">A criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague if it \u201c \u2018fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2203-04, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979) (citation omitted). In the sentencing context, \u201cvague sentencing provisions may post constitutional questions if they do not state with sufficient clarity the consequences of violating a given criminal statute.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 123, 99 S.Ct. at 2204 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-19\">Section 1324(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>(2) Any person who, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has not received prior official authorization to come to, enter, or reside in the United States, brings to or attempts to bring to the United States in any manner whatsoever, such alien, regardless of any official action which may later be taken with respect to such alien shall, <em>for each alien in respect to whom a violation of this paragraph </em>occurs\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-4\">(A) be fined in accordance with Title 18, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-5\">(B) in the case of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-6\">(ii) an offense done for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-7\">(iii) an offense in which the alien is not upon arrival immediately brought and presented to an appropriate immigration officer at a designated port of entry,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-8\">be fined under Title 18, and shall be imprisoned, in the case of a first or second violation of subparagraph (B)(iii), not more than 10 years, in the case of a first or second violation of subparagraph (B)(1) or (B)(ii), not less than 3 nor more than 10 years, <em>and for any other violation, not less than 5 nor more than 15 years.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">The plain language of the statute indicates the penalties are intended to be applied \u201cfor <em>each alien </em>in respect to whom a violation of this paragraph occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The use of the terms \u201ceach alien\u201d and \u201cviolation\u201d together in the introductory sentence of \u00a7 1324(a)(2) make clear that courts should count each alien as a separate violation for sentencing purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-14\">Although we find the plain language of the statute conclusive, our reading of \u00a7 1324 is bolstered by its legislative history. In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546. Prior to the IIRIRA, the statute provided that punishment be administered \u201cfor each transaction constituting a violation of this paragraph, regardless of the number of aliens involved.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2) (1996). In a section entitled \u201cApplying Certain Penalties on a Per Alien Basis,\u201d the IIRIRA struck the \u201cfor each transaction constituting a violation\u201d language of \u00a7 1324(a)(2), and replaced it with the current language, \u201cfor each alien in respect to whom a violation of this paragraph occurs.\u201d IIRIRA, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-566. In changing the text of the statute, Congress clearly expressed its intent that district courts determine the penalties for alien smuggling offenses based on the number of aliens the defendant smuggled into the United States. The accompanying Conference Report lends further support to this interpretation. <em>See </em>H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, at 204 (1996) (\u201cHenceforth, an offense will be counted for each alien smuggled, not, as under current law, for each transaction regardless of the number of aliens involved\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the penalty provisions of \u00a7 1324(a)(2) are not unconstitutionally vague or ambiguous. We further hold the district court did not err in applying the provisions on a per-alien basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">. Because we find no ambiguity, the rule of lenity is inapplicable. <em>United States v. Sepulveda, </em>115 F.3d 882, 887 n. 11 (11th Cir.1997) (rule of lenity \u201chas no application where the fair meaning of the statute is clear\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">. Appellant alternatively argues that the penalty provisions of \u00a7 1324(a)(2) are unconstitutionally vague because the five-year minimum mandatory sentence exceeds the sentence provided for by the recent IIRIRA-mandated amendments to \u00a7 2L1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. This argument is without merit. The Sentencing Guidelines themselves provide that \"[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the [GJuideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). This Court has likewise held that \"[t]he statute controls in the event of a conflict between the guideline and the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 1204, 140 L.Ed.2d 332 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
