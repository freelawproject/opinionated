The plaintiff who was driving testified that she had no previous knowledge of the defect, that the horse was gentle and was walking at the time, and that she was then looking straight ahead. The evidence also showed that the road was rough, that there was mud and water upon it, and that there was room to pass safely upon the side of the way. One witness for the plaintiff testified that any one who was on the lookout could have seen the hole. The presiding judge, at the defendant\u2019s request, instructed the jury in substance, that if the plaintiffs in the daytime, and at a walk upon a broad and substantially level road, with ample width for passing by the hole, went into it, when it was conspicuous, obvious and in plain sight, they were not in the exercise of due care, unless they show some excuse for their inattention to their track; and that the law requires of one riding in the daytime such attention to the road over which he is about to pass, as to see large holes that are con spicuous, obvious and in plain sight, unless some sufficient reason excuses the inattention, and refused to give the further instructions requested by the defendant, that no such excuse was offered or shown by the evidence in this case, and that there was no evidence in the case of due care on the part of the plaintiffs, or either o\u00ed them. The judge, at the request of the plaintiffs, also instructed the jury that it was enough if the plaintiffs looked ahead in such a manner as persons of ordinary prod anee usually do in riding upon a highway. The jury found for the plaintiffs. <em>Held, </em>that the last instruction was correct, that the other instructions were sufficiently favorable to the defendant, and that the case was rightly submitted to the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">Actions of tort to recover for injuries occasioned by a defect in a highway, which the defendant was bound to keep in repair.
