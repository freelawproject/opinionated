For this purpose two of the passenger cars were set off upon a siding, and the remainder of the train, consisting of baggage and smoking cars, was withdrawn to be sent forward again upon the main track, passing by the cars upon the siding. After the former cars had acquired considerable headway in moving forward upon the main track, it was discovered by the switchman at the siding that the cars first set off had not been pushed sufficiently far upon the siding to clear the main track, and that a corner of one of them projected so far over the main track as to prevent the remainder of the train passing them without collision. The switchman accordingly set the switch in such manner as to direct the remainder of the train back upon the siding, full upon the two cars standing upon it. The course adopted by the switchman was admitted to be the most prudent open to him under the circumstances, after he discovered that the cars could not pass each other upon different tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel farther stated that the said intestate was riding upon the platform of that car which was in front as the ears were moving, and that this came, into violent collision with the stationary cars upon the siding. The platforms of the cars thus meeting being of unequal height, the platform of one was forced over that of the other, and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate standing at the brake received the injuries for which the action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">The plaintiff contended that the injuries were received by reason of the train having been made up with cars having platforms of unequal height; that if it had been made up with cars having platforms of equal height no damage would have been done to said intestate, and that his injuries did not result from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Ms want of care or negligence, or that of any person having the care and management of the train. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-3\">If upon the evidence above set forth the plaintiff could maintain his action, the case was to stand for trial; otherwise judgment to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-4\"><em>C.
