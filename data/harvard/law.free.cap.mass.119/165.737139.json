Lochman, on a promissory note dated May 20, 1878, payable four months after date, signed by Greenlaw &amp; Gillis, and payable to the order of David Gillis, and indorsed by him and by each of the defendants. Writ dated January 20, 1874. The action was defended by Pierce alone. His answereset up a deed of composition dated October 8, 1873, between himself and his creditors, by which, in consideration of the payment of fifty per cent, of their respective claims, they agreed to release Mm from all claims wMch they then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>had against him, the deed to be null and void if not signed by all his creditors. This deed was signed by the plaintiff among others, but Lochman\u2019s name did not appear among the signers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-4\"><em>At </em>the trial in the Superior Court, before Allen, J., it appeared that Samuel B. Rindge held a promissory note, of which Pierce was the maker and Lochman the indorser. The composition deed was signed \u201c Samuel B. Rindge, provided this does not release the indorser in any manner.\u201d The plaintiff contended this was not a valid signing in contemplation of the agreement. It was admitted if this did not release the indorser, then all the creditors had signed. The judge submitted the question to the jury, whether the paper was signed by all the creditors. The jury found for the defendant; and at the request of the parties the judge reported the case to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">If the above signing was valid, judgment was to be entered on the verdict for the defendant; otherwise a new trial to be had.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-6\"><em>S.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgW\">The condition annexed by Rindge to his signature of the deed of composition was equivalent to a reservation of his rights against Lochman as indorser of the note held by Rindge, and did not prevent his execution of the deed from operating as a release of all his rights against Pierce as maker of that note, although it could not affect any right of Lochman against Pierce. <em>Sohier </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>6 Cush. 537. <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>114 Mass. 120. But the report expressly states that if this execution of the deed by Rindge did not release the indorser, all the creditors of Pierce had signed the composition deed \u2014 which, as Lochman\u2019s name does not appear among the signers of that deed, necessarily implies that the relation between him and Pierce was such that he was not a creditor of Pierce, and would not, if called upon to pay the note as indorser, have any right to recover against Pierce. The deed of composition, having been signed by all the creditors of Pierce, is a bar to this action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\"><em>Judgment on the verdict for the </em>defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
