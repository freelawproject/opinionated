Writ dated December 15, 1874, and returnable to January term 1875 of the Superior Court, .the return day being January 5. The city of Boston was summoned as trustee. It appeared by the officer\u2019s return that service was made on the trustee on December 16, 1874, and on the principal defendant on December 21, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">At January term 1875 of the Superior Court the trustee entered a special appearance and prayed for a discharge on the ground that no legal service had been made upon it. The court ordered the trustee to be discharged, and gave judgment for the plaintiff for the amount claimed and costs. From the judgment discharging the trustee the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-10\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1r\">By the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>123, \u00a7 21, original writs issuing from this court or the Superior Court must be served fourteen days at least, and from a police court or justice of the peace seven days at least, before the return day; and by \u00a7 22, in any action brought against a city or town, or certain other corpo rations, the writ must be served thirty days at least before the \u25a0return day. By <em>c. </em>142, \u00a7 5, trustee processes must be \u201c served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>on the defendant and each of the trustees in the manner prescribed for the service of an original summons without an attachment.\u201d As no time is otherwise prescribed for the service of trustee processes, \u201c the manner \u201d evidently includes the time, as well as the form, of service. This writ, therefore, having been served upon the city of Boston, as trustee of the principal defendant, less than thirty days before the return day, was not legally served upon, the city. <em>Stimpson </em>v. Malden, 109 Mass. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The provision of <em>e. </em>123, \u00a7 19, that original writs issuing from this court or the Superior Court, \u201c if required to be served fourteen days before the return day, shall be made returnable at the court next to be held after the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the writ; and if required to be served thirty days before the return day, shall be made returnable to the court next to be held after the expiration of thirty days from the date of the writ,\u201d creates no difficulty which may not be avoided by the plaintiff in any action; for if a city, town or other corporation named in \u00a7 22, is summoned as trustee, so that the writ cannot be made returnable within thirty days, it may be served on the principal defendant, as well as on another trustee, who is not entitled to more than fourteen days\u2019 notice, fourteen days before the return day. <em>c. </em>142, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The writ in this case not having been legally served upon the trustee, the Superior Court rightly discharged him, and allowed the action to proceed against the defendant, who had been legally served, c. 142, \u00a7 7. <em>Belknap </em>v. <em>Gibbens, </em>13 Met. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
