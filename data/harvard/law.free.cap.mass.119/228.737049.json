The answer of the defendants admitted the execution of the bond, but denied each and every other allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Wilkinson, J., without a jury, the plaintiff introduced the record on the clerk\u2019s docket of her complaint, under the bastardy process, against Charles Howe, the principal named in the bond, by which it appeared that her complaint was entered at December term 1873 of the Superior Court; that the respondent appeared by his attorney at that term; that the supplementary complaint was filed June 9, 1874; that an answer, containing a general denial was filed August 5, 1874; that trial by jury was demanded September 3, 1874; that the defendant was defaulted May 10, 1875, and the order of affiliation was passed May 13,1875. The plaintiff then rested her case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-10\">The defendants declined to offer any evidence, and requested the judge to rule, as matter of law, that the evidence of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tiff was insufficient to warrant a finding that there had been a breach of the condition of the bond, or such a breach as to authorize a judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-4\">The judge refused so to rule, but found for the plaintiff, and ordered judgment for the penalty of the bond, and execution to issue for the sum due to September 30, 1875, The defendants alleged exceptions,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-5\"><em>S.

By the terms of the bond, the principal obligor was bound to appear and abide the order of the court. He does not fulfil this obligation by merely entering an appearance and filing an answer, denying the charge against him. He is bound to be in court when the case is in order for trial, and his default, as entered of record, is conclusive proof of the fact that, although solemnly called, he did not appear. In this state of the case, it was impossible that the court could do otherwise than rule that there had been such a breach of the condition of the bond as to authorizes judgment for the plaintiff. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>116 Mass. 360. As this is the only question raised by the defendants, the result must be that their</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\"><em>Exceptions are </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
