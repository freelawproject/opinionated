Trask on Walnut Street,\u201d and running by four courses and distances, 1896 feet in all, by the northerly line of that street; thence by four successive courses and distances, each except the last terminating at a cedar post, amounting in all to 1703 feet, \u201cto a point on the Downing road (westerly line) at its intersection with Elm Street; \u201d thence by three courses and distances on \"westerly line of road,\u201d 2496 feet in all; thence by nineteen courses and distances, each except the last terminating at a cedar peat, and amounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>to 8985 feet in all, \u201c to starting point.\u201d The names of the owners of the land taken were not mentioned, nor th\u00bf town or city in which the land was situated, and no plan was referred to in the description or filed with it. At the trial of an action of trespass, brought by the owner of land so taken, against the city, no monuments were proved except along about two thirds of one side of the tract of land intended to be taken; it appeared that a very small portion of it was within the city of Lynn; a plan was introduced, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s objection, of the entire tract of land taken, and a surveyor testified that the lot could be traced and its limits made certain by the plan; but there was no evidence that the land could be identified by the description filed without the aid of the plan or of a surveyor ; and it did not appear that all of the cedar posts, called for by the description, or which, or how many of them, had been set up. <em>Held, </em>that the certificate was insufficient, and that the defendant was a trespasser.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b191-4\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af_\">This is an action of tort in the nature of trespass for breaking and entering the plaintiff\u2019s close, digging up and subverting the soil, carrying away large quantities of earth and gravel and inundating thirty acres of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The defendant justifies its acts as having been done for the purpose of supplying the city and its inhabitants with pure water, under the St. of 1871, <em>c. </em>218.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u25a0The first section of that statute authorized the city for that purpose <em>\u201c </em>to take, hold and convey into and through said city the waters of Breed\u2019s Pond, so called, in said city, and the waters which flow into and from the same, and any water rights connected therewith, and the streams running into Beaver Brook below Breed\u2019s Pond; \u201d and to \u201c take and hold, by purchase or otherwise, such land on and around the margin of said pond, not exceeding five rods in width, as may be necessary for the preservation and purity of said waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">By section 2, \u201c the mayor of said city of Lynn shall, within sixty days after taking any of the land aforesaid, file in the registry of deeds for the county of Essex, southern district, a description thereof sufficiently accurate for identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">By section 4, \u201c said city shall be liable to pay all damages sustained by any person or corporation, by taking of any land, water, water rights or property, or by the constructing of any aqueduct, reservoir or other works for the purposes aforesaid; and if any person or corporation, sustaining damages as aforesaid, cannot agree with the city upon the amount of such damages, he or it may have them assessed in the same manner as is provided by tow with respect to land taken for highways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>It is admitted that no previous notice was given to the plaintifl or other landowner of any intention to take their lands, and no hearing was had upon the subject; and that no bounds or monuments were set up to distinguish the lots of the respect! re proprietors.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The certificate filed by the city in the registry of deeds,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>scribes the land taken as \u201c a lot commencing at tne southwest corner of land owned by Charles H. Trask on Walnut Street,\u201d and running by four courses and distances, 1896 feet in all, by the northerly line of that street; thence by four successive courses and distances, each except the last terminating at a cedar post, amounting in all to 1703 feet, \u201cto a point on the Downing road (westerly line) at its intersection with Elm Street; \u201d thence by three courses and distances on \u201c westerly line of road,\u201d 2496 feet in all; thence by nineteen courses and distances, each except the last terminating at a cedar post, and amounting to 8985 feet in all, \u201c to starting point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The plan introduced by the defendant at the trial, which is not referred to in the description and does not appear to have been filed with it, and to the admission of which in evidence the plaintiff for that reason objected, shows a tract of land, marked by corresponding courses and distances, of irregular shape, more than a mile long, and of width varying from a mere point or angle at each end to something less than a quarter of a mile at the widest part, containing about one hundred acres, and including Birch Brook, which is not named in the statute, but is a tributary of Beaver Brook, running into it below Breed\u2019s Pond, and which, as the report finds, substantially dries up in summer time.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The surveyor who made the plan testified to its general correctness, and that the lot could be traced and its limits made certain by that plan. But there was no evidence that the land could be identified by the description filed, without the aid of the plan or of a surveyor; and it did not appear that all of the cedar posts called for by the description, or which or how many of them, had been set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Even if the corner of Charles H. Trask\u2019s land, assumed as the starting point of the description filed by the city, is a monument capable of being identified; and if the subsequent boundaries on \u201c westerly line of road \u201d can be referred to the Downing road rather than to Elm Street which that road intersects; no monuments whatever are proved, except along about two thirds of one side of the tract of land intended to be taken, and no means are afforded of ascertaining the remaining boundaries - except by courses and distances. No names of owners of the land taken are mentioned; nor even the town or city in which the land intended to be taken is situated; and it was admitted at the argument that but a small portion of the tract, near the starting point, is in the city of Lynn, and the rest in the town of Saugus.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The case differs from that of the location of a highway or railroad, in which the width of the land taken throughout the whole length of the way is stated and the terminus at each end clearly defined; and is wholly unlike the case of a deed made by the landowner himself, or the levy of an execution, of which he has distinct notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">If the plan had been referred to as part of the description, it might have been sufficient. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>6 Cush. 270. <em>Hazen </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>2 Gray, 574. <em>Andover </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>5 Gray, 393. But without such reference, or any other notice to the owner of the land, the description before us cannot be held to be \u201c sufficiently accurate for identification,\u201d as the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The case, in our opinion, imperatively calls for the application of the rule stated by this court in <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>14 Gray, 282, 288 : \u201c The appropriation of private property to the public use, which is one of the highest acts of sovereign power, should not be accomplished by ambiguous or uncertain language. The presumption is in favor of the owner of the land, and any act done by public authority, which interferes with his rights, should be, as it always may be, clear and intelligible.\u201d See also <em>Hinckley </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>2 Pick. 162; <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Swampscott, </em>105 Mass. 535 <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>109 Mass. 527, 538 <em>Housatonic Railroad </em>v. <em>Lee &amp; Hudson Railroad, </em>118 Mass. 391 <em>Lewiston </em>v. <em>County </em>Commissioners, 30 Maine, 19.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>S.

Perry, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Aybz\">were stopped by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">The defendant, never having filed the certificate required by statute, was a trespasser, and for this reason, without considering the other objections made by the plaintiff to the validity of the defendant\u2019s proceedings, the case, according to the terms of the report, is to <em>Stand for trial.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-5\"> \u201c City of Lynn.
