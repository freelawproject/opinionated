In that court, the respondent moved to set aside the verdict, \u201c because the deputy in charge of said jury entered the room where they were deliberating before they had agreed and sealed up their verdict.\u201d Wilkinson, J., allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\">It appeared that the deputy sheriff, who was left in charge of the jury, went into the room where they were, and while they were deliberating upon their verdict; that the room occupied by them was a large one, and that the officer stepped in for the purpose of warming himself, and sat a few minutes by a stove in the room ; that he left the room before they had agreed upon a verdict, and had no conversation with any of said jurors while he was in the room; that as he was entering the room, the foreman asked him if the sheriff had gone, and he answered yes; that the foreman asked him \u201c Who is going to give us instruction if we want any?\u201d and he made no answer to this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-9\">The court thereupon ordered the verdict to be set aside, and the petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>E.

Sts. <em>c. </em>43, \u00a7 40 ; <em>c. </em>149, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14. The question whether, upon the proof of the irregular and improper conduct of the officer, such an interference with the deliberations of the jury was to be inferred, as required the verdict to be set aside, was a question of fact, largely depending upon the credit given to witnesses, and addressed exclusively to the discretion of the presiding judge; and the exercise of that discretion, not appearing to have involved any ruling in matter of law, is not subject to revision, whether the verdict is set aside or accepted. <em>Norton </em>v.
