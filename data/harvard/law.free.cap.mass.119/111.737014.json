The tenant introduced evidence that his father bought the land with his money, that his father gave him a deed of the land after the action was commenced, and not before, and declarations of the father when digging the cellar that he bought the land for the tenant. The demandant in reply offered evidence of the declarations of the father to other persons, when digging the cellar, and before the action was commenced, that the land was his. This evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>was excluded. It was not contended that these declarations were part of the declarations of the father, put in evidence by the tenant. <em>Held, </em>that their exclusion, when offered in rebuttal, gave the demandant no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-4\">Writ oe entry, dated December 8, 1868, to recover land in Danvers.

The declarations thus excluded were of the same character, and to the same effect, as declarations in relation to the demanded premises, again offered by the demandant in rebuttal of the tenant\u2019s case, as hereinafter stated.
