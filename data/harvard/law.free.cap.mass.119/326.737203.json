That after twenty-three persons had been summoned as grand jurors upon venires issued for that number, according to the statute in such cases provided, and a legal grand jury had been constituted therefrom according to law, and after twenty of said grand jurors, being first duly sworn, had retired to commence their investigations, and before the finding of said indictment against Grimm, the court ordered a second venire to issue for seven other persons, four of whom came into court and were sworn as grand jurors, and allowed to retire with and take part in the investigation of said grand jury as members thereof, said second venire being illegal, and said persons returned under the same being illegally sworn, as there was no deficiency in said grand jury at the time it issued or at any other time, and said persons returned under the same were not required; and said illegal grand jury, constituted as aforesaid, was not a grand jury, and said indictment found by the same is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-5\">\u201c Second.

E. Bolles, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_Z\">1. The provisions of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>171, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 4, must be strictly followed, and the record shows such a departure from these provisions as made the grand jury an illegal body. The second venire issued when there was no deficiency, and the six summoned on the new venire were sworn and constituted, with the first eighteen, a grand jury of twenty-four. If those excused are to be treated as if never summoned, then the new venire made the number twenty-five. If this course of procedure is to be allowed, twenty-three can be summoned, one excused, and new venires issued for twenty-three more, and a grand jury constituted or packed for any purpose of oppression. It is no answer to say that in this country this is not likely to be. It was intended that we should have \u201c a government of laws and not of men.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">2. The same reasons apply to this point. After eighteen had been sworn, six more were sworn all at one time, making a grand jury of twenty-four. This was clearly illegal. These six men were equally incompetent to act. They had no right upon the grand jury. Any one upon it made the findings all illegal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>cited 2 Pick. 559. <em>State </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>36 Maine, 128. Excusing two did not cure the illegality of those remaining. Four of these men served upon the grand jury which found the. indictment against the plaintiff, and another came in at the February term, making five of them. If this course can be adopted, 'hen any number can be summoned and sworn, and those not desired can be excused, and this constitutional tribunal become dependent entirely upon the discretion of the presiding judge. See 1 Lead. Crim. Cas. (2d ed.) 260, note to <em>King </em>v. <em>Marsh.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">It may be contended that, because these grand jurors were sworn every term, this original illegality was cured. But this illegality consists not alone in the swearing, but in their being summoned at all; and the terms of court have nothing to do with the grand jury, which lasts six months. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>171, \u00a7 <em>2, </em>The foreman is chosen for the whole term. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>171, \u00a7 8 The jurors are sworn for the whole term, and the statute only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>provides for them to be sworn when empanelled. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>171, \u00a7 5. It has been expressly decided that they need not be sworn again. <em>Turns </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Met. 224. The practice of swearing them at each term of court is not required by law, and can have no force in law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-4\"><em>W. C. </em>Loring, ( <em>C. R. </em>Train, Attorney General, with him,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b347-5\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axj\">A grand jury in this Commonwealth may consist of not less than thirteen, nor more than twenty-three persons. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>2 Cush. 149. In the present case, the writs of venire facias were originally issued by the clerk for twenty-three grand jurors, as authorized by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>171, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. Section 4 provides that, \u201c in case of deficiency of grand jurors in any court, writs of venire facias may be issued to the constables of such cities or towns as the court may direct, to return forthwith such further number of grand jurors as may be required.\u201d We are of opinion that this section authorizes the court, whenever the number of grand jurors in attendance is less than the full number of twenty-three, to cause so many additional grand jurors to be summoned as in its opinion, making due allowance for absences and excuses, may insure the filling up of the grand jury to that number; and that the summoning of a greater number does not affect the validity of an indictment found by the legal number of jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Grand jurors sworn by the clerk in the presence of the court are legally charged with the performance of their duties, so far as any action of the court is required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sanborn, 116 Mass. 61. But if they are at once excused and never join the grand jury in their deliberations, they form no part of the grand jury by which an indictment is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The validity of the proceedings in this case depends upon the amended and completed record, returned in obedience to the writ of certiorari issued upon the motion of the attorney general. <em>Turns </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Met. 224. By that record it appears that at January term, five of the grand jurors originally summoned were excused permanently, leaving a grand jury of eighteen; that a venire was thereupon ordered by the court to issue for seven additional grand jurors, six of whom appeared and were sworn, and two of these permanently excused, leaving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>grand jury of twenty-two, and that those twenty-two, together with the seventh additional juror before summoned, constituted the grand jury of February term, by which this indictment was found\u2019. It thus appears that the grand jury in question consisted of only twenty-three persons, as the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The case of <em>State </em>v. Symonds, 36 Maine, 128, upon which the plaintiff in error relies, differs from this in two particulars : 1st. By the statutes of Maine, the court had no authority to summon additional grand jurors. 2d. The objection was taken before pleading the general issue. See <em>State </em>v. Carver, 49 Maine, 588 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Parker, 2 Pick. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">As we are of opinion that no irregularity is shown in the case before us, it is unnecessary to consider whether the objection was seasonably taken. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
