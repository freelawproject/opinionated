In accordance with the terms of the agreement in the composition deed the plaintiffs received a dividend of $17, being ten per cent, of the amount due on the open account and on the note then due and payable, and no part of the note now in suit has ever been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-7\">If, on these facts, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover at all, judgment was to be entered for them for $100 and interest from May 2, 1874, or for ten per cent, of that amount, as the court should find that the note declared on was covered by the composition deed or not.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-8\"><em>W.

This deed was dated February 24, 1874, and the ten per cent, was to be paid within thirty days. There was a contingency upon which there might become due from Eatigan to the plaintiffs a certain other sum, if -Travers should fail to pay his note at maturity, and Eatigan should be properly notified thereof. The defendant contends that upon payment of ten per cent, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>amounts due, he was entitled to be discharged from all debts, whether due or not. Whatever might have been the effect of the deed upon debts, the liability for which was fixed, the character and language of the deed does not indicate that it was intended to be a relinquishment of all liabilities by reason of which the defendant might afterwards upon the occurrence of certain events become chargeable as a debtor. While such a contingent demand might undoubtedly have been released if the parties had so intended, yet it should appear that they had it in view at the time of executing the deed. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>4 Met. 80, 89. Here everything points to the opposite conclusion. Before it could be determined whether the defendant would become liable to. pay this note, the composition deed would by its terms have been fully executed. There were two claims to which it strictly applied; and the subsequent conduct of the parties, who made no provision for any dividend upon this, tends to show that it was not understood unon either side that this claim was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
