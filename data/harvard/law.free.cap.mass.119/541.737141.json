The case was reserved by <em>Oolt, </em>J., for the consideration of the full court, and was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\">The testator, a resident of Great Barrington, in this Commonwealth, made his will on January 6, 1872, which, after certain specific bequests, proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-6\">\u201c Seventh. All the residue of my estate, both real and personal, which I may own at my decease after the payment of my just debts, funeral expenses, and the expenses of settling my estate by my executors hereinafter named, I give and bequeath to the town of Kinderhook, New York, in its corporate capacity, in trust for the uses and purposes following: I direct said town to appoint some suitable person or persons to demand and receive the same from my said executors, and to invest the same as he or they shall deem best. I further direct that said town of Kinderhook shall annually, at their annual town meeting, appoint some person or persons to collect the interest and income thereof annually, and appropriate the same as follows : First, I direct that he or they shall pay annually, on the first day of May, to each of my parents, Miles Miner and Harriet Miner, his wife, the sum of one hundred dollars so long as they both shall live. At the death of either one of them, I direct that he or they shall pay to the survivor the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars annually during his or her life, at the time above stated. Second, I direct that he or they shall annually, at their discretion, expend the sum of four hundred dollars for the purpose of keeping the cemetery in said town, where the remains of my beloved wife and her parents are buried, in good order, and in keeping and preserving the monu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ments erected at their respective graves in a suitable and proper condition, and in keeping and maintaining the fence inclosing said cemetery in good order.

The testator was a widower, and died without issue, his father, the defendant Miner, surviving him. He left real estate in Great Barrington, and personal estate; and after the payment of his debts, the expenses of settling the estate, and the other legacies, there was a considerable sum to be disposed of under the seventh clause of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-6\">On April 29, 1875, the following statute was passed by the Legislature of Hew York:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\">\u201c An Act to authorize the town of Kinderhook to take a legacy under the will of Edward G.

Y.) 227; <em>S. C. </em>1 Keyes, 561. <em>Bascom </em>v. <em>Albertson, </em>34 N. Y. 584. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>43 N. Y. 487. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>52 N. Y. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">But the testator\u2019s domicil being in this Commonwealth, the question of the validity of his dispositions of his personal property, though to be executed elsewhere, is to be determined by the law of Massachusetts. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Haven, </em>3 Met. 109. <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>23 N. Y. 69. <em>Bascom </em>v. <em>Albertson, </em>34 N. Y. 584. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>43 N. Y. 424. By our law, this bequest is valid, whether the beneficiaries are in this or in any other state or country. <em>Bartlet </em>v. <em>King, </em>12 Mass. 536. <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>9 Met. 280. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>5 Allen, 575. <em>Odell </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>10 Allen, 1. <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>11 Allen, 446. And the fact that a charitable bequest, otherwise valid, cannot take effect immediately, for want of proper objects or trustees, or of enabling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>acts of the Legislature or of the Executive, will not defeat it. <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>White, </em>18 Pick. 828, 336. <em>Odell </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>10 Allen, 1, 8. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Clarke Institution, </em>110 Mass. 88, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The court will not allow a valid charitable trust to fail for want of a trustee; and if the trust is to be executed out of the Commonwealth, the court may appoint a trustee here to receive the bequest, or may order the fund, or the income thereof from time to time, to be paid to a trustee in the place where the trust is to be executed \u2014 as may be consistent with its own jurisdiction and practice, and best carry out the intention of the testator. <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>9 Met. 280. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>London, </em>3 Bro. Ch. 171; <em>S. C. </em>1 Ves. Jr. 243. <em>Mayor of Lyons </em>v. <em>East India Co. </em>1 Moore P. C. 175, 295-297, and cases cited. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sturge, </em>19 Beav. 597. <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>43 N. Y. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">This bequest is \u201c to the town of Kinderhook, New York, in its corporate capacity,\u201d in trust for the charitable uses and purposes declared in the will. The St. of New York of 1875, <em>e. </em>200, \u00a7 1, expressly authorizes that town in its corporate capacity to receive and hold in trust all the property bequeathed to it by this will, for the uses and purposes therein mentioned. The bequest being valid by the law of this state, the town named in the will as trustee being now enabled, by a special act of the Legislature of the state in which it is situated, to take the bequest, and the trust being directed by the will to be executed in that state and for the benefit of the inhabitants of that town, the court might properly direct the fund to be paid over to the town, if it were clear that the trust could thereupon be lawfully administered according to the will of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">But here a new difficulty arises. The testator directs that the interest and income of the fund shall be collected and distributed by persons appointed by the town annually for that purpose. The statute of New York, already referred to, \u00a7 2, authorizes such persons to be appointed by the supervisor and justices of the peace of the town. The collection and distribution of the income by persons appointed by certain municipal officers would not be according to the will of the testator, which directs those persons to be appointed by the town itself. . It does not therefore as yet appear that, if the fund should be ordered to be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>to the town of Kinderhook, it could be administered according to the will of the testator. The court is not at liberty to alter the scheme of the testator, either as to the objects of the charity or the agents by whom it is to be administered, unless it appears to be impossible to carry out his scheme according to its terms. <em>Baker </em>v. Smith, 13 Met. 34, 41. <em>Trustees of Smith Charities </em>v. Northampton, 10 Allen, 498, 501, 502. <em>Harvard College </em>v. <em>Society for Theological Education, </em>3 Gray, 280. <em>Jackson </em>v. Phil<em>lips, </em>14 Allen, 539, 591, 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The result is, that the bequest must be adjudged valid, and the cause must stand for further directions. If the Legislature of New York shall see fit to provide by supplemental statute for the administration of the trust according to the will, the fund may then be ordered to be paid to the town of Kinderhook. If there shall be no such legislation within a reasonable time, it will become necessary to consider whether the court should appoint an other trustee, or whether the bequest must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The Legislature of New York, by the St. of 1876, <em>c, </em>241, passed May 13,1876, provided for the election by the town of Kinderhook of persons .to administer the trust according to the will; and by the final decree in the cause, at September term 1876, the fund, after payment of the defendants\u2019 costs, taxed as between solicitor and client, was ordered to be paid to the town.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
