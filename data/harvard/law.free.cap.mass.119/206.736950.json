Fredericks, ante, 199, was that \u201c it is void for duplicity, charging two offences in one count; and the complaint does not contain any sufficient allegation or description of any offence at law, and is defective both in form and substance.\u201d This motion was overruled, and the defendant was then tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">The government introduced evidence tending to show that the defendant kept a place of business, in which ale and other liquors were exposed and kept for sale.

The addition made by the judge to this instruction was clearly correct; for \u00a7 18 of the St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>99, provides that ale as well as distilled spirits shall be deemed intoxicating liquors, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
