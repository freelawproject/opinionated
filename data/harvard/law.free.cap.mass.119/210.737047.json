Evidence was offered by the government to prove that these women of bad repute, so resorting to said hall, had frequently while there solicited men to leave the building and go away with them for the purposes of prostitution; and that thereupon the men so solicited frequently would leave the hall in company with the women so soliciting them, and gc away with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>them, the defendant being present in the hall when these acts were done. To the admission of this evidence in support of the complaint the defendant objected, but the judge ruled that the evidence so offered was admissible in support of the allegation of disorderly conduct, and admitted it. The defendant was convicted, and alleged exceptions to the admission of said evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-4\">H. <em>M.

We cannot doubt that in such a case it would be competent for the prosecution to prove that the place was kept ostensibly as a dance hall, but really as a place of resort for notorious prostitutes, where they were to meet with dissolute men, and to make assignations and appoint meetings for purposes of prostitution. This would certainly be admissible as part of the evidence. There is nothing in the bill of exceptions to indicate that it was all the evidence offered at the trial. The habitual meeting of such persons for such purposes would inevitably tend to produce riotous and disorderly conduct. Whether such evidence standing alone would be sufficient to sustain the charge is a question not raised by these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
