The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-13\"><em>H. M.

The mortgagee is therefore properly described as owner. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>16 Gray, 379. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>3 Cush. 399, 401. <em>Esson </em>v. <em>Tarbell, </em>9 Cush. 407, 411. <em>Dean </em>v. <em>M' Ghie, </em>4 Bing. 45, 49. <em>Dickinson </em>v.
