The yvill provided that the trust should terminate upon the death of the wife, when the trustees were directed to pay over to his wife\u2019s niece the sum of $3000; a certain sum to another legatee, and the residue of the trust fund to the residuary legatees. A codicil to the will provided: \u201c To my wife\u2019s niece I give the sum of $7000 in addition to the $3000 given in my will, making $10,000; and I ratify and confirm my said will in all other particulars.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the legacy given by the codicil must be paid from the trust fund upon the same conditions as the original legacy to the niece.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">Bill in equity by the executors of the will and codicil of Thomas Sullivan, against the legatees named in the will, to obtain the instructions of the court. The testator by his will, which was dated September 5,1873, after declaring that his lawful debts and funeral expenses should be paid, devised and bequeathed to his wife, Julia A. Sullivan, specific real estate and chattels, and gave $30,000 to trustees, who were directed to invest the same and pay to his wife the income accruing therefrom during her life. The will then provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-9\">\u201c After the decease of my said wife, Julia A.

Kanouse claims that, by the true meaning and construction of said will and codicil, her said legacy of $7000 given in said codicil is payable, so far as there are funds in the hands of said executors to pay the same, out of the residuum of said estate after the creation of said trust fund, and that the payment thereof is not deferred to the decease of the said Julia A. Sullivan, the widow of said deceased, and she has demanded payment of the same ; but that the residuary legatees claim that said legacy of $7000 is payable out of said trust fund at the termination of said trust after the decease of said Julia; and they claim that the funds in the hands of said executors ought to be paid to them, and they have demanded the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-7\">The answers of the defendants admitted the averments of the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-8\"><em>C.

This is an absolute bequest, and falls within the above rule. It is not limited in terms. The absence of any limitation aids the construction. In the will, the mode of payment of the bequests is expressly stated. The words \u201c in addition to \u201d distinguish rather than assimilate the bequest of the codicil to the bequest of the will. The burden is upon the residuary legatees to show the qualification of the bequest. This is an additional not a substituted bequest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-4\">G. <em>Sennott,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJG\">for the residuary legatees.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-5\">Gray, C.
