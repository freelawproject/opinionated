Haley, Morse &amp; Co. made claim on the insurance company for the loss, through the defendants, and made' and delivered to them three formal proofs of loss on June 18,1873. On or about August 18, 1873, Haley, Morse &amp; Co. called on the defendants, who then delivered to them the three drafts sued upon. These drafts were indorsed by Haley, Morse <em>&amp; </em>Co., and deposited by them in.a bank for collection, on August 18, 1873, and the amount thereof was passed to the credit of Haley, Morse &amp; Co., and by the bank forwarded to Philadelphia for collection. The insurance company on presentment declined to pay the amount of the drafts, or any portion thereof, and they were protested and returned at once to the bank with protests attached, and the bank promptly notified Haley, Morse &amp; Co. of the fact. \u2022 The plaintiff, at the request and for the accommodation of Haley, Morse &amp; Co., paid the money to the bank and received the instruments declared on from the bank, with the protests annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">The defendants contended that the action could not be maintained on the ground that the instruments were executed by them as agents merely, and that there was not any personal liability on their part, whether in the hands of a <em>bond fide </em>holder or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\">If the plaintiff was not entitled to recover upon these facts, judgment was to be for the defendants; otherwise judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-8\"><em>H.

It thus appears that Foster &amp; Cole, in drawing it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>acted only as agents of the corporation, as clearly as if they had repeated words expressing their agency after their signature; and they cannot be held personally liable as drawers thereof. <em>Carpenter </em>v.
