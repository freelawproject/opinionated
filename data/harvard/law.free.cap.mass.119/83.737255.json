The defendant did not appear and was defaulted at that term, and the case was continued for assessment of damages. The default has never been taken off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\">At December term 1873, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the consent of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the taking off of the default and to their appearance for the defendant in the suit, which was refused. They then said they should be# heard upon the assessment of damages. The case was continued from term to term until March term 1875, and no entry of any kind for the defendant was made upon the docket until that term, when the clerk made the entry of \u201c Dean &amp; Reed, upon question of damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">The case was set down for a hearing by the court at that term, and upon the day it was in order the defendant\u2019s counsel filed a motion in writing, asking that the damages might be assessed by a jury, which was granted upon the terms that the defendant first pay the plaintiff his costs in preparing for a hearing that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">Subsequently at the same term the damages were assessed by a jury, the defendant asking for and having a view.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">The clerk taxed the plaintiff\u2019s costs for each term, including those of March term 1875.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeA\">The provision of the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>156, \u00a7 27, that , in the taxation of costs \u201c the plaintiff shall be allowed only one term fee if the defendant is defaulted without having appeared,\u201d relates to the time when costs are taxed; and a defendant, in order to come within it, must at that time stand defaulted and not have appeared to defend himself against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. To construe it with literal and grammatical strictness would deprive the plaintiff of costs after the first term, where the defendant, having once failed to appear, had been defaulted, although he had since had the default taken off, and taken part in the trial of the whole case. It would be equally inconsistent with the object of the statute, which is to prevent the plaintiff from accumulating costs by keeping an undefended case in court, to apply it <em>to </em>the case of a defendant who, although defaulted on the main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>issue, has availed himself of the right, reserved to him by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>133, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, of being heard upon the assessment of damages, and of moving that such assessment be made by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\n<em>Taxation affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
