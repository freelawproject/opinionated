Field and Henry Field, Jr. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Wilkinson, </em>J., who, after verdict, reported the case for the determination of this court in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">It was admitted that the title to the land was in Mercy Cross-man at the time of her death in 1834. The material parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>her will, which was dated September 2, 1834, and admitted to probate on November 7 of the same year, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-3\">\u201c And first, that all my debts shall be paid and secondly that all my property both real and personal of whatsoever name or kind (except what shall be disposed of hereafter) I give for the maintenance support and bringing up of my niece Julia Frances Crossman, under the management of my brother Edward Cross-man as guardian during his lifetime provided he does not bring home his wife Fanny or marry with some other person in which case my brother Daniel Grossman is to have the management or guardianship heretofore named, and if the said Julia Frances should not live, then the property which I now give to her, the improve only I give to my brother Edward during his lifetime provided he marries not nor supports his present wife in which case it must go to my brothers Ebenezer Crossman and Daniel Crossman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-4\">\u201c Thirdly. I give to my nephew John H. Crossman one hundred and fifty dollars in cash and fourthly to Mrs. Sarah Walters my niece the amount of fifty dollars in furniture.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">It further appeared that Mercy Crossman was unmarried, and that her heirs at law were her brothers, Ebenezer, Daniel, Josiah and Edward, all of whom are now dead.\u201d There are no descendants of Daniel living, and Josiah was unmarried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">It further appeared that Edward Crossman left one child only, a daughter, Julia Frances, who is the person mentioned by that name in the will of Mercy Crossman; that Julia Frances first married one Waldron, who died leaving no issue by her; and that afterwards she married Henry Field, Jr., one of the respondents, by whom she had one child, Edward H. Field, the other respondent, both of whom are now <em>living; </em>and that Julia Frances died in 1849. It did not appear that any of the property of Mercy Crossman had been disposed of or conveyed for the maintenance, support or bringing up of Julia Frances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">Upon these facts, the judge ruled that the will of Mercy Cross-man devised to Julia Frances a fee in the land described in this petition, and that this petition could not be maintained, and directed the jury to return a verdict for the respondents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-8\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5B\">The intention of the testatrix to give an estate in fee to her niece is manifested in several ways :</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">1st. By the use of the words \u201c all my property, both real and personal, of whatsoever name or kind,\u201d which, in a will, ordinarily pass a fee. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>18 Pick. 537. <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>9 Gray, 171. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>107 Mass. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">2d. By the addition of the words \u201c except what shall be disposed of hereafter,\u201d which confirm the presumption that the testatrix did not intend to die intestate as to any part of her estate. <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Kilborn, </em>3 Cush. 557. <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>4 Gray, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">3d. By the subsequent description of the subject of the devise as the \u201c property which I now give to her.\u201d See cases under first point, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">4th. By contrast with the devise over of \u201cthe improve only\u201d to Edward Crossman, giving him but a life estate. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>1 Cush. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">5th. By the consideration that if the word \u201c it \u201d in the final limitation to Ebenezer and Daniel imports a fee, (and so would prevent an intestacy as to the remainder, as would be the case if they should take only a life estate,) the implication is unavoidable that a like fee had previously been devised, which could only be to the niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The proviso that if the niece \u201cshould not live\u201d is exactly equivalent to \u201c if she should die,\u201d or \u201c in case of her death,\u201d and (as she must die at some time, and no'other period is mentioned in the will) must apparently be construed \u201c if she should not \u25a0 survive me,\u201d the testatrix. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>9 Allen, 516. 2 Jarman on Wills, <em>c. </em>48. But if the will could be construed to give the niece an estate in fee, subject to be devested upon her dying before Edward Crossman, she did in fact survive- him, and the contingency upon which her estate would be devested has not arisen. <em>Brightman </em>v. <em>Brightman, </em>100 Mass. 238. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>118 Mass. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">The legal effect of- all the provisions of the will is too clear to be restricted by the mention of the purpose of the devise to the niece as for her \u201c maintenance, support and bringing up ; \u201d by the appointment of Edward, or in certain contingencies Daniel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>to be her guardian; or by the consideration that, if the niece takes a fee, some of the limitations over may be repugnant and void. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
