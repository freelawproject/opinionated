At the hearing before Morton, J., upon the information, answer and proofs, the attorney general contended that the St. of 1866, <em>c. </em>149, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, applied to the work of filling the basins, channel and flats of Miller\u2019s River under the St. of 1873, <em>c. </em>304; and the defendant contended that the St. of 1866 did not so apply, and that the city of Cambridge was not in any event answerable.

The work was to be done, not by private individuals for their own benefit, but under the direction of the boards of mayor and aldermen oi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the two cities, for the abatement of a nuisance and the preservation of the public health. 2d. It was but the carrying out of a plan which had been devised by the board of harbor commissioners, acting jointly with the state board of health, under authority of the St. of 1872, <em>c. </em>353. 3d. The St. of 1873, <em>c. </em>304, contains no reference to the requirements of the St. of 1866, <em>c. </em>149, as has been usual whenever works to be done by municipal authorities were intended by the Legislature to be governed by such requirements.
