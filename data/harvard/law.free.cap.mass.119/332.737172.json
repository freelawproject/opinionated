The Municipal Court of the city of Boston has no jurisdiction further than to issue the warrant to search, and seize the property, and no authority is conferred by statute upon said court to render the decree therein named, ordering the furniture and other personal, property to be sold, and from which decree the claimant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">\u201c 2.

The proceedings in this case are irregular and void, and contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of this state in this, that the furniture and other personal property for which a claim was made were appropriated to public uses without compensation, without a trial by jury, and by the decree of a court having no jurisdiction to adjudge the forfeiture of said property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-8\">This motion was overruled, and the case proceeded to trial, it appeared in evidence that the property claimed was the property of the claimant Tibbetts; that he was not present at the time the gaming took place, and was not interested or connected with the parties who were engaged in the unlawful game; that a game called faro was, at the time of the seizure, being played by the persons named in the proceedings, in the room described in the complaint, See., upon which the warrant to search was issued, said building being used for a gaming-house; that the furniture and other property seized were used in the apartments where the said game of faro was being played, as the furniture and other property of said building, and were seized as alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-9\">The judge submitted to the jury the issues whether the articles claimed were used as the furniture, fixtures and personal property of said building, and whether the said building was a gaming-house, and the said articles found therein at a time when Charles Childs, William Hersev, Charles Moore, and other per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>sons, were therein playing at an unlawful game, to wit, a game called .faro. The jury answered in the affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\">The claimant then asked the judge to rule as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">\u201c 1. That the provisions of the St. of 1869, &lt;?. 364, did not give jurisdiction to the Municipal Court of the city of Boston to adjudge a forfeiture of the furniture and other property of the claimant, and -that said court had no authority by statute to issue the decree named in the proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\">\u201c2.

That the proceedings, decree, &amp;c., of said court, having been defective, irregular, contrary to the forms of law and the Constitution of the state, this court has no proper application before it for a condemnation of the personal property seized and described in the written claim filed in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">\u201c 5. That, upon the evidence, the facts as found by the jury and the proceedings before this court, the claimant is entitled to a return of said property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">The judge declined to rule as requested, but did rule, that, upon the proceeding hereinbefore stated, and the facts found by the jury, the government was entitled to a decree of condemnation and forfeiture, and ordered the same to be entered; and the claimant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-11\"><em>G. W. Searle, </em>for the claimant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB1\">1. The Municipal Court had no authority to decree a forfeiture and sale. The St. of 1869, <em>e. </em>364, \u00a7 3, neither in terms nor in spirit confers any such authority. It evidently and expressly contemplates an application to another and different tribunal from the inferior court, otherwise the same language would have been employed in relation to the jurisdiction to issue the warrant and decree forfeiture. Instead of this, the language used is, \u201c application shall be made to a court of competent jurisdiction \u201d for a decree, and the natural inference from the changed phraseology would be that the Municipal Court was not intended as the competent tribunal at all, or else that it was not competent in all cases, that is, in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>where the value is over twenty dollars. The natural statutory court for applications for adjudging forfeiture is the Superior Court. It is a civil proceeding. Fish forfeitures are always in that branch of the court. The words used nowhere fix the tribunal of forfeiture. This would seem to imply that it would vary, dependent on the amount. In the case of illegal measures, the language is, \u201c the proper tribunal.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>49, \u00a7 194. If this is not the correct interpretation of the statute, it is void, being in violation of the provision of the Constitution requiring trial by jury, in all cases where the value of property involved is over twenty dollars. The fact of the right of appeal does not cure the difficulty; as is apparent if there is no appearance in a case. The decision of the court in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Justices of the Municipal </em>Court, 103 Mass. 456, does not settle this question. The only point there decided was that it was not a proper case for mandamus. All beyond that point is <em>obiter.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-4\"><em>2. </em>The complaint and warrant did not sufficiently describe the premises to be searched. The rooms to be searched on the second, third and fourth stories are not pointed out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\">3. The warrant is defective in authorizing the officer to seize all personal property, whether used in connection with gaming or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">4. There is no allegation in the information that the property claimed was seized by virtue of the warrant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\">5. The order of notice issued on the information was not legally served. Notice should have been given through the newspapers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-8\"><em>W. C.

The nature of the application was such, it being a petition for the purpose of compelling an inferior but important local tribunal to take jurisdiction of certain proceedings under the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>364, and to consider and determine whether certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>property found- and seized should be condemned and sold under its direction, that it was appropriate to consider and determine what were the powers and duties of that court under that statute as well as under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>170, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, of which it was an amendment, even if in the particular case owing to certain defects in the \u00bbproceedings no mandamus could properly be issued. So far, therefore, as this case is disposed of by the conclusions there reached, as we are satisfied upon reexamination with their correctness, it would be superfluous to discuss or even to re-state them. We proceed to consider only those objections not there passed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">1. The complaint described with sufficient precision the premises intended to be searched. It alleges that the articles are \u201c in certain rooms \u201d in a building definitely described, \u201c that is to say, ' in the rooms in the second, third and fourth stories of said building,\u201d which said \u201c rooms \u201d are further averred to be occupied by some person whose name is unknown to the complainant, and a warrant is prayed to search \u201c there \u201d for the articles complained against. The warrant authorizes a search of the rooms described in the complaint. The words, \u201c the rooms in the second, third and fourth stories,\u201d distinguish them sufficiently from the other rooms in the building in which they are situated, and include all the rooms which answer this description.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">2. The complaint, also, and the warrant, in the description of the articles intended to be seized, other than gambling apparatus or implements, follow the words of the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>364, \u00a7 2, which authorizes the search for and seizure of \u201c all the furniture, fixtures and personal property found .in such gaming-house.\u201d Section 3 renders liable to condemnation and sale all such property so found which was \u201c used as the furniture, fixtures or personal property of such gaming-house,\u201d it being intended thereby to subject to forfeiture articles convenient and useful in themselves, which have been put to the improper use of making a gaming-house more comfortable or agreeable. But the officer is not limited, in his right to seize, merely to the personal property thus liable to condemnation. As one of the objects o* the seizure is to obtain evidence of the unlawful business conducted in such house, he may also seize the other personal property there, even if it should not be found afterwards subject t\u00ae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>condemnation as the personal property of the gaming-house, as it may be of importance in furnishing evidence of the business there transacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Even if this were not so, a complaint and warrant which were too broad in their terms as including articles which would not properly be liable to seizure, would not be so far defective that the claimant of property properly described therein, and which was liable to seizure, could take advantage of such defect to quash the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">3. The objection, that the information, filed after the return of the search warrant against the property here claimed, does not show that this property had been seized under the authority of the warrant, cannot avail. The information, after alleging the previous steps and the terms of the warrant, contains a recital of the acts done by the officer who had served it, and the words by \u201c virtue of said warrant,\u201d with which this recital commences, apply to and qualify the whole of it, the sentence which states the seizure of the \u201c furniture, fixtures and personal property \u201d by the officer, as well as that which precedes it, which states his entry into the premises and the seizure of the gambling apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">4. Neither is the objection tenable that there was no sufficient notice of the information against the articles sought to be condemned. No notice is provided for by the statute in express terms, but as it would be contrary to the general spirit of our law to decree that property should be destroyed or declared forfeit without a suitable effort to notify the owner thereof, thus affording him an opportunity to be heard in relation thereto, it has been held that notice should be given. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Justices of the Municipal </em>Court, <em>ubi supra. </em>It should be such notice as in the judgment of the court would be reasonable and likely to convey information of the facts and proposed proceedings to the party in interest. While service of the notice, where parties are unknown, by advertisement in the public papers may often be proper, yet it is not the only mode, and often not the most effectual. The order issued by the clerk, \u201c in accordance with the order of the court,\u201d directed a service by copy of the information and order upon the persons in whose possession the articles were found, and by posting up a copy of the order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>information on the building where the seizure was made, fourteen days previous to the hearing. The return of the officer shows that after diligent search he could not find the parties named, and that their usual places of abode were unknown to him, and that the notice was served by posting a copy as directed on 1 the building. This was a reasonable notice, and one which the court, before whom the proceedings were had, might well deem quite as likely to convey the information intended to the parties interested, as any which could be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
