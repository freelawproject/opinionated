Tapley against Lucretia W. Martin, was tried at November term 1870 of this court in Ef&amp;ex, and a verdict returned for the plaintiff, and exceptions taken by the defendant at the trial were allowed by the presiding judge, and entered upon the law docket in that county at November term 1871. On February 26,1872, the defendant pleaded a certificate of discharge in bankruptcy, obtained January 20, 1872, in the District Court of the United States for the District of Maryland. On June 15,1874, Ambrose A. Ranney, Esquire, the attorney for the defendant, suggested of record that her death occurred June 12, 1874. On October 22, 1874, the plaintiff filed a motion that the plea of discharge in bankruptcy be taken off the record of this court, upon the ground that it would appear from an inspection of the whole record and final decree of the United States Court (copies of which were produced) that the certificate of discharge had not been granted, but had been refused. In November, 1874, the exceptions taken at the trial were argued by Mr. Ranney, as <em>amicus </em>curiae, and by the counsel for the plaintiff, and overruled. See <em>Tapley </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>116 Mass. 275.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>At a subsequent hearing before Wells, J., on motions of the plaintiff that the plea of discharge in bankruptcy be ordered to be taken off the record, and that judgment be entered for the plaintiff <em>nune pro tune </em>as of November term 1871, James D.

This is a petition to prove exceptions taken to the right of the court to enter judgment for the plaintiff <em>nune pro tune </em>after the death of the defendant. The objection is raised that there is no party before this court to take exception. The theory upon which such a judgment is entered is, that the court by a fiction goes back to the time when the parties were living, and enters such judgment as would then have been entered but for the delay of the law. This is expressed in <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>16 Pick. 170, 173, as follows: \u201c The court will go back to the time when the judgment might have been rendered on the verdict, if no motion had been made which prevented it.\u201d In <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>106 Mass. 339, 342, it is said that \u201c the court in now rendering judgment will go back to the time when it would have been rendered if no action had been taken to prevent it.\u201d In <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>Smyth, </em>8 Bing. 29, 32, Tindal, C. J., said: \u201c The case therefore does not depend on the St. of Car. II., but on the rule of common law, that where parties are hung up by act of the law, neither of them loses his right, but eventually judgment is entered <em>nune pro tune, </em>as if the party were still alive.\u201d Similar expressions are found in a great number of cases. Freeman on judgments, (2d ed.) \u00a7 56 \u00a7 <em>seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-5\">If this is the theory for the purpose of entering judgment, is it not the same for the purpose of showing cause why such judgment should not be entered ? In <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Bough, </em>15 L. J. (N. S.) Q. B. 30, 32, Wightman, J., said: \u201c If it could be shown that the defendants or any third person would be prejudiced by .entering the judgment as prayed, that would no doubt be ground for the court refusing to interfere; but in the absence of any well founded objection of that kind, it appears to me that the rule for entering the judgment <em>nune pro tune </em>must be made absolute.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-6\">The cases are numerous where arguments have been entertained by courts upon their power to render a judgment <em>nune pro tune </em>after the death of one party, and no suggestion has ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>been made that there was no party in court competent to resist the motion. The arguments proceed upon the fiction that they are had while the parties are living. <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>16 Pick. 170. <em>Mayor of Norwich </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>4 Burr. 2277. <em>Abington </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>11 L. J. (N. S.) Q. B. 15. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>9 Q. B. 47 ; <em>S. C. </em>16 L. J. (N. S.) Q. B. 56. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Paine C. C. 483. <em>Heathcote </em>v. <em>Wing, </em>11 Exch. 355. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Tranah, </em>12 C. B. 406.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-4\">The petitioners were allowed to be heard before a single judge as to whether or not the record in this case was ready for final judgment; and if allowed to be heard upon that question there, have they not the right to ask a review of the ruling made upon matters of law? They were admitted as parties so far as the motion to enter judgment was concerned, and ask now only to be heard upon that same motion. In <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>106 Mass. 339, the exceptions were allowed after death of the party excepting. In <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Rosher, </em>13 Q. B. 780, after verdict for the plaintiff, with leave reserved to move a nonsuit or verdict for the defendant, the defendant died before a motion could be made; and the rule <em>nisi </em>was afterwards obtained in his name. Suppose in <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Riley </em>the exceptions as filed had been disallowed; might they not have been proved ? It may be said that in the above cases the exceptions were taken while the parties were living, but they were such as must have been taken at or before verdict, which could only be had while the parties were living; in the case at bar, the exceptions arise from proceedings that could only be taken after the death of one of the parties. Now it must either be held that the court proceeds <em>ex parte </em>in fiction as well as in fact, in allowing judgment <em>nunc pro tune </em>after death of one of the parties, or that the decision of a single judge is final upon the legal power to enter such a judgment. Suppose, when <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Riley </em>was sent back to the Superior Court, a question had arisen as to the legal power of the court to enter judgment; would the decision of a single judge of the Superior Court have been final ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-5\"><em>O.

Smyth, 8 Bing. <em>29; S. C. 1 </em>Mo. &amp; Sc. 93; <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>9 Q. B. 47; or if the exceptions had been taken by the party in his lifetime, though not allowed or entered until after his death ; because they would be his own exceptions, seasonably alleged and tendered by himself, and the subsequent allowance and entry of them might be treated as mere forms to put them in order for hearing ; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>106 Mass. 339; or if the ruling below bad been in his favor, and the questions of law reserved on the motion of the other party; <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>16 Pick. 170 ; or if the questions of law had been reserved by the judge himself at the trial or hearing, and brought before the full court by his report, or by motion pursuant to leave so reserved. <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>2 Cush. 52, 62. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Rosher, </em>13 Q. B. 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">But the difficulty in this case lies deeper. None but a party to a suit has a right to allege exceptions, or to file a petition to establish the truth thereof. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 11. At the time when these questions of law were first raised, the defendant was dead, and no executor or administrator had, so far as appears, been appointed or named. The heir of the defendant had no right to appear as a party to a personal action. The sureties upon the bond to dissolve the attachment were not, and could not be made, parties to the action in their own name; and they could not use the name of the defendant, because she was dead, uc$r of her executor or administrator, because it does not appear that there was any. Both the heir and the sureties were allowed to come in and be heard, not as parties to the suit, but, just as any stranger might be, for the information of the judge before whom the motions were pending. The counsel for the deceased defendant had no right to be heard as such, because his authority to act in her behalf had been revoked by her death. Like the heir and the sureties, he could be heard only as <em>amicus curiae. </em>An <em>amicus curiae </em>is heard only by the leave and for the assistance of the court, and upon a case already before it. He has no control over the suit, and no right to institute any proceeding therein, or to bring the case from one court to another, or from a single judge to the full court, by exceptions, appeal or writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>error. 4 H.
