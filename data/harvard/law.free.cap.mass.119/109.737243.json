The committee on licenses to whom was referred the proposed revocation of the license of Mary Moylan, common victualler and liquor dealer, reported verbally, that they had given a hearing to all parties interested, and were of opinion that it was inexpedient to take further action in the matter. The report was accepted. After some discussion, on motion of Alderman Chapman, it was ordered, that the license to sell intoxicating liquors granted by this board to Mary Moylan May 3, 1875, be and the same is hereby revoked.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-4\">Parol evidence was offered by the government, tending to show that the defendant had an opportunity to be heard and was heard, upon a charge of having sold liquor on the Lord\u2019s day, before the committee on licenses of the board of aldermen of the city of Salem, and upon the question of the revocation of said license.

It should have appeared by their record, in some form, that the mayor and aldermen had upon such proof determined her license forfeited by reason of her violation of the conditions upon which it was to be exercised. They were dealing with that which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>under this statute, is deemed a valuable privilege, to obtain which the defendant had paid a considerable sum, and of which she was not liable to be deprived except by such a decision. St. 1875, <em>c. </em>99, \u00a7 7. It was not in their power to revoke or recall her license, either arbitrarily, or because they considered it to have been injudiciously granted in the first instance, or for any similar reason. Their power was much more limited, and it cannot be inferred from a vote simply that the license be \u201c revoked,\u201d that they have adjudged it forfeited upon proof satisfactory to them, that its conditions had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Nor is it necessary to determine, in the case before us, whether the deficiency in the recorded vote of the mayor and aldermen could have been supplied by extrinsic evidence that they acted upon proof satisfactory to them, and upon such proof, although using the term \u201c revoked,\u201d had determined the license. If the extrinsic evidence admitted be examined, it entirely fails to show that either the committee on licenses (before whom there was a hearing) or the mayor and aldermen ever found the defendant guilty of any breach of its conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
