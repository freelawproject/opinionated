Sts. <em>c. </em>137, \u00a7 5, to recover possession of a house on Kirkland Street in Boston, alleged to be held by the defendant unlawfully and against the right of the plaintiff. Writ dated May 23,1872. The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court on appeal, on an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHL\">On April 1, 1869, the plaintiff executed to the defendant a written lease of the said premises for a term of five years. The defendant entered into possession under the lease, and has coutin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>aed in possession up to the present time. On March 1,1872, one month\u2019s rent was in arrear and unpaid; the defendant declined to pay the same to the plaintiff, who on March 8 gave him a notice, in due form, to quit in fourteen days, for non-payment of rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\">On July 18, 1870, the city of Boston, in pursuance of the St. of 1868, <em>c. </em>277,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> passed an order in due form of law to take possession of said premises, and duly recorded the same in accordance with the act, in the Suffolk Registry of Deeds. Since the commencement of this action, the title to the premises has been reconveyed by the city to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">Some time in the fall of 1871, the city, by its contractors and workmen, entered upon the premises for the purpose of raising the building, as contemplated by the act. The defendant continued to occupy the premises as his dwelling, subject to the disturbance created by such raising, which was considerable; and he continued to pay rent to his lessor during and for some months succeeding the completion of the work done by the city, both parties acting in the belief that the lease continued in full force and effect. The city gave notice to the defendant that it would commence the work of raising prior to so doing, but the defendant paid no attention thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">In February, 1872, the defendant was informed, but not by the city or any of its agents, that he was liable to the city for the use and occupation of the premises, and in consequence declined to pay- the rent in arrear March 1, as before stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-7\">A. <em>Russ, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-8\"><em>R.

During this term the city of Boston, acting by authority of the St. of 1868, <em>c. </em>277, for the purpose of making certain im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>provements of a public character, took the estate in accordance with the provisions of that statute, and the title thereof was then vested in the city, that of the plaintiff being divested. <em>Dingley </em>v. Boston, 100 Mass. 544. The plaintiff brings this proceeding for tbe possession of the premises, upon the ground that the de \u2022 fendant has failed to pay him one month\u2019s rent which has accrued since this taking by the city, the defendant still continuing in possession, although disturbed therein by the work which the city has been carrying on, and the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover depends upon the question whether any rent was due to him from the defendant. But, even without eviction by, or attornment to, the holder of the new title, the liability to pay the rent reserved ceased with the termination of the plaintiff\u2019s estate during the term subsequent to the making of the lease and the entry of the defendant under it. <em>Lamson </em>v. Clarkson, 113 Mass. 348, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">It was for the plaintiff, then, to show that, subsequently to the expiration of his title, a new tenancy had been created; and upon the facts stated, the court below was warranted in finding that no agreement for such new tenancy was shown, and in rendering judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Since this proceeding was commenced, the city of Boston has reconveyed to the plaintiff the title to these premises; but this cannot affect the case, which is to be determined by the condition of things which then existed. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
