By the terras of the deed, the city was to make an appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars for the purpose, and to build a hospital, or part of a hospital, of a certain size, upon the land within three years, or, failing to do so, to pay the grantor, or his legal representative, the sum of two hundred dollars a month; and the land was not to be sold for twenty-five years, and then only upon the opinion of three fourths of the board of trustees that it was unsuitable for a city hospital, and upon the setting apart of a sum of money equal to the value of the land, as then ascertained by three appraisers, as a permanent fund for the city hospital. The city was duly authorized by the Legislature to erect and maintain a city hospital, and accepted the grant of the said land. The grantor by his will, after devising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>all the residue of his estate to the city in trust, to be by it applied fly the sole use and benefit of the city hospital, provided as follows: \u201c While I would not wish to give any particular direction to the bequest, nor incur the risk of defeating the purpose I have in view in making it, by imposing any limitations or condition as to the manner of its use, still I should prefer to see it set apart as a separate fund, and the income thereof only applied to the support and maintenance of said hospital, if such course shall commend itself to the wisdom of those having it in charge.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that a bill in equity brought by the city after the death of the grantor and within three years after the grant, seeking to release the city from the obligation of building a hospital upon the land within three years from the date oi the deed, and to enable the city to sell the land immediately for its own benefit, on the ground that the city had made other provisions for a suitable and convenient city hospital elsewhere, that it would be inexpedient and unnecessary to erect a hospital on the land, and that said land, on account of its situation, its northern exposure and nature of its soil, was not a suitable, convenient or wholesome place for the erection of a hospital for the reception and care of sick persons, could not be maintained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-4\">Bill in equity, filed November 24, 1874, by the city of Worcester against the trustees of the Worcester City Hospital, the heirs and executors of George Jaques, and the Attorney General, alleging the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-5\">By the St. of 1871, <em>c. </em>339, passed May 25, 1871, the city of Worcester was authorized \u201cto erect, establish and maintain a hospital for the reception of persons who, by misfortune or poverty, may require relief during temporary sickness,\u201d and the city council of said city was empowered \u201c to make such ordinances, rules and regulations as they may deem expedient, for the appointment of trustees and all other necessary officers, agents and servants for managing the said hospital.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-6\">On June 26,1871, the city council passed an ordinance, which is now in force, establishing a hospital accordingly, and providing for the appointment of a board of trustees for the management of the hospital and of all funds and real and personal property received by the city by gift or bequest for the benefit of the hospital, and afterwards elected a board of trustees under the ordinance. The city established a city hospital for the reception of patients, and the city council made annual appropriations for its support and maintenance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-7\">On March 12, 1872, George Jaques conveyed to the city a parcel of land in Worcester, to be held by the city, its successors and assigns, in trust nevertheless, and for certain charitable uses and purposes set forth in the deed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201c 1.

No hospital building, or part of a hospital building, shall be placed or built on said parcel of land, for twenty-five years from the date hereof, until the plan of such building or part thereof shall have been approved by a vote of said city council, and also by a vote of the board of trustees of the city hospital of said city.

The testator, in and by his said will, after providing for the payment of his debts, funeral expenses and charges of administration, and directing the payment of certain pecuniary legacies, devised and bequeathed all the rest and residue of his property, real and personal, to the city of Worcester, in trust for the use and benefit of said city hospital, said devise and bequest being contained in the eighth and ninth clauses of his will, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">\u201c 8. I have been convinced for some time that the city of Worcester, containing within it as it does so many elements of prosperity, thrift and rapid growth, has no greater want to be supplied than that of a well endowed and properly managed gen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>eral hospital which can minister to the comforts of the sick and unfortunate among the poorer classes of the city\u2019s population, by furnishing that care, nursing and medical skill which otherwise they never would receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-4\">\u201c I have already given evidence of my conviction upon this point by the gift recently made to the city for that object, but at the same time I realize how little that alone can do towards the proper and full accomplishment of the work, or even to such a degree as to render it of any permanent and real value to those for whose comfort and well being it is designed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">\u201c In making disposition of the balance of my property, situated as I am, with no relation likely to survive me nearer than cousins with whom I have never been on terms of intimacy, and many of whom are comparative strangers to me, I have thought I could not be the instrument of more good to my fellow men, or serve a better purpose with said balance of\u2019my estate, than by contributing still more to the object above named. Therefore,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\">\u201c 9. All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal or mixed, not herein otherwise disposed of, of which I may die seised and possessed, or to which I may in any way be entitled at the time of my decease, whatever the same may be, wherever it may be or be situated, or however it may lu known, designated or described, I give, devise and bequeath unto the city of Worcester, in trust, however, to be by the city applied to the sole and particular use and benefit of the institution recently established and known as the Worcester City Hospital, and to no use or purpose other than that whatsoever. While I would not wish to give any particular direction to the bequest nor incur the risk of defeating the purpose I have in view in making it, by imposing any limitations or condition as to the manner of its use, still I should prefer to see it set apart as a separate fund, and the income thereof only applied to the sup port and maintenance of said hospital, if such course shall commend itself to the wisdom of those having it in charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\">The bill further alleged that a large personal and real estate had vested in and was now held by the city under said will, for the charitable uses and purposes in said will declared; that the city had made other provisions for a suitable and convenient city hospital building; that it would be inexpedient and unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>to erect a hospital building on said land at the present time or within three years from the date of said deed; that said land, on account of its situation, its northern exposure and the nature of its soil, is not a suitable, convenient or wholesome place for the erection of a hospital for the reception and care of sick persons ; that other land, more suitable and available for said purpose, can readily be obtained; that the city had already established a city hospital on land which was devised to the city under said will of George Jaques, and which is better adapted to said purposes; that it is necessary and expedient that a sale and conveyance of the land conveyed by said deed should be made, and the proceeds invested for the use and benefit of said <em>hospital; </em>that James Jaques, one of the defendants, had released to said executors all his interest in said estate, and the executors had conveyed the same to the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-4\">The prayer of the bill was that the city might be relieved from the obligation of building a hospital building on said land within three years from the date of said deed, and that a conveyance of said land and the investment and application of the proceeds for the purposes of said hospital should be decreed, and for other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">The executors filed an answer disclaiming all interest in the matters set forth in the bill. The trustees of the city hospital filed an answer admitting the allegations of the bill, and consenting that the prayer of the bill might be granted. The bill was taken for confessed against James Jaques. Sabra Carter, one of the heirs at law of George Jaques, appeared and filed a demurrer, assigning for cause that the plaintiff had not in the bill made or stated such a case as entitled it to any relief whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">The case was heard and reserved by <em>Gray, </em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_0\">By the terms of the deed executed by Gecrge Jaques and accepted by the city, the city took the land for the purpose of building a hospital thereon; the city was to make an appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars for the purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and was to build a hospital, or part of a hospital, of a certain size, upon the land, within three years, or, failing to do so, to pay to the grantor or his legal representative the sum of two hundred dollars a month; the land was not to be sold for twenty-five years, and then only upon the opinion of three fourths of the board of trustees that it was unsuitable for a city hospital, and upon the setting apart of a sum of money equal to the value of the land, as then ascertained by three appraisers, as a permanent fund for the benefit of the Worcester City Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The right to the monthly sum of two hundred dollars, payable by the terms of the deed to the grantor or his legal representative, vested, upon his death, in his executor or administrator. <em>Cox </em>v. Curwen, 118 Mass. 198. By virtue of the residuary clause in his will, it would pass to the city; yet not as absolute property, but in trust for the benefit of the Worcester City Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">There is nothing in the will, which manifests any intention to vary the provisions of the deed, or to authorize a sale of the land except at the time and under the restrictions therein stated. The donor may well have considered that if a hospital should -not be erected on the land granted, the land would increase in value so much during twenty-five years, that his charitable purpose would be best promoted by not selling the land before the expiration of that time. But whatever his reasons were, the terms of his grant, to which the city, by accepting it, assented, are plain. Even if, as the city now alleges, the land is an unsuitable place for a hospital, whatever weight that consideration may have upon the question whether a hospital shall be immediately built there, it has no tendency to show that the alternative undertaking of the city to pay two hundred dollars monthly cannot be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The object of the present bill is to release the city from the obligation of building a hospital upon the land, and of appropriating twenty-five thousand dollars for that purpose, or, tailing so to build, of paying two hundred dollars <em>monthly; </em>and to enable the city to sell the land immediately, in violation of the terms of its contract with the donor, and thus to avail itself of the whole value of the gift, without performing its part of the contract, or paying any of the sums of money which it had bound itself to pay out of its own funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The only reasons alleged are that the city has made other provisions for a suitable and convenient city hospital elsewhere; that it would be inexpedient and unnecessary to erect a hospital on this land; and that \u201c said land, on account of its situation, its northern exposure and the nature of its soil, is not a suitable, convenient or wholesome place for the erection of a hospital for the reception and care of sick persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">It does not appear that there are any facts which did not exist or were not known to the city at the time of accepting the deed of the donor, and no case is shown for inducing a court of equity to assist the city in violating its contract with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
