Testimony to the same point was also introduced by the plaintiffs in rebuttal. The plaintiffs contended that the burden of proof was on the defendant to establish and prove said alteration, but the judge ruled <em>\u201c </em>that the proof of the signature of a party to a note is <em>primd facie </em>evidence that the whole body of the note written over it is the act of said party ; but that such proof is merely <em>primd facie, </em>that when, as in the present case, proper pleadings present the issue, the plaintiffs are bound to prove affirmatively that the note declared on and put in proof is substantially the note made by the defendant; and that, when proof has been offered by the defendant tending to show a material alteration, the burden of proof is with the plaintiffs, to satisfy the court, or jury, upon the whole case, that the note so declared on was in substance and effect the note of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">The judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-6\"><em>N.

This the defendant denies, and says that there has been an alteration of the note since it was given. If an alteration was made after its execution and without the defendant\u2019s consent, the note declared on is not the note )f the defendant. The plaintiffs must establish that it is this defendant\u2019s note, and on this proposition the plaintiffs have the burden of proof throughout. \u25a0 The plaintiffs rely upon the words of Shaw, C. J., in Davis v. <em>Jenney, </em>1 Met. 221, 224: \u201cthat an extension of the time was a material alteration, and that the burden of proof was upon the defendant to show the alteration.\u201d That the words are not here used in their technical sense, is evident from the paragraph that follows: \u201c or perhaps to state this last proposition with a little more precision, the proof or admission of the signature of a party to an instrument is <em>primd facie </em>evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>that the instrument written over it is the act of the party; and this <em>primd facie </em>evidence will stand as binding proof, unless the defendant can rebut it by showing, from the appearance of the instrument itself, or otherwise, that it has been altered.\u201d In <em>Wilde </em>v. <em>Armsby, </em>6 Cush. 314, it was held that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show that an interlineation was made before the instrument was executed. The same rule applies as when a want of consideration is relied on as the defence to a promissory note; the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, upon the whole evidence, to establish that fact. <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>6 Cush. 364. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>12 Gray, 467. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>13 Pick. 69, 76. The ruling at the trial was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
