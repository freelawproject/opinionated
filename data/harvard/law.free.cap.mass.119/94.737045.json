Almy as an expert, to testify to the value of the land taken by the city, and he was permitted to testify thereto without objection, having known of sales of land at or about the time of, the taking. The respondent then asked him the following question : \u201c How did you get at your opinion of the market value ? \u201d The petitioners objected, and the sheriff excluded the question; and the respondent excepted. The jury returned a verdict for the petitioners, which was certified to the Superior Court. In that court the verdict was set aside on motion of the respondent, and the petitioners appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-10\"><em>J.
