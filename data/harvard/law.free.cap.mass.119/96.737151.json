The declaration alleged that the plaintiff made a verbal agreement with the defendant to dig and wall his cellar, furnish the materials for the mason work, and to do the labor in putting up and putting on said materials in mason work for a six tenement block, belonging to the defendant, in Fall River, for the sum of $1425; that in pursuance of said verbal agreement he furnished the materials, dug and walled the cellar, and put up and put on the materials in mason work to the said six tenement block for the defendant for the said sum ; that the defendant, in consideration thereof, paid him on or about August 13, 1873, the sum of $725 towards the same, and that the defendant owes the plaintiff the balance of $700, and interest on the same from October 15, 1873, according to an account annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-4\">The answer of defendant contained a general denial, alleged payment and denied any agreement to pay interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court without a jury, Pitman, J., ordered judgment for the defendant, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions upon the following findings and rulings :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">\u201c I find that the plaintiff has not established by a preponderance of proof the contract or agreement set forth in his declaration. There is also evidence tending to show that after an original undertaking had been entered into between the plaintiff and one Francis Hye to furnish on his account the work and materials for which this suit is now brought, that said plaintiff declined or refused to furnish the same, and that the defendant thereupon promised to see him paid. The defendant offered evidence to the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">\u201c As upon my view of the whole evidence there does not appear to me, if this were proved, to have been a novation or an extinguishment of the original liability of Hye, I have not deemed it material to determine whether or not there was such a collateral undertaking, because if proved it would not be the contract declared on.
