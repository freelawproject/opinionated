S. 19, 26). Our decree of October 27, 1947, reserved jurisdiction to enter such further orders and to issue such writs as might from time to time be necessary (332 U. S. 804, 805).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The Government has now filed a petition praying that the precise boundary as to certain segments of the California coastal area be ascertained. It urges that there exists a definite need for a prompt determination in this respect. California has answered, agreeing that there is need for prompt determination of the boundaries as to the segments designated by the Government, but it urges that there is also need for a prompt determination of the precise California coastal boundary all the way from Oregon to Mexico.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b928-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>Attorney General Clark, Solicitor General Perlman, Assistant Attorney General Vanech, Arnold Raum, Stanley M.

Should the master conclude that such adjudications should be made, he is also authorized to recommend to this Court an appropriate procedure to be followed in determining the precise boundary of such segments.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b928-8\">Mr. Justice Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision of this question.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
