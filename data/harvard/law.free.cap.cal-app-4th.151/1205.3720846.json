According to the People, dismissal is a proper sanction for a criminal discovery violation only when it is required by the United States Constitution, and dismissal was not required here because the evidence that was not disclosed was not favorable to defendants. We agree and therefore reverse the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The criminal charges in this case arose from an incident in March 2004, when defendants allegedly participated in a group assault on several individuals in West Sacramento, including a 47-year-old Afghani expatriate named Sayed Sayah. According to the People, the assault was precipitated by a conversation earlier in the day between Sayah and defendant Ashraf about Sayah\u2019s plans to return to Afghanistan to work as an interpreter for United States military forces there. In the course of that conversation, Ashraf allegedly expounded on the evils of the United States and the merits of the Taliban and declared that Sayah was \u201ca bad [MJuslim because he was willing to help the United States, which is the enemy of Islam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">On February 23, 2006, in advance of the trial scheduled to begin on March 7, defendants filed a motion in limine that requested (among other things) a bar on the use of the word \u201cTaliban\u201d absent an Evidence Code section 402 hearing \u201cas to any evidence that would support a belief that any defendant was a member or acting in behalf of said organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">The following day, the prosecutor filed a motion in limine in which he sought (among other things) leave to offer evidence of the conversation between Ashraf and Sayah to provide a motive for the attack\u2014\u201creligious and political hatred.\u201d In passing, the prosecutor noted that \u201c[t]he specifics of th[e] conversation were recorded by Detective Erik Thruelsen of the [West Sacramento Police Department] when he interviewed [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">A week later, on March 3, 2006, the prosecutor filed an \u201caddendum\u201d to his motion in limine on the motive issue. According to the prosecutor, he had discovered just two days earlier (on Mar. 1) that \u201conly a small fraction of what was said by several interviewed witnesses making reference to the Ashraf/Niazi Taliban connection as motive for the attack, was included in the police reports\u201d the prosecution had received and produced to the defense in discovery. The prosecutor explained that while interviewing another one of the victims, Amarddin (Zerguy) Maazoudin, on March 1 about prior incidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>involving the Niazis, Maazoudin told the prosecutor about an incident in which Sarajuddin Niazi described himself \u201cpassionately as pro-Taliban.\u201d Maazoudin also told the prosecutor that Detective Thruelsen was present during an interview around the time the March 2004 incident was being investigated during which Maazoudin had described the earlier incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Apparently alarmed about this omission from the police reports, the prosecutor contacted Detective Thruelsen. The detective told the. prosecutor that after the first two witnesses he interviewed mentioned the Taliban, he contacted \u201ca joint FBI-Homeland Security Office task force (JTF).\u201d Thereafter, the JTF (joint task force) either conducted or was present' at the interviews of the victims and other witnesses. At the apparent request of the JTF, Detective Thruelsen excluded references to the Taliban from the reports of the interviews\u2014to the extent any such reports were prepared. The prosecutor summarized the excluded information as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-6\">(1) All but one of numerous references to the Taliban by Sayah in his initial interview with Detective Thruelsen were excised from the report of that interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">(2) A second interview of Sayah was conducted by the JTF and Detective Thruelsen, in which Sayah apparently gave \u201ca detailed account of Khialuddin Niazi\u2019s involvement with the Taliban in 2001 and 2002 in West Sacramento,\u201d but no report of that interview was provided to the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">(3) References to two encounters between Amarddin Maazoudin and Sarajuddin Niazi in late 2001-2002 were missing from the reports of Maazoudin\u2019s interviews. Both incidents showed \u201cSarajuddin Niazi\u2019s pro-Taliban sympathies and a high degree of passion on the subject of the Taliban\u2019s ouster from Afghanistan by the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-9\">(4) Detective Thruelsen interviewed another victim, Julio Gomez, who \u201ctalked about witnessing \u2022 the exchange between Amarddin Maazoudin and Sarajuddin Niazi in which Sarajuddin became visibly incensed over a political loss suffered by the Taliban in the signing of the \u2018Bonn Agreement.\u2019 \u201d That portion of Gomez\u2019s interview was apparently excluded from the police reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-10\">(5) An interview of a witness (Aslum Maazoudin) was conducted by the JTF and West Sacramento police, in which the witness \u201cdescribed a 2002-2003 confrontation with Khialuddin Niazi during which i[t] became apparent that he was actively supporting the Taliban in various ways,\u201d but no report of that interview was provided to the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>According to. the prosecutor, \u201cThe net result was that any substantive information obtained from witnesses and victims providing evidence of hostility by the Taliban as the motivation for the attack appears to have been excluded from police reports provided to [the prosecution].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">On March 2, 2006, the prosecution conducted supplemental interviews of Sayah, both Maazoudins, and Gomez, focusing on the information that had been excluded from the police reports that was \u201ccorroborative of the motives for the attack based solely on perceived political differences.\u201d The prosecutor represented that the reports of those supplemental interviews were to be faxed to defense counsel on March 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">On March 6, 2006, the day before trial, Ashraf filed a motion to dismiss the information \u201cbased upon the failure of the prosecution\" to provide discovery timely before the trial in this matter.\u201d Ashraf argued that by \u201cwithholding material information until the eve of trial on the excuse that they did not have possession of it, (even though their chief investigating detective did), [the prosecution] ha[s] breached [its] duty and the public trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">The following day, the parties and the court took up the motion to dismiss, in which\" the three other defendants joined. The prosecutor assured the court \u201cthere was nothing wilful [on his part] in any way shape or form in the withholding of these statements.\u201d He also told the court he had directed Detective Thruelsen to contact the FBI'or Homeland Security to \u201cget them to respond to my request to release all the statements that they\u2019re in. possession of,\u201d but there had been no response. Additionally, at various points the prosecutor interjected that the information or evidence Detective Thruelsen withheld was \u201cinculpatory,\u201d not exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">After considering the matter, the trial court found there had been \u201ca violation of the discovery statute\u201d .that was \u201cnot intentional by the Deputy District Attorney ... but was intentional by law enforcement in general, and specifically Detective [Thruelsen].\u201d In considering potential sanctions, the court observed that \u201cthe discovery may be exculpatory, [because] an argument can be made that since there has been no contact with the defendants by Homeland Security or the F.B.I. regarding an alleged Taliban connection, that may be favorable to the defendants.\u201d After determining that \u201call less restrictive sanctions would not be effective,\u201d the court found \u201cthere\u2019s been a due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>process violation and that a dismissal is called for.\u201d Accordingly, the court dismissed the case \u201cwithout prejudice, to give the district attorney an opportunity to obtain the withheld reports if he\u2019s able to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The People filed a timely notice of appeal from the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">\n<em>The Discovery Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Discovery in California criminal prosecutions is governed by Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 1054 et seq. Under section 1054.1, the prosecutor must \u201cdisclose to the defendant or his or her attorney\u201d certain \u201cmaterials and information, if it is in the possession of the prosecuting attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the possession of the investigating agencies.\u201d That material includes \u201c[rjelevant written or recorded statements of witnesses or reports of the statements of witnesses whom the prosecutor intends to call at trial,\u201d as well as \u201c[a]ny exculpatory evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 1054.1, subds. (f), (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Subdivision (b) of section 1054.5 provides that \u201c[u]pon a showing that a party has not complied with Section 1054.1 . . . , a court may make any order necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter . . . .\u201d Subdivision (c) of that statute provides, however, that \u201c[t]he court shall not dismiss a charge pursuant to subdivision (b) unless required to do so by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d (\u00a7 1054.5, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">As the People point out, \u201cthe only substantive discovery mandated by the United States Constitution\u201d is the disclosure of \u201cmaterial exculpatory evidence\u201d under <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83 [10 L.Ed.2d 215, 83 S.Ct. 1194]. <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Barrett) (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314-1315 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 264].) They contend that because \u201cthere is no showing that the missing reports would have contained any [material] exculpatory information,\u201d there was no <em>Brady </em>violation here and therefore no basis for dismissing the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">\n<em>Standard Of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Khialuddin Niazi first contends the People\u2019s argument \u201cmisses the point\u201d because the issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in choosing dismissal as a sanction for the People\u2019s discovery violation. He is mistaken. Although abuse of discretion is generally the proper standard of appellate review on matters regarding discovery in criminal cases (see <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 359, 366 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 637]), that standard is manifestly <em>not </em>the proper one here, because subdivision (c) of section 1054.5 <em>forbids </em>the use of dismissal as a discovery sanction unless the dismissal is <em>required </em>by the federal Constitution. The judge had no discretion to exercise. Thus, the question here is not whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the case, but whether the trial court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the case because the federal Constitution did not require dismissal. To answer that question, we must determine whether a <em>Brady </em>violation occurred. If there was no <em>Brady </em>violation, then there was no conceivable basis for concluding the federal Constitution required dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\"><em>There Was No </em>Brady <em>Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">Under Brady, \u201c \u2018the prosecution must disclose to the defense any evidence that is \u201cfavorable to the accused\u201d and is \u201cmaterial\u201d on the issue of either guilt or punishment.\u2019 [Citation.] Under <em>Brady, </em>\u2018Evidence is \u201cfavorable\u201d if it either helps the defendant or hurts the prosecution, as by impeaching one of its witnesses. [][] Evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had [it] been disclosed to the defense, the result . . . would have been different.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Kennedy v. Superior Court, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.4th at p. 367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Of course, to determine whether evidence that was not disclosed to the defense was favorable and material under <em>Brady, </em>we must have some idea of what that evidence was. Here, we do not even know for certain whether there ever <em>was </em>any evidence\u2014in the form of written or recorded statements of witnesses or reports of those statements\u2014that the People failed to disclose. From the record, all we really know is that the prosecutor <em>did not receive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>reports of certain statements given by Sayah, Gomez, and Amarddin and Aslum Maazoudin; we do not know whether any. such reports actually exist or ever existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Even if we assume they do (or did) exist, however, from the record it appears those reports would consist of the following: (1) whatever references to the Taliban Detective Thruelsen excised from his report of his initial interview of Sayah; (2) any report of the second interview of Sayah, in which he described Khialuddin Niazi\u2019s involvement with the Taliban in 2001 and 2002; (3) any report of the interview or interviews of Amarddin Maazoudin in which he described encounters with Sarajuddin Niazi in late 2001-2002 that showed Sarajuddin\u2019s pro-Taliban sympathies; (4) any report of the part of Detective Thruelsen\u2019s interview of Gomez where Gomez discussed Sarajuddin becoming visibly incensed over a political loss suffered by the Taliban; and (5) any report of the interview of Aslum Maazoudin in which he described a 2002-2003 confrontation with Khialuddin Niazi that indicated Khialuddin was actively supporting the Taliban.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">We are at a loss to understand how any of the matter described above could be deemed \u201cfavorable\u201d to defendants for <em>Brady </em>purposes. So far as we know, the excluded matter all related to defendants\u2019 support of and/or sympathy for the Taliban.. To the extent defendants\u2019 status as Taliban sympathizers/supporters is relevant at all' in this case, it appears relevant only as circumstantial evidence of defendants\u2019 possible motive for attacking Sayah because of his plans to work as an interpreter for United States military forces in Afghanistan. \u201cWhile it is not indispensable that motive be proven as an element necessary to justify a conviction of one charged with crime, the presence or absence of motive is . a circumstance going to the question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McQuate </em>(1934) 2 Cal.2d 227, 234 [39 P.2d 408].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Here, evidence that defendants had a motive to attack Sayah would, at the very least, be relevant to refute defendants\u2019 claim they acted in self-defense. Since the matter contained in the interviews not disclosed to defendants tended to show the presence, rather than the absence, of motive, that matter can only be characterized as <em>unfavorable </em>to defendants. The prosecution has no federal constitutional duty to disclose to a defendant evidence that is unfavorable to him. <em>(People v. Burgener </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 875 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 62 P.3d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>Khialuddin Niazi theorizes that the undisclosed reports might have been favorable to defendants for impeachment purposes. He claims \u201c[t]here is more than a reasonable probability that able defense counsel would find some inconsistency in the witnesses\u2019 prior statements that would assist the defense in defending against the charges.\u201d It is true that evidence tending to impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness may be deemed favorable to the defense under <em>Brady. </em>(See <em>Giglio v. United States </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 150, 154-155 [31 L.Ed.2d 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 763].) \u201cThe jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence . . . .\u201d <em>(Napue v. Illinois </em>(1959) 360 U.S. 264, 269 [3 L.Ed.2d 1217, 1221, 79 S.Ct. 1173].) The problem here, however, is that defendants cannot point to anything in the undisclosed reports they could have used to impeach Sayah, Gomez, Amarddin Maazoudin, or Aslum Maazoudin, and mere speculation that there <em>might have been </em>something useful for impeachment purposes in those reports is not sufficient to demonstrate a <em>Brady </em>violation. (See <em>People v. Gutierrez </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1472 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 138] <em>[\u201cBrady . .. </em>does not require the disclosure of information that is of mere speculative value\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">As for tiie trial court\u2019s suggestion that the discovery might have been favorable to defendants because \u201cthere has been no contact with the defendants by Homeland Security or the F.B.I. regarding an alleged Taliban connection,\u201d the court\u2019s reasoning was faulty. <em>Brady </em>requires the disclosure of evidence that is favorable to the defendant. The evidence that was not disclosed here was evidence of defendants\u2019 support of and/or sympathy for the Taliban, which, as we have explained, was not favorable to defendants. That evidence is not transformed into something favorable to defendants simply because federal officials may not have contacted defendants about their connections with the Taliban. While the evidence of a lack of contact might itself be favorable to defendants (to rebut evidence of their Taliban affiliations), evidence of a lack of contact is not the evidence the People failed to disclose, and the finding of a <em>Brady </em>violation cannot be premised on the potential exculpatory nature of such <em>other </em>evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">At bottom, the question here is whether the evidence the People failed to disclose\u2014evidence that defendants supported or sympathized with the Taliban\u2014was favorable to defendants. We conclude it was not. Accordingly, there was no <em>Brady </em>violation, and therefore no conceivable theory under which the federal Constitution required dismissal of this case for the People\u2019s failure to disclose that evidence. Accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Davis, Acting P. J., and Butz, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 29, 2007, S154270.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">The People do not argue, and therefore we do not address, the propriety of the trial court\u2019s determination that there was \u201ca violation of the discovery statute\u201d in this case. It bears noting, however, that section 1054.1 requires the prosecuting attorney to disclose material and information only \u201cif it is in the possession of the prosecuting attorney or if the prosecuting attorney knows it to be in the possession of the investigating agencies.\u201d It appears here that the prosecuting attorney did not possess any \u201cmissing reports\u201d and did not know if any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>reports were in the possession of the investigating agencies. Thus, it could be argued there was no violation of the discovery statute. As we said, however, the People do not argue this point, so we do not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
