Colburn\u2019s testamentary plan compelled a forced election by his former wife and their children\u2014either enforce their rights under an existing marital dissolution judgment by filing creditor\u2019s claims, or relinquish those rights and take the gifts provided for them in his trust instruments. The former wife and children filed \u201csafe harbor\u201d petitions (Prob. Code, \u00a7 21320) in pursuit of an order eliminating the election and allowing them to reap the benefits of both the marital dissolution judgment and the gifts under the trust. The trustees opposed both petitions. The trial court found that creditor\u2019s claims (a prerequisite to enforcement of the marital judgment) would violate the no contest clause, but that an order to Show cause for modification of the child support due under the marital judgment would not. Both sides appeal, the former wife and children in search of an order that would allow them to have their cake and eat it too, the trustees in search of consistency. We agree with the trial court that creditor\u2019s claims would violate the no contest clause but disagree with the trial court\u2019s finding that an order to show cause would not. We affirm the order denying the safe harbor petitions and reverse the finding that allows an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Richard D. Colburn married Jacqueline S. Colburn in May 1998. They had two children, Daisy (bom in 1998) and Franklin (bom in 2000), then divorced in January 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\n<em>The Dissolution Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">A final judgment based on a stipulated marital settlement agreement obligated Richard (and, in the event of his death, his estate) to pay child support (tax free to Jacqueline) of $4,000 per month per child until majority, marriage, emancipation, or death (f 2.1), to provide medical and dental care for the children (f 2.4), and to pay monthly spousal support of $8,333 to Jacqueline until her death, nonmodifiable and not terminable on her remarriage or his death (f l.l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the marital judgment obligated Richard to deposit into a separate irrevocable trust the amount of $950,000 for the children (][ 3.2), and to include in his estate plan an irrevocable trust or annuity sufficient to make annual tax-free payments of $100,000 to Jacqueline until her death, with any remainder passing to the Colburn Foundation, a charitable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>The Richard D. Colburn Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Richard created the Richard D. Colburn Trust in 1969, and amended and restated it in November 2002 (after the dissolution of his marriage to Jacqueline). The trust includes various provisions designed to comply \u201cwith and . . . carry out the obligations imposed upon [Richard] and [his] estate by the [marital] judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">With regard to child support for Daisy and Franklin (and to carry out the provisions of ff 2.1 and 2.4 of the marital judgment), the trust instructs the trustees to \u201cpurchase a high quality commercial annuity ... in an amount sufficient to make monthly payments to [Jacqueline] equal to $4,000 per child commencing with the month of [Richard\u2019s] death . . . until each child attains age 19, plus such additional amounts [if any] needed to pay [Jacqueline\u2019s] income tax liability arising from the Child Support Payments.\u201d A separate provision directs the trustees to make a \u201cgood faith, reasonable estimate\u201d of the children\u2019s medical costs and to establish a medical trust in an amount not to exceed $1 million in order to \u201ccarry out the obligations imposed upon [Richard\u2019s] estate\u201d by the marital judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">In addition to and independent of Richard\u2019s obligations under the marital judgment, the trust creates separate $3 million trusts for Daisy and Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201c[I]n full satisfaction of the obligations [to Jacqueline] imposed upon [Richard\u2019s] estate\u201d by paragraphs 1.1 and 5.2 of the marital judgment, the trust provides for the creation of an irrevocable \u201ccharitable remainder annuity trust\u201d to make monthly spousal support payments to Jacqueline of $8,333 ($100,000 per year) commencing the first day of the month following Richard\u2019s death and terminating upon Jacqueline\u2019s death, with the remainder passing to the Colburn Foundation, and in addition provides for the purchase of a \u201chigh quality commercial annuity\u201d to pay Jacqueline $100,000 annually for life, plus an amount necessary to pay her tax liability for those payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The trust includes this no contest clause:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201c1.1 have intentionally and with full knowledge omitted to provide for my heirs, except for such provisions, if any, as are made specifically in this trust and my Will.

(including Daisy and Franklin). . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Northern Trust Company and three of Richard\u2019s six adult children (Richard W. Colburn, Keith W. Colburn, and Carol C. Hogel) were named as the trustees of Richard\u2019s trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Richard died on June 3, 2004, and the trustees thereafter initiated procedures to require anyone asserting a claim against the trust\u2019s assets (including claims based on money judgments) to first present a creditor\u2019s claim to the trustees. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 19000, subd. (a)(1), 19004, 19300, subd. (b); <em>Embree </em>v. <em>Embree </em>(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 487, 493 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 782].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">In October, Jacqueline filed two safe harbor applications (one for herself, and one on behalf of the children which was subsequently prosecuted by Barbara D. Bergstein as the children\u2019s guardian ad litem) in which she asked the probate court to determine whether creditor\u2019s claims for spousal and child support and other funds she claimed pursuant to the marital judgment (a total of $8,551,890 for her and $4,687,000 for the children) or, in the children\u2019s case, an order to show cause for modification of child support as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>alternative to a creditor\u2019s claim ($4,687,000), would violate the trust\u2019s no contest clause. (\u00a721320.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a nutshell, Jacqueline and the children claimed the provisions of Richard\u2019s trust did not fully satisfy the obligations imposed on his estate by the marital judgment, and that their proposed creditor\u2019s claims would carry out, not frustrate, his stated intention to have the trust fulfill his obligations under the marital judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The trustees, joined by the Colburn Foundation, opposed both applications, noting that \u201cthe overall distributions to [Jacqueline] and the children under the trust far exceed the amounts required by the [marital judgment]\u201d and contending, among other things, that the proposed creditor\u2019s claims would be contests under the express terms of the trust instrument because they sought \u201cdistributions from the trust estate that far exceeded] and differed] from the distributions for [Jacqueline and the children] provided for under the trust\u201d (and thus frustrated the purpose of the trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In July 2005, the probate court signed and filed an order finding (1) that Jacqueline\u2019s proposed creditor\u2019s claim, if filed, <em>would </em>violate the trust\u2019s no contest clause, (2) that the children\u2019s proposed creditor\u2019s claim, if filed, <em>would </em>violate the trust\u2019s no contest clause, but (3) that an application for an order to show cause for modification of child support, if filed, would <em>not </em>violate the no contest clause because the clause is \u201cunenforceable as against public policy with respect to modification of child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Jacqueline and the guardian ad litem appeal from the order insofar as it finds that their proposed creditor\u2019s claims would violate the no contest clause, and the trustees appeal from the order to the extent it holds that an application for an order to show cause for modification of child support would not violate the no contest clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">I. <em>Jacqueline\u2019s and the Children\u2019s Appeals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Jacqueline and the children contend their proposed creditor\u2019s claims would not violate the no contest clause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">A no contest clause in a will or trust instrument creates a condition upon the instrument\u2019s gifts and disposition by conditioning a beneficiary\u2019s right to take the share provided to her upon her agreement to acquiesce to the terms of the instrument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No contest clauses are not only valid but also favored as a matter of public policy\u2014because they discourage litigation and give \u00e9ffect to the purposes expressed by the testator or trustor. \u201c[E]ven though a no contest clause is strictly construed to avoid forfeiture, it is the testator\u2019s intentions that control, and a court \u2018must not rewrite the [trust] in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate [the trustor\u2019s] unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the no-contest clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Burch v. George </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 246, 255 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 866 P.2d 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">A no contest clause may result in a \u201cforced election\u201d where a beneficiary is obligated to choose between two inconsistent or alternative rights or claims because the testator or trustor clearly intended that the beneficiary not enjoy both. <em>(Estate of Webb </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 169, 173-174 [142 Cal.Rptr. 642].) Put another way, a claimant cannot at the same time take the benefits under a testamentary instrument and repudiate the losses; she must accept the terms in toto, or reject them in toto. (Ibid.; <em>Burch </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 257; <em>Estate of Orwitz </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 767, 769 [40 Cal.Rptr. 545].) A forced election may be expressed in the testamentary document <em>(Estate of Lufkin </em>(1901) 131 Cal. 291, 293 [63 P. 469]) or implied when the trustor\u2019s intent would be thwarted by giving effect to the trust\u2019s testamentary provisions <em>in addition to </em>rather than instead of the beneficiary\u2019s other rights under a statute or judgment. <em>(Estate of Orwitz, supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.2d at p. 769.) Where a beneficiary has rights independent of the testamentary document, a no contest clause necessarily creates a forced election. <em>(Burch </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">With these principles in mind, we independently determine Richard\u2019s intent from the trust instrument (no extrinsic evidence was presented in the trial court). <em>(Estate of Davies </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1173 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 239]; <em>Estate of Webb, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 174; <em>Burch </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pp. 254-256; <em>McIndoe </em>v. <em>Olivos, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Richard\u2019s no contest clause is a paradigm of clarity and unequivocally states his intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">He provided that any beneficiary of his trust or will who, directly or indirectly, contested or attacked either document so as to \u201cfrustrate [his] dispositive plan\u201d\u2014by \u201cfiling a creditor\u2019s claim\u201d or otherwise\u2014would be specifically disinherited and her share would go to the Colburn Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">He identified the marital dissolution judgment and stated that he had set forth in, his trust provisions \u201cto fulfill all obligations [he might] have to [Jacqueline], Daisy, and Franklin pursuant to the terms of the [marital judgment].\u201d He explained that he \u201cspecifically intended] that if [Jacqueline] (or any personal representative or agent of [Jacqueline]) (a) raise[ed] any claim that she ha[d] a community property interest in [his] estate or against this trust or prosecut[ed] any action based thereon, (b) <em>fil[ed\u00a1 a creditor\u2019s claim in [his] estate or against this trust </em>or prosecut[ed] any action based thereon, or (c) in any other manner [made] any claim against this trust, [his] estate, the Colburn Music Fund, or the Colburn Foundation, then in that event [Jacqueline] and all of her descendants (including Daisy and Franklin) shall be deemed to be Objectors as provided in [the no contest clause], and for all purposes thereof, they each shall be deemed to have predeceased [him].\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Lest there be any doubt, he also provided that if Jacqueline, \u201ceither on her own behalf or in any other manner [or through any other person] commence[d] . . . any legal proceeding of any nature against [him] and/or [the trustees], [his] estate,, this Trust, or any other trust established during [his] lifetime, [or any of his charitable entities], then . . ; such action shall constitute a contest of this trust and [his] Will, and [he thereby] disinherit[ed] [Jacqueline] and all [of her] descendants . . . (including Daisy and Franklin).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">By its plain terms, the no contest clause bars the creditor\u2019s claims proposed by Jacqueline and the children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By its substantive provisions, the trust itself confirms Richard\u2019s intent to have the trust perform all of his obligations under the marital judgment\u2014while at the same time giving $3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>million gifts to each of his children. Quite plainly, he did everything within his power to ensure that Jacqueline and the children would accept his gifts without challenging his overall testamentary plan, while at the same time forcing their election so that their challenge to the trust, if made, would leave them to their remedies under the marital dissolution judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">To avoid this result, Jacqueline and the children offer a variety of arguments, none of which have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\n<em>\u00cd.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Jacqueline contends that, although it is clear Richard intended to satisfy the marital judgment by the provisions in his trust, those provisions do not accomplish his intended purpose. According to Jacqueline, her goal is to further Richard\u2019s intent by modifying the trust to conform to the judgment, which she insists is not a contest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The children advance a similar argument, pointing to the differences vis-\u00e1-vis child support and medical support, and the absence of the $750,000 residence provision from the trust. Both arguments miss the point, because the mere filing of a creditor\u2019s claim is a contest within the plain language of the no contest clause, and the purported reasons for prosecuting the claims are irrelevant. <em>(Burch v. George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 257; <em>Estate of Orwitz, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.2d at pp. 770-771; <em>Estate of Emerson </em>(1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 510, 514 [186 P.2d 734].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Richard\u2019s trust provides that, before making distributions to Jacqueline and the children \u201cand in order to ensure that [his] estate is eligible for the maximum allowable federal estate tax charitable deduction,\u201d the trustees are \u201cto obtain either an order from the court having jurisdiction over this trust or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>other suitable legal release\u201d confirming that the trust satisfied his postdeath obligations under the marital judgment. In the event one or more of the provisions related to the marital judgment are determined by court order or legal release to fail to satisfy the marital judgment, those provisions are to be deemed void. According to Jacqueline and the children, the trustees have failed to obtain the required order or releases, and their creditor\u2019s claims are nothing more than an effort to obtain the determinations the trustees should have sought and obtained (while at the same time preserving Jacqueline\u2019s and the children\u2019s rights by the timely filing of their creditor\u2019s claims). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">First, there is nothing in the record to support an assumption that the trustees were required to act before the safe harbor petitions were filed, or that the time within which the trustees can seek the required order or release has expired. Jacqueline and the children could consent to an order confirming the sufficiency of the trust, confirming their rights under the trust, and abandoning their claims under the marital judgment. Alternatively, they could relinquish their rights under the trust, file their proposed creditor\u2019s claims, and obtain the benefits they are entitled to under the marital judgment. In either event, the onus is on Jacqueline and the children, not the trustees (whose obligation is not triggered until distribution is on the horizon).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Second, assuming the trustees are in some way remiss in their duties, the trustees\u2019 omission cannot transform the creditor\u2019s claims into something other than that which they are\u2014actions that, without regard to their purpose, are expressly within the scope of Richard\u2019s no contest clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Jacqueline and the children contend that, assuming their proposed creditor\u2019s claims trigger the no contest clause, public policy considerations (the enforcement of spousal and child support orders) bar enforcement of the no contest clause in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Enforcement of the no contest clause extinguishes Richard\u2019s testamentary gifts to Jacqueline and the children but it in no way prevents them from enforcing Richard\u2019s support obligations under the marital judgment. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Burch v. George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>261-267, where the decedent\u2019s widow advanced essentially the same argument, claiming that enforcement of a no contest clause impaired and effectively prohibited enforcement of her community property rights, \u201cwhile the enforcement of a no contest clause might work a forfeiture of a surviving spouse\u2019s conditional right to take under the trust instrument, it does not . . . work any forfeiture or conversion of the spouse\u2019s community property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 265.) The same is true about spousal and child support because here, as in <em>Burch, </em>the no contest clause does not deprive the former spouse or children of their right to support under the marital judgment, nor does it hinder their ability to assert those interests. To the extent Jacqueline and the children believe their claims under the marital judgment are payable by Richard\u2019s estate, they are free to pursue those claims at their option. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">That Jacqueline and the children would thereby relinquish their conditional right to take under Richard\u2019s trust is a given\u2014because equity supports enforcement of the no contest clause against beneficiaries asserting support claims against the trust\u2019s assets when those claims would plainly frustrate the trustor\u2019s intent and expectations. \u201cThere is considerable unfairness in allowing a [former] spouse [and her children] to accept a will or trust instrument to the extent it confers a benefit, and at the same time attack the instrument to the extent it does not. Under such circumstances, the [former] spouse [and her children] would receive a windfall to the detriment of other beneficiaries.\u201d <em>(Burch </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 267; see <em>Estate of Wolfe </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 570 [311 P.2d 476]; <em>Estate of Waters </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 81 [100 Cal.Rptr. 775]; <em>Estate of Orwitz, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.2d at pp. 769-771; <em>Estate of Lufkin, supra, </em>131 Cal. 291; Hey wood, <em>Proverbs </em>(1546) [\u201cWould ye both eat your cake and have your cake?\u201d].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">We reject the children\u2019s challenge to the specific provision in the trust that a creditor\u2019s claim by Jacqueline would disinherit not only her but also the children (as Jacqueline\u2019s \u201cdescendants\u201d). First, the issue was not raised in either of the safe harbor petitions and thus is not before us on this appeal. Second, the issue is premature and will ripen only if Jacqueline ultimately relinquishes her rights under the trust and pursues a creditor\u2019s claim but the children do the opposite by choosing the trust and relinquishing their rights under the marital judgment. (But see <em>Burch v. George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>p. 256; <em>Zwirn </em>v. <em>Schweizer </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1153 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 527]; <em>Estate of Pittman </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 290 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 622]; <em>Tunstall v. Wells, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.) For this reason, and because the public policy issue could not be determined without factual findings about the benefits and burdens of the compelled election, the point is outside the scope of the safe harbor petitions. (Cf. <em>Estate of Ferber </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 244, 251 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 774] [when a public policy issue is raised in a safe harbor petition, it may be considered only when it can be disposed of as a matter of law, without reference to factual matters].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">II. <em>The Trustees\u2019Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The trustees contend the trial court erred in finding that an application for an order to show cause to modify child support would not violate the no contest clause. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">As the children concede, a creditor\u2019s claim is a prerequisite to an application for an order to show 'cause to modify child support. (\u00a7\u00a7 19004, 19300.) As explained above, a creditor\u2019s claim would violate the no contest clause. As necessarily follows, the children must choose between their rights under the marital judgment and those given by the trust. Any other result would\" be a windfall for the children, a disservice to the trust\u2019s other beneficiaries, and a blatant violation of Richard\u2019 s testamentary plan. <em>(Burch </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 267; <em>Estate of Wolfe, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 570; <em>Estate of Waters, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 81; <em>Estate of Orwitz, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.2d at pp. 769-771; <em>Estate of Lufkin, supra, </em>131 Cal. 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The order is reversed insofar as it holds that an application for an order to show cause for modification of Richard\u2019s child support obligations would not violate the no contest clause. In all other respects, the order is affirmed. The trustees are awarded their costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Mallano, Acting P. J., and Jackson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On June 4, 2007, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. The petition of appellant Barbara D. Bergstein for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 8, 2007, S154108.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\">The marital judgment also obligated Richard to make a lump sum payment of $750,000 to Jacqueline to equalize the property division, and another lump sum payment of $750,000 to her as child support earmarked for the purchase of a residence for Jacqueline and the children. If Jacqueline subsequently sought increased child support, the payment for the residence was to be deemed an advance against any additional award of child support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">As noted above, the marital judgment obligated Richard to fund an irrevocable trust for the children ($950,000). There is no such provision in the trust (although as noted the trust gives each of the children $3 million in trust), and the parties seem to agree that Richard separately created the $950,000 trust. There is nothing in the trust about the $750,000 payment for the children\u2019s residence or the $750,000 payment to Jacqueline to equalize the property division, apparently because Richard believed those payments had been made. Jacqueline and the children believe otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\">All section references are to the Probate Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Under section 21320, \u201ca beneficiary may, without violating a no contest clause, apply to the court for a determination whether a particular act would be a contest provided that no determination of the merits of the petition is required.\u201d <em>(McIndoe </em>v. <em>Olivos </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 483, 487 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 689].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">A \u201ccontest\u201d is any action, including the filing of a creditor\u2019s claim, \u201cidentified in a \u2018no contest clause\u2019 as a violation of the clause.\u201d (\u00a7 21300, subd.

By its plain language, the no contest clause applies to \u201cany person\u201d (all noncharitable beneficiaries) who is or \u201cclaims under or through a beneficiary\u201d of the trust. (\u00a7\u00a7 21120 [words of an instrument are to be interpreted to give every expression some effect], 21121; <em>Sarracino </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 1, 13 [118 Cal.Rptr. 21, 529 P.2d 53].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\">She conveniently ignores the fact that her proposed creditor\u2019s claim seeks a lump sum payment for spousal support based on her presumed life expectancy (not the monthly payments provided in the marital judgment to continue only so long as she actually lives), plus the $750,000 payment provided in the judgment (to equalize the property division), which is not included in the trust (apparently because Richard believed that payment had been made). In short, the amounts sought by her creditor\u2019s claim'are for more and different benefits than those available to her under the marital judgment or the trust. Of course, the merits of Jacqueline\u2019s claim that the trust does not satisfy Richard\u2019s obligations under the marital judgments\u2014that is, the merits of her proposed creditor\u2019s claim\u2014cannot be considered on this appeal.

Accordingly, the children could have filed a creditor\u2019s claim contingent on an order or agreement voiding one or more of the trust\u2019s provisions and making it clear that then, and only then, would they attempt to enforce the concomitant provisions in the marital judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Conversely, there is nothing patently unfair about this compelled election. As we noted in <em>Tunstall v. Wells </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 554, 565 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 468], a testator has the right to grant bequests subject to any lawful conditions he may select, and it is not for us or any court to question the testator\u2019s selected approach. Unlike us, Richard knew Jacqueline and did everything required to compel her to choose between keeping the rights she had negotiated and obtained under the marital judgment or relinquishing those rights in order to gain some other benefit under his trust. It is also worth noting that, in addition to Jacqueline and her children, Richard had five adult children and one adult stepson from a prior marriage, and was contemplating a new marriage at the time of his 2002 amendment to his trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">To the extent there are other issues sprinkled throughout Jacqueline\u2019s and the children\u2019s briefs, we reject them for the reasons stated in the. text. For example, the children\u2019s claim that Richard did not intend the no contest clause to apply to a claim brought on their behalf is belied by the express language of the no contest clause: \u201cI have intentionally and with full knowledge omitted to provide for my heirs, except for such provisions, if any, as are made specifically in this trust -and my Will. If any person who is or claims under or through a beneficiary of this trust in any manner whatsoever, .directly or indirectly, contests or attacks this trust or my Will, takes any action that would frustrate the dispositive plan contemplated in this trust or my Will, conspires or cooperates with anyone attempting to contest, attack, or frustrate this trust or my Will, or takes any of the actions set forth in items (a) through (d) below of this paragraph . . . , then in that event I specifically disinherit each such Objector.\u201d By way of another- example, the no contest clause does not, as the children contend, restrict the court\u2019s jurisdiction over child support. <em>(In re Marriage of Bereznak </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1069 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 351] [children have the right to have the court hear and determine all matters that concern their welfare].) The children, through their mother or their guardian ad litem, have the absolute right to relinquish their father\u2019s testamentary gifts and fully enforce his estate\u2019s obligations under the marital judgment if it is in their best interests to do so. If the trust\u2019s bequests to the children are more generous than the benefits they could obtain under the marital judgment, we presume Jacqueline or the guardian ad litem would choose the trust over the judgment. Either way, it does not appear to us that these children will ever want for anything. <em>\" \u25a0</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
