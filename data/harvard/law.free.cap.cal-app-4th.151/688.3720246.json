The hedge fund principals took short positions in the stock and worked closely with the publisher to put out reports that were anything but the purported unbiased and objective assessment promised to subscribers. So says the targeted company in its complaint, and so aver various declarants in the papers opposing the anti-SLAPP<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motions prosecuted by the publisher and the hedge fund parties. In this scenario, and at this early stage of discovery, the trial court correctly declined to strike respondents\u2019 complaint. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">A. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">1. <em>Overstock.com, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">According to Overstock\u2019s first amended complaint, Overstock is an online closeout retailer. It offers customers an opportunity to shop online for brand name merchandise at heavily discounted prices, while offering suppliers an alternative way to distribute inventory liquidation. Overstock launched its first Web site for customers in 1999. Its stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">2. <em>The Gradient </em>Appellants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Gradient, formerly Camelback Research Alliance, Inc. (Camelback), provides analytical reporting services on publicly traded companies through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>subscription program. Its customer base of approximately 125 subscribers consists almost exclusively of large institutional investors. One product is the earnings quality analytics (EQA) report. The EQA reports rate public companies on an \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d scale, with \u201cA\u201d being the highest mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The base price to subscribe to Gradient services is approximately $25,000 to $40,000 or more per year. For the base fee customers receive access to all of Gradient\u2019s newly published reports, as well as historic reports on publicly traded companies. Additionally, subscribers are entitled to order two custom reports on a specific company, at any time. Beyond that, subscribers can pay for more custom reports. As a marketing strategy, Gradient commonly offered the service free of charge to hedge fund managers for up to several months before it invoiced the investor and required payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">3. <em>The Rocker Appellants</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Rocker and Marc Cohodes are managing members of the Rocker Partners entities. The Rocker Partners\u2019 investors include \u201cfunds of funds, university and hospital endowments, and individuals and families with substantial assets.\u201d Rocker describes Rocker Partners as a \u201cshort-biased\u201d hedge fund that invests \u201clong\u201d in public companies but also sells \u201cshort\u201d those securities which it believes are overvalued and likely to decline in price in the future. Rocker Partners is best known for its expertise in selling short.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">B. <em>Gradient\u2019s Custom Research Reports</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Demetrios Anifantis,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a former customer representative who worked for Camelback from November 2003 through November 2004, submitted a declaration in this litigation, revealing the following:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Typically a subscriber requesting a custom report would supply Gradient with information on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>company subject to the request, with instructions to consider the information and include it in the report. As well, the customer usually would instruct the appropriate personnel to generate either a positive or negative report on the subject company.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Anifantis was present on many telephone conversations between customers requesting special reports and Donn Vickrey, editor-in-chief and executive vice-president of Gradient, in which the customers would suggest that Gradient focus on the negative information the customer supplied for inclusion in the report. Often there was no doubt that the customer was asking Gradient to research and draft a negative report on the target company.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Vickrey commonly altered the report to meet the customer\u2019s expectation and request. Vickrey and the customer would discuss the report contents in detail and many times the customer would request, and the company would receive, a lower grading than the grade received in the initial version of the report. Although Vickrey retained the final editorial decisionmaking on these reports, based on his observations Anifantis concluded \u201cthere was no doubt that these reports were not the product of an unbiased, objective view of the subject companies, but rather ... the customer was paying for a report that would heavily favor the requesting customer\u2019s negative view of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Indeed it was common knowledge at Gradient that customers who wanted negative reports prepared on subject companies\u2014and who supplied negative information or guidance to Gradient in connection with a custom report\u2014 either held short positions in the securities of those companies or intended to take short positions upon publication of the reports. These negative reports on public companies were a key component in the customers\u2019 efforts to profit from the anticipated depression of the trading price of the subject companies\u2019 stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Customers would also ask Gradient not to disseminate the report to the public for a specified time period so they could obtain their position in the targeted company\u2019s stock prior to the public receiving the information. Many hedge funds requested Vickrey to delay public release of reports for three to seven days to allow the funds to take a position in the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Gradient maintained a \u201cTop Ten\u201d list of stocks that performed in accordance with the rankings attributed by Gradient in its reports. The purpose of this list was to provide potential and current customers with the stock performance tracking results in order to demonstrate Gradient\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>predict and affect stock performance. Gradient also tracked what it referred to as \u201c \u2018Blow ups by Grade.\u2019 \u201d \u201cBlow ups\u201d were companies which suffered a one-day decline of -20 percent or more in the price of their stock, or better than -25 percent over the course of a week within 12 months of publication of a report. These reports were a successful part of Gradient\u2019s promotional materials to short-selling hedge fund clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Routinely, Gradient would publish all custom reports to their entire client base, without disclosing to the clients that the reports were ordered by subscribers; that subscribers had advance copies prior to publication; or that the subscribers exerted any influence over the content of the report, including influence over the negative assessment of the company. Moreover, Gradient understood that its subscribers intended to republish the custom reports to third parties who maintained positions in the stock, as well as to government regulatory agencies. Vickrey would also permit financial journalists to review the custom reports, knowing that this exposure would provide wider public circulation of the content of the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The analysts who researched and wrote reports on publicly traded companies were recent university graduates with four-year degrees in business-related disciplines. However, when a subscriber asked about the report preparers, management instructed the sales and service representatives to tell them that the analyst team was made up of \u201c \u2018CFAs\u2019 or \u2018CPAs\u2019 \u201d although except for top management, the analysts did not have those advanced-degree designations.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">While publishing the research reports described above, James Carr Bettis and Vickrey, the founders of Gradient, were portfolio managers for a hedge fund called Pinnacle Investments Advisors, LLC (Pinnacle). Their management of a hedge fund conflicted with Vickrey\u2019s instruction that if a customer ever inquired whether Gradient invested or managed money, staff should answer in the negative. One Gradient employee in fact answered one telephone on behalf of Gradient and another on behalf of Pinnacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">C. <em>The Gradient and Rocker Appellants Focus on Overstock</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">In 2003 and 2004, Rocker Partners, LP, began requesting reports from Gradient on Overstock. In February 2004, Rocker Partners began establishing short positions in Overstock. Rocker Partners became a Gradient subscriber in July 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Rocker was in frequent telephone contact with Vickrey concerning the fund\u2019s requests for negative reports on Overstock. Anifantis was involved in the publication of three reports and participated in calls in which Vickrey and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Rocker discussed the reports in advance of publication. Vickrey sent Rocker drafts of Overstock reports prior to publication. Rocker suggested changes, including underscoring negative aspects, sometimes adding additional negative facts or suggesting a- more negative perspective than was reflected in the drafts. At Rocker\u2019s request, Gradient wrote several reports on Overstock that gave the company a grade of \u201cD\u201d or \u201cF.\u201d Based on his participation in telephone calls with Vickrey and Rocker, Anifantis concluded it appeared \u201cthat Vickrey accommodated Rocker\u2019s requests for [Gradient] to publish negative information on Overstock for the purpose of negatively influ\u00e9ncing the price of Overstock shares so that Rocker could profit from its existing or intended short positions in Overstock shares and Vickrey and [Gradient] could gain favor with Rocker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">It was apparent to Anifantis that Rocker Partners had a short position in Overstock, or intended to establish such position prior to publication of the reports. Several times Rocker requested that Vickrey delay publication of the final report for a specified period so Rocker Partners could establish their own short position.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">D. <em>Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">1. <em>The Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In August 2005 Overstock sued the Gradient and Rocker appellants. The first amended complaint alleged (1) libel and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, based on allegedly false and defamatory statements contained in the Overstock reports published by Gradient, with the collaboration and cooperation of Rocker appellants; and (2) violations of the unfair competition law (UCL),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> based on the alleged \u201cknowing and intentional dissemination of negative reports on Overstock containing false and/or misleading statements,\u201d without disclosing Rocker appellants\u2019 participation in the development of those reports, among other matters. As well, respondents Barron and Helbum, each former owners of Overstock common stock, sued Rocker appellants for violation of the state securities antiffaud laws. (Coip. Code, \u00a7 25400 et seq.) This cause of action was based on defendants\u2019 actions designed to wrongfully depress the price of Overstock\u2019s common stock for their financial benefit, as parties holding short positions in that stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">2. <em>Motions to Strike; Opposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">. Both groups of appellants moved to strike the entire complaint under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute. In opposition to these motions, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>items, Overstock submitted, the declaration of David Chidester, its senior vice-president of finance, who reviewed over 50 Gradient reports on Overstock from June 2003 through December 2005,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and identified multiple statements of fact about Overstock\u2019s accounting practices and related matters which in his opinion were \u201cprovably false.\u201d According, to Chidester, these false assertions damaged the corporation. As he explained, prior to January 1, 2005, Overstock stock traded at just over $73 per share. Thereafter the price began to drop steadily and consistently to a low of under $30. As of January 2, 2006, it was trading in the high $20 range.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Chidester further indicated that the performance of Overstock\u2019s stock was a major component of its relationship with lenders, suppliers, banks, investors, customers and the media. In November 2005 Overstock\u2019s largest factor cut the company\u2019s unsecured line of credit in half, based on the price drop in Overstock\u2019s stock. This had multiple negative ramifications, including the delayed receipt of contracted-for inventory; the need to resort to a more expensive line of credit, and an increase in the amount the factor charged Overstock\u2019s vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In addition, because its stock was not being fairly valued, Overstock had to scuttle the purchase of a company for stock, and instead pay cash, thereby causing its cash position to diminish. Similarly, with the artificially low stock price in 2005, Overstock had to forgo negotiating with at least six online retailers that had asked if Overstock were interested in acquiring them in exchange for stock. Finally, because of Overstock\u2019s undervalued stock price, it did not issue any stock in 2005 under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Not issuing stock that year deprived the company of an ability to raise capital at a reasonable cost of dilution to the shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">3. <em>Trial Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The trial court found that appellants met their burden of showing that Overstock\u2019s complaint targeted acts in furtherance of their right to free speech in connection with an issue of public interest, as required by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>425.16, subdivision (b)(1). However, the court also concluded that respondents fulfilled their burden of establishing a probability of prevailing on the merits. On the issue of actual malice, the court held that the declaration of Anifantis \u201c[was] sufficient prima facie evidence demonstrating Gradient\u2019s predecessor (Camelback) published \u2018special reports\u2019 in reckless disregard of the truth . . . .\u201d And, although the court determined that Gradient\u2019s reports were \u201cliberally couched in terms of opinion,\u201d it reasoned that the reports \u201cimply that Overstock intentionally misstated financial metrics to artificially inflate its earnings reports and engaged in a variety of accounting improprieties that could be construed as statements of fact. The reports are not written in the form of loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language, but are serious in tone and content.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.) This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">A. <em>Introduction; Burdens of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Resolving the merits of a section 425:16 motion involves a two-part analysis, concentrating initially on whether the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity within the meaning of the statute and, if it does, proceeding secondly to whether the plaintiff can establish a probability of prevailing on the merits. <em>(Ampex Corp. </em>v. <em>Cargle </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1576 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 863].) We review de novo the trial court\u2019s ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion. <em>(Carver v. Bonds </em>(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 328, 342 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Here we bypass the initial inquiry because everyone agrees that the first hurdle in obtaining anti-SLAPP relief has been met. Thus we focus solely on whether respondents have made a prima facie showing of facts which, if credited by the trier of fact, would sustain a favorable judgment. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The filing of a notice of motion under the anti-SLAPP statute generally will stay all discovery in the action. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (g).) Nonetheless, a plaintiff opposing an anti-SLAPP motion cannot rely on allegations in the complaint, but must set forth evidence that would be admissible at trial. <em>(Ampex Corp. v. Cargle, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1576.) Precisely because the statute (1) permits early intervention in lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that implicate free speech concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct discovery, the plaintiff\u2019s burden of establishing a probability of prevailing is not high: We do not weigh credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the evidence. Instead, we accept as true all evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant\u2019s evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff\u2019s submission as a matter of law. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Only a cause of action that lacks \u201ceven minimal merit\u201d constitutes a SLAPP. <em>(Navellier v. Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">We review each cause of action below.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">B. <em>Libel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Appellants are adamant that the trial court wrongly determined that Overstock established a probability of prevailing on its defamation claim. First we review the general principles pertinent to the libel claims. Next, we address Gradient appellants\u2019 arguments that the statements at issue cannot reasonably be viewed as implying provably false factual assertions and in any event Overstock did not introduce prima facie evidence of actual malice as required by <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 84 S.Ct. 710]. Finally, we tackle Rocker appellants\u2019 assertions that Overstock did not set forth evidence of actual malice or that any of the allegedly false statements in the Gradient reports were attributable to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">1. <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Libel, a form of defamation \u201cis a false and unprivileged publication by writing . . . which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which . . . has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 44, subd. (a), 45.) A statement that is defamatory without the need for explanatory matter such as an inducement, innuendo or other extrinsic fact, constitutes \u201ca libel on its face.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 45a.) Defamatory language that is not libelous on its face is not actionable unless the plaintiff proves special damages as a proximate result of the libel. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Where, as here, the plaintiff is a limited public figure,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he or she must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the allegedly defamatory statements were made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity. <em>(New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at pp. 279-280; <em>Ampex Corp. v. Cargle, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1577-1578.) In the context of an anti-SLAPP suit motion, the limited public figure who sues for defamation must establish a probability that he or she can produce such clear and convincing evidence. <em>(Ampex Corp. v. Cargle, supra, </em>at p. 1578.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>In <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 1, 17 [111 L.Ed.2d 1, 110 S.Ct. 2695] <em>(Milkovich), </em>the United States Supreme Court moved away from the notion that defamatory statements categorized as opinion as opposed to fact enjoy wholesale protection under the First Amendment. Significantly, the court recognized that \u201cexpressions of \u2018opinion\u2019 may often imply an assertion of objective fact.\u201d <em>(Milkovich, </em>at p. 18.) The court went on to explain: \u201cIf a speakers says, \u2018In my opinion John Jones is a liar,\u2019 he implies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion that Jones told an untruth. Even if the speaker states the facts upon which he bases his opinion, if those facts are either incorrect or incomplete, or if his assessment of them is erroneous, the statement may still imply a false assertion of fact. Simply couching such statements in terms of opinion does not dispel these implications ...\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 18-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Thus a false statement of fact, whether expressly stated or implied from an expression of opinion, is actionable. <em>(Milkovich, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 19.) The key is not parsing whether a published statement is fact or opinion, but \u201cwhether a reasonable fact finder could conclude the published statement declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact.\u201d <em>(Franklin v. Dynamic Details, Inc. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 375, 385 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 429], citing <em>Milkovich, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 19, among other authority.) And, when deciding whether a statement communicates or implies a provably false assertion of fact, we use a totality of the circumstances test. <em>(Franklin </em>v. <em>Dynamic Details, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 385.) This entails examining the language of the statement. \u201c \u2018For words to be defamatory, they must be understood in a defamatory sense . . .. [f] Next, the context in which the statement was made must be considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 385-386, quoting <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Herald Examiner </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 254, 260-261 [228 Cal.Rptr. 206, 721 P.2d 87].) The contextual analysis requires that courts examine the nature and full content of the particular communication, as well as the knowledge and understanding of the audience targeted by the publication. <em>(Baker v. Los Angeles Herald Examiner, supra, </em>at p. 261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">2. <em>The Arguments of Gradient Appellants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">a. <em>The Allegedly False Statements Concerning Accounting Irregularities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Overstock has accused Gradient of repeatedly making statements in its reports that state or imply that the company intentionally falsified its accounting reports in order to defraud investors. According to Chidester, effective July 1, 2003, due to a change in its operations that resulted in the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>assuming an inventory risk, it began accounting for revenue received in fulfillment partner transactions on a gross basis as opposed to a net basis. Its outside auditor determined that the change was proper and met the appropriate criteria set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Nonetheless, Gradient relentlessly attacked Overstock\u2019s revenue recognition accounting. For example, the August 26, 2004 EQA alert stated: \u201c[T]he most important update in this <em>Alert </em>is new evidence indicating that <em>there is literally \u2018no there there\u2019 with respect [to] OSTK\u2019s claimed motivation for changing its revenue recognition model. As a consequence, we believe that it is misstating revenues through a substantive violation of </em>GAAP.I\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Gradient also explained its reasoning: \u201cAs -we show, <em>the amount of risk borne by OSTK is virtually nil and, as a consequence, we believe that its use of gross method revenue recognition violates the intent (if not the form) of GAAP.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The report reiterates: <em>\u201c[W]e do not believe that OSTK\u2019s accounting choice is compliant with current accounting practice. </em>In this regard, <em>we believe that the company has materially overstated its sales since July 1, 2003 and that its assertions about the economic activity of the firm are misleading. A </em>further concern is the likelihood that the company\u2019s sole motivation for this change was the desire to report higher revenues\u2014 presumably to fit the company\u2019s story with respect to the projected growth in and level of revenues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Similarly, the September 24, 2004 EQA bulletin asserted that \u201cOSTK\u2019s change in revenue recognition policy was a highly questionable move,\u201d indicating that the reporters \u201cdon\u2019t believe that OSTK\u2019s claimed reasons for the change are valid or defensible. Rather, <em>our view is that the company changed its revenue policy in order to drive its share price higher (and give Mr. </em>Bymet[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] <em>a chance to meet his seemingly unattainable sales goal of $2 billion by 2006).\u201d </em>Toward the end of the report Gradient wraps it up: <em>\u201cThis is the type of accounting policy choice that we believe the SEC would be very interested in looking at.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Further, the November 3, 2004 research report expressed Gradient\u2019s <em>\u201cprofessional opinion that any argument to the effect that gross revenue </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>recognition is 'preferred\u2019 or \u2018appropriate\u2019 is complete balderdash. </em>Nothing more than searching for answers in the market for excuses.\u201d Gradient also sought to tie the resignation of Overstock\u2019s chief financial officer (CFO)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to the change in revenue recognition practices: <em>\u201cThe contemporaneous nature of (1) the change in revenue recognition model and (2) the resignation of the CFO was (and still is) a significant concern.\u201d </em>And in an appendix Gradient repeated its belief \u201cthat the company is violating GAAP due to the use of gross method revenue recognition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Additionally, in its February 4, 2005 research report Gradient reported: \u201cWe have also argued that a change in revenue recognition was implemented in H2 2003 in an effort to bolster the company\u2019s efforts to drive revenues and share price even higher\u2014though management has vehemently denied our theory in regards to its revenue recognition change. Although we strongly disagree with the revenue recognition change, we avoid further discussion of the issue in this report. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">That report also stated that Overstock\u2019s cash flow was artificially boosted in 2004 and its \u201coperating cash flow was severely overstated by float cash in 2004.\u201d This item was substantially repeated in seven EQA \u201cgreatest concerns\u201d listings issued thereafter, through April 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">1. <em>The </em>Assertions: Gradient appellants insist that the statements are nonactionable speech because they are either (1) \u201copinions based on fully disclosed fact\u201d; (2) \u201crational interpretations of ambiguous sources\u201d; (3) \u201cstatements embodying complex and debatable technical judgments\u201d; or (4) \u201cstatements too inexact or subjective to be proven true or false.\u201d Overstock counters that the contested material implies defamatory statements of fact that can be objectively verified and as such these statements are actionable as provably false statements of fact. We think Overstock has the better argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">2. <em>The Publications Can Be Understood as Implying Defamatory Statements: </em>As the trial court pointed out, the Gradient reports were \u201cliberally couched in terms of opinion.\u201d However, statements in the publications do not attain constitutional protection simply because they are sprinkled with words to the effect that something does or does not \u201cappear\u201d to be thus and so; or because they are framed as being \u201cin our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>opinion\u201d or as a matter of \u201cconcern.\u201d We line up with Division One of this appellate district: \u201cIn the same manner that the <em>Milkovich </em>court rejected the concept that preceding an assertion of defamatory fact by the language \u2018in my opinion,\u2019 should insulate the speaker from a defamation action, we reject the notion that merely couching an assertion of a defamatory fact in cautionary language such as \u2018apparently\u2019 or \u2018some sources say\u2019 or even putting it in the form of a question, necessarily defuses the impression that the speaker is communicating an actual fact. [][] The use of interrogative language alone does not entitle statements to constitutional protection where, as here, they otherwise can be understood as implying defamatory fact.\u201d <em>(Weller v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 991, 1004 [283 Cal.Rptr. 644], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Without question, the reports reasonably could be understood as implying that Overstock changed its accounting methodology in order to boost revenue figures artificially; the change was a substantive violation of GAAP that led to continuing material overstatements of revenue; the company knowingly inflated its cash flow; and the president and CFO resigned as a result of these transgressions. In other words, Overstock was \u201ccooking the books\u201d and manipulating accounting procedures to boost the price of its stock. These implications are strengthened by the sheer flurry of negative reports, as well as by the stylistic emphasis placed on key phrases. And, as we discuss below, Chidester presented evidence of the falsity of these implications. Thus, the publications reasonably could be understood as implying provably false assertions of fact. <em>(Milkovich, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Gradient nonetheless touts the fact that the reports ran a disclaimer that the information in them \u201creflects our judgment at the time of original publication and is subject to change without notice.\u201d But wrapping an article around a disclaimer that the contents represented a \u201cjudgment\u201d does not conclusively resolve the dispositive question\u2014whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the publication declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact. <em>(Ruiz </em>v. <em>Harbor View Community Assn. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1456, 1471 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 133].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Gradient also urges that its \u201ccritical opinion\u201d of Overstock\u2019s accounting change was based on nondefamatory, disclosed facts. However, Chidester refuted the truth of certain disclosed factual bases concerning the impropriety of Overstock\u2019s financials, namely that it bore no meaningful inventory risk; the primary causes for return are causes other than buyer\u2019s remorse; and the company did little more than provide a software interface for the majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>returns.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Even where the speaker states facts upon which he or she bases an opinion, if the facts are incorrect or incomplete, or if the speaker\u2019s assessment of them is erroneous, the statement can still imply an actionable statement. <em>(Milkovich, supra, </em>497 U.S. at pp. 18-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">3. <em>The Context and Tenor of the Publications Do Not Negate the Impression that the Defamatory Statements Were Assertions of Facts: </em>Taking up Gradient appellants\u2019 invitation to employ the totality of the circumstances test and examine the \u201c \u2018full content of the communication\u2019 \u201d <em>(Franklin </em>v. <em>Dynamic Details, Inc., supra, </em>116 Cal.App.4th at p. 389), we first look at these statements in their broad context. The Gradient publications are \u201cResearch Reports\u201d and EQA bulletins, alerts, and \u201cGreatest Concerns\u201d lists. Gradient characterizes its reports, alerts and bulletins as presenting the firm\u2019s \u201cunbiased, independent and objective analysis of a company\u2019s earnings quality\u201d and tells subscribers who ask that they are prepared by professional certified public accountants and financial analysts. The tone and content is serious, and a typical subscriber would take the materials seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">These publications are nothing like the commentary appearing in a financial newsletter that criticized two advertisements published by a mutual fund, and survived an action for libel. <em>(Morningstar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 676, 680 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 547].) The advertisements in that case boasted the performance of the mutual fund in five different categories. The article, entitled \u201cLies, Damn Lies, and Fund Advertisements,\u201d sported a drawing of a smiling court jester with the word \u201cCommentary\u201d above it, and the name of the author. This context forewarned the reader that what followed was one person\u2019s opinion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 681, 693.) Moreover, the reviewing court found the title to be \u201c \u2018rhetorical hyperbole\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018imaginative expression,\u2019 \u201d the flavor of which was not lost on the sophisticated readers. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 690-691.) A reasonable fact finder would not conclude that the published statements implied a probably false factual assertion. Rather, the title and text suggested that the mutual fund manipulated statistics\u2014which it did not deny\u2014not that it lied. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Moreover, Gradient holds itself out to its subscribers as having specialized knowledge in the areas of financial accounting and issues of earnings quality. Its business was built around developing reader confidence to rely on its opinions as reflecting the truth about Overstock and other frequently targeted companies. (See <em>Wilbanks v. Wolk </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 883, 904 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 497].) Indeed, Gradient tracked its ability to move the price of a stock based on its reports, and used this tracking information to promote itself with hedge fund clients and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Gradient also asserts that the readers would understand that the reported data involved questions that were inherently technical, complex, subjective and debatable, raising reasonably debatable questions of interpretation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For example, Gradient characterizes one of its reports as <em>a disagreement </em>between Gradient analysts and Overstock management about how to interpret the change in Overstock\u2019s revenue recognition policy, which amounted to a technical issue for which there was no right or wrong answer. Gradient is wrong. There is a right or wrong answer to whether in multiple reports Gradient made false statements of fact that are objectively verifiable; and provably false, for example, that Overstock\u2019s accounting violated GAAP, with the implication that Overstock falsified its financials to mislead investors. That is what this lawsuit is all about. <em>Jefferson Sch. Dist. R-1 v. Moody\u2019s Investor\u2019s, supra, </em>175 F.3d 848, is readily distinguishable on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">4. <em>Evidence of Falsity. </em>Chidester declared that Overstock\u2019s. revenue-recognition accounting is dictated by GAAP; approved by outside auditors; reflects the substantial inventory risk the company has with respect to fulfillment partner sales transactions; and is not driven by any effort to increase the company\u2019s reported revenues. Further, the accounting change from net to gross revenue recognition w\u00e1s evaluated by outside auditors according to criteria set forth by the FASB, and the auditor\u2019s national office determined that the change was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">With respect to the issue of operating cash flow, Chidester stated that the accounting pronouncement FAS 95, which would be of common knowledge to any certified public accountant, describes cash flow statements and defines operating cash flows as \u201coperating cash inflow minus operating cash outflow.\u201d The company\u2019s statements of operating cash flow derive directly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>that definition and are proper in all respects. Chidester concluded that \u201cGradient\u2019s repeated implication that Overstock engaged in accounting irregularities in reporting its operating cash flows for 2004 is therefore also provably false . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Chidester declared he was familiar with and responsible for the company\u2019s financial statements and accounting. Taking the evidence in his declaration as true, it was sufficient to establish a probability that Overstock would prevail in demonstrating the falsity of Gradient\u2019s assertions that the company engaged in accounting irregularities, with respect to revenue recognition accounting and operating cash flow, and the implication that it did so to mislead investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">b. <em>Purchase of Bulk Diamonds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In late 2004, an entity specializing in the diamond industry purchased bulk diamonds at below market price on behalf of Overstock, with funds from Overstock. For GAAP purposes, under an FASB interpretation, the entity that purchased the diamonds is defined as a variable interest entity (VIE). Per the accounting rules, once an entity is determined to meet the definition of a VIE, its financial statements are consolidated with the company with which it transacted the particular business matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In a series of reports Gradient attacked the structure of the transaction, in effect accusing Overstock of acting improperly in selecting a VIE to purchase diamonds. For example, Gradient \u201cbelieved\u201d that \u201cthe use of the VIE is likely to reflect the use of clever accounting\u201d and will allow Overstock to <em>\u201creport the top line benefits of the jewelry business without reporting 100% of the unit\u2019s </em>losses.\u201d In another report the firm indicated Overstock would only have to report 50 percent of the VIE\u2019s losses and that it believed <em>\u201cthe use of the VIE lacks economic substance and is likely motivated purely by cosmetic earnings management.\u201d </em>Similar statements were repeated in four other publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Chidester declared that these statements were false because all components of the VIE\u2019s financial statements would be incorporated into and reported within Overstock\u2019s financial statements; the use of the VIE is required and proper under the accounting rules in all respects; and considerations of \u201c \u2018cosmetic earnings management\u2019 \u201d did not play any role in structuring the transaction. With this declaration Overstock established its prima facie case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Again, Gradient criticizes Chidester\u2019s declaration as conclusory and inadmissible, but does not challenge the trial court decision overruling its objections to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">c. <em>Stock Buy-back Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Gradient also assailed Overstock\u2019s stock buy-back program in a number of publications, calling it ill advised, and estimating the company was \u201con the hook to pay out an additional $13.9 million (or deliver shares of an equivalent amount) at the market price on May 3, 2005. While OSTK\u2019s share price could rise or fall (further) before any settlement, we do not believe that it is appropriate to gamble with shareholder funds in this fashion.\u201d In a later publication, Gradient asserted that \u201c[t]he risk exposure is bom by OSTK, leading to further dilution if OSTK shares continue to underperform.\u201d Still later it announced that \u201cthe plan has backfired thus far, as OSTK\u2019s share price has fallen well below the strike price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Again, Chidester declared that the assertions that Overstock subjected shareholders to a substantial risk and was on the hook for millions of dollars were false. He explained that the total amount Overstock could be required to pay out under the program was fixed from inception and publicly reported; there was no basis for the claim that the company would or could have any additional payout obligation; and nothing in the company\u2019s public filings implied that additional cash would have to be paid. Indeed, Gradient later admitted that the assertion that Overstock was on the hook for millions of dollars was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Gradient reverts to its refrains that its \u201copinion\u201d was couched with a sprinkling of subjective words such as \u201cbelieve\u201d and \u201cestimate\u201d and that the gist of its comments remained true even if the $13.9 million \u201cestimate\u201d was inaccurate. Wrapping an assertion of defamatory fact or an implied defamatory statement around these terms does not mitigate the impression that the reports, taken as a whole, imply that Overstock put its shareholders in harm\u2019s way by implementing a stock buy-back program. (See <em>Weller v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1003-1005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">d. <em>Gradient\u2019s \u201cGist\u201d Argument Is Not Persuasive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Quoting from the November 3, 2004 research report, Gradient maintains that the overarching theme of the entire series of articles, viewed over time, was its repeated mantra of a \u201cfatal flaw\u201d in Overstock\u2019s business model, namely the \u201cexceptionally high rate of customer chum\u201d that left the company with \u201cno choice but to spend ever increasing amounts for customer acquisition, or see its sales falter.\u201d Due to this fatal flaw, Gradient concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>company\u2019s stock was overvalued and a bad investment. Citing <em>Carver v. Bonds, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th 328, Gradient reasons that because Overstock does not challenge the \u201cfatal flaw\u201d commentary, which it posits is the \u201cgist\u201d of the 50-plus articles, the articles are constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Carver </em>does not help Gradient. There, a chiropractor challenged a single article published by a newspaper. The gist of the article was that the plaintiff exaggerated his relationships with famous athletes to market his practice. Allegations to that effect were substantially true. The one allegedly false statement\u2014that the plaintiff boasted of a 100 percent success rate\u2014\u201cwas at most a minor instance\u201d of the type of behavior others reported at length in the article and would not have affected the reader\u2019s view of him. <em>(Carver </em>v. <em>Bonds, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 359.) This minor error regarding a passing reference to a boast could not sustain a defamation claim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 357-359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In contrast, Gradient\u2019s allegations of fraudulent accounting, inappropriate gambling with shareholder funds and accusations concerning Overstock\u2019s use of a VIE do not constitute a single straying from the main story line, nor are they minor factual errors. Rather, these critiques were repeatedly put before readers and were part and parcel of Gradient\u2019s ongoing negative coverage and assessment of the company. More to the point, it is one thing to assault a company\u2019s business model and quite another to assault the company\u2019s leadership as committing accounting fraud, gambling with shareholder funds, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">e. <em>Malice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Limited public purpose figures who sue for defamation, such as Overstock respondents, \u201cmust establish a probability that they can produce clear and convincing evidence that the allegedly defamatory statements were made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity. [Citations.] ... [][]... [f] Actual malice may be proved by circumstantial or direct evidence. [Citation.] However, we will not infer actual malice solely from evidence of ill will, personal spite or bad motive. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ampex Corp. v.

Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 244, 257-258 [208 Cal.Rptr. 137, 690 P.2d 610], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The trial court held that the Anifantis declaration constituted prima facie evidence demonstrating that Gradient\u2019s predecessor (Camelback) published special reports on Overstock in reckless disregard of the truth. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The evidence showed that Gradient\u2019s way of doing business was to allow customers such as Rocker appellants to order custom reports; provide information to Gradient on the target company and request that it be used; instruct the principals to produce a positive or negative report and discuss the report in detail with them. Gradient in turn frequently altered the report to meet customer requests and expectations. The special reports were not the product of an unbiased view of the target companies. Instead, the customer paid for a report that would heavily favor its negative view of the target. Nonetheless, Gradient advertised its reports as independent and objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Gradient tracked the stock performance of the- reported companies, listing the \u201cTop Ten\u201d whose stock performed in accordance with the rankings given by Gradient. An aspect of Gradient\u2019s marketing strategy was to show potential and existing customers the results of this tracking in order to demonstrate its ability to predict and affect stock performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In keeping with the publisher/customer relationship described above, Rocker appellants requested reports on Overstock that contained more negative information, or emphasized specific negative facts and downplayed positive facts. Gradient knew that Rocker Partners was \u201ca devoted short.\u201d During prepublication calls, Rocker frequently requested more negative treatment of Overstock than was reflected in the report, or suggested augmentation or strengthening of a negative aspect. He received drafts in advance and suggested changes underscoring negative items, sometimes requesting adding additional negative facts or a perspective making facts appear more negative. Anifantis noted specific language that ended up in final disseminated versions of reports after Rocker requested that Vickrey include such language. Rocker also on several occasions requested that Gradient hold off on publication for a period so he could take a position in the stock. It was common knowledge that Rocker wanted Gradient to publish frequent, negative reports on Overstock and that he- spoke frequently with Vickrey about this matter. Anifantis indicated that based on telephone calls he participated in with Rocker and Vickrey, it appeared that Vickrey accommodated Rocker\u2019s requests to publish negative information for the purpose of negatively influencing the price of Overstock shares so Rocker could profit from short positions in Overstock shares and Gradient could gain favor with Rocker.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>This picture establishes Overstock\u2019s minimum burden defending against the anti-SLAPP motions. It shows that Gradient colluded with Rocker to publish reports that met the negative expectations of Rocker in order to please Rocker and drive down the value of Overstock\u2019s stock. (See <em>Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Consumers Union ofU.S. </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 330 F.3d 1110, 1135 [evidence that the defendant sought to produce a predetermined result in a product test\u2014in other words, that it rigged the test\u2014demonstrated awareness of the probable falsity of the negative product rating and was sufficient to preclude summary judgment on the issue of malice].) This model of doing business resulted in reports with defamatory statements and implications about the company\u2019s accounting practices, stock buy-back program and diamond investment efforts. Through the company\u2019s form 10-Q filings and conference calls held during 2003, Gradient was repeatedly advised, contrary to its false statements, that the change in revenue recognition did not violate GAAP. Similarly, there was no basis for the accusations about Overstock being on the hook for additional funds and gambling with shareholders\u2019 money with respect to the stock buy-back program, or for implying that Overstock improperly used a VIE to purchase diamonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Gradient appellants insist that unless the dots can be connected between \u201cthe allegedly Rocker-supplied statements identified by Anifantis\u201d and \u201cthe allegedly false and defamatory statements identified by Chidester,\u201d Overstock cannot satisfy the malice requirement. The point here is not that Rocker supplied the specific false statements and implications discussed in this opinion, but that the business model and way of doing, promoting and retaining business hinged on producing biased reports that were rigged to please the customer\u2019s expectations. In producing those biased reports, clients such as Rocker, who want a preconceived result from the reports, provide information to Gradient, ask for changes, suggest amplifying negative aspects, plot the timing of the release of reports with Gradient, again, all \u00e1s a matter of course. This model supports an inference of malice, namely that Gradient relied on information from biased sources, made statements in its reports without doing the necessary investigation and due diligence, and made statements with defamatory implication to achieve a preconceived result. This dynamic, described in detail by Anifantis, suffices to show a reasonable probability that the statements discussed above were made with actual malice. That Gradient promoted itself as independent and objective when the opposite was true cinches our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Gradient appellants also maintain that the publisher\u2019s purported financial interest in lowering. Overstock\u2019s share price is not probative of malice because malice cannot be inferred alone from evidence of ill will or intention to injure. But again Gradient misses the point. There was no independent ill will against, or desire to injure, Overstock. The malice is in the very business model and practices that preordain negative reports, and provides probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>evidence that Gradient acted in reckless disregard of the truth in making the false statements and implications that it did. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">3. <em>The Arguments of Rocker Appellants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Rocker appellants first assert that because the statements in the Gradient reports that were attributed to them by Anifantis were not alleged to have been false or otherwise are nonactionable, Overstock has no libel claim against them. But Overstock\u2019s libel claim is not based on any particular statement that Rocker appellants insisted be included in the reports. Rather, it stems from their involvement in the publication of the reports on Overstock that included defamatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">One who takes a responsible part in a publication of defamatory material may be held liable for the publication. <em>(Shively </em>v. <em>Bozanich </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1230, 1245 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d 676].) Thus, participating in publication of an article as editor can subject a person to liability. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Calder </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 128, 134 [187 Cal.Rptr. 825].) However, liability will not attach to a business manager of a newspaper published in a foreign language he or she did not understand, where there was no evidence the manager exerted control over editorial staff and it was undisputed he or she had no advance knowledge of the preparation or contents of the defamatory articles. <em>(Sakuma v. Zellerbach Paper Co. </em>(1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 309, 321-322 [77 P.2d 313].) Nor is financial contribution to a political campaign a sufficient hook for liability where the contributor is not involved in the preparation, review or publication of the allegedly defamatory campaign literature. <em>(Matson v. Dvorak </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 549 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 880].)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Rocker appellants maintain that Overstock did not produce any evidence that they played a responsible part in the publication of any of. the Gradient reports. We disagree. The evidence adduced showed that Rocker appellants initiated a negative campaign against Overstock in 2003, before becoming a Gradient subscriber, soliciting frequent, negative reports on the company. Rocker was in regular telephone contact with Vickrey concerning the substance of the reports and frequently requested that the reports contain more negative information or emphasize negative facts. He received and reviewed the Overstock reports in advance of publication, exercised editorial influence over the substantive content of the reports, and controlled the timing of publication. With this evidence Overstock made a prima facie showing that Rocker appellants played a responsible part in the publication of the subject reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Rocker appellants also dispute that there was evidence \u25a0 to support a showing of actual malice. Again, we disagree. The exercise of editorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>influence, the presence of a strong financial interest in driving down the price of Overstock\u2019s shares, and the control of timing of publication all play a circumstantial role in our analysis. Moreover, by virtue of Rocker appellants\u2019 very involvement in the preparation of the Gradient reports on Overstock, they had direct knowledge that, contrary to Gradient\u2019s public assertion that their reports were independent and objective, in reality the publications were subject to manipulation by interested parties. From this collusion and knowledge one reasonably could infer that Rocker appellants had reason to doubt the reports.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">C. <em>Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">To establish a prima facie case of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) an economic relationship between the plaintiff and a third party, with a probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of this relationship; (3) intentional and wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, designed to interfere with or disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption or interference; and (5) economic harm to the plaintiff as a proximate result of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct. <em>(Sole Energy Co. </em>v. <em>Petrominerals Corp. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 212, 241 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 798].) A plaintiff\u2019s burden includes pleading and proving \u201cthat the defendant not only knowingly interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s expectancy, but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.\u201d <em>(Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 376, 393 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 436, 902 P.2d 740].) We consider an act independently wrongful \u201cif it is proscribed by some constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common law, or other determinable legal standard.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1159 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Both sets of appellants argue that if Overstock does not prevail on its libel claim, it cannot succeed on its intentional interference claim, since liability for that tort cannot rest on mere expressions of opinion to a third party. (See <em>Momingstar, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 696.) We have dispelled this concern in part II.B., <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>D. <em>UCL Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The UCL cause of action alleged: \u201cGradient\u2019s knowing and intentional dissemination of negative reports on Overstock containing false and/or misleading statements concerning Overstock, and without disclosing the input of the Rocker Defendants . . . , and Rocker\u2019s knowing and intentional false statements concerning Overstock, constitute unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices by the Defendants . . . , in violation of Business and Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200, <em>et seq. </em>and \u00a7\u00a7 17500, <em>et seq.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Appellants repeat their unsuccessful arguments that this claim must fall with the faulty libel claim. Gradient appellants also suggest that this cause is limited to the defamatory reports, but, as can be seen from the above quote, it is not. They also attack the UCL claim as improperly requesting injunctive relief amounting to an unconstitutional prior restraint. But Overstock is not seeking to enjoin speech; it is seeking to enjoin unfair business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In its reply brief, Gradient appellants contend that Overstock did not present any evidence that the business practices at issue\u2014such as failing to disclose Rocker\u2019s participation in the reports and claiming to be unbiased and objective\u2014were likely to deceive a reasonable consumer, citing <em>Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1267 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Overstock submitted evidence that, unbeknownst to Gradient subscribers, Rocker colluded with Gradient in preparing the negative,\" defamatory reports about Overstock and Gradient falsely held itself out as publishing unbiased and objective reports. Unquestionably a reasonable implication of this evidence is that the Gradient subscribers would likely be deceived by the nondisclosure and fals\u00e9hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Rocker appellants further take umbrage with the trial court\u2019s ruling that this cause of action \u201cdoes not involve a \u2018securities transaction.\u2019 (See <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Ziasun Technologies, Inc. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th <em>777, </em>788 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 522].)\u201d (Capitalization omitted.) This ruling on a substantive point of law was handed down in conjunction with the trial court\u2019s order overruling Gradient\u2019s demurrer to two causes in the first amended complaint, not as part of the order denying the special motions to strike. However, since Rocker appellants also raised this issue in their motion to strike, we address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The plaintiffs in <em>Bowen </em>were investors who alleged they were defrauded by a pyramid or Ponzi scheme orchestrated by the company from which they purchased stock. The reviewing court held that securities transactions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>exempt from the UCL, reasoning that Business and Professions Code section 17200 mirrors the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41 et seq.); historically the FTC has not viewed that legislation as, reaching securities transactions; and many other states considering whether securities violations were actionable under their consumer protection statutes concluded they were not. <em>(Bowen v. Ziasun Technologies, Inc., supra, </em>116 Cal.App.4th at pp. 788-790.) Whether one agrees with <em>Bowen </em>or not,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> its holding that securities transactions are not covered under the UCL bars lawsuits based on deceptive conduct in the sale and purchase of securities, nothing more. <em>Overstock\u2019s claims do not arise from any stock transactions between the parties. </em>Rather, they arise from the allegedly defamatory reports published by Gradient, Gradient\u2019s business practices in producing such reports and Rocker appellants\u2019 role in this wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Rocker appellants argue nonetheless that transactions more broadly relating to the securities market are also beyond the reach of the UCL, turning to, among other authority, <em>Spinner Corp. v. Princeville Development Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 849 F.2d 388, which the <em>Bowen </em>court found instructive <em>(Bowen </em>v. <em>Ziasun Technologies, Inc., supra, </em>116 Cal.App.4th at p. 788). In <em>Spinner, </em>the plaintiff launched a hostile tender offer against Princeville. During litigation brought by Spinner to invalidate certain antitakeover provisions that Princeville had adopted earlier, Princeville learned that confidential information had been provided to Spinner. Princeville counterclaimed for deceit under Hawaii\u2019s \u201cbaby FTC Act.\u201d The question for the Ninth Circuit was whether the act applied to conduct \u201cordinarily associated with securities transactions.\u201d <em>(Spinner Corp., supra, </em>at p. 390.) Concluding that the Hawaii consumer protection statute did not encompass such transactions, it relied in part on a provision directing that the statute \u201cbe construed in accordance with the judicial interpretation of similar federal antitrust statutes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 390-391.) The Hawaii statute was nearly identical to a provision of the FTC Act, and that act had not been applied in a securities context since 1923. <em>(Spinner Corp., </em>at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In contrast, the California UCL contains no directive to interpret our consumer protection statute consistently with the FTC Act, and is thus distinguished from the Hawaii law on this basis. (See <em>Roskind v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 345, 355, fn. 8 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 258], further holding that California\u2019s UCL \u201chas always been given a broad and sweeping ambit by our Legislature and our Supreme Court. [Citations.] The UCL contains no language supporting an exclusion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>securities, and under the plain language of the UCL, we cannot create such an exclusion.\u201d) Indeed the sweeping language of the UCL is intended \u201c \u2018to permit tribunals to enjoin on-going wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 181 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Although, as Overstock points out, <em>Roskind </em>addressed the ultimate question of whether federal securities law preempts a UCL claim relating to securities transactions, the court began its analysis with a review of the broad precedents underpinning the UCL. It concluded that the UCL potentially <em>could </em>provide a remedy for the securities violation at issue if not preempted by federal law in that context. <em>(Roskind v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., supra, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at pp. 350-351.) This ruling thus was integral to its determination that federal securities law <em>did not </em>preempt the plaintiff\u2019s UCL claim. <em>(Roskind, supra, </em>at pp. 352-356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Rocker appellants also charge that Overstock lacks standing to bring its UCL claim because it did not plead it \u201csuffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of\u2019 the alleged misconduct as required by Business and Professions Code sections 17204 and 17535. Their theory is that Overstock was not deceived by the Gradient reports and therefore it is relying on a \u201c \u2018fraud on the market\u2019 \u201d theory \u201cas a substitute for actual inducement in pleading proximate causation.\u201d This approach, they claim, has been roundly rejected by courts in other states applying their consumer protection statutes with similar proximate cause language. First, to state the obvious, the authority cited is from other jurisdictions, and does not construe or apply the broad mandate of the California UCL. Second, each is a consumer class action involving false advertising claims in which the defendant is accused of artificially inflating the price of a consumer commodity. <em>(Oliveira </em>v. <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>(2002) 201 Ill.2d 134 [776 N.E.2d 151, 155-156, 267 Ill.Dec. 14] [gasoline]; <em>Weinberg v. Sun Co., Inc. </em>(2001) 565 Pa. 612 [777 A.2d 442, 443-445] [same]; <em>New Jersey Citizen Action v. Schering </em>(N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div. 2003) 367 N.J.Super. 8 [842 A.2d 174, 176] [allergy medication].) Thus, unlike the present case, the harm to the plaintiffs in the cited cases stemmed from the effect of the defendants\u2019 actions on the consumer market. Third, Overstock\u2019s purported damage does not stem from reliance on, or deception by, the Gradient reports. Rather it has pleaded \u201cunlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices\u201d resulting in diminution in value of its assets and decline in its market capitalization and other vested interests. This meets the statutory requirement of \u201cinjury in fact\u201d resulting from defendants\u2019 misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>E. <em>Claim for Violation of Corporations Code Section 25400</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Respondents Barron and Helbum, former owners of Overstock common stock, alleged that Rocker appellants engaged in concerted wrongful actions designed to wrongfully depress the price of Overstock\u2019s common stock for their financial benefit. This cause was brought under California\u2019s securities antifraud statute, Corporations Code section 25400. This statute \u201cprovides that it is unlawful in this state to make false statements or engage in specified fraudulent transactions which affect the market for a security when done for the purpose of inducing purchase or sale of the security or raising or depressing the price of the security. In short, it prohibits market manipulation.\u201d <em>(Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1040 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 968 P.2d 539], fn. omitted.) Corporations Code section 25500 creates a remedy for buyers or sellers of stock damaged by the forms of market manipulation banned by section 25400.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Rocker appellants argue that Overstock cannot prevail on this claim because the company has not submitted any evidence that they made a \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d statement or had \u201creasonable ground to believe\u201d any such statement was false (Corp. Code, \u00a7 25400, subd. (d)), or that they traded in a manner which created a misleading market in Overstock\u2019s shares <em>(id., </em>subds. (a), (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">As laid out in part \u00dc.B., <em>ante, </em>Overstock provided prima facie evidence that Rocker appellants willfully participated in a wrongful scheme to depress the price of Overstock\u2019s stock by, among other things, participating in the development and publication of false statements concerning Overstock; concealing their role in deciding the tenor and content of the reports, giving lie to the assertion that the reports were independent and objective analyses; and delaying publication to facilitate establishing a short position in the stock. The trial court properly denied Rocker appellants\u2019 special motion to strike this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">F. <em>Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Wrapping up their case against Overstock, Rocker appellants are convinced Overstock cannot demonstrate probability of success on any cause of action for want of establishing causation of any damages. First they reiterate that there is no tie between the statements attributed to them and a decline in the Overstock share price. Again, liability was never premised on those statements; liability is premised on Rocker\u2019s participation in the preparation of negative reports falsely represented to be independent and unbiased, containing provably false assertions for the purpose of financial gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Next, Rocker appellants contend that Overstock was required to introduce an \u201cevent study\u201d showing a correlation between issuance of the Gradient reports and the decline in share price. They trot out a string of federal cases involving federal securities fraud claims by shareholders against the stock issuer, each concluding that such a study was a prerequisite to recovery. For example, in <em>In re Northern Telecom Ltd. Securities Litigation </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2000) 116 F.Supp.2d 446, discovery had been completed and the defendant moved successfully for summary judgment, the district court ruling, among other matters, that the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s expert was \u201cfatally deficient in that he did not perform an event study or similar analysis to remove the effects on stock price of market and industry information and he did not challenge the event study performed by defendants\u2019 expert.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 460.) Similarly, the matter of <em>In re Executive Telecard, Ltd. Securities Litigation </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1997) 979 F.Supp. 1021, 1025-1026, also proceeded to the summary judgment stage. Ruling on a challenge to the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, the district court indicated that the reliability of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony was called into question because he failed to indicate whether he had conducted an event study to determine if the defendants\u2019 stock price was affected by conipany-specific factors exclusive of the alleged fraud. And finally <em>In re Oracle Securities Litigation </em>(N.D.Cal. 1993) 829 F.Supp. 1176, 1181, involved approval of a settlement agreement. The district court criticized the plaintiffs\u2019 expert for failing to employ an event study that would allow more precise isolation of influences of information on the stock\u2019s price behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In contrast to the above cases which were at the summary judgment or settlement stage of proceedings, here the motions to strike came at the beginning of litigation and discovery. Overstock\u2019s prima facie case of causation need not be dependent on the completion of an event study. Overstock\u2019s prima facie evidence of causation includes the following: Its stock price had been on a steady rise for several years; appellants began frequently publishing defamatory reports starting in late 2004; these reports' were sent to financial journalists as well as large institutional investors, including hedge funds, that had the ability to affect the stock price with purchases, sales or shorts; appellants continued collaborating on and publishing negative reports on Overstock for the purpose of negatively influencing the price of Overstock shares so Rocker appellants could profit from existing or intended short positions; Gradient delayed publication several times' so Rocker appellants could establish their short position; and the price plummet in Overstock shares occurred in 2005, after the flurry of Gradient reports had gathered steam.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>III.

Initially Overstock received a grade of \u201cD\u201d which dropped to \u201cF\u201d in December 2003 and remained there ever since. In all, Gradient published over 50 negative reports on Overstock.

Nonetheless Gradient treated this departure as a red flag, explaining that \u201c[t]he departure of a CFO is necessarily a concern as it can be an indication ,of latent accounting irregularities or internal, accounting-related disputes.\u201d The bulletin concluded that Lindsey\u2019s departure lent \u201ccredence\u201d to Gradient\u2019s concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Chidester stated: \u201cGradient asserts that Overstock has no real inventory risk with respect to fulfillment partner sales transactions because Overstock is responsible only for the category of returns described as \u2018buyer\u2019s remorse.\u2019 . . .

The statement was so vague and the range of factors that could cause financial-pressures so vast that the district\u2014which had not pinpointed more specific statements or factors discernable from the bond rater\u2019s general negative assessment\u2014could not prevail. <em>(Id. </em>at.pp. 850-851, 855.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Gradient comments that Chidester\u2019s testimony is \u201cconclusory, improper, and inadmissible\u201d yet the firm does not challenge the trial court decision <em>overruling </em>its objections to this declaration.
