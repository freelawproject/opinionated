The purpose of the MSA was to govern the provision of municipal services to a gaming facility the Tribe was hoping to build within the City of Hesperia and within the Agency\u2019s redevelopment project area. Hesperia Citizens for Responsible Development (Citizens) filed a first amended complaint in which it alleged that respondents\u2019 adoption of the MSA was illegal, on various grounds. For example, Citizens claimed that the Agency\u2019s approval of the MSA violated Health and Safety Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 33426.5, which generally prohibits redevelopment agencies from assisting businesses in the development of gaming facilities. Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment in which they maintained that they had not violated section 33426.5, and that they were entitled to judgment on Citizens\u2019s other claims, as well. The trial court granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">On appeal, Citizens claims that the trial court erred in granting respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Citizens contends that the Agency\u2019s execution of the MSA violates section 33426.5. In addition, Citizens claims that respondents\u2019 adoption of the MSA violates the Community Redevelopment Law (\u00a7 33000 et seq.) and constitutes an unlawful surrender of respondents\u2019 sovereign authority. We affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">A. <em>Factual background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In 1993, the City Council adopted ordinance No. 178, approving a redevelopment plan (Redevelopment Plan). Ordinance No. 178 noted that the Redevelopment Plan delineated an area within which redevelopment was authorized pursuant to the Community Redevelopment Law (the Project Area).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In 2002, the Tribe informed the City that it was interested in purchasing real property within the boundaries of Hesperia. The Tribe intended to have the land placed in trust by the United States Secretary of the Interior, for use by the Tribe to operate a casino. The Tribe indicated that it wanted the City to provide municipal services to the proposed development, including police, fire, water, and sewer services, after the land was taken into trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The City performed various analyses to determine the impact on the City of the proposed development, and ultimately reached an agreement with the Tribe concerning the provision of municipal services to the proposed development (the MSA). The MSA identified a proposed site for the casino, which is located within the boundaries of both Hesperia and the Project Area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to the MSA, the City agreed to provide police, fire, water and sewer services to the proposed development. The Tribe agreed to compensate the City for these services. On August 25, 2003, the City Council adopted resolution No. 2003-67, approving the MSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">After adoption of resolution No. 2003-67, opponents of the casino project circulated a referendum petition that sought to have the City Council\u2019s determination overturned. Enough signatures were gathered to have the referendum placed on the ballot. A special election was held on March 2, 2004. The electorate upheld the City Council\u2019s approval of the MSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Title to the property on which the proposed development is to be constructed is currently held by a private owner. The property is vacant land. The Tribe has applied to the Secretary of the Interior to place the property in trust for the benefit of the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>B. <em>Procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In May 2004, Citizens filed a first amended complaint/verified petition against respondents. In the -first cause of action, Citizens claimed that respondents\u2019 adoption of resolution No. 2003-67 constitutes assistance to the Tribe in developing its gaming facility, and thus violates section 33426.5. In the second cause of action, Citizens claimed that respondents\u2019 adoption of resolution No. 2003-67 violated the Community Redevelopment Law for various reasons, including that the planned uses of the land as set forth in the MSA were unlawful. Citizens alleged in the third cause of action that resolution No. 2003-67 was invalid because the parcel of land on which the casino is to be built is not blighted. In the fourth cause of action, Citizens claimed that respondents\u2019 adoption of resolution No. 2003-67 violated California law in various ways, including that the development of a casino violates the prohibition on gambling contained in Penal Code section 330 and Business and Professions Code section 19800 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In the fifth and sixth causes of action, Citizens sought injunctive relief enjoining enforcement of resolution No. 2003-67, and a declaration that resolution No. 2003-67 is void. In the final cause of action, Citizens sought a writ of mandate prohibiting respondents from enforcing resolution No.2003-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Citizens filed a motion for summary adjudication and for summary judgment on the ground that respondents had violated section 33426.5. In addition, Citizens filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in which it claimed that respondents had no defense to any of Citizens\u2019s claims, and that Citizens was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Respondents filed their own motion for summary judgment on various grounds, including that Citizens\u2019s action was preempted by federal law, and that respondents had not violated section 33426.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">After further briefing and a hearing, the trial court denied Citizens\u2019s motion for summary judgment and motion for judgment on the pleadings, and granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court based its order granting respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">\u201c1. That the Moving Defendants have met their initial burden of proof to establish that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the Moving Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">\u201c2. That no statutory basis exists for the filing of the Complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">\u201c3. That the Municipal Services Agreement is preempted by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\u201c4. That once the land is placed in trust by the Secretary of the Interior preemption will apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents. Citizens timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">A; <em>Standard, of review '</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.

On appeal, the reviewing court makes \u201c \u2018an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The legislative history clearly indicates that the Legislature intended to prohibit agencies from providing both direct and indirect assistance to such entities. (See, e.g., Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 2063 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) [\u201cThis bill would further prohibit a redevelopment agency from providing any form of <em>direct or indirect </em>assistance to a development or business\u201d (italics added)]; Concurrence in Sen. Amends., Assem. Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>No. 2063 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 12, 1996, p. 1 (hereafter Concurrence in Senate Amendments) [stating that Senate amendments to Assem. Bill No. 2063 add a prohibition on \u201cindirect assistance to gambling enterprises\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Section 33426.5 does not expressly define direct or indirect assistance. However, the use of the term \u201cassistance\u201d suggests that the Legislature intended to prohibit redevelopment agencies from affirmatively aiding businesses that are engaged in the development of gaming facilities. (See Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1993) p. 132 [defining \u201cassistance\u201d as \u201cthe act or action of assisting,\u201d and defining \u201cassist\u201d as \u201cto give support oi: aid\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Further, the context in which the term \u201cassistance\" is used in section 33426.5 suggests that the Legislature intended to prevent redevelopment agencies from using the powers granted to them by the Community Redevelopment Law to assist businesses in the development of gaming facilities. The opening paragraph of section 33426.5 provides, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of Sections 33391, 33430, 33433, and 33445, or any other provision of this part, an agency shall not provide any form of direct assistance to . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">3. <em>The legislative history of section 33426.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The legislative history of section 33426.5 supports the conclusion that the Legislature intended to prevent redevelopment agencies from providing assistance to businesses engaged in developing gaming facilities. Section 33426.5 was initially adopted in 1994 to prohibit redevelopment agencies from using redevelopment powers to assist automobile dealerships and certain \u201cbig box\u201d retailers. (Stats. 1993, ch. 942, \u00a7 25, p. 5364.) In 1996, the Legislature amended section 33426.5 to add the prohibition on assisting gaming enterprises. (Stats. 1996, ch. 136, \u00a7 1, p. 699.) The legislative history of the 1996 amendment describes this history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201cCalifornia\u2019s Community Redevelopment Law lets cities and counties create redevelopment agencies (RDA\u2019s) to improve \u2018blighted\u2019 project areas. RDA\u2019s use eminent domain, extraordinary land management powers, and tax increment financing\u2014the difference between the property taxes generated before and after the improvement\u2014to redevelop project areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201cFor decades, the Community Redevelopment Law has proved very lucrative for the communities that use its powers to attract and retain private investment, but very controversial with citizens, taxpayers, and businesses that must live under its powerful tools. In the last three decades, the Legislature has responded to RDA\u2019s\u2019 critics by enacting various reforms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cIn 1994, the Legislature passed a comprehensive redevelopment reform measure to refine the definition of \u2018blight,\u2019 standardize intergovernmental fiscal relationships, and limit agencies longevity ([Assem. Bill No.] 1290, Isenberg, 1994). As part of the 1994 reform, the Legislature banned the use of redevelopment funds for certain automobile [dealerships,] \u2018big box\u2019 retailers, and new city halls and county administration buildings, but grandfathered-in existing revenue pledges.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2063 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 12, 1996, pp. 1-2 (hereafter Senate Analysis).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The Senate Analysis also noted that two redevelopment agencies had been assisting gambling enterprises. The Senate Analysis characterized this assistance using the same language\u2014\u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d\u2014that appears in section 33426.5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cTwo of the state\u2019s RDA\u2019s have recently been involved in assisting, <em>directly or indirectly, </em>gambling enterprises. In the 1980s, the City of Bell Gardens RDA (Los Angeles County) signed a 55-year lease with the Bicycle Club, a card casino, to use agency-owned land as a parking lot for $750,000 a year. More recently, the City of Palm Springs RDA (Riverside County) proposed to give land to an Indian tribe so that the tribe could establish a gambling casino downtown in conjunction with Caesar\u2019s. The RDA would have received two to three percent of the casino\u2019s profits. The Attorney General unsuccessfully sued the city, and the case is currently on appeal. Caesar\u2019s, however, has terminated its plans to participate in the casino.\u201d (Sen. Analysis, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">This legislative history suggests that the Legislature intended to prohibit redevelopment agencies from providing assistance like the direct assistance (giving land) and indirect assistance (leasing land) discussed in these examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">There are numerous other indications in the legislative history that suggest that the Legislature intended to prohibit redevelopment agencies from <em>subsidizing </em>gaming enterprises. (See Concurrence in Sen. Amends., <em>supra, </em>at p. 2 [\u201cProponents argue that redevelopment agencies should not subsidize gambling enterprises\u201d]; Sen. Com. on Local Gov., analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2063 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 12, 1996, pp. 2-3 [\u201cAfter redevelopment agencies (RDAs) expressed an interest in promoting gambling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>enterprises, state lawmakers grew concerned. Worried that gambling would promote blight instead of abate it, they want to prohibit RDAs from spending public money to promote gambling and gaming\u201d]; Governor\u2019s Off. of Planning and Research, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2063 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) July 1, 1996, p. 4 (hereafter Enrolled Bill Report) [\u201cproponents contended that gaming enterprises can establish themselves without redevelopment help\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In contrast, there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the Legislature intended to require redevelopment agencies to oppose any attempt by a business to establish a gaming enterprise within a redevelopment project area. Citizens relies on the following quotation from the Enrolled Bill Report: <em>\u201cThe author\u2019s staff </em>explained that [Assembly Bill No.] 2063 is being introduced to stop any future development and assistance of gambling enterprises in redevelopment project areas.\u201d (Enrolled Bill Report, <em>supra, </em>at p. 3, italics added.) However, the intention of the <em>bill author </em>in introducing the bill is not indicative of the <em>Legislature\u2019s </em>intent in passing the bill. <em>(Kaufman &amp; Broad Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering, Inc., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">4. <em>The Agency did not provide direct or indirect assistance to a gaming entity in adopting the MSA</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In support of its claim that the Agency violated section 33426.5, Citizens asserts that \u201cthe <em>MSA </em>provides direct assistance to the development of property inside the redevelopment Project Area which will be used for gambling or gaming.\u201d (Italics added.) Citizens notes that the opening paragraph of the MSA states the following: \u201cThis [MSA] is made ... by and between the City of Hesperia (hereinafter \u2018the City,\u2019 which term shall include the City of Hesperia, Hesperia Community Redevelopment - Agency, the Hesperia Water District, and the Hesperia Fire Protection District) and [the Tribe].\u201d Citizens also notes that the MSA states that \u201cthe City\u201d will provide various municipal services to the planned casino, including sewer and water service and police and fire protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Citizens further maintains that the Agency is taking an \u201cactive and direct role\u201d in the casino project. Citizens supports this assertion by noting that the property for the proposed casino is located within the Project Area. Citizens also asserts that the Agency will forgo \u201ccontrols\u201d and \u201crevenue\u201d associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>with the land to be used for the casino. With respect to revenue, Citizens argues that the Agency will forgo its right to receive tax increment revenues to which it would otherwise be entitled, when the land is taken into trust by the Tribe. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 16; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33670 et seq.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to controls, Citizens argues that the Agency will lose its right to impose design and land use controls when the land is taken into trust for the Tribe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In its reply brief, Citizens contends that the \u201cclearest form of assistance\u201d in the MSA is its requirement that \u201cthe City\u201d provide to the Secretary of the Interior correspondence in support of the Tribe\u2019s application to take the land for the casino in trust for the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We reject each of Citizens\u2019s arguments that the Agency has violated section 33426.5. First, with respect to Citizens\u2019s argument that the MSA outlines the municipal services to be provided the planned casino, Citizens does not contend that the Agency itself will be responsible for providing such services. While Citizens notes that \u201cthe City\u201d is defined in the opening paragraph of the MSA in such a way as to include the Agency, it is simply not reasonable to construe the MSA as requiring that the <em>Agency </em>provide the municipal services discussed therein, since it is undisputed that the Agency is not empowered to provide services such as water and sewer service or police and fire protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Section 33426.5 does not preclude the Agency from being a party to the MSA because the MSA requires that the City and other local governmental entities provide municipal services to the planned casino. Section 33426.5 evinces the Legislature\u2019s intent to preclude <em>redevelopment agencies </em>from assisting gaming entities. There is nothing in section 33426.5 that suggests that redevelopment agencies cannot be- parties to contracts in which <em>other </em>governmental entities provide assistance to gaming entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Similarly, we reject Citizens\u2019s argument that the Agency\u2019s adoption of the MSA constitutes \u201cassistance\u201d within the meaning of section 33426.5 because it will result in a loss of \u201ccontrols and revenue\u201d associated with the land to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>taken in trust for the benefit of the Tribe. As the MSA itself recognizes, any such loss of control or revenue is a function of the property becoming land held in trust for the Tribe, not a function of the MSA. For example, the MSA recites that without the MSA, \u201cthe City would not. . . have any authority or input with regard to the Tribe\u2019s trust lands . . . .\u201d Similarly, the MSA provides, \u201cThe Tribe and the City agree that... the City will lose potential tax revenues from the land and the improvements thereon and from certain commercial activities that the Tribe may conduct on the Trust lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We also reject Citizens\u2019s argument that the MSA\u2019s provision that the City will provide correspondence in support of the Tribe\u2019s application to take the land in trust constitutes the assistance that section 33426.5 prohibits. Section 21 of the MSA provides that \u201cthe City shall provide the correspondence attached as Exhibit D to the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs ...\u201d Exhibit D is a letter from the Mayor of the City of Hesperia that states, \u201cIt is with great pleasure that I, <em>on behalf of the City Council of the City of Hesperia, </em>California, submit this letter supporting the [Tribe\u2019s] request to take land into Trust.\u201d Thus, notwithstanding the MSA\u2019s definition of \u201cthe City,\u201d it is not reasonable to construe section 21 of the MSA as requiring the <em>Agency </em>to support the Tribe\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency did not provide direct or indirect assistance to a gaming entity in adopting the MSA and thus, that the Agency did not violate section 33426.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">C. <em>Respondents did not violate the Community Redevelopment Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Citizens claims respondents violated the Community Redevelopment Law in adopting the MSA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Citizens\u2019s primary argument in support of this claim is that the MSA does not contain adequate assurances from the Tribe that it will use the land to be taken in trust for the proposed casino in a manner consistent with the Community Redevelopment Law. Citizens argues that the Agency could have insisted that the \u201cTribe . . . make certain concessions\u201d in order to gain the Agency\u2019s approval of the MSA. Citizens also faults the Agency for failing to insist that provisions be included in the MSA that would mandate compliance with the Community Redevelopment Law\u2019s policy regarding nondiscrimination (\u00a7 33050) and the requirement that 20 percent of tax increment funds paid to a redevelopment agency be used for low-income housing (\u00a7 33487). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Similarly, Citizens argues that the Agency could have demanded that the MSA incorporate a provision of the Redevelopment Plan that governs design restrictions on developments in the Project Area. This argument fails because Citizens has not identified any obligation in the Community Redevelopment Law that requires the Agency to insist on such terms for all developments occurring within a redevelopment area.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Citizens also argues that the site of the proposed casino is not blighted. (\u00a7 33030.) Not every property within a redevelopment area need be blighted. (\u00a7 33321 [\u201cA project area need not be restricted to buildings, improvements, or lands which are detrimental or inimical to the public health, safety, or welfare, but may consist of an area in which such conditions predominate and injuriously affect the entire area\u201d].) More importantly, the City Council\u2019s prior determinations of blight in adopting the 1993 Redevelopment Plan and a 1999 amendment to the Redevelopment Plan are conclusive. (\u00a7 33368 [providing that in the absence of a validation action, \u201c[t]he decision of the legislative body shall be final and conclusive, and it shall thereafter be conclusively presumed that the project area is a blighted area as defined by Section 33031 and that all prior proceedings have been duly and regularly taken\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Finally, Citizens broadly argues that gambling is not consistent with the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d (\u00a7 33020), and that a casino will not provide \u201can environment for the social, economic, and psychological growth and well-being of all citizens.\u201d (\u00a7 33071.) Such arguments go to the merits of the underlying project and the compatibility of the project with the Redevelopment Plan. Citizens expressly states that this lawsuit does not address those issues. (See fn. 8, <em>ante) </em>Accordingly, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We conclude that respondents did not violate the Community Redevelopment Law in adopting the MSA in the ways Citizens claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">D. <em>Respondents did not unlawfully relinquish their sovereign authority by adopting the MSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Citizens claims that respondents unlawfully relinquished their sovereign authority by adopting the MSA. The gist of this claim is that, \u201conce the property is put in trust for the Tribe,\u201d the property will no longer be subject to state law or local ordinances. We reject this argument. As Citizens\u2019s argument implicitly acknowledges, any preemption of state law and local ordinances on land that comes to be held in trust for the tribe is a function of federal law, not the MSA.

The taxing agency receives the same amount of money it would have realized under the assessed valuation existing at the time the project was approved, while the additional money resulting from the rise in assessed valuation is placed in a special fund for repayment of indebtedness incurred in financing the project.\u201d <em>(Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 259, italics omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Citizens offers this example in support of its argument that respondents violated the Community Redevelopment Law.
