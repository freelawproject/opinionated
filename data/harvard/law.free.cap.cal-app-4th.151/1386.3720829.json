She sought a mortgage loan from defendant and respondent Master Financial, Inc. (Master Financial), to facilitate her purchase of a San Jose home. She was turned down; Master Financial stated in writing that it \u201cdoes not lend on day care homes.\u201d Shortly thereafter, plaintiff and appellant Project Sentinel, Inc., a nonprofit fair housing organization (Project Sentinel), obtained written confirmation from Master Financial that it \u201cwill NOT make loans with home day care if the home day care income is required to qualify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">Sisemore brought suit against Master Financial and two of its employees; Project Sentinel later joined in the suit as a plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They contended, among other things, that Master Financial\u2019s policies were in violation of FEHA. More specifically, plaintiffs asserted that Master Financial (1) had intentionally discriminated on the basis of the source of income of the loan applicant in violation of section 12955, subdivision (e); and (2) was liable under FEHA because its lending policy had a disparate impact on Sisemore and other family daycare home operators in that it disproportionately excluded women and families with children, thereby violating sections 12955, subdivision (e), and 12955.8, subdivision (b). The demurrer to the second amended complaint (Complaint) was sustained without leave to amend by the court below, and plaintiffs appeal from a judgment that we deem to have been entered on that order. (See Discussion, pt. II., <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">We consider on appeal whether a source-of-income discrimination claim under FEHA applies only in the landlord-tenant context (as the court concluded below). We also consider whether plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact claim is viable, or, as Master Financial urges, is not maintainable because family daycare home operators are not among a class of persons protected under FEHA. Further, we evaluate the viability of Sisemore\u2019s claims of discrimination under the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq.), of unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>or unfair business practice under the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), and of violating Health and Safety Code section 1597.40. We also consider whether Project Sentinel had standing to allege a FEHA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">We conclude after de novo review that the lower court properly sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the first cause of action for violation of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40. The court, however, erred when it sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. Further, the court should have overruled the demurrer to the (FEHA) third cause of action. Plaintiffs have stated a claim for intentional source-of-income discrimination under FEHA; section 12955, subdivision (e) cannot be read so narrowly as to make it applicable only to tenants or potential tenants seeking rental housing. Plaintiffs have further stated a FEHA claim for disparate impact discrimination. Moreover, we hold that Project Sentinel alleged sufficient facts for standing to assert a FEHA claim. Finally, we conclude that Sisemore has stated a viable claim under the UCL (second cause of action). Accordingly, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">The following material facts\u2014which this court accepts as true for purposes of evaluating the trial court\u2019s ruling on demurrer <em>(Searle v. Wyndham Internat., Inc. </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1327, 1330, fn. 1 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 231])\u2014are alleged in the Complaint: Sisemore is a licensed operator of a family daycare home for 14 or fewer children. The principal source of her income is from her operation of the family daycare home. Sisemore has custody and care of her three-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">In June 2003, Sisemore\u2014while she was renting the home out of which she operated her daycare business\u2014contacted Nikki Caster, a loan processor, to assist in obtaining a loan to purchase a home. Caster in turn contacted Colleen Brehm, a representative of Master Financial; she explained Sisemore\u2019s financial circumstances to Brehm, including the fact that Sisemore was then renting a home and that the principal source of her income was the operation of a daycare home. Brehm informed Caster that Sisemore could qualify for a particular loan product that Master Financial offered. That product consisted of a loan secured by a first deed of trust at an interest rate starting at 5.24 percent, and a loan secured by a second deed of trust at an interest rate starting at 9.99 percent. Brehm did not tell Caster or Sisemore that a term of the home loan prohibited Sisemore from using her intended home as a family daycare operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>In August 2003, Sisemore located a home in San Jose that she wanted to purchase; she intended to reside in it with her daughter, and to operate a daycare business. Caster informed Brehm about the property. Brehm told Caster that the interest rate on the first loan had increased to 5.74 percent but that the terms were otherwise the same as previously discussed. Based upon this understanding, Sisemore submitted an offer to purchase the home that was accepted. During the escrow process, Master Financial sent a letter denying Sisemore\u2019s loan application, stating that it \u201cdoes not lend on day cafe homes.\u201d As a result of this denial, Sisemore was required to seek and obtain an alternative home loan with less attractive rates and terms than the loans she had anticipated receiving from Master Financial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">In July 2004, a female Project Sentinel employee, who posed as a licensed home daycare operator (a \u201ctester\u201d), contacted Master Financial to inquire about qualifying f\u00f3r a home loan. Andy Vargas, an area sales manager of Master Financial, advised her by e-mail that Master Financial \u201cwill NOT make loans with home day care if the home day care income is req\u00fcired to qualify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">Sisemore filed her original complaint on August 20, 2004, against Master Financial, Vargas, and Brehm. Thereafter, Sisemore, along with Project Sentinel, filed a first amended complaint. Master Financial filed a demurrer and motion to strike relative to the first amended complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court in large part sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">Sisemore and Project Sentinel filed the Complaint on or about March 24, 2005. Master Financial filed a demurrer and motion to strike. The court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the first through fourth causes of action of the Complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sisemore and Project Sentinel filed separate timely appeals from the order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">I. <em>Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">The following issues are presented in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-7\">1. Whether Master Financial\u2019s alleged policies constituted a prohibition or restriction on the use or occupancy of property as a family daycare home, such that Sisemore stated a claim for a violation of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-8\">2. Whether Sisemore stated a cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-9\">3. Whether plaintiffs stated a claim for intentional discrimination based upon source of income under FEHA (\u00a7 12955 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-10\">4. Whether plaintiffs stated a claim for disparate impact discrimination under FEHA, because Master Financial\u2019s policies had a disproportionate effect on women or families with children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-11\">5. Whether Project Sentinel alleged sufficient facts for standing to assert a FEHA claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-12\">6. Whether Sisemore stated a cause of action under the UCL (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">II. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">We are confronted initially with whether the matter from which the appeals have been taken is properly appealable. Although Master Financial here does not argue that plaintiffs\u2019 separate appeals are defective because they challenge a nonappealable order, we cannot overlook this potential procedural infirmity: \u201cThe existence of an appealable judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal. A reviewing court must raise the issue on its own initiative whenever a doubt exists as to whether the trial court has entered a final judgment or other order or judgment made appealable by Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Jennings v. Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 126-127 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074].) Since this issue is central to our jurisdiction, we address it on our own motion. <em>(Olson </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, 398 [197 Cal.Rptr. 843, 673 P.2d 720]; <em>Nguyen v. Calhoun </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 428, 436 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 436].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>The purported appeals taken by plaintiffs were from the order sustaining the demurrer. The record does not reflect the entry of a judgment or a dismissal on the demurrer order. An order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is not appealable, and an appeal is proper only after entry of a dismissal on such an order. <em>(Berri v. Superior Court </em>(1955) 43 Cal.2d 856, 860 [279 P.2d 8]; <em>Hill v. City of Long Beach </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1684, 1695 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 125].) On occasion, however, appellate courts have reviewed such orders, based upon justifications such as the avoidance of delay, the interests of justice, and the apparent intent of the trial court to have a formal judgment filed. <em>(Reyna v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 876, 879 [138 Cal.Rptr. 504].) And when the trial court has sustained a demurrer to all of the complaint\u2019s causes of action, appellate courts may deem the order to incorporate a judgment of dismissal, since all that is left to make the order appealable is the formality of the entry of a dismissal order or judgment. <em>(Thaler v. Household Finance Corp. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1098 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 779]; see also <em>Hinman </em>v. <em>Department of Personnel Admin. </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 516, 520 [213 Cal.Rptr. 410] [appeal from order sustaining demurrer without leave to amend deemed proper to avoid delay and in furtherance of justice].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">Here, the order sustaining the demurrer to each of the four causes of action of the Complaint without leave to amend effectively ended plaintiffs\u2019 ability to proceed fiirther with their case below. The only step left to make the order appealable was the formal entry of a dismissal order or judgment. We will accordingly deem the order on the demurrer to incorporate a judgment of dismissal and will review the order. <em>(Thaler v. Household Finance Corp., supra, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at p. 1098.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">III. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">The standard of review is de novo. <em>(Cryolife, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1152 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 396].) \u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules. \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] When a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Blank v. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58]; see also <em>Randi </em>W. v. <em>Muroc Joint Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1066, 1075 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 263, 929 P.2d 582].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>\u201cIt is not the ordinary function of a demurrer to test the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations or the accuracy with which he describes the defendant\u2019s conduct. A demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading.\u201d <em>(Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660].) Thus, as noted, in considering the merits of a demurrer, \u201cthe facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [176 Cal.Rptr. 824]; see also <em>Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 496 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216] [court reviewing propriety of ruling on demurrer is not concerned with the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s ability to prove . . . allegations, or the possible difficulty in making such proof\u2019].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">On appeal, we will affirm a \u201ctrial court\u2019s decision to sustain the demurrer [if it] was correct on any theory. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kennedy v. Baxter Healthcare Corp. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 799, 808 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 736], fn. omitted.) Thus, \u201cwe do not review the validity of the trial court\u2019s reasoning but only the propriety of the ruling itself. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Orange Unified School Dist. v. Rancho Santiago Community College Dist. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 750, 757 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">When a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, the reviewing court must determine whether there is a reasonable probability that the complaint could have been amended to cure the defect; if so, it will conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the plaintiff leave to amend. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Housing Authority of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 708, 719 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 374].) The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that it could have amended the complaint to cure the defect. <em>(Campbell v. Regents of University of California </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 311, 320 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 320, 106 P.3d 976].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">IV. <em>Claim Under Health and Safety Code Section 1597.40</em></p>\n<p id=\"AhL\">A. <em>Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">Sisemore alleges in the first cause of action of her Complaint that Master Financial\u2019s conduct in rejecting her loan application constituted a practice of discrimination against family daycare home providers in violation of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40. Specifically, Master Financial violated that statute when it (1) refused to lend to her if she operated her family daycare business in the home she was acquiring through the anticipated loan; (2) issued \u201ca written instrument . . . publishing [Master Financial\u2019s] stated policy of refusing to make home loans secured by a dwelling in which a licensed home day care is operated\u201d; and (3) discriminated against other loan applicants who were home daycare operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>Sisemore urges that Master Financial\u2019s conduct was a violation of subdivision (b) of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40 because Master Financial\u2019s letter refusing to make a loan to a family daycare home constituted a \u201cwritten instrument . . . forbid[ding] or restricting] the . . . mortgaging of [] real property for use or occupancy as a family day care home.\u201d She contends that the trial court erroneously held that no such claim was alleged because Master Financial\u2019s written denial \u201c[did] not purport to restrict any real property from being used or occupied as a family day care home.\u201d (Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Sisemore argues further that she stated a cause of action for a violation of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (c). She urges that Master Financial\u2019s denial of a loan was a \u201crestriction or prohibition . . . [on] the acquisition, use, or occupancy of [] property for a family day care home for children,\u201d proscribed by Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (c). Sisemore argues that the court below erred by concluding that Master Financial\u2019s alleged conduct \u201c[did] not violate subdivision (c) because it [did] not impose restrictions on the purchase and use of real property.\u201d She argues further that the court erred when it found that \u201c[s]ubdivision[s] [(b) and] (c) do[] not require mortgage lenders to engage in the business of lending on day care homes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Master Financial responds that the statute does hot apply to the matters alleged by Sisemore. Specifically, Health and Safety Code section 1597.40 concerns the invalidity of written instruments or restrictive covenants impairing the use of real property for the operation of family daycare homes. Since Sisemore\u2014Master Financial argues\u2014did not allege the existence of such a written instrument or restrictive covenant, she failed to state a cause of action under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">B. <em>Viability of First Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">L. <em>Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cEvery provision in a written instrument entered into relating to real property which purports to forbid or restrict the conveyance, encumbrance, leasing, or mortgaging of the real property for use or occupancy as a family day care home for children, is void and every restriction or prohibition in any such written instrument as to the use or occupancy of the property as a family day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>care home for children is void.\u201d As noted, Sisemore contends that Master Financial\u2019s letter denying Sisemore\u2019s loan application constituted a \u201cwritten instrument\u201d restricting or prohibiting the mortgaging of Sisemore\u2019s -property for use or occupancy as home daycare, in violation of subdivision (b) of the statute. Reduced to its most basic form, Sisemore\u2019s contention is that a rejection letter in which a mortgage lender refuses to make a loan where the security is intended to be used as a family daycare home constitutes a \u201cwritten instrument.\u201d We reject that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">In construing subdivision (b) of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, we begin \u201cwith the actual language of the statute, and if the text is clear as applied to a given case, and it does not fall into any of the exceptions, stop there. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(J.A. Jones Construction Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1575 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 206].) We thus commence by considering whether Master Financial\u2019s rejection letter constituted a \u201cwritten instrument\u201d under the statute. Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (b) does not define the term, and there have been no reported decisions discussing the meaning of \u201cwritten instrument\u201d in subdivision (b). But in context, the type of \u201cwritten instrument\u201d addressed in subdivision (b) of the statute is one \u201centered into relating to real property\u201d and which contains certain restrictions or prohibitions concerning the use of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">We are guided by the manner in which \u201cinstrument\u201d is defined under the Government Code with reference to the recordation of documents: \u201c \u2018Instrument,\u2019 as used in this chapter, means a written paper signed by a person or persons transferring the title to, or giving a lien on real property, or giving a right to a debt or duty.\u201d (\u00a7 27279, subd. (a).) And we note that a leading authority, in identifying a nonexclusive list of 116 types of written instruments subject to recordation under section 27280, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not include a mortgage lender rejection letter as being a recordable instrument. (5 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2000) \u00a7 11:6, pp. 19-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">As defined in legal dictionaries, the term is not susceptible of the meaning ascribed to it by Sisemore. (See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dict. (8th ed. 2004) p. 813, col. 2: \u201cinstrument. 1. A written legal document that defines rights, duties, entitlements, or liabilities, such as a contract, will, promissory note, or share certificate.\u201d) Nor are common definitions of \u201cinstrument\u201d supportive of Sisemore\u2019s position. (See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>p. 1172, cols. 1-2: \u201cinstrument... a legal document (as a deed, will, bond, lease, agreement, mortgage, note, power of attorney, ticket on carrier, bill of lading, insurance policy, warrant, writ) evidencing legal rights or duties esp. of one party to,another . . .\u201d; Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 2001) p. 605, col. 2: \u201cinstrument ... a formal legal document (as a deed, bond, or agreement) . . . .\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Sisemore asserts that <em>Barrett v. Dawson </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1048 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 899] (Barrett) supports a broad construction of the statute and the conclusion that Master Financial\u2019s rejection letter constituted a \u201cwritten instrument.\u201d The chief issue in <em>Barrett </em>was whether a 1983 amendment to Health and Safety Code section 1597.40 (formerly codified as \u00a7 1597.501) was intended to make restrictive covenants that limited family daycare homes in residential areas void irrespective of whether the covenants predated the original enactment of the statute in 1981. Significantly, Barrett\u2014unlike the case here\u2014clearly concerned a written instrument; namely, a restrictive covenant contained in a document recorded when the neighborhood was developed in 1968. <em>(Barrett, supra, </em>at p. 1052.) <em>Barrett </em>simply does not support the conclusion that a mortgage lender\u2019s letter rejecting a borrower based upon the anticipated use of the security as a family daycare home constitutes a \u201cwritten instrument\u201d under Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">\u201cWords used in a statute or constitutional provision should be given the meaning they bear in ordinary use.

In this instance, we cannot reasonably construe Master Financial\u2019s letter rejecting a mortgage loan based upon the nature of Sisemore\u2019s anticipated use of the security to be a \u201cwritten instrument\u201d under subdivision (b) of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">2. <em>Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (c) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subdivision (d) [concerning family home daycare operated in rented or leased property], every restriction or prohibition entered into, whether by way of covenant, condition upon use or occupancy, or upon transfer of title to real property, which restricts or prohibits directly, or indirectly limits, the acquisition, use, or occupancy of such property for a family day care home for children is void.\u201d Sisemore contends\u2014independent of her claim under Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (b)\u2014that Master Financial violated subdivision (c) because it restricted or prohibited Sisemore from using the property she intended to acquire as a family daycare home. She argues that subdivision (c) affords broad protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>against practices that directly or indirectly limit, inter alia-, the use of property for family daycare, including Master Financial\u2019s practice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">We first reject Master Financial\u2019s argument that no claim under subdivision (c) was stated because its rejection letter did not constitute a \u201cwritten instrument.\u201d While, as we have observed, this contention has merit under subdivision (b) of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, nowhere is the term \u201cwritten instrument\u201d found in subdivision (c). There is no reason to import the requirement of a \u201cwritten instrument\u201d specified in subdivision (b) into the practices proscribed under subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">Sisemore posits correctly that the scope of Health and Safety Code section 1597.40, subdivision (c) is broader than subdivision (b), in that the former subdivision does not require a \u201cwritten instrument\u201d as its subject. By its terms, subdivision (c) embraces \u201cevery restriction or prohibition entered into,\u201d irrespective of whether it is part of a \u201cwritten instrument.\u201d Were we to interpret subdivision (c)\u2014as suggested by Master Financial\u2014to apply only to restrictions or prohibitions found in a \u201cwritten instrument,\u201d the proscriptions in subdivision (b) would be rendered unnecessary and surplusage. <em>(Bowland v.

The statute addresses restrictions or prohibitions \u201centered into,\u201d thereby implying an arrangement more formal and binding than simply a lender\u2019s stated policy regarding mortgage loans.

Code, \u00a7 1597.40, subd. (a).) The Legislature declared \u201cthis policy to be of statewide concern with the purpose of occupying the field to the exclusion of municipal zoning, building and fire codes and regulations governing the use or occupancy of family day care homes for children, . . . and to prohibit any restrictions relating to the use of single-family residences for family day care homes for children except as provided by this chapter.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>2d par.) And the court in <em>Barrett, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at pages 1050-1051, identified the scope of the statute as declaring void any restrictive covenants that limited family daycare homes in residential neighborhoods.

The mortgage lending policy contained in that letter did not constitute a \u201crestriction or prohibition entered into, whether by way of covenant, condition upon use or occupancy, or upon transfer of title to real property, which restricts or prohibits directly, or indirectly limits, the acquisition, use, or occupancy of such property for a family day care home . . . . \u201d (Health &amp; Saf.

Background and Contentions of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">Sisemore alleges in the fourth cause of action of the Complaint that Master Financial\u2019s conduct was in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq.) (Act). After incorporating by reference all factual allegations in the Complaint, she alleges that Master Financial discriminated against her \u201cbased on [her] source of income, occupation, and an arbitrary characteristic, the running of a family day care . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">The court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the Act cause of action. It reasoned that \u201c[a] mortgage lender may impose occupational or professional qualifications that exclude certain prospective borrowers. Such restrictions do not constitute arbitrary discrimination unless the mortgage lender uses them as a pretext to exclude persons having the types of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>characteristics protected by the [Act]. The election to become a- licensed home day care provider represents a professional and, probably, economic choice rather than a personal characteristic of the type enumerated in the Act. . . . See <em>Roth v. Rhodes </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 530, 537 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 706].\u201d Since Sisemore did not allege that the loan rejection was pretextual in order to discriminate on the basis of a protected personal characteristic, but merely alleged that Master Financial \u201ccategorically refuse to approve mortgages for licensed home day care providers,\u201d the court concluded that the fourth cause of action failed to state a claim under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Sisemore asserts that the Act has been construed to afford broad protection against arbitrary discrimination. Discrimination on the basis of one\u2019s occupational status is not expressly proscribed by the statute. But our Supreme Court (Sisemore argues) has reiterated that section 51 of the Civil Code does not present an exhaustive list of the bases upon which discrimination is proscribed, and that courts have occasionally recognized other classifications (e.g., children, families with children) that are subject to protection under the Act. Sisemore asserts that occupational-status discrimination, although <em>not </em>expressly mentioned in the statute, is conduct that courts have acknowledged to be prohibited under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">Master Financial responds that subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 51 prohibits only discrimination based upon certain personal characteristics, such as gender, race, color, or religion. It argues that Sisemore is attempting to improperly expand the Act to include protection against discrimination on the basis of an economic, rather than a personal, characteristic. Master Financial, citing <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873] <em>(Harris), </em>contends that economic/financial distinctions, such as the operation of a family daycare home claimed here to be the basis of the discriminatory conduct, are not afforded protection under the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">B. <em>Whether Unruh Civil Rights Act Claim Was Alleged</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">Civil Code section 51, subdivision (b) provides; \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, marital status, or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d As our Supreme Court has very recently emphasized: \u201cThe Act expresses a state and national policy against discrimination on arbitrary grounds. [Citation.] Its provisions were intended as an active measure that would create and preserve a nondiscriminatory environment in California business establishments by \u2018banishing\u2019 or \u2018eradicating\u2019 arbitrary, invidious discrimination by such establishments.

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 216 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992] <em>(Cox).) </em>Thus, in <em>Cox, </em>the high court concluded that the Act prohibited a business\u2019s arbitrary exclusion of a customer on the ground that he associated with a male with long hair and unconventional dress. <em>(Cox, </em>at p. 216.) Similarly, in <em>Marina Point, Ltd. v. Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 740 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115] <em>(Marina Point), </em>the court held that a blanket policy of excluding children or families with children from rental housing constituted discrimination under the Act, notwithstanding the fact that those groups were not specifically enumerated in the statute. (See also <em>O\u2019Connor v. Village Green Owners Assn. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 790 [191 Cal.Rptr. 320, 662 P.2d 427] <em>(O\u2019Connor) </em>[holding that a condominium development restricting residency to persons over 18 violated Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">In <em>Harris, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 1142, the Supreme Court revisited whether discrimination based upon characteristics not specifically enumerated in Civil Code section 51 was potentially proscribed under the Act. After extensive discussion (see <em>Harris, supra, </em>at pp. 1154-1156), the court rejected the defendants\u2019 position that only classes specifically identified in the statute were protected. The <em>Harris </em>court acknowledged that \u201c[beginning with <em>Cox </em>in 1970, the Unruh Act has been construed to apply to several classifications not expressed in the statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1155.) It therefore rejected the defendants\u2019 contention that the Legislature had repudiated the holdings in <em>\u201cCox, Marina Point, O\u2019Connor, </em>and similar appellate decisions extending the Unruh Act beyond its specified categories of discrimination . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Koebke v. Bernardo Heights Country Club </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 824, 840 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 565, 115 P.3d 1212] <em>(Koebke), </em>reiterated that in <em>Harris </em>it had \u201caffirmed the principle articulated in [its] earlier decisions that the Act\u2019s enumerated categories are illustrative, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>restrictive.\u201d It explained that <em>Harris </em>had established a \u201ca three-part analytic framework for determining whether a future claim of discrimination, involving a category not enumerated in the statute or added by prior judicial construction, should be cognizable under the Act.\u201d <em>{Ibid..)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Although the case was not mentioned by the Supreme Court, slightly over a year before <em>Harris </em>was decided, the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Division Three) held that a police officer had stated a claim for discrimination under the Act on the basis of his occupational status. In <em>Long </em>v. <em>Valentino </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1287 [265 Cal.Rptr. 96] <em>(Long), </em>the plaintiff, a police officer, attended a public meeting sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that concerned police practices. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1291.) After being ejected by an ACLU attorney, the plaintiff brought suit for damages, alleging, inter alia, a claim for unlawful discrimination under the Act. <em>(Long, </em>at p. 1293.) The appellate court concluded that the plaintiff had stated a claim under the Act based upon arbitrary occupational-status discrimination, and it rejected the defendants\u2019 assertion that speech alone (i.e., words uttered ejecting the plaintiff) was not actionable. The court stated: \u201c[A]n announcement such as \u2018You can\u2019t eat at my diner because you are a lawyer, bricklayer, female, or Indian chief\u2019 would be actionable under the Unruh Act, although words alone were the means employed to effect the unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>(Long, </em>at p. 1297; see also <em>McCalden v. California Library Ass\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 955 F.2d 1214, 1221 [noting that protected classes under the Act have been broadly defined to include, int\u00e9r alia, \u201cstudents, families with children, welfare recipients, and occupational groups\u201d].) Moreover, the court disposed of the defendants\u2019 argument that police officers were not entitled to protection under the Act, holding that \u201cthey are as much entitled to the protections of the Unruh Act as any other citizen. They may not be refused service in a restaurant, denied an apartment, or ejected from a public meeting merely because of their occupation* whether working a shift or on vacation.\u201d <em>(Long, supra, </em>at p. 1298; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 1300 [citing other hypothetical examples of prohibited occupational-status discrimination by car rental agency, restaurateur, and transportation company].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Sisemore urges that <em>Long </em>established a judicially recognized category (occupational status) that is protected from arbitrary discrimination under the Act. She argues that since the Supreme Court in <em>Harris, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 1142 did not disturb prior case authority identifying certain protected classifications not specified in Civil Code section 51, she stated a viable cause of action under <em>Long </em>for occupational-status discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">We conclude that Sisemore has alleged a cognizable Unruh Civil Rights Act claim. At its most basic form, the fourth cause of action alleges that Master Financial arbitrarily discriminated against Sisemore solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>basis of her occupational status. Liberally construed, the claim is that she was refused a mortgage loan simply because she is a family daycare home operator. <em>Long, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 1287 supports the conclusion that arbitrary occupational discrimination is prohibited under the Act. (See also 8 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Constitutional Law, \u00a7 905, pp. 388-389 [identifying occupational discrimination as being protected under Act, citing <em>Long].) </em>The Supreme Court has not. overruled or even questioned <em>Long\u2019s </em>holding. In addition, we note that seven years before <em>Long </em>was decided, the Supreme Court in dictum mentioned that discrimination on the basis of employment status was a cognizable claim under the Act. <em>(Marina Point, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 736; see also 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 608 (1975) [concluding that arbitrary occupational discrimination was prohibited by Act].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The high court has never repudiated that dictum. Therefore, Sisemore has stated a discrimination claim under the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Master Financial urges that it simply made a business decision that it would make no loans to a prospective borrower who intended to use the security for the loan (his or her residence) to operate, a family daycare business. It alternatively characterizes its conduct as a refusal to make a business loan. While these are potential explanations for its actions, the fact remains that the Complaint alleges that Master Financial refused to provide a mortgage loan to Sisemore\u2014who was otherwise qualified for the , loan under Master Financial\u2019s criteria\u2014because she intended to engage in her chosen occupation as a family daycare home operator. She is required by statute to use her residence to operate a family home daycare facility. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1596.78 [defining facility as home regularly providing child care to 14 or fewer children \u201cin the provider\u2019s own home\u201d].) Sisemore therefore must use the security for her mortgage loan (her home) to engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>her chosen occupation. Regardless of the label used to describe Master Financial\u2019s alleged conduct, it can fairly be considered as a refusal to deal with Sisemore solely on the basis of her occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Master Financial, citing <em>Harris, </em>also argues that the type of discrimination alleged by Sisemore is \u201centirely economic,\u201d rather than discrimination based upon a \u201cpersonal\u201d characteristic protected under the Act. This position is without merit for two reasons. First, we do not read <em>Harris </em>as establishing a bright-line test in which discriminatory conduct is proscribed under the Act only if it involves a \u201cpersonal\u201d characteristic. Rather, the court held that the Act provides protection against discriminatory conduct based upon categories identified in the statute as well as others that have been identified in appellate decisions. <em>(Harris, supra, 52 </em>Cal.3d at p. 1155.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <em>Harris </em>court further held that, in evaluating the viability of an Unruh Civil Rights Act claim based upon a category not enumerated in the statute <em>or identified in a prior appellate decision, </em>one of the questions in the three-part test is whether the new claim \u201cis based on a classification that involves personal.characteristics.\u201d <em>(Koebke, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 841.) Since <em>Long, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 1287, held that the Act prohibited arbitrary discrimination on the basis of one\u2019s occupation, we need not engage in the three-part <em>Harris </em>test that would require a qualitative analysis of whether a person\u2019s occupation is a \u201cpersonal\u201d characteristic, or a purely \u201ceconomic\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">Second, even were such an analysis required, we would disagree with Master Financial that one\u2019s occupational status is a purely economic characteristic. This case differs significantly from the circumstances in <em>Harris, </em>where the claim was that a business could not discriminate under the Act by establishing a particular economic criterion for the rental of an apartment unit. Here, Sisemore contends that she was discriminated against because of her choice of occupations, <em>not </em>that she was denied a mortgage loan because that choice resulted in her earning insufficient income to meet the lender\u2019s underwriting criteria. Moreover, an individual\u2019s choice of an occupation\u2014 while it may, of course, be motivated at least in part by economic consideratiqns\u2014is often a very personal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">Master Financial relies on <em>Roth v. Rhodes, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th 530, in support of its position that Sisemore did not allege a viable Act claim. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number><em>Roth, </em>the plaintiff, a podiatrist, alleged that operators of medical buildings had, inter alia, violated the Act by limiting its commercial tenants to medical doctors. (25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 535-536.) The trial court granted summary adjudication in favor of the defendants on the Act claim. (25 Cal.4th at p. 536.) The <em>Roth </em>court posited that the question of whether a commercial landlord could \u201crefuse to lease space to podiatrists [was] analytically no different from the question of whether the law requires a department store which caters to the high end of the market to purchase shoes from a manufacturer who makes less expensive, lower quality shoes. Or we could ask, does the law prohibit a landlord from limiting his tenancies to lawyers, merchants, or any specific trade or profession?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 536-537.) The court concluded that restrictions by a commercial landlord limiting tenants to certain occupations do not run afoul of the Act as long as the restrictions are not used as a pretext to exclude persons having personal characteristics protected under the Act. (25 Cal.App.4th at p. 537.) In so holding, the court noted that the choice of a profession is \u201ca professional and, frequently, an economic choice, rather than a personal characteristic of the type enumerated in the [A]ct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 539.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">While a cursory reading of <em>Roth </em>might suggest that Sisemore\u2019s occupational status is not protected under the Act against arbitrary discrimination of the kind alleged here, we conclude that <em>Roth </em>dictates no such conclusion. <em>Roth </em>concerned a commercial landlord\u2019s decision to tailor its tenant base to a particular occupation to the exclusion of all others. This business decision provided a uniform tenancy for the commercial building, rather than an arbitrary exclusion of one particular occupational group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Further, the procedural posture in <em>Roth </em>differs greatly from the status of our case. The trial court in <em>Roth </em>granted summary adjudication after receiving evidence concerning the defendants\u2019 business justification for the allegedly discriminatory practice. Here, the court rejected the claim at the demurrer stage, without any evidence of Master Financial\u2019s justification for refusing to make a mortgage loan to Sisemore because of her occupation. On the face of the pleadings, Master Financial arbitrarily rejected Sisemore as a borrower solely because of her occupation even though she otherwise met the lender\u2019s qualifications. At this stage, it was improper for the court to have found that Sisemore had not stated a viable claim under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">Moreover, <em>Roth </em>did not repudiate the holding in <em>Long, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 1287, that the Act prohibits arbitrary occupational discrimination. Indeed, the <em>Roth </em>court neither cited <em>Long </em>nor held categorically that the Act does not protect against any form of occupational-status discrimination. (See <em>Elisa B. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 108, 118 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 46, 117 P.3d 660] [\u201c \u2018Language used in any opinion is of course to be understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court, and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered\u2019 \u201d].) We therefore conclude that <em>Roth </em>is distinguishable from the circumstances before us and does not compel the conclusion that Sisemore has failed to state a claim under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">\u201c \u2018The purpose [of the Act] is to compel a recognition of the equality of citizens in the right to the peculiar service offered . . .\u2019 \u201d by an organization or entity covered by the Act. <em>(Marina Point, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 738; see also <em>Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 712, 733 [195 Cal.Rptr. 325].) As the Supreme Court has held, \u201c[t]he Act is to be given a liberal construction with a view to effectuating its purposes. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Koire v. Metro Car Wash </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 24, 28 [219 Cal.Rptr. 133, 707 P.2d 195]; see also <em>Angelucci v. Century Supper Club, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 167.) We conclude that a finding here that Sisemore stated a viable Unruh Civil Rights Act claim for occupational discrimination is consistent both with the holding in <em>Long </em>and the statute\u2019s policy of prohibiting arbitrary denial of access to public accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">VI. <em>FEHA Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"AE9\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">In the third cause of action, plaintiffs allege that Master Financial committed unlawful housing practices in violation of FEHA. They assert that Master Financial, as a \u201c. . . mortgage company or other financial institution that provides financial assistance for the purchase, organization, or construction of any housing accommodation[,] . . . discriminate[d] against [a] person or group of persons because of the ... sex,. . . familial status,. .. [or] source of income ... in the terms, conditions, or privileges relating to the obtaining or use of that financial assistance.\u201d (\u00a7 12955, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">There are two essential components to plaintiffs\u2019 position. First, they assert that they properly alleged a claim for intentional discrimination against a group specifically protected under FEHA\u2014namely, persons discriminated against based on the source of their income in violation of subdivision (e) of section 12955. Second, plaintiffs contend that they alleged a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination in violation of subdivision (e) of section 12955 because Master Financial\u2019s policy of not lending to home daycare operators disproportionately affected two protected classes, namely, women and families with children. Since a FEHA violation may be shown (as provided in section 12955.8, subdivision (b)) by establishing that an act prohibited by FEHA \u201chas the effect, regardless of intent, of unlawfully discriminating on the basis of . . . sex . . . [or] familial status . . . ,\u201d plaintiffs contend that they stated a viable disparate impact claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>The court below concluded that neither plaintiff had alleged a viable FEHA claim. It concluded that the \u201csource of income\u201d category in section 12955, when the statute is \u201cviewed as a whole and in conjunction with its legislative history, . . . [applies only to] prohibit[] discrimination on the basis of a person\u2019s source of income in assessing his or her eligibility for rental housing. It does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person\u2019s source of income in assessing his or her eligibility for a mortgage loan.\u201d The court held further that plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact claim failed because the allegations did not \u201cestablish that the alleged discriminatory practices affect women as a group or families with children as a group. Instead, they establish that the discriminatory practices affect licensed home day care providers as a group. The FEHA does not protect this group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">We address separately below plaintiffs\u2019 intentional discrimination and disparate impact theories. We also address Master Financial\u2019s assertion that the order sustaining the demurrer was proper (as to the entity plaintiff) on the additional ground that Project Sentinel lacks standing to assert a FEHA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">B. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Intentional Discrimination Claims under FEHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Section 12955 makes a variety of discriminatory housing practices unlawful. Subdivision (e) of the statute\u2014upon which plaintiffs\u2019 intentional discrimination claims are based\u2014makes it unlawful \u201c[f]or any person, bank, mortgage company or other financial institution that provides financial assistance for, the purchase, organization, or construction of any housing accommodation to discriminate against any person or group of persons because of the race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial status, <em>source of income, </em>or disability in the terms, conditions, or privileges relating to the obtaining or use of that financial assistance.\u201d (Italics added.) Based upon Master Financial\u2019s statements\u2014(to Sisemore) that it \u201cdoes not lend on day care homes,\u201d and (to Project Sentinel) that it \u201cwill NOT make loans with home day care if the home day care income is required to qualify\u201d\u2014plaintiffs contend that they were denied a mortgage loan on the basis of source of income as proscribed by section 12955, subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">Master Financial\u2019s primary response is that the terms of section 12955 make it clear that the source-of-income discrimination provisions apply only in the context of discrimination by a landlord against an actual or potential tenant seeking rental housing. In support of this position, it cites subdivision (p)(l) of the statute, which \u00a1provides: \u201cFor the purposes of this section, \u2018source of income\u2019 means lawful, verifiable income paid directly to a tenant or paid to a representative of a tenant. For the purposes of this section, a landlord is not considered a representative of a tenant.\u201d Master Financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>argues further that the legislative history of the 1999 amendment to section 12955 compels the conclusion that the source-of-income provisions protect only tenants or prospective tenants against discrimination by landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">The interpretation and application of a statute involve questions of law subject to de novo review. <em>(Amdahl Corp. v. County of Santa Clara </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 604, 611 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 486].) We take a three-step sequential approach to interpreting statutory language. (See <em>Halbert\u2019s Lumber, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1238-1239 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 298] <em>(Halbert\u2019s Lumber).) </em>First, we will examine the language at issue, giving \u201cthe words of the statute their ordinary, everyday meaning.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1238; see also <em>Lungren v. Deukmejian, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 735.) If we conclude that the statutory meaning is free of doubt, uncertainty, or ambiguity, the language of the statute controls, and our task is completed. <em>(Halbert\u2019s Lumber, supra, </em>at p. 1239; see also <em>Security Pacific National Bank </em>v. <em>Wozab </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 991, 998 [275 Cal.Rptr. 201, 800 P.2d 557].) Second, if we determine that the language is unclear, we will attempt to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent as an aid to statutory construction. <em>(Halbert\u2019s Lumber, supra, </em>at p. 1239.) In attempting to ascertain that intent, \u201cwe must examine the legislative history and statutory context of the act under scrutiny. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sand </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 567, 570 [194 Cal.Rptr. 480, 668 P.2d 787].) Third, if the clear meaning of the statutory language is not evident after attempting to ascertain its ordinary meaning or its meaning as derived from legislative intent, we will \u201capply reason, practicality, and common sense to the language at hand. If possible, the words should be interpreted to make them workable and reasonable [citations], . . . practical [citations], in accord with common sense and justice, and to avoid an absurd result [citations].\u201d <em>(Halbert\u2019s Lumber, supra, </em>at pp. 1239-1240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">We will conform to this three-step procedure in our interpretation of the statutory language at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">1. <em>Whether language is clear on its face</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">On its face, the language of subdivision (e) of section 12955\u2014prohibiting discrimination against \u201cany person or group of persons\u201d on the basis of source of income\u2014appears clear on its face. \u201cPerson\u201d is not limited in any way; in its ordinary sense, the language would suggest universal application to any man, woman, or child who is subjected to discrimination on the basis of his or her source of income in connection with the financing of the purchase, construction, or organization of housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>But subdivision (p)(l) of section 12955 undermines the supposedly clear meaning of \u201cany person or group of persons\u201d in subdivision (e). While the definition of \u201csource of income\u201d found in subdivision (p)(l) does not compel the conclusion that subdivision (e) prohibits source-of-income discrimination only in the context of persons seeking rental housing, the collision of these two subdivisions creates an ambiguity unresolved by the first step of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">Accordingly, we will attempt to ascertain the meaning of the statute by examining legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">2. <em>Legislative intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">Master Financial in its demurrer contended that the Legislature\u2019s clear intent was to make the provisions concerning source of income discrimination applicable only in the landlord-tenant context. It cited certain language purportedly describing the purpose of the bill ultimately enacted in 1999 to amend section 12955.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The language, describing a version of Senate Bill No. 1098 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill 1098), reads: \u201cThis bill would make it unlawful for a landlord to use specified financial or income standards for the rental of housing. The standard^] would be unlawful if it: a) fails to account for the aggregate income of persons residing together or proposing to reside together, or the aggregate income of the tenants and their co-signers, on the same basis as the aggregate income of married persons residing together or proposing to reside together; or b) uses a minimum income standard based on a multiple or percentage of the rent that, in case where there is a government rent subsidy, fails to calculate the minimum income based solely on the part of the rent to be paid by the tenant.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1098 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 7, 1999, p. 3.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">Sisemore correctly notes that the above quoted language related to an early version of Senate Bill 1098; at the time, the proposed legislation did not have \u201csource of income\u201d language as part of an amendment to section 12955. Instead, it proposed the inclusion (as subds. (m) and (n) of \u00a7 12955) of language prohibiting the failure to account for certain income of actual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>prospective tenants as. outlined in the language quoted in the preceding paragraph. The proposed legislation was amended in July 1999, at which time appeared the \u201csource of income\u201d language that ultimately became part of the 1999 amendment to section 12955. Therefore, we conclude that the language cited by Master Financial in its demurrer does not support the conclusion that the legislative intent was to limit the class of persons protected against source-of-income discrimination to actual or prospective tenants seeking rental housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Master Financial also asserts that a heading to and introductory language concerning Senate Bill 1098 support its position regarding legislative intent. Specifically, it cites the following heading and preamble to a committee report for the proposed legislation: \u201cSUBJECT [f] Landlord and Tenant Law\u2014Rights of Parties upon Termination of Section 8 Contracts\u2014Rental Information and Criteria\u2014[][] DESCRIPTION [][] This bill would amend the landlord/tenant laws as follows: . . .\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1098 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 7, 1999, p. 1.) But as we have noted, this description concerned an early iteration of Senate Bill 1098 that preceded its amendment in which source-of-income language appeared. Further, we find such descriptions in headings to analyses of proposed legislation to have little or no value in ascertaining legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">Of some significance here in evaluating legislative intent is a portion of the legislative counsel\u2019s digest of the final version of Senate Bill 1098: \u201cThis bill would, until January 1, 2005, prohibit discrimination under [FEHA] on the basis of a <em>person\u2019s </em>source of income, the failure to account for the aggregate income of coresidents, or the failure to exclude a government rent subsidy from that portion of the rent to be paid by the <em>tenant </em>in assessing his or her eligibility for rental housing.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 1098 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) Stats. 1999, ch. 590, italics added.) The legislative counsel\u2019s use of the term \u201cperson\u201d in the first clause to describe the class of individuals who would be protected under the bill against source-of-income discrimination\u2014particularly when juxtaposed against the term \u201ctenant\u201d in the second clause-supports plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that subdivision (e) of section 12955 was intended to protect all persons, not just tenants or prospective tenants, against source-of-income discrimination. (See <em>Harris, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 1157, fn. 6 [courts may \u201cascribe[] to the Legislature the intentions expressed in the Legislative\u2019s Counsel\u2019s Digest of a statutory amendment\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">In our effort to ascertain the intent of the Legislature here, we are mindful of the observation of Justice Sills that \u201creading the tea leaves of legislative history is often no easy matter. Even assuming there is such a thing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>meaningful collective intent, courts can get it wrong when what they have before them is a motley collection of authors\u2019 statements, committee reports, internal memoranda and lobbyist letters. ... In light of these factors, the wisest course is to rely on legislative history only when that history itself is unambiguous.\u201d <em>(J.A. Jones Construction Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 1578.) After consideration of the matter, we believe that it would be imprudent to render a conclusive interpretation of the 1999 amendment to section 12955 on the basis of legislative intent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">3. <em>Application of reason and common sense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">The court below interpreted the \u201csource of income\u201d protections of section 12955 as \u201cprohibiting] discrimination on the basis of a person\u2019s source of income in assessing his or her eligibility for rental housing\u201d only. It thus restricted the statute to affording protection only to tenants or prospective tenants, and then, only in the context of source-of-income discrimination by a landlord in a lease transaction. In effect, the court held that section 12955, subdivision (p)(l)\u2019s \u201csource of income\u201d definition trumped other subdivisions of the statute that facially provide protection against source-of-income discrimination to <em>all </em>persons. We conclude that this was an erroneous interpretation of the statute for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">First, this narrow interpretation ascribes little significance to the fact that section 12955 appears on its face to provide broad protection against source-of-income discrimination in a variety of housing contexts, and not simply to landlord-tenant situations. It is not only subdivision (e) of section 12955\u2014the subdivision at issue here\u2014that appears to afford broad protection to all persons against source-of-income discrimination. Subdivision (a) of section 12955 makes it unlawful \u201c[f]or the owner of any housing accommodation to discriminate against or harass any person because of [the person\u2019s] . . . source of income . .. . \u201d Subdivision (c) of section 12955 \u00a1prohibits the printing or publication of \u201cany notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a housing accommodation that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on . . . source of income .. . .\u201d Further, subdivision (i) prohibits one \u201cwhose business involves real estate-related transactions [from] discriminating] against any person in making available a transaction, or in the terms and conditions of a transaction, because of. . . source of income . . . .\u201d And subdivision (j) makes it unlawful \u201c[t]o deny a person access to, or membership or participation in, a multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>listing service, real estate brokerage organization, or other service because of . . . source of income ...\u201d Moreover, apparently broad proscriptions against source-of-income discrimination appear in four other subdivisions of section 12955. (See \u00a7 12955, subds. (d), (h), (k), <em>(l).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">None of, the nine subdivisions of the statute that make reference to prohibiting source-of-income discrimination, on their face, appears to limit either the class of potential discriminatees to actual or prospective tenants or the proscription to landlord-tenant relationships. The trial court\u2019s construction of the statute fails to harmonize\u2014and in fact creates conflict between\u2014the nine subdivisions of section 12955 appearing to provide broad coverage for source-of-income discrimination, on the one hand, and subdivision (p)(l), on the other hand. (See <em>Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Verjil </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 205, 218 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 73, 138 P.3d 220] [provisions that are related \u201c \u2018should be read together and construed in a manner that gives effect to each, yet does not lead to disharmony with the others\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323] [\u201c[Statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">Second, an interpretation limiting persons protected against source-of-income discrimination under subdivision (e) of section 12955 to tenants or prospective tenants would conflict with our duty to make the language of the statute \u201c \u2018workable and reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Regents of University of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 529, 537 [91 Cal.Rptr. 57, 476 P.2d 457], fn. omitted.) Rather than make section 12955, in its entirety, \u201cwork,\u201d the trial court\u2019s construction would result in subdivision (e)\u2014as well as eight other subdivisions\u2014being applied to individual cases in a much more restrictive manner than appears warranted by the statutory language. The across-the-board limitation of source-of-income discriminatees under section 12955 to tenants or prospective tenants is not a construction that makes the statutory language reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">Third, we believe that allowing section 12955, subdivision (p)(1) to effectively trump the nine preceding subdivisions of section 12955 by severely restricting the statute\u2019s protections against source-of-income discrimination would <em>not </em>be \u201cin accord with common sense and justice.\u201d <em>(Halbert\u2019s Lumber, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1239.) FEHA is to be liberally construed. (\u00a7 12933; <em>Auburn Woods I Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1578, 1590 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 669] <em>(Auburn Woods); </em>see generally <em>People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Muller </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 263, 269 [203 Cal.Rptr. 772, 681 P.2d 1340] [remedial statute should be liberally construed to promote its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>objectives].) An interpretation of section 12955 limiting the statute\u2019s apparently broad source-of-income discrimination protections to landlord-tenant circumstances would indeed be a narrow one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Fourth, the trial court\u2019s construction of the statute does not avoid, but in fact promotes, an absurd result. <em>(Wasatch Property Management v. Degrate </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1111, 1122 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 112 P.3d 647] [a \u201cstatute should be interpreted to avoid an absurd result\u201d].) It would make the apparent broad protections against source-of-income discrimination found in nine different subdivisions of section 12955 virtually meaningless. The application of source-of-income discrimination only to tenants or prospective tenants would render nugatory the \u201csource of income\u201d language in various subdivisions of the statute. For example, it is doubtful that section 12955, subdivision (j)\u2014proscribing discrimination in connection with access to, membership in, or participation in, a multiple listing service, a real estate brokerage organization, or other services\u2014would realistically prohibit any source-of-income discrimination if the only potential discriminatees were actual or prospective tenants. More to the point here, it is difficult to imagine that section 12955, subdivision (e) would have any real-world application if its source-of-income discrimination prohibitions to loans made to assist in \u201cthe purchase, organization, or construction of any housing accommodation\u201d applied only to tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">We therefore conclude that subdivision (p)(l) of section. 12955 does not confine the protections afforded to potential discriminatees under section 12955, subdivision (e) to tenants or potential tenants seeking rental housing. Rather, since subdivision (e) prohibits source-of-income discrimination by \u201cany person, bank, mortgage company or other financial institution that provides financial assistance for the purchase, organization, or construction of any housing accommodation,\u201d the \u201csource of income\u201d definition in subdivision (p)(l) should be. read as having potential application only when the potential discriminatee is a tenant or potential tenant and the potential discrimination arises out of efforts to seek rental housing. In this manner, the apparent broad protections against source-of-income discrimination afforded under subdivision (e) are harmonized with subdivision (p)(l)\u2019s definition of \u201csource of income\u201d in the context of potential tenant discrimination. Moreover, such an interpretation is a liberal construction of FEHA that is in furtherance of its broad objectives to proscribe discrimination in the employment and housing settings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Plaintiffs have alleged that Master Financial discriminated against them on the basis of their source of income in connection with their efforts to obtain financial assistance to purchase a housing accommodation. They have stated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>viable claim for intentional discrimination under section 12955, subdivision (e). The demurrer to the third cause of action of the Complaint should therefore have been overruled.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">C. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Disparate Impact Claims Under FEHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0U\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Plaintiffs contend that their respective claims under FEHA are viable under an alternative theory of disparate impact discrimination. They argue that Master Financial\u2019s practice of not lending to family daycare home operators, while arguably facially neutral, had a disparate impact on protected classes\u2014 gender and familial status. As noted above, the court rejected this contention, concluding that the allegations of the Complaint merely showed \u201cthat the discriminatory practices affect licensed home day care providers as a group. The FEHA does not protect this group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that a disparate impact theory of discrimination is applicable to FEHA claims. They contend that the Complaint properly alleged both elements of such a theory: (1) the existence of an outwardly neutral policy (i.e., no loans to family daycare home operators); and (2) Master Financial\u2019s lending practice, regardless of its intent, had the effect of discriminating on the basis of gender and familial status without a sufficient business justification for that practice. Thus plaintiffs assert, as the policy is alleged to have had a significant adverse or disproportionate effect upon one or more protected classes, the third cause of action states a cognizable disparate impact claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">Master Financial responds that the lending policy claimed to be discriminatory involved economic rather than personal characteristics. Further, family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>daycare home providers are not recognized as a protected class under FEHA; thus, the trial court properly rejected the disparate impact claim. Moreover, Master Financial asserts that FEHA does not prevent lenders from taking business factors into consideration as criteria in deciding whether to make loans; here, it was proper for Master Financial to reject the proposed collateral (real property to be used for family daycare) in determining whether to make a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">We address the merits of these contentions below.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">2. <em>Viability of disparate impact theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">As a threshold matter, we consider whether a FEHA housing discrimination claim may be founded on a disparate impact theory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude that this theory is recognized both under the California statute (\u00a7 12955.8, subd. (b)) and under federal decisional authority applicable to FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">A disparate' impact theory, as an alternative to a theory of disparate treatment (or intentional discrimination), is recognized in the context of employment discrimination claims under FEHA. <em>(Carter v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1321 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 519] <em>(Carter).) </em>As explained by our Supreme Court: \u201c \u2018Disparate treatment\u2019 is <em>intentional </em>discrimination against one or more persons on prohibited grounds. [Citations.] Prohibited discrimination may also be found on a theory of \u2018disparate impact,\u2019 i.e., that regardless of motive, a <em>facially neutral </em>employer practice or policy, bearing no manifest relationship to job requirements, <em>in fact </em>had a disproportionate adverse effect on members of the. protected class. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, fn. 20 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">The parties have cited no case authority specifically holding that a disparate impact housing discrimination claim may be asserted under FEHA\u2014as opposed to a FEHA employment discrimination claim. But plaintiffs urge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>section 12955.8 authorizes such a housing discrimination theory: \u201cFor purposes of this article,[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] in connection with unlawful practices: [][]... [][] (b) Proof of a violation causing a discriminatory effect is shown if an act or failure to act that is otherwise covered by this part, and that has the effect, regardless of intent, of unlawfully discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, disability, national origin, or ancestry. . . .\u201d While there have been no reported decisions addressing the meaning and application of this statute, section 12955.8, subdivision (b) plainly authorizes a claim for housing discrimination irrespective of intent, where the alleged act or omission has the effect of discriminating on the basis of one\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, disability, national origin, or ancestry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">The legislative history of section 12955.8 supports this conclusion. The Senate Judiciary Committee Report concerning Assembly Bill No. 2244 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.)\u2014the 1993 legislation that included the enactment of section 12955.8 (see Stats. 1993, ch. 1277, \u00a7 7, p. 7517)\u2014makes it plain that the Legislature wished to recognize expressly that discrimination under FEHA could be based upon either disparate treatment or disparate impact. \u201cThis bill specifically provides that violation of the FEHA may be established by proving that (a) an act or failure to act demonstrates an intent to discriminate in violation of the FEHA or (b) an act or failure to act has the effect, regardless of intent, of unlawful discrimination. HO The federal courts have generally held that violations of federal fair housing laws can be established by proving discriminatory effect. [Citations.] [][]... [f] Discriminatory effect is demonstrated by application of a \u2018disparate impact analysis.\u2019 This analysis permits <em>a </em>complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that a respondent\u2019s practice or policies have an adverse impact on a statutory[ily] protected class (e.g., race, religion, sex, etc.). Once the prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the respondent to justify the challenged practice or policy. . . .\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2244 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 24, 1993, p. 10.) The analysis cited several disparate impact cases<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> decided under the federal housing discrimination laws. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2244 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) p. 10.) It also noted that FEHA as it existed in 1993 (former section 12955.6) provided that \u201cnothing in it \u2018shall be construed to abrogate or limit the holding in <em>Keith v. Volpe[,] </em>858 F.2d 467[,] relating to discriminatory effect.[\u2019] In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>case, ... the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s finding that a violation of the [federal housing discrimination laws] had been established by evidence of discriminatory effect.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2244 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) p. II.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The legislative history of section 12955.8 clearly demonstrates the recognition that housing discrimination under FEHA may be established either by disparate treatment or by disparate impact. (See also Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2244 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 28, 1993.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Moreover, even absent this statutory authority, \u201c[t]he Legislature sought to make the FEHA \u2018 \u201csubstantially equivalen^]\u201d \u2019 [citation] to the federal Fair Housing Act and its amendments (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq.) . . . .\u201d <em>(Konig </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 743, 749 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 50 P.3d 718]; see also <em>Broadmoor San Clemente Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1, 6-7, 8 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 316].) Accordingly, \u201c[c]ourts often look to cases construing the FHA, . . . when interpreting FEHA\u201d <em>(Auburn Woods, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1591), and federal authority plainly authorizes disparate impact housing discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act (FHA). (See <em>Betsey v. Turtle Creek Associates, supra, </em>736 F.2d 986; <em>Keith v. Volpe, supra, </em>858 F.2d 482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">To present a prima facie disparate impact case under the federal statute (the FHA), \u201ca plaintiff must show at least that the defendant\u2019s actions had a discriminatory effect. [Citations.] Discriminatory effect means that \u2018the conduct of the defendant actually or predictably results in [prohibited] discrimination. . . . \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Keith v. Volpe, supra, </em>858 F.2d at p. 482, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>City of Black Jack, Missouri, supra, </em>508 F.2d at pp. 1184-1185.) The plaintiff need not show a discriminatory intent to establish a disparate impact claim under the FHA. <em>(Pfaff v. U.S. Dept. of Housing </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 88 F.3d 739, 745-746.) Rather, the essential premise of an FHA disparate impact claim \u201c \u2018is that some [housing] practices, adopted without a deliberately discriminatory motive, may in operation be functionally equivalent to intentional discrimination.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mountain Side Mobile Estates v. Secretary of HUD </em>(10th Cir. 1995) 56 F.3d 1243, 1250-1251, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">For example, a facially neutral practice of refusing to rent to a prospective tenant receiving AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) benefits was nonetheless held to have had a discriminatory effect upon a protected class (families with children) to support a housing discrimination claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>the FHA. <em>(Gilligan </em>v. <em>Jamco Development Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 108 F.3d 246.) Similarly, while an all-adult policy for an apartment building may have been facially nondiscriminatory\u2014because, at the time, families with children were not a protected class\u2014a disparate impact claim was held maintainable where it had a disproportionately adverse impact on minority tenants. <em>(Betsey </em>v. <em>Turtle Creek Associates, supra, </em>736 F.2d at p. 988.) Likewise, a municipality\u2019s refusal to approve a low to moderate income housing development for tenants displaced by a freeway was held to have had a disproportionate effect under the FHA because two-thirds of the displaced low-income tenants were minorities. <em>(Keith v. Volpe, supra, </em>858 F.2d at p. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">In <em>Gilligan, Betsey, Keith, </em>and other disparate impact cases, the challenged policy appears benign because it applies on its face to a group of individuals who are not members of a protected class. But the implementation of that policy has a disproportionate adverse effect upon members of a class that <em>is </em>protected. In this instance, the facially neutral practices are the alleged refusal to (1) make loans to daycare homes, and (2) fund mortgage loans where the source of income used to qualify for the loan is the operation of a daycare home. Because of the residency requirements for such facilities (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1596.78), these practices effectively constitute the refusal to make loans to family home daycare operators. (Cf. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cisneros </em>(6th Cir. 1995) 52 F.3d 1351, 1360 [holding that scope of FHA was broad enough to include \u201credlining,\u201d where discriminatory practice of limiting availability of property insurance directly impacted person\u2019s ability to obtain housing].) Plaintiffs have alleged further that this facially neutral policy had a disproportionately negative impact on members of two protected classes\u2014women and families with children, because licensed daycare home providers in Santa Clara County are made up of higher percentages of women and families with children than the percentages of those groups as reflected in the County\u2019s general population. Therefore, since plaintiffs have alleged facts in the Complaint \u201cof a violation causing a discriminatory effect\u201d by alleging practices \u201cthat [have] the effect, regardless of intent, of unlawfully discriminating on the basis of . . . sex [or] . . . familial status\u201d (\u00a7 12955.8, subd. (b)), they have properly pleaded a disparate impact housing discrimination claim under FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">But the court below reasoned that plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action because the Complaint alleges only discrimination against licensed home daycare providers, a class that is not protected under FEHA. This rationale for sustaining the demurrer was flawed. As we have noted, the essence of a disparate impact claim is that a challenged policy, while facially neutral (i.e., not evidencing intentional discrimination against a protected class), in practice and effect is discriminatory toward a particular protected class. <em>(Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 354, fn. 20.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>Thus, the fact that Master Financial\u2019s policies, on their face, impacted an unprotected class (i.e., family daycare home operators) does not preclude a disparate impact claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Master Financial claims that its challenged policies concern economic matters and do not discriminate (even indirectly) on the basis of personal characteristics. But there is nothing in F\u00c9HA that remotely suggests that housing discrimination\u2014either disparate treatment or disparate impact discrimination\u2014does not occur if the act or omission involved economic choices (rather than ones based upon personal characteristics). And the federal statute (the FHA) does not contain a limitation that housing.discrimination must be based upon personal characteristics. (See, e.g., <em>Gilligan </em>v. <em>Jamco Development Corp., supra, </em>108 F.3d 246 [challenging policy of excluding prospective tenants with AFDC income]; <em>National Fair Housing Alli. v. Prudential Ins. Co. </em>(D.D.C. 2002) 208 F.Supp.2d 46 [challenging homeowners insurer\u2019s \u201credlining\u201d policy as having disparate impact on minorities seeking to purchase homes in certain regions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">In addition, Master Financial asserts that <em>Carter, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th 1313, a case cited by the trial court in its ruling, is controlling. There, the plaintiff alleged that her employer\u2019s reorganization demoting administrative managers\" had a disparate impact on women and persons \"over 40. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1321.) But she asserted erroneously that \u201cadministrative managers were a \u2018protected group.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1322.) The appellate court concluded that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence at trial to support a disparate impact claim because \u201cher data set was incomplete\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1325); she had failed to present statistical evidence detailing the percentage of women and persons over 40 in the control group of all employees to compare it with the administrative managers affected by the company policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1325-1326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\"><em>Carter </em>is not controlling. First, <em>Carter </em>was an employment discrimination case decided after a trial; the appellate court held that the defendant\u2019s JNOV (judgment notwithstanding the verdict) motion should have been granted due to the absence of plaintiff\u2019s evidentiary showing. <em>(Carter, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at p. 1326.) Here, we examine only whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient ultimate facts in support of their disparate impact housing discrimination claim to survive demurrer. Second, in contrast to the circumstances in Carter\u2014where the plaintiff made the erroneous assertion \u201cthat administrative managers were a \u2018protected group\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1322)\u2014 plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact claim here is not so ill-founded. As noted, plaintiffs do not claim that daycare home operators are a protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>Third, plaintiffs here have alleged an adequate foundation for their disparate impact claim. They have asserted that Master Financial\u2019s policies disproportionately affected women and families with children because those two protected classes comprise a much higher percentage of daycare home operators in Santa Clara County than the percentages of those groups found generally in the county. (See <em>Charleston Housing Auth. v. U.S. Dept. of Agric. </em>(8th Cir. 2005) 419 F.3d 729, 741 [tenants of public housing units slated for demolition established prima facie case that proposed action had disparate impact on minorities]; <em>Mountain Side Mobile Estates v. Secretary of HUD, supra, </em>56 F.3d at p. 1251 [noting that a number of cases determined existence of disparate impact under the FHA \u201cbased on statistical evidence regarding the narrowly defined area in question\u201d].) In contrast, the plaintiff in <em>Carter </em>failed to present any evidence as to the composition of all employees of the company in order to determine whether the challenged policy in fact had a disparate impact on women and persons over 40. <em>(Carter, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1325-1326.) Thus, for all the court in <em>Carter </em>knew, the composition of women and persons over 40 in the company\u2019s employment roster as a whole was at least equal to the percentages of those groups in the subset (i.e., administrative managers) directly affected by the challenged policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">We therefore hold that section 12955.8, subdivision (b) authorizes a housing discrimination claim where the effect of the alleged practice was to discriminate against a person on the basis of, inter alia, his or her gender or familial status, irrespective of whether that discrimination was intentional. We conclude further that plaintiffs have stated a claim under this statute. Master Financial may ultimately disprove the allegations that its policies had a disparate impact upon women or families with children. It may ultimately defeat plaintiffs\u2019 claims by, for example, establishing that its lending policy was justified by business necessity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The allegations, however, are sufficient to sustain a disparate impact claim at this early pleading stage. (See <em>Construction Protective Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>TIG Specialty Ins. Co., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 199.) The demurrer to the third cause of action should have been overruled because the Complaint adequately stated a disparate impact claim under FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>D. <em>Project Sentinel\u2019s Standing to Sue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Master Financial contended in its demurrer that Project Sentinel lacked standing to maintain the third cause of action. The court did not specifically rule on this issue, having sustained the demurrer based upon a finding that neither plaintiff had stated a cause of action under FEHA. Master Financial renews this position on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">FEHA authorizes the filing of suit by \u201c[a]n aggrieved person\u201d to seek relief for a discriminatory housing practice or a breach of a conciliation agreement. (\u00a7 12989.1.) The act defines \u201caggrieved person\u201d as \u201cincluding] any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that the person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.\u201d (\u00a7 12927, subd. (g).) FEHA (\u00a7 12927, subd. (f)) further defines \u201cperson\u201d by reference to the federal definition of that term under FHA, section 3602(d) of title 42 of the United States Code, which reads: \u201c \u2018Person\u2019 includes one or more individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, labor organizations, legal representatives, mutual companies, joint-stock companies, trusts, unincorporated organizations, trustees, trustees in cases under title 11 [bankruptcy], receivers, and fiduciaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">As we have noted, California courts often refer to federal decisional authority under the FHA in their interpretation of FEHA. <em>(Auburn Woods, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1591; <em>Brown v. Smith </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 767, 781 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 301]; <em>Broadmoor San Clemente Homeowners Assn. v. Nelson, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 6-7.) In <em>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 363 [71 L.Ed.2d 214, 102 S.Ct. 1114] <em>(Havens Realty), </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a nonprofit housing group had standing to bring suit under the FHA for alleged racial discrimination in housing. In so holding, the court held that the organization, by alleging that it had been required to devote significant resources to address the defendant\u2019s practices, had claimed injury on its own behalf. <em>(Havens Realty, </em>at p. 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">In <em>Walker </em>v. <em>City of Lakewood </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 272 F.3d 1114, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal followed <em>Havens Realty </em>in reaching the conclusion that an independent fair housing services provider had standing to bring a claim under the FHA and FEHA. There, the court concluded that the provider had suffered injury in fact to support standing under the FHA, based upon allegations that the city with which it had contracted to provide services had retaliated against it and thwarted its ability to provide fair housing counseling services. (272 F.3d at pp. 1124-1125.) The Ninth Circuit held further that because the fair housing services provider had standing under the federal law, it likewise had standing under FEHA. (272 F.3d at pp. 1125-1126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>Lastly, Project Sentinel cites a decision of the Fair Employment and Housing Commission. In <em>Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Green </em>(1986) No. 86-07, FEHC Precedential Decisions 1986-1987, CEB 1, page 7, the Commission rejected the argument that a fair housing agency (Council) lacked standing to sue under FEHA. It reasoned: \u201cIn <em>Havens Realty[, supra,] </em>455 U.S. 363 [102 S.Ct. 1114], the Supreme Court held that a housing group very similar to the Council would have standing to sue under the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604) if it could demonstrate that the need to send testers out to check the defendant\u2019s rental practices had drained money from the group\u2019s counseling and referral programs. We determine that the same rationale confers standing on the Council here, because the evidence amply demonstrates that the Council has suffered the diversion of resources the Department claims. Investigating a complaint of discrimination against respondent diverted resources away from the Council\u2019s landlord-tenant counseling and public education activities.\u201d <em>(Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing </em>v. <em>Green, </em>at p. 7, fn. omitted.) While this decision is not controlling <em>(Smith v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 1143, 1157 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 700, 913 P.2d 909]), we believe it has significant bearing on our resolution of the standing question here. <em>(See Auburn Woods, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1591 [\u201cCommission\u2019s interpretation of FEHA \u2018is entitled to great respect\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">Master Financial cites this court\u2019s decision in <em>Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair Housing v. Westwood Investors </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1377 [271 Cal.Rptr. 99] <em>(Midpeninsula </em>Citizens) in support of its contention that Project Sentinel lacks standing. There, a nonprofit corporation involved in eliminating housing discrimination brought suit under the Act to challenge an apartment building\u2019s rental policy alleged to have been discriminatory. <em>(Midpeninsula Citizens, </em>at p. 1380.) The plaintiff contended that it was an \u201caggrieved person\u201d under Civil Code section 52. <em>(Midpeninsula Citizens, </em>at p. 1382.) It urged us to apply <em>Havens Realty, supra, </em>455 U.S. 363, to find standing, a contention that we rejected because <em>Havens Realty </em>involved standing under a very different statute (the FHA) in which Congress intended to confer broad standing to sue. <em>(Midpeninsula Citizens, supra, </em>at pp. 1385-1386.) We concluded that, based upon a focused review of the Act and cases decided under it, the plaintiff did not have standing to sue: \u201c[The] Legislature has specifically conferred standing to sue under the Unruh Act upon the victims of the discriminatory practices and certain designated others, i.e., district or city attorneys or the Attorney General. [Citations.] The California courts have not seen fit to endorse a more expansive interpretation of these standing requirements, and we decline to do so in this case.\u201d <em>(Midpeninsula Citizens, </em>at p. 1386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number><em>Midpeninsula Citizens </em>does not compel our conclusion here that Project Sentinel lacks standing. As we noted there: \u201cStanding requirements will vary from statute to statute based upon the intent of the Legislature and the purpose for which the particular statute was enacted.\u201d <em>(Midpeninsula Citizens, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1385.) Our high court has very recently reiterated this very point. (See <em>Angelucci v. Century Supper Club, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 175.) Here, we address standing as it applies to a FEHA claim, and we are persuaded by <em>Havens Realty, supra, </em>455 U.S. 363, and its progeny that have found the existence of standing under the FHA under circumstances similar to those presented here. Since Project Sentinel has alleged that it has been required to divert scarce resources to address Master Financial\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct, we conclude that Project Sentinel is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under section 12989.1 and has standing to assert a FEHA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">VII. <em>Claim Under the UCL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">Business and Professions Code section 17200 provides: \u201cAs used in this chapter, unfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500) of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.\u201d As our high court has stated, \u201c[t]he Legislature intended this \u2018sweeping language\u2019 to include \u2018 \u201canything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bank of the West v.

Included among such practices that may be the basis for a UCL claim are alleged violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act <em>(Midpeninsula Citizens, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1389-1393; <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v.

But the Supreme Court did <em>not </em>hold that the additional categories recognized in prior decisions would continue to receive protection under the Act only if they possessed strictly \u201cpersonal\u201d characteristics. And, as we have noted, the court did not overrule the holding in <em>Long, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 1287, that the Act prohibits arbitrary occupational-status discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">As this was the only language quoted by Master Financial in its demurrer, it is apparent that this was the legislative history upon which the court based its conclusion that subdivision (e) of section 12955 applied only to source-of-income discrimination in connection with determining a person\u2019s eligibility for rental housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">In its appellate brief, Master Financial does not repeat this language or renew the argument that this particular language compels the conclusion that the legislative intent was to limit source-of-income discrimination under section 12955 to actions taken against persons seeking rental housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">Part of the difficulty here with \u201creading the tea leaves of legislative history\u201d is that the 1999 amendment to section 12955 was actually a conglomeration of portions of four separate pieces of legislation, each of which addressed distinct issues. (See Sen. Bill No. 1148 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.); Sen. Bill 1098; Assem. Bill No. 1670 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.); Assem. Bill No. 1001 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">The conclusion that the Complaint was sufficient to survive demurrer is, of course, not an expression of an opinion regarding the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. It may very well be the case that plaintiffs will be unable to establish the discriminatory treatment by Master Financial that they allege. <em>(Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 199 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 57 P.3d 372] [acknowledging that, while complaint stated prima facie case for relief sufficient to survive demurrer, the defendant could raise the same challenges later by motion for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment].) But on reviewing the propriety of sustaining a demurrer to a complaint without leave to amend, we are not concerned with whether the plaintiff ultimately may be able to prove the allegations in his or her pleading. <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 496; cf. <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 232, 236 [40 L.Ed.2d 90, 94 S.Ct. 1683], overruled on other grounds in <em>Davis v. Scherer </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 183, 191 [82 L.Ed.2d 139, 104 S.Ct. 3012] [\u201cThe issue [on the propriety of dismissing a complaint] is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims. Indeed it may appear on the face of the pleadings that a recovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not the test\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">Although we have concluded, <em>ante, </em>that the demurrer to the third cause of action should have been overruled because it stated a viable claim for intentional discrimination under FEHA, we address plaintiffs\u2019 additional disparate impact theory in order to provide guidance to the trial court because of the likelihood that the issue will be raised again. (See <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority </em>v. <em>Continental Development Corp. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 694, 719. [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 630, 941 P.2d 809]; <em>Hale v.
