J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApK\">Christopher Bryan King appeals from the judgment (order granting probation) entered upon his conviction by plea of guilty to violating the registration requirements of Penal Code section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by failing to register a change of address during a probationary term on a prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Appellant contends that when hn individual\u2019s obligation to register as a sexual offender is premised solely on a condition of probation M a nonregistrable offense, he does not violate section 290 when he fails to notify law enforcement of a change of address.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">We conclude that appellant was not ordered to register pursuant to section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E), and therefore he could not be convicted of violating section 290.'We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">In July 2002, in case No: MA024039, appellant pled no contest to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor (\u00a7 261.5) in return for a five-year grant of probation on various terms and conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among the agreed-upon conditions of probation was the requirement that appellant register as a sex offender during the five-year probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">On March 8, 2006, a complaint was filed charging that between December 21, 2005, and February 21, 2006, appellant, \u201cbeing a person required to register based on conditions of probation granted, did willfully, knowingly, and unlawfully violate the registration provision of Penal Code section 290\u201d and that he thereby committed a felony violation of section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">Appellant entered into a plea agreement under which he pled guilty to the charged offense in return for service of 120 days in county jail prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>sentencing, at which- time he would be granted probation. The trial court acknowledged, based upon a statement .by appellant\u2019s trial counsel, that appellant would seek a certificate of probable cause to preserve his right to appeal the issue of whether \u201csomeone required to register under [section] 290 as a probation condition for a conviction of [section] 261.5 can be convicted of a new violation of [section] 290.\u201d After appellant served his jail term, the trial court suspended imposition of judgment and placed him on probation for three years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>Appellant obtained a certificate of probable cause, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Section 290, subdivision (a)(1)(A) provides, \u201cEvery person described in paragraph (2), for the rest of his or her life while residing in California . . . shall be req\u00fcired to register . . within five working days of coming into, or changing his or her residence within, any city, county, or city and county . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">Paragraph (2) of section 290, subdivision (a) provides, \u201cThe following persons shall be required to register pursuant to paragraph (1): .. .[][]. . . [f] (E) Any person ordered by any court to register pursuant to this section for any offense not included specifically in this section[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] if the court finds at the time of conviction or sentencing that the person committed the offense as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification. The court shall state on the record the reasons for its findings and the reasons for requiring registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">With exceptions not here relevant, \u201cany person who is required to register under this section based on a felony conviction . . . who willfiilly violates any requirement of this section ... is guilty of a felony . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 290, subd. (a)(2)(G)(ii)(g)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">Section 261.5, unlawful sexu\u00e1l intercourse with a minor, is not an offense enumerated in section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(A), and a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>convicted of that offense is not subject to a mandatory lifetime registration obligation under section 290, subdivision (a)(1)(A). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hofsheier </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1185, 1197 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 821, 129 P.3d 29] <em>(Hofsheier).) </em>If a court imposes a discretionary registration requirement upon a person convicted of violating section 261.5, it must comply with the requirements set forth in section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E). <em>(Hofsheier, supra, </em>at p. 1197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Appellant contends that he was not ordered to register pursuant to the provisions of section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E), and that his failure to register was simply a violation of his condition of probation, rather than a violation of section 290. We agree. While the trial court could have imposed a registration requirement pursuant to section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E), the record establishes that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Under section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E), a trial court may order a person convicted of a nonenumerated offense to register \u201cpursuant to this section.\u201d By its terms, section 290 imposes a registration requirement on the individual \u201cfor the rest of his or her life . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 290, subd. (a)(1)(A).) Here, the trial court specifically limited the registration requirement to the five-year period during which appellant was on probation for the unlawful sexual intercourse offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">Moreover, a registration requirement for a nonenumerated offense such as unlawful sexual intercourse may only be imposed \u201cif the court finds at the time of conviction or sentencing that the person committed the offense as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification\u201d and the court \u201cstate[s] on the record the reasons for its findings and the reasons for requiring registration.\u201d (\u00a7 290, subd. (a)(2)(E).) \u201c[T]o implement the requirements of section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E), the trial court must engage in a two-step process: (1) it must find whether the offense was committed as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification, and state the reasons for these findings; and (2) it must state the reasons for requiring lifetime registration as a sex offender.\u201d <em>(Hofsheier, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1197.) Here, the trial court did not make the findings required under section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E) when it imposed a registration requirement as a condition of probation. We presume that the trial court was aware of and correctly applied the applicable law <em>(People v. Coddington </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>529, 644 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 528, 2 P.3d 1081], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1046, 1069, fn. 13 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 409, 25 P.3d 618]) and that, had it intended to impose a registration requirement under section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E), it would have imposed a lifetime requirement in the required fashion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the registration requirement was not imposed under the provisions of subdivision (a)(2)(E) of section 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">A trial court has broad discretion to impose conditions of probation that will foster rehabilitation of the defendant and protect the public and the victim. <em>(People v. Jungers </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 698, 701 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 873].) Notwithstanding the prosecutor\u2019s assertion\u2014which was, in any event, erroneous\u2014that registration \u201cfor any period\u201d could be imposed under section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E), the trial court did not impose the five-year registration requirement under that section. It simply imposed it as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">The record reflects that when the trial court advised appellant of the consequences of his plea to the unlawful sexual intercourse charge, it stated that appellant would have \u201c[f]ive years probation, five years of registration.\u201d At that time, the trial court stated, \u201cIf you come back and see me on a violation [of probation], I have got 270 days in county jail, or two years, nine months in state prison that I can impose upon you.\u201d The trial court did not suggest that a violation of one of the conditions of probation, the registration requirement, would constitute a new felony offense, and appellant did not agree to any such condition. A discretionary registration requirement under section 290, subdivision (a)(2)(E) may not be grafted onto a plea bargain when it was not included in the agreement. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Olea </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1292, 1297-1298 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 722].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">Since appellant was not \u201cordered ... to register pursuant to this section\u201d (\u00a7 290, subd. (a)(2)(E)), he did not violate section 290 by failing to register. His conviction of violating section 290 must be reversed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">The-plea of guilty to violating section 290, subdivision .(a)(2)(E) is vacated, the judgment (order granting probation) is reversed, and the complaint,is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">Ashmann-Gerst, J., and Chavez, J., concurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>have provided the suppliers with a windfall for damages for pain and suffering prior to the death of the machinist\u2019s mate. (Opinion by Simons, J., with Jones, P. J., and Needham, J., concurring.)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1070-13\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1070-14\">We have taken judicial notice of the transcript'of the July 15, 2002, plea and sentencing in the prior case, case No. MA024039. The record discloses that appellant, age 27, engaged in sex with a 16-year-old girl.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">At the time appellant entered his plea in this case, he admitted a violation of probation in case No. MA024039 \u201cfor failing to obey all laws by picking up a new felony conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">Subparagraph (A) of section 290, subdivision (a)(2) enumerates the offenses for which a conviction requires the defendant to register pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">Contrary to respondent\u2019s assertion, we do not read appellant\u2019s contention as a claim that the trial court could not subject him to a lifetime registration requirement because it did not make the required factual findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">The failure to register may, of course, constitute a violation of probation in case No. MA024039. Appellant states that he does not challenge \u201chis sentence for the probation violation\u201d in that case. That matter, in any event, is not presently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
