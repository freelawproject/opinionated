A jury found Juan Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez R\u00edos guilty of voluntary manslaughter with personal use of a deadly weapon. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 192, subd. (a), 12022, subd.

Second, he argues that language in CALCRIM No. 372 absent from analogous CALJIC No. 2.52 allowing the jury to infer from his flight after the crime that he was \u201caware of his guilt\u201d impermissibly presumes the existence of his guilt and lowers the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. Third, he argues that language in CALCRIM No. 3471 absent from analogous CALJIC No. 5.56 allowing the use of deadly force in self-defense without withdrawing from the fight only if \u201cthe defendant started the fight using nondeadly force\u201d violates his rights to due process, confrontation, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">1. <em>CALCRIM No. 220</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Rios argues that language in CALCRIM No. 220 absent from analogous CALJIC No. 2.90 requiring the jury \u201cto compare and consider all the evidence\u201d impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defense by allowing the jury to hold against the defense the absence of defense evidence. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">After all of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses testified, the court responded to a juror\u2019s question by \u201cadvising you may only consider the evidence that\u2019s already been received in this case,\u201d at which point the prosecution rested and, immediately afterward, the defense rested without presenting any evidence. After instructing with CALCRIM No. 222 to \u201cdecide what the facts are in this case\u201d and \u201cto decide what happened based only on the evidence that has been presented to you in this trial,\u201d the court instructed Rios\u2019s jury with CALCRIM No. 220:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-8\">\u201cThe fact, that a criminal charge has been filed against the defendant is not evidence that the charge is true. You must not be biased against the defendant just because he has been arrested, charged with a crime or brought to trial. A defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be innocent. This presumption requires that the People prove each element of a crime and any special allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-9\">\u201cWhenever I tell you the People must prove something, I mean they must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an abiding conviction that. the charge is true. The evidence need not eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to some possible or imaginary doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>\u201cIn deciding whether the People have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, you must impartially <em>compare and consider all the evidence that was received throughout the entire trial. </em>Unless the evidence proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, he is entitled to an acquittal. You must find him not guilty.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">With reference to the italicized portion of CALCRIM No. 220, CALJIC No. 2.90 imparts essentially the same mandate to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">\u201cA defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt whether [his] [her] guilt is satisfactorily shown, [he] [she] is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. This presumption places upon the People the burden of proving [him] [her] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-7\">\u201cReasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case which, after <em>the entire comparison and consideration of all the </em>evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge.\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.90, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">CALCRIM No. 220 uses <em>verbs </em>requiring the jury to \u201ccompare and consider all the evidence that was received throughout the entire trial.\u201d CALJIC No. 2.90 uses <em>nouns </em>requiring \u201cthe entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence\u201d by the jury. Rios fails to persuade us that those grammatical differences are material. The United States Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to CALJIC No. 2.90 in part on the rationale that \u201cthe entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence\u201d language \u201cexplicitly told the jurors that their conclusion had to be based on the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>(Victor v. Nebraska </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 1, 16 [127 L.Ed.2d 583, 114 S.Ct. 1239].) The language Rios challenges in CALCRIM No. 220 did just that. The standard of review in an appellate challenge to an instruction on the ground of ambiguity is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in a way that denied fundamental fairness. (See <em>Estelle v. McGuire </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 62, 72-73 [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 112 S.Ct. 475]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].) By that standard, Rios\u2019s argument that \u201cCALCRIM No. 220 shifted the burden to him to prove the existence of reasonable doubt\u201d is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">2. <em>CALCRIM No. 372</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Rios argues that language in CALCRIM No. 372 absent from analogous CALJIC No. 2.52 allowing the jury to infer from his flight after the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>that he was \u201caware of his guilt\u201d impermissibly presumes the existence of his guilt and lowers the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The court instructed Rios\u2019s jury with CALCRIM No. 372: \u201cIf the defendant fled immediately after the crime was committed, that conduct may show that he was <em>aware of his guilt. </em>If you conclude that the defendant fled, it is up to you to decide the meaning and importance of that conduct. However, evidence that the defendant fled cannot prove guilt by itself.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Arguing that the \u201cculprit\u201d in CALCRIM No. 372 is the word \u201caware,\u201d Rios contrasts CALCRIM No. 372 (which uses that word) with CALJIC No. 2.52 (which does not) and claims that the latter instruction \u201cleft open the question whether the defendant was guilty by instructing that the defendant\u2019s flight could be considered as <em>evidence of guilt\u201d </em>but \u201cnot as <em>evidence of his awareness of his guilt\u201d </em>(italics added): \u201cThe [flight] [attempted flight] [escape] [attempted escape] [from custody] of a person [immediately] after the commission of a crime, or after [he] [she] is accused of a crime, is not sufficient in itself to establish [his] [her] guilt, but is a fact which, if proved, may be considered by you in the light of all other proved facts in deciding whether a defendant is guilty or not guilty. The weight to which this circumstance is entitled is a matter for you to decide.\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">On whether a flight instruction permitting a jury to infer \u201cawareness of guilt\u201d is constitutional, the California Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of an analogous challenge to CALJIC No. 2.52 is instructive. In <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 130 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 6 P.3d 150] <em>(Mendoza), </em>the defense argued that \u201cthe instruction creates an unconstitutional permissive inference because .it cannot be said with \u2018 \u201csubstantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 179.) Noting that a permissive inference violates due process \u201conly if the suggested conclusion is not one that reason and common sense justify in light of the proven facts before the jury,\u201d <em>Mendoza </em>held that permitting \u201ca jury to infer, if it so chooses, that the flight of a defendant immediately after the commission of a crime indicates a <em>consciousness of guilt\u201d </em>is not violative of due process. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 180, italics added.) .</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Our short etymological analysis of Rios\u2019s argument begins with, a dictionary definition of the word \u201caware\u201d: \u201cHaving knowledge or cognizance.\u201d (American Heritage Diet. (4th ed. 2000) p. 125.) In reliance on the dictionary\u2019s list of synonyms that include the word \u201caware,\u201d Rios argues that the word \u201cimplies knowledge gained through one\u2019s own perceptions or by means of information.\u201d (Italics omitted; see <em>ibid.) </em>\u201cConscious,\u201d another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>word on the list, \u201cemphasizes the recognition of something sensed or felt\u201d (id., at p. 125, italics omitted), which, of course, focuses on the acquisition of knowledge not by \u201cinformation\u201d but by \u201cperceptions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Since the dictionary defines \u201cconsciousness\u201d as \u201c[sjpecial awareness or sensitivity: class consciousness; race consciousness\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 391, italics omitted), ipso facto the special awareness that <em>Mendoza </em>allows a jury to infer from a flight instruction is \u201cguilt consciousness\u201d (in the syntax of the dictionary) or \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d (in the syntax of the California Supreme Court). (Compare American Heritage Dict., <em>supra, </em>at p. 391 (italics omitted) with <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 180.) As the inference in <em>Mendoza </em>passes constitutional muster, so does the inference here.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">On whether a flight instruction impermissibly lowers the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, the California Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of another challenge to CALJIC No. 2.52 likewise is instructive. In <em>People v. Navarette </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 458 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 89, 66 P.3d 1182] <em>(Navarette), </em>the defense argued that there might be \u201creasons for flight other than consciousness of guilt,\u201d that there might be flight \u201con account of a minor crime [the defendant] <em>did </em>commit, though he had no connection with a more serious crime he <em>did not </em>commit,\u201d and that there might be lack of \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d even if the defendant was guilty, so \u201cthe court should have instructed the jury not to consider evidence of flight unless it first concluded defendant was in fact fleeing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 502.) \u201cThe purpose of presenting evidence of flight is to establish consciousness of guilt,\u201d the court wrote, \u201cbut defendant argues the jury should first have found that defendant had a guilty conscience before considering the evidence of flight.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Navarette </em>summarily rejected that argument: \u201cDefendant\u2019s theory turns the instruction on its head.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">By parity of reasoning to both <em>Mendoza </em>and <em>Navarette, </em>we reject Rios\u2019s arguments that CALCRIM No. 372 impermissibly presumes the existence of his guilt and lowers the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">3. <em>CALCRIM No. 3471</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Rios argues that language in CALCRIM No. 3471 absent from analogous CALJIC No. 5.56 allowing the use of deadly force in self-defense without withdrawal from the fight if \u201cthe defendant started the fight using nondeadly force\u201d violates his rights to due process, confrontation, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The court instructed Rios\u2019s jury with CALCRIM No. 3471:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">\u201cA person who engages in mutual combat, or who is the first to use physical force has a right to self-defense only if, one, he actually and in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>faith tries to stop fighting; and two, he indicates by whatever conduct to his opponent in a way that a reasonable person would understand that he wants to stop fighting and that he has stopped fighting; and three, he gives his opponent a chance to stop fighting. If a person meets these requirements, he then has a right to self-defense if the opponent continues to fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\"><em>\u201cIf you decide that the defendant started the fight using nondeadly force, </em>and the opponent responded with such sudden and deadly force that the defendant could not withdraw from the fight, then the defendant had the right to defend himself with deadly force and was not required to try to stop fighting.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Rios argues that a reasonable interpretation of the first clause in the last paragraph of CALCRIM No. 3471 is \u201cthat he may use deadly force only if he started the fight and did so' with nondeadly force.\u201d He argues that the instruction differs from the last paragraph of CALJIC No. 5.56 \u201cby appearing to add a requirement that the defendant have started the fight in order for the principle to apply\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-6\">\u201cThe right of self-defense is only available to a person who engages in mutual combat:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-7\">\u201c[[1.] If [he] [she] has done all the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-8\">\u201cA [He] [She] has actually tried, in good faith, to refuse to continue fighting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-9\">\u201cB [He] [She] has by words or conduct caused [his] [her] opponent to be aware, as a reasonable person, that [he] [she] wants to stop fighting; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-10\">\u201cC [He] [She] has caused by words or conduct [his] [her] opponent to be aware, as a reasonable person, that [he] [she] has stopped fighting; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-11\">\u201cD [He] [She] has given [his] [her] opponent the opportunity to stop fighting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-12\">\u201cE After [he] [she] has done these four things, [he] [she] has the right to self-defense if [his] [her] opponent continues to fightf.]] [, or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-13\">\u201c[[2.] <em>[If the other party to the mutual combat responds in a sudden and deadly counterassault, that is, force that is excessive under the circumstance, the party victimized by the sudden excessive force need not attempt to withdraw and may use reasonably necessary force in </em>self-defense.]\u201d (CALJIC No. 5.56, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>On the premise that his \u201cdefense hinged on the principle conveyed by the last paragraph of CALCRIM No. 3471,\u201d Rios argues that he was deprived of the defense of self-defense by that \u201cambiguous\u201d paragraph. He argues that he \u201cdid not indicate his intention to withdraw from the fight, but used deadly force after Pati\u00f1o used deadly force first by throwing a bottle at him.\u201d The Attorney General argues that, even if credible, the evidence on which Rios relies \u201cwould unquestionably show that the victim no longer presented a threat of death or great bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The record refutes Rios\u2019s argument and corroborates the Attorney General\u2019s. The sole evidentiary basis of the theory of self-defense that Rios\u2019s attorney argued to the jury was the testimony of Rosa Alc\u00e1rez, who along with her boyfriend Fructoso Mercado went to the bar with Rios on the night of the homicide. Alc\u00e1rez testified that Pati\u00f1o, who had not fought with Rios earlier, threw an intact bottle at him, hitting him in the shoulder, and that Rios reached down and picked up the bottle, which had broken, and, using a single overhand right cross punch, hit Pati\u00f1o in the cheek and neck area with the bottle. No evidence showed, or even intimated, that, after throwing the bottle at Rios, Pati\u00f1o had access to, let alone used, another bottle or used \u201csudden and deadly force\u201d against Rios in any other way. A homicide detective impeached Alc\u00e1rez\u2019s testimony with her pretrial statement that the bottle Pati\u00f1o threw at Rios did not even hit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">None of the other evidence about the fatal conflict between Pati\u00f1o and Rios even intimated a possible defense of self-defense. Mercado testified that Rios fought with Pati\u00f1o inside the bar, that both men had bottles in their hands, that Rios broke the bottle in his hand against a door, and that both men kept fighting with each other outside the bar. Hilario Hern\u00e1ndez testified that from inside Mercado\u2019s car she saw Rios\u2019s \u201chand closed\u201d on Pati\u00f1o\u2019s stomach. Bartender Sara Soto testified that from behind the bar she saw Pati\u00f1o leave the bar, saw Rios break a bottle against the bar, and saw Rios leave the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">So the paragraph of CALCRIM No. 3471 to which Rios objects is simply irrelevant here. Whether or not Rios started the fight with Pati\u00f1o, there is no substantial evidence in the record that Pati\u00f1o\u2019s throwing a beer bottle at him, whether the bottle hit him in the shoulder or missed him altogether, constituted \u201csuch sudden and deadly force\u201d that Rios could not withdraw from the fight. By finding him guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the jury rejected his insubstantial defense of self-defense. His attorney accurately argued at sentencing that his crime was \u201cvoluntary manslaughter in perhaps its purest form, the heat of passion kind of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d Instruction on self-defense with CALCRIM No. 3471 simply reflected an abundance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>caution by the court. (See \u00a7 197; cf. <em>People v. Stitely </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 514, 550-552 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 108 P.3d 182].)
