J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKo\">Under the California Arbitration Act (CAA) (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1280-1294.2), a petition or response seeking to <em>correct </em>or <em>vacate </em>an arbitration award must be brought in the superior court within 100 days after service of a signed copy of the award <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1288), while a petition to <em>confirm </em>the award may be brought within four years after service <em>(ibid.). </em>(Section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Here, the arbitrator issued an award in favor of plaintiff. Defendants did not file a petition or response in the trial court to correct or vacate the award within the 100-day period. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1285-1286.8.) Three weeks after the period expired, plaintiff filed a petition to confirm the award. In their response, defendants challenged the award as invalid. The trial court entered judgment confirming the award;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We conclude that, because defendants did not bring a timely petition or response to correct or vacate the award, the trial court had no choice but to disregard defendants\u2019 challenge and \u201cconfirm the award as made.\u201d (\u00a7 1286.) We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The following allegations and facts are taken from the complaint and the evidence submitted on the motion to confirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">On July 19, 2005, Eternity Investments, Inc. (Eternity), filed this action against Michael and Amy Brown, seeking damages and the enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien. On August 5, 2004, the parties had entered into a \u201cHome Improvement Contract\u201d under which Eternity, a construction company, was to remodel the Browns\u2019 kitchen. The contract contained an arbitration provision stating that all disputes would be subject to binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The complaint alleged that Eternity had fully performed its obligations and that the Browns still owed $49,745. Eternity had previously filed a mechanic\u2019s lien in that amount with the county recorder. The complaint sought $49,745 in damages and foreclosure on the lien. The action was basically dormant for a few months.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>On February 11, 2005, the Browns filed a demand for arbitration with the AAA, seeking $30,000 from Eternity. Eternity filed an answering statement and a counterclaim for $49,750. An arbitrator was assigned to the case, and the matter was heard in June 2005. On August 26, 2005, the arbitrator rendered an award in Eternity\u2019s favor in the sum of $36,575. On September 7, 2005, the AAA served a copy of the signed award on the parties by mail and facsimile.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On January 6, 2006, Eternity filed a petition in the trial court to confirm the award. Eternity asserted that \u201c[t]he Browns have not filed a petition to vacate or correct the award, and more than 100 days has elapsed since the service of the award. ... H] ... [1] Thus, the Browns\u2019 right to challenge the award by a petition to vacate is gone, and the court must mle for Eternity by confirming the award.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On February 8, 2006, the Browns filed opposition papers and a petition of their own, seeking to vacate the arbitration award. They argued primarily that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by awarding compensation to an unlicensed contractor. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7031, subds. (a), (e) [unlicensed contractor may not recover compensation in an action absent substantial compliance with licensing requirements].) That is a ground for vacating an award. (See \u00a7 1286.2, subd. (a)(4); <em>Lindenstadt v. Staff Builders, Inc. </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 882, 889-893 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 484], discussing <em>Loving &amp; Evans v. Blick </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 603, 605, 609-615 [204 P.2d 23], and <em>Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 31-32 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899]; see also <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Stites Prof. Law Corp. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1718, 1723-1726 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 570] [arbitrators\u2019 lack of jurisdiction over dispute is ground for. vacating award].) The Browns also faulted Eternity for not producing adequate proof of licensure during the arbitration hearing. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7031, subd. (d) [when issue of licensure is controverted, contractor has burden of producing verified certificate of licensure from Contractors\u2019 State License Board].) Similarly, the Browns argued that the arbitrator had improperly precluded them from introducing material evidence. (See \u00a7 1286.2, subd. (a)(5) [award shall be vacated if party\u2019s rights were substantially prejudiced by arbitrator\u2019s refusal to hear evidence material to the controversy].) Finally, they asserted that the arbitrator did not adequately explain his decision in writing. (See \u00a7 1283.4.) This, too, may have provided grounds for correcting or vacating the award. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1286.6, subd. (c), 1286.2, subd. (a)(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On February 22, 2006, the trial court heard the matter, granted Eternity\u2019s petition to confirm the award, implicitly denied defendants\u2019 petition to vacate, and entered judgment confirming the award, entitling Eternity to $36,575 in damages and permitting it to foreclose on the mechanic\u2019s lien. The Browns filed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cWe review issues of statutory interpretation de novo. . . . The primary purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent. . . . We first consider the statutory language, \u2018being careful to give the statute\u2019s words their plain, commonsense meaning.\u2019 ... \u2018If the language of the statute is not ambiguous, the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent is unnecessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>(California School Employees Assn., Tustin Chapter No. 450 </em>v. <em>Tustin Unified School Dist. </em>(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 510, 517 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 739], citations omitted.) Further, \u201c[w]e are not bound by the trial court\u2019s stated reasons for its ruling ... as we only review the ruling and not its rationale.\u201d <em>(Rinehart </em>v. <em>Boys &amp; Girls Club of Chula Vista </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 419, 429 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 677].)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">An arbitration award that has not been vacated or confirmed \u201chas the same force and effect as a contract in writing between the parties to the arbitration.\u201d (\u00a7 1287.6.) If an award is confirmed, judgment shall be entered thereon, and the judgment is to be treated in all respects like a judgment in \u201ca civil action of the same jurisdictional classification.\u201d (\u00a7 1287.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Under the CAA, a trial court is limited in its review of an award. The pleadings in a proceeding under the CAA consist of a \u201cpetition\u201d and a \u201cresponse thereto.\u201d (\u00a7 1290.) The court may, on <em>petition </em>by a party to the arbitration, either confirm, correct, <em>or </em>vacate the. award. (\u00a7 1285.) \u201cA <em>response </em>to a petition . . . may request the court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct <em>or </em>vacate the award.\u201d (\u00a7 1285.2, italics added.) The CAA sets forth narrow grounds for <em>correcting </em>and <em>vacating </em>an award. (\u00a7\u00a7 1286.6, 1286.2, subd. (a)(l)-(6).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Dismissal </em>of a petition is appropriate if the person named as the respondent is not bound by the award and was not a party to the arbitration. (\u00a7 1287.2.)\"</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The grounds for <em>confirming </em>an award are not similarly detailed. Rather, confirmation of an award is the mandatory outcome <em>absent </em>the correction or vacatur of the award or the dismissal of the petition: \u201cIf a petition or response ... is duly served and filed, the court shall <em>confirm the award as made . . . </em>unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 1286, italics added.) A petition to confirm need only set forth (1) the names of the arbitrators, (2) the arbitration agreement (by description or attached copy), and (3) the award and written opinion of the arbitrators (by description or attached copy). (\u00a7 1285.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\u201cA <em>petition </em>to <em>confirm </em>an award shall be served and filed not later than four years after the date of service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner. A <em>petition </em>to <em>vacate </em>an award <em>or </em>to <em>correct </em>an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.\u201d (\u00a7 1288, italics added.) \u201cA <em>response </em>requesting that an award be <em>vacated </em>or that an award be <em>corrected </em>shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date of service of a signed copy of the award upon: [][] (a) The respondent if he was a party to the arbitration; or [f] (b) The respondent\u2019s representative if the respondent was not a party to the arbitration.\u201d (\u00a7 1288.2, italics added.) In addition, a <em>response </em>must be served and filed within 10 days after service of the petition in California; 30 days is permitted if the petition is served outside the state. (\u00a7\u00a7 1290.6, 1290.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201c \u2018[I]f one wishes to have an award vacated or corrected he must act within one-hundred days of service of the award or be precluded from attacking the award.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Coordinated Construction, Inc. v. Canoga Big \u201cA, \u201d Inc. </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 313, 318 [47 Cal.Rptr. 749].) \u201cIf [the party who lost in the arbitration does] not serve and file a petition to vacate or a response to [a] petition to confirm within the 100-day period from the date of service of the award . . . , the award must be treated as final.\u201d <em>(Klubnikin </em>v. <em>California Fair Plan Assn. </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 393, 398 [148 Cal.Rptr. 563].) As stated by division two of this district: \u201c[A]ppellants chose not to file a petition to vacate the arbitration award (see \u00a7 1288), and they do not contest that their response, which did seek to vacate the award, was time barred by [the 100-day deadline]. Failure to file a timely response prevents a party from vacating an award . . . .\u201d <em>(United Firefighters of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1576, 1581 [283 Cal.Rptr. 8], fns. omitted.) And, according to a leading treatise: \u201cIf you represent the winning party in the arbitration, <em>wait until after </em>the 100-day period before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>petitioning to confirm the award. Unless the losing party files in the interim, the delay may cut off any challenge to the award!\u201d (Knight et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Alternative Dispute Resolution (The Rutter Group 2006) | 5:511, p. 5-347.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The CAA\u2019s deadlines for challenging and confirming arbitration awards serve important goals. A challenge to an award\u2014to correct or vacate it\u2014 typically requires the trial court to make factual determinations. (See <em>Lindenstadt </em>v. <em>Staff Builders, Inc., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 889-893 &amp; fhs. 7, 8; \u00a7 1291.) Consequently, a challenge must be made soon after the award is served\u2014within 100 days\u2014while the evidence is fresh and witnesses are available. But absent a challenge, there may be no need for judicial intervention. The award is treated as a contract (\u00a7 1287.6), and the prevailing party has a substantially longer period\u2014up to four years (similar to the four-year statute of limitations for breach of contract (\u00a7 337, subd. 1))\u2014to obtain satisfaction of the award before resorting to the courts. In the event of satisfaction, judicial relief will not be necessary, conserving court resources. If, however, the award is not satisfied, the prevailing party may convert it into an enforceable judgment by way of a petition to confirm. (\u00a7\u00a7 1287.4, 1288.) And confirmation will be a simple process absent a prompt, timely challenge to the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Here, the Browns did not serve or file a <em>petition </em>or <em>response </em>to correct or vacate the award before the 100-day period expired. Eternity filed a petition to confirm 121 days after service of the award. At that point, it was too late for the Browns to seek correction or vacatur. And they did not request dismissal of the petition. Under the plain language of the CAA, the trial court had no alternative but to \u201cconfirm the award as made\u201d notwithstanding the Browns\u2019 argument that the award was invalid. In short, the trial court was required to confirm the award absent correction or vacatur, and the deadline to correct or vacate the award had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Of course, a party with a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the 100-d\u00e1y time limit may obtain relief in a trial court under section 473, subdivision (b). (See Knight et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Alternative Dispute Resolution, <em>supra, </em>f 5:510, p. 5-346.) Further, a trial court may exercise its equitable power to grant relief if the deadline expires due to extrinsic mistake or fraud. <em>(Id., </em>1 5:510.1, pp. 5-346 to 5-347.) And where a trial court has granted a petition to <em>compel </em>arbitration over a party\u2019s objection that the dispute is not arbitrable, the issue of arbitrability may be raised on appeal from the judgment confirming the award even if the appellant did not petition the trial court to vacate the award. (See <em>United Firefighters of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1578-1582.) But none of those exceptions applies here. The trial court therefore acted properly in confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>The Browns\u2019 reliance on <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Stites Prof. Law Corp., supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1718, is misplaced. There, the court stated that, even though the arbitrators had concluded they had \u201csubject matter\u201d jurisdiction over the dispute, the trial court could vacate the award on the ground that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority by deciding the matter. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1723-1725, applying \u00a7 1286.2, subd. (a)(4), former subd. (d).) Nothing in <em>National Union </em>suggests that a ground for vacating an award can be raised after the 100-day period has expired. Indeed, the court noted that the parties had <em>followed </em>the procedures set forth in the CAA. <em>(National Union, </em>at p. 1723, fn. 2.) In addition, <em>National Union's </em>reference to \u201csubject matter\u201d jurisdiction was something of a misnomer. That term is used with respect to courts of law: Parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a <em>court </em>by consent, waiver, or estoppel. (See <em>Glassman </em>v. <em>McNab </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1593, 1601 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 293], criticizing <em>National Union.) </em>But \u201cthe general statutory provisions governing arbitration permit parties to confer subject matter jurisdiction on arbitrators over an issue by agreement.\u201d <em>(Glassman, </em>at p. 1601.) Thus, to avoid confusion, it may be more appropriate to refer to the \u201carbitrability\u201d of a dispute rather than the arbitrators\u2019 \u201csubject matter\u201d jurisdiction. (See, e.g., <em>Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 433 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 875, 926 P.2d 1061]; <em>Malek v. Blue Cross of California </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 44, 58 &amp; fn. 8 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 687]; <em>Merrick v. Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 212, 218 [181 Cal.Rptr. 530].)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Finally, we deny Eternity\u2019s motion seeking sanctions for a frivolous appeal. (See \u00a7 907; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.276(e).) Eternity argues that the appeal is frivolous because (1) an arbitration award is not reviewable for legal error, (2) the Browns raised the licensing issue in the arbitration, and (3) the arbitrator resolved that issue against them. But judicial review in these circumstances is not subject to the traditional rules governing arbitration awards. (See <em>Lindenstadt v. Staff Builders, Inc., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 889-893 [in ruling on a timely petition to vacate award, trial court reviews arbitrator\u2019s decision and evidence de novo to determine legality of compensation under licensing scheme]; see also <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Stites Prof. Law Corp., supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1724\u20141725 [trial court is not bound by arbitrators\u2019 determination that they had jurisdiction over dispute where statute (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6200 et seq.) precluded arbitration].) And the basis on which we have affirmed the trial court\u2014a procedural technicality of sorts\u2014was not one of the principal arguments in Eternity\u2019s brief. Sanctions are therefore inappropriate. (See <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 649-650 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Vogel, J., and Jackson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">On June 20, 2007, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
