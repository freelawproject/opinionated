The question we must resolve in this case is whether defendants Michael Bunnell (an associate warden at Folsom State Prison), Oliver Acuna (a captain at Folsom State Prison), and Alan Baber (a lieutenant at Folsom State Prison) deprived O\u2019Dea (a correctional officer at Folsom State Prison) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>of his liberty interests under the federal due process clause when he was injured while quelling a fight between rival prison gangs. As we will explain, the answer to this question is \u201cno,\u201d because defendants did not restrain O\u2019Dea.\u2019s, ability to act on his own behalf, even if they orchestrated the fight as O\u2019Dea alleges. 'We therefore a\u00a7km fixe yt'fgxxxexxt $xmXMX^,^Xt t'Xfjv defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">This case comes to 'us after a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants. We therefore state the facts in the light most favorable to O\u2019Dea as the party opposing the motion. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 627, 633, fn. 1 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 637].)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">O\u2019Dea was injured while quelling a fight between rival prison gangs on April 8, 2002. In the months prior to the fight, the prison had been on lockdown because of a January riot in which the Northern Hispanic prison gang attacked the Southern Hispanic prison gang. Sometime in February, the Southerners were \u201cretum[ed] to normal, programming\u201d while the Northerners remained on lockdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">On the morning of April 8, 2002, O\u2019Dea was told to \u201cstick around on the yard\u201d because the Northerners were going to be released. At the time, O\u2019Dea did not know there was an \u201cunlock plan\u201d or that a fight was anticipated between the Northerners and Southerners. O\u2019Dea positioned himself \u201cin the area near the yard shack and the custody ground level patio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">About 9:45 a.m., O\u2019Dea saw Northerners being released from building 1, although he had not heard the usual radio transmission by the yard sergeant authorizing the release. The released prisoners went directly to the area of the yard where the Northerners usually congregate. Also on the yard were Southerners who had been released onto the yard earlier that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The yard sergeant radioed to building 1 \u201cthat she had not called the yard yet and that she was not ready.\u201d Despite the yard sergeant\u2019s concerns, no steps were taken to stop or delay the release of the Northerners so the yard sergeant could clear the yard of the Southerners.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">About 10:25 a.m., some of the Southerners began walking together toward the handball courts in the direction of the Northerners. Shortly thereafter, more Southerners moved toward the handball courts until a large group of Southerners started running toward the Northerners. The result was a fight between about 100 Hispanic inmates with the Southerners outnumbering the Northerners.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>O\u2019Dea ran toward the fight and yelled for the inmates to get down. O\u2019Dea pepper sprayed the inmates who did not comply., When he ran out of pepper spray, O\u2019Dea \u201ctook out [his] baton and used it.\u201d After-the correctional officers quelled the fight, O\u2019Dea remained on the yard and helped \u201cput[] flex cuffs on inmates and provide[] security to the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In the afternoon, O\u2019Dea noticed pain in his neck and arms, numbness in his fingers, and \u201cjerkfing] and twitch[ing]\u201d in his chest and back muscles. In July 2002, he had neck surgery. In June 2003, he was \u201cmedically retired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">O\u2019Dea alleged that the fight on April 8, 2002, was orchestrated by Bunnell, Acuna, and Baber. According to O\u2019Dea\u2019s evidence, Bunnell made the decision to unlock the Northerners at a morning meeting on April 8 despite knowing that 20 inmate-manufactured weapons had been found and there was \u201ccontinuing unrest\u201d between the Northerners and Southerners. Bunnell\u2019s unlock plan was to release all inmates\u2014including Northerners and Southerners\u2014 one tier at a time in building 1 so that staff could observe the inmates\u2019 interaction before reintegrating them onto the yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Ac.una and Baber decided not to follow the unlock plan and instead ordered the Northerners to be released directly onto the yard before the yard sergeant had \u201ccleared\u201d and \u201ccalled\u201d the yard, which allowed the Southerners to remain on the yard. When Bunnell saw that his unlock plan was not being followed, he did not take action to prevent the fight, such as \u201crecalling the yard,\u201d \u201cputting the yard down\u201d (i.e., stopping the release and ordering inmates to get down on the ground), or \u201cstopping the unlock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">When Bunnell saw the Southerners moving toward, the Northerners on the yard, a prison official remarked to Bunnell, \u201cyou want to put the yard down, right?\u201d Bunnell responded, \u201cNo, not yet.\u201d Approximately 33 seconds after Bunnell decided not to put the yard down, the Southerners began running toward the Northerners and the fight began.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">According to O\u2019Dea\u2019s expert witness Michael Yarborough\u2014a 27-year veteran and warden of the former California Department of Corrections\u2014 Bunnell\u2019s decisions on the day of the fight were \u201cextremely reckless\u201d and created a \u201cforeseeable risk of harm to staff and inmates.\u201d Acuna and Baber\u2019s decisions made the fight likely to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>O\u2019Dea also produced evidence which he claimed impugned Bunnell\u2019s credibility and showed that Bunnell was \u201cbeholden\u201d to the Southerners.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Based on his evidence, O\u2019Dea sued Bunnell, Acuna, and Baber under the federal Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (section 1983)) claiming they deprived him of his liberty interests under the due process clause. The trial court excluded portions of O\u2019Dea\u2019s evidence, granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and dismissed the case. From that judgment, O\u2019Dea filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">On appeal, O\u2019Dea contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants because he created a triable issue of fact that Bunnell, Acuna, and Baber violated his right to due prodess when they \u201cacted affirmatively to create a foreseeable danger in reckless disregard for [his] constitutional rights.\u201d He also contends the court abused its discretion in excluding portions of his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">As we will explain, O\u2019Dea\u2019s first contention fails because even if O\u2019Dea\u2019s allegations against defendants are true, defendants did not restrain O\u2019Dea\u2019s ability to act on his own behalf\u2014the gravamen of a substantive due process claim based on the deprivation of a plaintiff\u2019s liberty interests. We therefore do not need to address his second contention regarding the court\u2019s alleged error in excluding his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Section 1983 allows individuals to sue state actors for violating their federal constitutional or statutory rights. <em>(Parratt v. Taylor </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 527, 535 [68 L.Ed.2d 420, 428, 101 S.Ct. 1908], overruled in part on other grounds in <em>Daniels v. Williams </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 327, 330-331 [88 L.Ed.2d 662, 668, 106 S.Ct. 662].) Section 1983 \u201c \u2018is not itself a source of substantive rights,\u2019 but merely provides \u2018a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Connor </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 386, 393-394 [104 L.Ed.2d 443, 453-454, 109 S.Ct. 1865].) .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">One of the constitutional rights cognizable under section 1983 is the right to liberty guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Youngberg v. Romeo </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 307, 309, 319 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>[73 L.Ed.2d 28, 32, 39, 102 S.Ct. 2452].) For purposes of an action for damages under section 1983, the deprivation of liberty triggering the protections of the due process clause \u201cis the State\u2019s affirmative act of restraining the individual\u2019s freedom to act on his own behalf\u2014through incarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal liberty.\u201d <em>(DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Soc. Servs. Dept. </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 189, 200 [103 L.Ed.2d 249, 262, 109 S.Ct. 998] <em>(DeShaney).) </em>It is on this alleged restraint of liberty that O\u2019Dea bases his section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">A claim similar to O\u2019Dea\u2019s was rejected over 20 years ago in a case brought by prison guards and their heirs against a prison director and assistant warden, where the guards had been injured and/or killed by inmates during a prison riot. <em>(Walker v. Rowe </em>(7th Cir. 1986) 791 F.2d 507, 509 <em>(Walker).) </em>The guards alleged that prison officials knew the inmates were making weapons but did not conduct enough random cell searches and did not \u201c \u2018immediately accept[]\u2019 \u201d the request by the guards\u2019 union for more cell searches; the assistant warden allowed the prison to operate normally instead of on lockdown even though he should have known the prison was \u201ctense\u201d; and the assistant warden \u201cdid not immediately issue shotguns to the tactical squad and order it to quell the disturbance\u201d upon \u201clearning] that a riot was in progress.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 509.) Based on these allegations, a jury found in favor of the prison guards and their heirs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Judge Easterbrook, writing the court\u2019s unanimous opinion, reversed the judgments, concluding that although the actions of the prison officials \u201carguably increased the danger to which the guards were exposed,\u201d they did not violate the Constitution. <em>(Walker, supra, </em>791 F.2d at pp. 507, 509.) The court\u2019s conclusion turned on the fact that \u201c[t]he defendants did not kill or injure the guards; prisoners did, and this makes all the difference.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 509.) The due process clause \u201cdoes not require the state to guarantee life, liberty, or property against invasion by private actors; it requires only that the state not act, unless with due process, when life, liberty, or property are in the balance.\u201d <em>(Walker, </em>at p. 509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In closing, Judge Easterbrook explained why the court\u2019s conclusion did not run afoul of the rule \u201cthat the state must protect prisoners and others in its charge.\u201d <em>(Walker, supra, </em>791 F.2d at p. 511.) That rule is based on \u201cthe principle that \u2018[i]f the state puts a man in a position of. danger from private persons and then fails to protect him ... it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citing <em>Bowers v. DeVito </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 686 F.2d 616, 618.) Here, however, \u201cthe state did not draft its guards; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>they enlisted, on terms they found satisfactory, and they were free to quit whenever they pleased. The state must protect those it throws into snake pits, but the state need not guarantee that volunteer snake charmers will not be bitten. It may not throw Daniel into the lions\u2019 den, but if Daniel chooses to be a lion tamer in the state\u2019s circus, the state need not separate Daniel from his charges with an impenetrable shield.\u201d (Walker, at p. 511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>Walker </em>is similar in material respects to O\u2019Dea\u2019s case. O\u2019Dea was injured while quelling a prison fight and now seeks to hold prison officials liable under the due process clause because he believes they were \u201cextremely reckless,\u201d created a \u201cforeseeable risk of harm to staff and inmates,\u201d and made the fight likely to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Regardless of whether O\u2019Dea\u2019s allegations are true, the defendants did not injure O\u2019Dea and did not restrain his ability to act. As O\u2019Dea himself admits, he voluntarily enlisted with the former Department of Corrections six years before his career-ending injury, and he was equipped with pepper spray and a baton that he used to subdue the inmates and quell the fight. As in <em>Walker, </em>while the acts of the prison officials arguably increased the danger to which O\u2019Dea was exposed, the due process clause simply does not protect O\u2019Dea from Bunnell\u2019s, Acuna\u2019s, and Baber\u2019s acts in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">O\u2019Dea nevertheless contends his claim is not foreclosed by <em>Walker, </em>relying on a line of cases postdating <em>Walker, </em>beginning with the United State Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>DeShaney. </em>As we will explain, consistent with <em>Walker, </em>the cases O\u2019Dea cites do not assist him because defendants did not restrain O\u2019Dea\u2019s freedom to act on his own behalf, a necessary component of a section 1983 claim premised on a plaintiff\u2019s alleged deprivation of liberty under the substantive component of the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In <em>DeShaney, </em>the Supreme Court refused to find a due process violation where a county\u2019s department of social services failed to adequately protect four-year-old Joshua from a violent beating by his father that left the boy severely brain damaged. <em>(DeShaney, supra, </em>489 U.S. at pp. 191, 193 [103 L.Ed.2d at pp. 256-257].) Despite previous suspicious injuries for which Joshua repeatedly had to be hospitalized and the department\u2019s decision to place him back with the father after it had removed him once, the Supreme Court held \u201c[a]s a general matter ... a State\u2019s failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 192-193, 197 [103 L.Ed.2d at pp. 256-257, 259].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The Supreme Court also rejected Joshua\u2019s argument that a \u201c \u2018special relationship\u2019 \u201d existed between him and the state simply because the department knew that he faced the danger of abuse and intended to protect him from that danger. <em>(DeShaney, supra, </em>489 U.S. at pp. 197-198 [103 L.Ed.2d at p. 260].) The court explained that the cases in which it had found a special relationship stood \u201conly for the proposition that when the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 199-200 [103 L.Ed.2d at pp. 261-262], citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble </em>(1976) 429 U.S. 97, 103-104 [50 L.Ed.2d 251, 259-260, 97 S.Ct. 285]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, supra, </em>457 U.S. at p. 310 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 38]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Central to the court\u2019s holding in <em>DeShaney </em>was the following reasoning: \u201cIn the substantive due process analysis, it is the State\u2019s affirmative act of restraining the individual\u2019s freedom to act on his own behalf\u2014through incarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal liberty\u2014which is the \u2018deprivation of liberty\u2019 triggering the protections of the Due Process Clause, not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means.\u201d <em>(DeShaney, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 200 [103 L.Ed.2d at p. 262].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Following this reasoning, the Supreme Court concluded \u201cthe State had no constitutional duty to protect Joshua.\u201d <em>(DeShaney, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 201 [103 L.Ed.2d at p. 263].) Joshua was injured while he was in his father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>custody, and even though the department had taken Joshua from his father at one point, the state \u201cplaced him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all.\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>[103 L.Ed.2d at p. 262].) In reaching its conclusion, the court observed that \u201c[w]hile the State may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Seizing on this observation in <em>DeShaney, </em>other courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have developed what they view as two exceptions to <em>DeShaney\u2019s </em>general rule that the state\u2019s failure to protect an individual against private violence does not rise to a constitutional violation under the due process clause. (See, e.g., <em>L.W. </em>v. <em>Grubbs </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 974 F.2d 119, 120-121 <em>(Grubbs I); Uhlrig v. Harder </em>(10th Cir. 1995) 64 F.3d 567, 572; <em>Kathleen R. v. City of Livermore </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 684, 699 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 772].) The first is \u201cthe \u2018special relationship\u2019 exception, stemming from a custodial relationship between the state and the victim,\u201d and the second is \u201cthe \u2018danger creation\u2019 exception, stemming from \u2018affirmative conduct on the part of the state in placing the plaintiff in danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>City of Ridgefield </em>(9th Cir. 2006) 439 F.3d 1055, 1070 (dis. opn. of Bybee, J.) <em>(Kennedy).) </em>It is the danger-creation exception on which O\u2019Dea relies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we will explain, the mischief that has resulted from indiscriminate application of selected language from cases discussing the danger-creation exception has provided unnecessary fodder for O\u2019Dea to advance his untenable due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">To support his position that the danger-creation exception applies, O\u2019Dea cites a number of cases from the Ninth Circuit that have allowed plaintiffs to go forward with claims against state actors \u201cfor their roles in creating or exposing individuals to danger they otherwise would not have faced.\u201d <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>439 F.3d at p. 1062.) These cases include <em>Wood v. Ostrander </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 879 F.2d 583, 586 (state trooper arrested drunk driver, impounded the car, and left the passenger by the side of the road in the middle of the night in a high-crime area where she was picked up by a stranger and raped); <em>Grubbs I, supra, </em>974 F.2d at pages 120-121 (supervisors at a custodial institution assigned a high-risk sex offender to work with plaintiff nurse alone in the institution\u2019s medical clinic where he raped her, even though the nurse had been informed she would not be left alone with violent offenders); <em>L.W. v. Grubbs </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 92 F.3d 894 <em>(Grubbs II) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(same facts as <em>Grubbs I); Penilla v. City of Huntington Park </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 115 F.3d 707, 708 (police officers responded to a ,911 call regarding a seriously ill man on the porch, found him to be in grave need of medical care, canceled the request for paramedics, broke into his house, moved him inside, locked the door, and left; the man was. found dead the next day); <em>Munger </em>v. <em>City of Glasgow Police Dept. </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 227 F.3d 1082, 1084-1085 (police ejected a drunk man from a bar late at night into subfreezing temperatures wearing only jeans and a T-shirt and prevented him from driving or reentering the bar where he had left his coat; the man died of hypothermia); and <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>439 F.3d at pages 1057-1058 (plaintiff reported to police that a neighborhood boy molested her daughter, an officer assured her he would provide advance notice of any police contact with the boy\u2019s family, police failed to do so until after the contact was made but then told plaintiff he would patrol the neighborhood; in reliance, plaintiff stayed the night at her house and early in the morning the boy shot plaintiff and her husband while they were asleep).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Using language from these cases, O\u2019Dea argues that defendants can be held liable here. Specifically, he points to a passage from <em>Kennedy </em>declaring that \u201cstate actors may be held liable \u2018where they affirmatively place an individual in danger,\u2019 <em>Munger </em>[v. <em>City of Glasgow Police Dept., supra,] </em>227 F.3d at [p], 1086, by acting with \u2018deliberate indifference to [a] known or obvious danger in subjecting the plaintiff to it,\u2019 <em>[Grubbs II, supra], </em>92 F.3d [at p.] 900.\u201d <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>439 F.3d at p. 1062.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We cannot agree with a narrow reading of these cases that imposes liability under the due process clause for a state-created danger <em>simply because </em>the state actor affirmatively placed the plaintiff in danger with deliberate indifference to a known or obvious danger. In our view, such a reading overlooks the gravamen of a substantive due process claim based on the deprivation of a plaintiff\u2019s liberty interests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>As <em>DeShaney </em>teaches, the gravamen of a section 1983 claim based on the substantive component of the due process clause is \u201cthe \u2018deprivation of liberty\u2019 \u201d resulting from \u201cthe State\u2019s affirmative act of restraining the individual\u2019s freedom to act on his own behalf.\u201d <em>(DeShaney, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 200 [103 L.Ed.2d at p. 262].) This requires <em>both </em>state action <em>and </em>a restraint on the individual\u2019s freedom to act for a cognizable claim under section 1983. Put into this perspective, the danger-creation exception is just another way of discussing the requisite component of state action but does not dispense with the requirement that the state action restrain the individual\u2019s freedom to act. Therefore, regardless of whether a case can be said to fall under the special relationship exception or the danger-creation exception, if the state has not deprived the plaintiff of liberty by restraining his individual freedom to act on his own behalf, the plaintiff simply does not have a cause of action under section 1983 under either exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Viewed in this light, the outcome of at least some of the Ninth Circuit cases O\u2019Dea has cited arguably can be justified because state action restrained the individuals\u2019 freedom to act on their own behalf. These include liability for the state trooper in <em>Wood </em>for stranding the passenger at the side of the road in the middle of the night in a high-crime area, effectively curtailing her ability to get home safely; the police officer in <em>Penilla </em>for removing the serious ill man from his porch and locking him in his house, thereby depriving him of his ability to summon neighbors or passersbys; and the police officers in <em>Munger </em>for ejecting a bar patron into subfreezing temperatures and preventing him from driving or reentering the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In contrast to these cases, there was no state action in O\u2019Dea\u2019s case that restrained him from acting on his own behalf. Even if Bunnell, Acuna, and Baber orchestrated the fight, they did not restrain O\u2019Dea from defending himself as he was equipped with pepper spray and a baton that he used to subdue the inmates and quell the fight. As the Supreme Court has warned, \u201c \u2018we must never forget, that it is a <em>constitution </em>we are expounding\u2019 \u201d and our Constitution \u201cdeals with the large concerns of the governors and the governed, but it does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living together in society. We have previously rejected reasoning that \u2018 \u201cwould make of the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>474 U.S. at p. 332 [88 L.Ed.2d at p. 669].) O\u2019Dea\u2019s due process claim therefore could not survive summary judgment, and the trial court correctly entered judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The judgment is affirmed.
