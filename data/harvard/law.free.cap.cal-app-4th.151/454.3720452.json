Ambiguity in the language of the rule makes it uncertain whether those time limits commence to run upon entry of a prejudgment appealable order, such as the one at issue here, or upon entry of final judgment in the litigation. We interpret rule 3.1702 so that the time limits imposed by the rule commence to run upon entry of judgment at the conclusion of a lawsuit. Those time limits do not commence to run upon entry of a prejudgment appealable order, such as an order granting or denying a special motion to strike under section 425.16. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney fees in this case was filed before entry of final judgment and was timely under rule 3.1702.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Plaintiff and respondent Tyrone C. Carpenter (plaintiff) sued defendant and appellant Jack in the Box Corporation (Jack in the Box) and defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>appellant Angelle Chapman (Chapman) (Jack in the Box and Chapman are collectively referred to as defendants) after plaintiff\u2019s employment with Jack in the Box was terminated in June 2003. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged causes of action against Jack in the Box for wrongful termination, employment discrimination, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; against Chapman for interference with contract; and against both defendants for defamation and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Defendants filed a special motion to strike pursuant to section 425.16, claiming that all of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action alleged injury arising from protected First Amendment activities, namely, Jack in the Box\u2019s investigation of allegations that plaintiff had sexually harassed Chapman, a fellow employee. Plaintiff opposed the special motion to strike, and after hearing argument from the parties on September 18, 2003, the trial court denied the motion. The trial court\u2019s denial of the special motion to strike was entered in the court\u2019s permanent minutes on September 18, 2003. On September 30, 2003, plaintiff served on defendant a document captioned \u201cNotice of Ruling on Defendant\u2019s Special Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Defendants appealed the order denying the special motion to strike. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s order in a nonpublished opinion. <em>(Carpenter </em>v. <em>Jack in the Box Corp. </em>(Apr. 26, 2005, B171403).) Following issuance of the remittitur on September 16, 2005, plaintiff filed a motion for statutory attorney fees and expenses in the trial court pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c). Defendants opposed the motion on various grounds, including untimeliness. The trial court ruled that plaintiff\u2019s motion was timely and that defendants\u2019 special motion to strike and appeal were completely without merit, and awarded plaintiff $53,651.47 in fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">CONTENTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Defendants appeal from the trial court\u2019s order awarding plaintiff attorney fees and costs pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c). They contend the order must be reversed because plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney fees and costs was untimely under rules 3.1702 and 8.104; the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees and to award him attorney fees on appeal; the trial court erred by concluding that the special motion to strike and appeal of the order denying that motion were frivolous; and the trial court failed to state with particularity its reasons for awarding attorney fees and costs. Plaintiff asks that we find defendants\u2019 appeal to be frivolous, and that we award him his attorney fees in responding to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s order. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney fees and costs was timely under rule 3.1702. The trial court had jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>consider plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney fees, did not abuse its discretion by finding that defendants\u2019 special motion to strike and appeal of the order denying that motion were frivolous, and stated with sufficient particularity its reasons for awarding plaintiff attorney fees and costs. We deny plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Although a trial court\u2019s ruling on the propriety of an attorney fees award is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, the determination of whether the trial , court had the statutory authority to make such an award is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>(Duale v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 880, 885 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 711].)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">B. <em>Jurisdiction </em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Defendants argue that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees because plaintiff did not seek an attorney fee award in this court when defendants appealed the order denying the special motion to strike, and because our remittitur affirming the trial court\u2019s order did not direct the trial court to determine plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Section 425.16, subdivision (c), authorizes a trial court to award costs and reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff in an unsuccessful special motion to strike \u201c[i]f the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d Such an award is made pursuant to section 128.5, which states in relevant part: \u201cEvery trial court may order a party, the party\u2019s attorney, or both to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. \u2018Actions or tactics\u2019 include, but are not limited to, the making or opposing of motions . . . . [f] . . . \u2018Frivolous\u2019 means (A) totally and completely without merit or (B) for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.\u201d (\u00a7 128.5, subds. (a), (b)(1), (2); see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court had both authority and jurisdiction under section 425.16, subdivision (c), to determine plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees in opposing the special motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s decision to seek his attorney fees in a separate noticed motion rather than as part of his opposition to defendants\u2019 special motion to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the issue. The party prevailing on a special motion to strike may seek an attorney fee award through three different avenues: simultaneously with litigating the special motion to strike; by a subsequent noticed motion, as was the case here; or as part of a cost memorandum. <em>(American Humane Assn. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Times Communications </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1103 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 488] <em>(American Humane Assn.); </em>\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A)-(C); Wegner et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (The Rutter Group 2006) f 17:151, p. 17-85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Defendants\u2019 appeal of the order denying the special motion to strike did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to consider plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney fees and costs. \u201cEven if the order granting the [special motion to strike] has been appealed, the trial court retains jurisdiction to entertain a motion for attorney fees.\u201d <em>(Doe v. Luster </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 139, 144 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 403].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The absence of direction from this court concerning plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees on appeal in our remittitur affirming the order denying the special motion to strike did not preclude the trial court from awarding plaintiff his attorney fees incurred in responding to defendants\u2019 prior appeal. The trial court\u2019s authority to award fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision (c), includes authority to award fees incurred in responding to an appeal of an order granting or denying a special motion to strike, or of an order awarding attorney fees in connection with such motion. (See <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 275].) \u201cA statute authorizing an attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate attorney fees unless the statute specifically provides otherwise. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Evans v. Unkow </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 624].) Section 425.16, subdivision (c), does not preclude recovery of appellate attorney fees; hence attorney fees recoverable under the statute include appellate fees. <em>(Evans, </em>at p. 1500; see also <em>Dove Audio, Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer &amp; Susman </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th <em>777, </em>785 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 830].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em>Hampton v. Superior Court </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 652, 655 [242 P.2d 1] and <em>Hanna v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 363, 376 [260 Cal.Rptr. 782], overruled on another ground in <em>Pasadena Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Pasadena </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 564 [273 Cal.Rptr. 584, 797 P.2d 608], on which defendants rely in support, of their jurisdictional argument, are inapposite. Neither of those cases addressed a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff under section 425.16, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>C. <em>Timeliness of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Defendants contend that plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney fees was not timely filed under rules 3.1702 and 8.104. Our determination of this issue requires us to interpret and apply those rules. \u201c[T]he interpretation of a rule of court is governed by the same precepts that apply to statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>(Kahn v. Lasorda\u2019s Dugout, Inc. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1122 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 790].) \u201cOur objective is to determine the drafter\u2019s intent using the words of the rule as our starting point. [Citation.] If the language of the rule is clear and unambiguous, it is unnecessary to probe the rule\u2019s drafting history in order to ascertain its meaning. [Citation.] If possible, we attribute significance to every word, phrase, sentence and part of a court rule. [Citation.] \u2018We accord a challenged rule a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with its apparent purpose, practical rather than technical in nature, which upon application will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Crespin v. Shewry </em>(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 259, 265 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 696] <em>(Crespin).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Rule 3.1702 governs claims for statutory attorney fees in civil cases. It provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney\u2019s fees . . . .\u201d (Rule 3.1702(a).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 3.1702 imposes time limits for filing a motion to claim statutory attorney fees, by cross-referencing the time limits prescribed by rules 8.104 and 8.108 for filing a notice of appeal: \u201cA notice of motion to claim attorney\u2019s fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court\u2014including attorney\u2019s fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial court\u2014must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108.\u201d (Rule 3.1702(b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Rule 8.104(a) imposes the following time limits for filing a notice of appeal: \u201cUnless a statute or rule 8.108 provides otherwise,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of: [U (1) 60 days after the superior court clerk mails the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled \u2018Notice of Entry\u2019 of judgment or a file-stamped copy of the judgment, showing the date either was mailed; [f] (2) 60 days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled \u2018Notice of Entry\u2019 of judgment or a file-stamped copy of the judgment, accompanied by a proof of service; or [f] (3) 180 days after entry of judgment.\u201d Rule 8.104 makes these same time limits applicable to an appeal from an appealable order. Subdivision (f) of the rule states that the term \u201cjudgment,\u201d as used in subdivision (a), \u201cincludes an appealable order if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>appeal is from an appealable order.\u201d Subdivision (d) of rule 8.104 defines what constitutes the entry date of a judgment or appealable order. Subdivision (d)(1) provides that \u201c[t]he entry date of a judgment is the date the judgment is filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 668.5, or the date it is entered in the judgment book.\u201d For an appealable order, subdivision (d)(2) and (3) of the rule provide; \u201c(2) The entry date of an appealable order that is entered in the minutes is the date it is entered in the permanent minutes. But if the minute order directs that a written order be prepared, the entry date is the date the signed order is filed; a written order prepared under rule 3.1312 or similar local rule is not such an order prepared by direction of a minute order. []Q (3) The entry date of an appealable order that is not entered in the minutes is the date the signed order is filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The trial court\u2019s order denying defendants\u2019 special motion to strike was an appealable order (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (i)), entered in the court\u2019s permanent minutes on September 18, 2003. Plaintiff filed his motion for attorney fees more than two years later\u2014on October 26, 2005. Plaintiff maintains that he could not bring his attorney fee motion sooner because defendants\u2019 appeal of the trial court\u2019s order denying the special motion to strike stayed further proceedings in the trial court pursuant to section 916, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The perfecting of defendants\u2019 appeal, however, did not automatically stay proceedings in the trial court to award fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision (c). (See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Zimmerman </em>(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1400, 1432, 1433 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 174].) Defendants argue that plaintiff\u2019s motion was untimely because rules 3.1702 and 8.104 require plaintiff\u2019s motion to have been filed within 180 days after September 18, 2003. There is some support for this argument in the language of the two rules. Subdivision (b)(1) of rule 3.1702 states that \u201c[a] notice of motion to claim attorney\u2019s fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108.\u201d Subdivisions (a)(3), (d)(2) and (f) of rule 8.104 require a notice of appeal from an appealable order to be filed within 180 days after entry in the court\u2019s permanent minutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>A closer inspection of rules 3.1702 and 8.104, however, reveals a discrepancy between the language of the two rules that makes their application to plaintiff\u2019s motion uncertain. Rule 3.1702(b)(1) prescribes time limits for filing a \u201cnotice of motion to claim attorney\u2019s fees for services <em>up to and including the rendition of judgment </em>in the trial court.\u201d (Italics added.) The term \u201crendition of judgment\u201d has a particular meaning. In the context of a court trial, it means the signing and filing of the court\u2019s findings, conclusions, and final judgment in a case. (See <em>Ehrler v. Ehrler </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 147, 152 [178 Cal.Rptr. 642]; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Attack on Judgment, \u00a7 56, p. 560.) The language preceding the term \u201crendition of judgment,\u201d as used in rule 3.1702, is worded in the conjunctive, encompassing claims for attorney fees \u201cfor services <em>up to and including </em>the rendition of judgment.\u201d (Rule 3.1702(b)(1), italics &amp; boldface added.) The language of the rule thus applies only to a motion to recover <em>all </em>prejudgment attorney fees incurred in an' action, and contemplates the filing of such a motion at the conclusion of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">A motion for attorney fees incurred in connection with a prejudgment appealable order, such, as an order granting or denying a special motion to strike, is a \u201cclaim for services\u201d rendered <em>before </em>\u201cthe rendition of judgment.\u201d It is not a claim, \u201cfor services <em>up tp and including </em>the rendition of judgment,\u201d and therefore does not fit within the plain language of rule 3.1702.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The term \u201cappealable order\u201d does not appear in rule 3.1702. The issue concerning the rule\u2019s applicability to appealable orders arises because subdivision (b)(1) of rule 3.1702 refers to other rules\u2014rules 8.104 and 8.108\u2014which define the term \u201cjudgment\u201d to include appealable orders under certain circumstances. The reference in rule 3.1702(b)(1) to rules 8.104 and 8.108 gives rise to an ambiguity in the meaning and application of rule 3.1702 that requires us to consider the rule\u2019s drafting' history, as well as its purpose and intent. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The First District Court of Appeal, in <em>Crespin, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th 259, considered the relationship between former rule 870.2 (now rule 3.1702) and former rules 2 and 3 (now rules 8.104 &amp; 8.108) in determining whether the time limits imposed by those rules apply to a postjudgment motion to obtain statutory attorney fees incurred in modifying a permanent injunction. The court in <em>Crespin </em>considered the language of rule 870.2, as well as the drafting history and policy behind the rule, and concluded that it made little sense to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>apply the time limits prescribed by rule 870.2 to motions for statutory fees incurred in connection with either prejudgment or postjudgment orders. <em>(Crespin, </em>at pp. 265, 267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The <em>Crespin </em>court noted that the reference in former rule 870.2 to former rules 2 and 3 did not incorporate the special definitions of \u201cjudgment\u2019\u2019 used in rules 2 and 3. As noted, former rules 2 and 3 define \u201cjudgment\u201d to include appealable orders in certain circumstances. The court in <em>Crespin </em>observed that rule 870.2(b)(1) \u201cby its express terms, merely borrows the <em>time limits </em>for filing a notice of appeal set forth in rules 2 and 3.\u201d <em>(Crespin, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th at p. 266.) The court stated that the special definitions of \u201cjudgment\u201d \u201care specific to the subject matter of rules 2 and 3: setting a readily determinable time limit for filing a notice of appeal. It makes perfect sense in that context to have a single time limit applicable to both judgments and appealable orders. In fact, rule 2(f) states expressly that its definition of \u2018judgment\u2019 to include an appealable order only applies if the appeal is from an appealable order rather than a judgment. Rule 870.2 addresses an entirely different subject: setting a time limit for seeking attorney fees. For that purpose, there is no obvious reason to impose the same time limit for bringing fee motions after entry of appealable orders and judgments. If anything . . . such an equation would promote piecemeal litigation over fees, which the drafters of rule 870.2 wanted to avoid.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The court in <em>Crespin </em>further noted, \u201cAn intent to borrow rule 2\u2019s special definition of \u2018judgment\u2019 is therefore anything but clear or unambiguous in the text of rule 870.2. .. . [W]e have also examined the rule\u2019s drafting history for evidence of such an intent. . . . We have found no sign in the drafting history of rule 870.2 that the effect of incorporating or not incorporating that specific definition into the rule by reference was ever considered or discussed.\u201d <em>(Crespin, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th at p. 266.) .</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The court in <em>Crespin </em>went on to state that interpreting former rule 870.2 to apply to fee motions for services rendered in connection with a prejudgment appealable order is \u201cnot practical or consistent with wise policy\u201d <em>(Crespin, supra, 125 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 266), particularly in the context of public interest litigation. \u201cReasonably construed, subdivision (b) [of rule 3.1702, former rule 870.2] permits a public interest litigant to file a single fee motion covering all services rendered in litigating the case to a judgment in the trial court. It does so by setting a time limit for bringing a fee motion <em>\u2018for services up to and including the rendition of judgment </em>in the trial court.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . [An] interpretation [that] focuses narrowly on the word \u2018judgment\u2019 and entirely ignores the italicized words that immediately precede it. . . leads to an absurdity. Each time an appealable order was entered, the public interest plaintiff would be compelled to promptly apply for fees for all services \u2018up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>and including the rendition of [the appealable order].\u2019 Such a reading would <em>compel </em>premature and piecemeal litigation over fees.\u201d (Crespin, at pp. 266-267.) The court in <em>Crespin </em>thus concluded that applying former rule 870.2 to motions for statutory fees incurred in connection with prejudgment appealable orders \u201cdoes not seem sensible, practical, or consistent with either the language of the rule or the dictates of wise policy.\u201d (125 Cal.App.4th at pp. 266-267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We agree with the court in <em>Crespin </em>that interpreting rule 3.1702 to require litigants to apply for attorney fees incurred in connection with a prejudgment appealable order within 60 or 180 days after entry of the order would be inconsistent with the language of the rule and its underlying policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The history of rule 3.1702 supports this conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A concise summary of the rule\u2019s history may be found in <em>Sanabria </em>v. <em>Embrey </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 837] <em>(Sanabria).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, Division Five of this court recounted the history of rule 3.1702 as follows: \u201cIn 1992, the Supreme Court asked the Administrative Office of the Courts to review the timing of claims for attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 (private attorney general fees). The Supreme Court was concerned that case law arguably permitted claims for such fees to be pursued at any time. A time limit appeared desirable. (Jud. Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts., Rep. on Time to Claim Attorney Fees (rule 870.2) (1992) p. 1.) Rather than address only attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, an amendment to California Rules of Court, rule 870.2 was proposed that would address the procedure for all claims for attorney fees under statute or contract. (Jud. Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts., Request for Comment: Specifying Time to Claim Attorney Fees by Rule (1992).)\u201d <em>(Sanabria, supra, </em>at p. 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The Judicial Council\u2019s 1992 request for comments indicates the drafters\u2019 intent to set an outer time limit <em>after judgment </em>within which statutory attorney fee claims could be made. In that document, the Judicial Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>states that the proposed amendments would \u201celiminate any possible implication that an attorney fee claim could be presented in an unlimited time <em>after </em>entry of judgment or issuance of a remittitur on appeal.\u201d (Judicial Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts., Request for Comment: Specifying Time to Claim Attorney Fees by Rule (1992), italics added.) As initially proposed, the draft rule provided that a \u201cnotice of motion to claim prejudgment attorney fees shall be served and filed before or at the same time the memorandum of costs is served and filed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under the rules in effect at the time, a prevailing party who claimed costs was required to serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of mailing the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever was sooner. <em>(Sanabria, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 427, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">A substantial number of comments were submitted in response to the Judicial Council\u2019s proposal. As summarized by the court in Sanabria: \u201cComments opposed the proposed amendment on the basis that the time suggested for claiming attorney fees would be inadequate for the more complex attorney fee issues that could arise under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.\u201d <em>(Sanabria, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 428.) Instead of using the 15-day time period for filing a memorandum of costs, many commenters, including the State Bar of California, suggested that 60 days would be a more reasonable time period in which to bring a motion for attorney fees. (Judicial Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts., Rep. on Time to Claim Attorney Fees (rule 870.2), <em>supra, </em>at p. 4.) \u201cThe State Bar\u2019s response to the request for comments was considered significant and was attached as an exhibit to the Administrative Office of the Courts\u2019 report on the proposal. In its response, the State Bar offered its own proposed language for California Rules of Court, rule 870.2, which provided, in pertinent part, as follows: \u2018A notice of motion to claim prejudgment attorney fees shall be served and filed within 60 days after the date of mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.\u2019 (Jud. Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts. Rep. on Time to Claim Attorney Fees (rule 870.2), <em>supra, </em>at p. 14.) This language tracked the language of California Rules of Court, rule 870(a), setting forth the time limit for claiming costs. The Administrative Office of the Courts interpreted this proposal as \u2018a requirement that the notice of motion for fees be filed within what is, in effect, the time for filing a notice of appeal.\u2019 (Jud. Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts. Rep. on Time to Claim Attorney Fees (rule 870.2), <em>supra, </em>at p. 4.)\u201d <em>(Sanabria, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 428.) The Administrative Office of the Courts also received comments from attorneys who handled complex public benefit cases, and who urged that there be optional deferral of a litigant\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees until after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>a possible appeal. (Judicial Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts., Rep. on Time to Claim Attorney Fees (rule. 870.2) (1993).)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Based on these comments, the Administrative Office of the Courts prepared another draft of former rule 870.2, incorporating the time periods for filing a notice of appeal. To address concerns that the proposed 60- or 180-day time period after notice of entry or entry of judgment might not be sufficient, the rule was further amended to allow the parties to stipulate to extend the time until 60 days after the deadline to file an appeal, or, in the event an appeal was filed, until the deadline for claiming costs on appeal. The rule was . also amended to authorize the trial court to grant further extensions of time for good cause. The new draft was circulated and the language of the then current rule 870.2 was adopted. <em>(Sanabria, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">It is evident from the history of rule 3.1702 that neither the drafters of the rule nor the parties commenting on the proposed rule contemplated that entry of a prejudgment appealable order might trigger the deadlines for claiming prejudgment attorney fees. The drafters noted that the proposed rule \u201cdoes not prevent attorneys from claiming such fees quite pr\u00f3mptly; rather, it sets an outside time within which claims must be made.\u201d (Judicial Council of Cal., Admin. Off. of Cts., Mem. from Members of Civil and Small Claims Com., Time to Claim Attorney Fees, Rule 870.2 (1993).) The history of rule 3.1702 indicates that the \u201coutside\u201d time limit for claiming prejudgment statutory attorney fees was intended to be entry of a final judgment\u2014not entry of a prejudgment appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we hold that the time limits imposed by rules 3.1702 and 8.104 for filing a motion for attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c) do not commence .to run until entry of judgment at the conclusion of the litigation. This interpretation of riile 3.1702 is consistent not only with the rule\u2019s history and underlying policy, but also with existing law and practice.  As noted, there are three ways in which a party may seek an award of attorney fees and costs in connection with a special motion to strike under section 425.16. The party filing such a motion may seek attorney fees in its moving papers, or the party prevailing on the motion may bring a separate, subsequently filed motion for fees and costs. <em>(Doe v. Luster, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.4th at p. 144; American <em>Humane Assn., supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 1103.) \u201cThe party prevailing on the special motion to strike can also seek its attorney fees as part of a \"cost memorandum <em>at the conclusion of the litigation. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Doe v. Luster, </em>at p. 144, fn. 4, italics added.)  In this case, had plaintiff not elected to bring a motion for attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), he could still have sought such fees as part of a cost memorandum at the conclusion of the lawsuit. <em>(Doe, </em>at p. 144, fn. 4.) Plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney fees, filed before entry of judgment, was not untimely under rule 3.1702.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>D. <em>Propriety of Attorney Fee Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Section 425.16 accords a trial court discretion to award attorney fees and costs to the prevailing plaintiff on a special motion to strike \u201c[i]f the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c); see <em>Visher v. City of Malibu </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 364, 371 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 816].) Such fees and costs are awarded pursuant to section 128.5, which allows an award of \u201creasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d (\u00a7 128.5, subd. (a); see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u201c \u2018A determination of frivolousness requires a finding the motion is \u201ctotally and completely without merit\u201d (\u00a7 128.5, subd. (b)(2)), that is, \u201cany reasonable attorney would agree such motion is totally devoid of merit.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights </em>v. <em>Garamendi </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1388 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 368] <em>(Garamendi).) </em>We review the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing plaintiff under section 425.16, subdivision (c) for abuse of discretion. (132 Cal.App.4th at p. 1388.) Under this standard, the appropriate test is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Here, the trial court found defendants\u2019 motion to be frivolous and awarded plaintiff $53,651.47. Defendants argue that the trial court did not set forth with sufficient particularity the justification for its finding of frivolousness and that such a finding is not warranted. We find the trial court\u2019s order was sufficient and find no abuse of discretion in its decision to award attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">1, <em>Sufficiency of Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Section 128.5, subdivision (c) requires that a trial court\u2019s order imposing fees and costs \u201cshall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.\u201d \u201cSubstantively, section 128.5 does not replace section 425.16. The import of section 425.16 is that \u2018a court must use the procedures and apply the substantive standards of section 128.5 in deciding whether to award attorney fees under the anti-SLAPP [<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Garamendi, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 1388.)

The court\u2019s statement of reasons, although brief, incorporated by reference both defendants\u2019 moving papers and our previous opinion affirming the denial of the special motion to strike. In our previous opinion, we rejected defendants\u2019 repeated efforts to \u201cdoggedly regurgitate the same baseless rationale\u201d in support of their arguments that a private employer\u2019s investigation of an employee\u2019s alleged sexual harassment was somehow protected activity under section 425.16. <em>(Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp., supra, </em>B171403.) \u201cTo justify a sanctions award, \u2018no more is required than a written factual recital, with reasonable specificity, of the circumstances that led the trial court to find the conduct before it sanctionable under the relevant code section.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Garamendi, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 1389.) The trial court\u2019s order met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">2. <em>Basis for Attorney Fee Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Section 425.16 provides in relevant part: \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Determining whether the statute bars a given cause of action requires a two-step analysis. <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].) First, the court must decide whether the party moving to strike a cause of action has made a threshold showing that the cause of action arises from an act \u201c \u2018in furtherance of the [defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685].) Section 425.16, subdivision (e) defines an \u201c \u2018act in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue\u2019 \u201d to include \u201c(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>authorized by law; (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; (4) or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d  If the court finds that the defendant has met its burden of demonstrating that the complaint comes within the provision of section 425.16, the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a \u201cprobability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1); see <em>Navellier, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Defendants contend that the issue presented in their special motion to strike\u2014whether statements made in connection with an employer\u2019s investigation of an employee\u2019s alleged sexual harassment were protected under section 425.16, subdivision (e) as an \u201cofficial proceeding authorized by law\u201d\u2014was one of first impression at the time; that the law concerning the scope of the protection afforded by section 425.16, subdivision (e) to nongovernmental proceedings was uncertain; and that they reasonably pursued both the special motion to strike and appeal of the trial court\u2019s order denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">After the trial court entered its order awarding plaintiff his attorney fees, the Third District Court of Appeal issued its opinion in <em>Olaes v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1501 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 467] <em>(Olaes), </em>in which the court rejected an identical argument made by an employer who sought to invoke the protection of section 425.16 as the basis for striking a defamation claim arising out of the employer\u2019s investigation of alleged sexual harassment by an employee. The employer argued that its investigation was an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d under subdivision (e) of section 425.16. The court in <em>Olaes </em>found the employer\u2019s interpretation of section 425.16 to be \u201ctortuous at best and illogical at worst,\u201d and that the phrase \u201c \u2018any other official proceeding\u2019 \u201d as used in the statute was \u201cintended to protect speech concerning matters of public interest in a governmental forum\u201d (135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1507), and not a procedure for resolving sexual harassment complaints \u201cdesigned and instituted by a private company.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1508.) Defendants argue that they did not have the benefit of the <em>Olaes </em>court\u2019s guidance concerning the meaning of an \u201cofficial proceeding authorized by law\u201d at the time they brought their special motion to strike and that they should not be sanctioned for pursuing what they believed to be a meritorious claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Defendants\u2019 focus on the phrase \u201cany other official proceeding authorized by law\u201d in subdivision (e) of section 425.16 ignores other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>statutory language requiring that statements made during such proceedings be \u201cin connection with .a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(4); see <em>id., </em>subd. (e)(3).) Even before the Third Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>Olaes, </em>the law was well-established, \u201cthat unlawful workplace activity below some threshold level of significance is not an issue of public interest, even though it implicates a public policy.\u201d <em>(Rivero </em>v. <em>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 913, 924 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 81].) In <em>Rivero, </em>a supervisor of janitors at a public university sued his union for defamation and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress after information about him was published in a union publication. The union moved to strike the complaint under section 425.16, arguing that the alleged wrongful conduct was in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest. In affirming the order denying the union\u2019s special motion to strike, the court in <em>Rivero </em>stated, \u201cHere, the Union\u2019s statements concerned the supervision of a staff of eight custodians by Rivero, an individual who had previously received no public attention or media coverage. Moreover, the only individuals directly involved in and affected by the situation were Rivero and the eight custodians. Rivero\u2019s supervisi\u00f3n of those eight individuals is hardly a matter of public interest.\u201d <em>(Rivero, </em>at p. 924.) The instant case, involving a private employer\u2019s investigation of an alleged incident of sexual harassment by an individual who was entirely outside the public eye, is indistinguishable from the circumstances .presented in <em>Rivero. </em>Defendants did not meet their burden of establishing that plaintiff\u2019s causes of action arose from acts protected under section 425.16 \u201cin connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(4); see <em>Olaes, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th atp. 1511 [\u201calthough . . . the elimination of sexual harassment implicates a public interest, an investigation by a private employer concerning a small group of people does not rise to a public interest under section 425.16\u201d].) We reached this same conclusion in defendants\u2019 previous appeal in which we affirmed the trial court\u2019s order denying the special motion to strike. <em>(Carpenter </em>v. <em>Jack in the Box Corp., supra, </em>B171403.) The trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that defendants\u2019 special motion to strike, and their appeal of the order denying that motion, were frivolous. <em>(Garamendi, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 1388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">E. <em>Attorney Fees in This Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Plaintiff asks in a separate motion that we find defendants\u2019 appeal of the trial court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees and costs to be frivolous, and that we dismiss the appeal and award him his attorney fees incurred in responding to this appeal. Given the ambiguity in rule 3.1702, and the uncertainty concerning its application to motions for attorney fees incurred in connection with a special motion to strike under section 425.16, we cannot conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>defendants\u2019 appeal was frivolous.
