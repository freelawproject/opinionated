J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASj\">Following an administrative hearing, appellant Department of Motor Vehicles (the DMV) suspended respondent Jeffrey J. Arburn\u2019s driving privileges for one year for driving motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13353.2, 13353.3, subd. (b)(2).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The superior court granted Arburn\u2019s subsequent petition and issued a writ of mandate directing the DMV to set aside the suspension. On appeal, the DMV contends the superior court erred in reversing Arburn\u2019s suspension on the grounds that the arresting officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop Arburn\u2019s vehicle. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">On March 31, 2005, at approximately 5:00 p.m., San Jose Police Officer Lira was stopped at a stop sign eastbound on Forest at the Bascom Avenue intersection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Turning to his left, Officer Lira saw Arburn\u2019s \u201cvehicle weaving, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>S/B Bascom Ave. and almost hit the curb.\u201d Arbum\u2019s vehicle was \u201cweaving in Lane #2,\u201d and was \u201ctraveling at about the speed limit\u201d when it \u201calmost hit the west curb of Bascom Ave.\u201d Officer Lira pulled behind the vehicle as it passed in front of him and the car \u201cimmediately turned into a parking lot of a business.\u201d Officer Lira \u201cinitiated a vehicle stop for the weaving in the roadway.\u201d &gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Upon contacting Arburn, Officer Lira observed several objective symptoms of intoxication: bloodshot/watery eyes, the odor of an alcoholic beverage, unsteady gait, slurred speech, and horizontal nystagmus. Arburn \u201cneeded to lean on [the] police car at times to keep steady\u201d and was \u201cvery slow in [his] responses.\u201d Officer Lira arrested Arburn for driving under the influence. On the way to the police station, Arburn began to fall asleep in the back of the police car. A blood-alcohol test administered one hour later confirmed a blood-alcohol content. of 0.23 percent, well over the legal limit of 0.08 percent. (See \u00a7 23152.) As a result of the blood test results, the DMV suspended Arbum\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">Arburn requested an administrative hearing pursuant to section 13558 to determine whether the suspension of his license was justified. (\u00a7 13558, subd. (a); see also <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 448, 456 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 860, 940 P.2d 311] [describing right to hearing upon request and hearing process].) At the hearing, the administrative officer was tasked with determining: (a) whether the officer had reasonable cause to believe that Arburn had been driving a motor vehicle in violation of section 23152; (b) whether Arburn was lawfully arrested; and (c) whether Arburn was driving a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol content of 0.08 percent or greater. (\u00a7\u00a7 13557, subd. (b)(2), 13558, subd. (c)(2).) Arburn challenged only the second statutory requirement\u2014that he was not lawfully arrested\u2014and contended that Officer Lira did not have sufficient cause to stop his vehicle. The hearing officer found all three statutory prerequisites met by a preponderance of the evidence and reinstated the suspension of Arbum\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">On September 26, 2005, Arburn petitioned the superior court for review of the administrative findings. (See \u00a7 13559 [providing for judicial review of license suspension].) The court issued an alternative writ temporarily staying the suspension to consider Arbum\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus. At the hearing on the petition, the court found there was insufficient evidence to support the findings that the investigatory stop was justified. The court issued a writ of mandate directing the DMV to set aside its order suspending Arbum\u2019s driving privileges. The DMV filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">In ruling on a driver\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus, the trial court uses its independent judgment to determine \u201c 1 \u201cwhether the weight of the evidence supported the administrative decision.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Lake </em>v. <em>Reed, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 448, 456-457.) On appeal, the trial court\u2019s factual findings must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 457.) If the facts are undisputed and the issue presented is a question of law, as it is here, we conduct an independent review. (See <em>Morgenstern v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 366, 372 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 46]; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1514, 1517 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 528].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">\u201c \u2018Under the Fourth Amendment, government officials may conduct an investigatory stop of a vehicle only if they possess \u201creasonable suspicion: a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d . . . Such reasonable suspicion \u201crequires specific, articulable facts which, together with objective and reasonable inferences, form a basis for suspecting that a particular person is engaged in criminal conduct.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>White </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 636, 641 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 371], citation omitted.) \u201cUnder this standard, an officer may stop and briefly detain a suspect for questioning for a limited investigation even if the circumstances fall short of probable cause to arrest.\u201d <em>(Brierton v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 499, 509 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 275] <em>(Brierton).) </em>The standard of reasonable suspicion is \u201cless demanding than probable cause \u2018not only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show-probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Souza </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 224, 230-231 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 885 P.2d 982].) At the same time, however, \u201cno stop or detention is permissible when the circumstances are not reasonably \u2018consistent with criminal activity\u2019 and the investigation is therefore based on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch.\u201d <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 894 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957] <em>(Tony C.), </em>superseded on other grounds by Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Arburn first contends that a single weave or swerve presents insufficient cause to suspect an intoxicated driver. He argues that \u201cthe record is ambiguous as to whether the weave and the almost hitting the curb constituted one action,\u201d so this court must assume that it was. We are not persuaded by Arbum\u2019s interpretation of the record. Officer Lira reported \u201cweaving\u201d, in the lane <em>and </em>that Arburn almost hit the west curb. The reasonable inference is not that Arbum\u2019s car swerved once, but that the vehicle was moving back and forth as it proceeded southbound and at one point narrowly missed the curb. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>More than one California court has found that \u201cweaving\u201d within a lane provides sufficient cause to conduct an investigatory stop. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bracken </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 3-4 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 481] <em>(Bracken) </em>[weaving within lane for one-half mile]; <em>People v. Perez </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8, 10-11 [221 Cal.Rptr. 776] <em>(Perez) </em>[\u201c\u2018pronounced weaving\u2019 within the lane\u201d for three-quarters of a mile; citing additional cases holding that weaving from one lane to another justifies an investigatory stop]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d Supp. 12, 14 [179 Cal.Rptr. 431] [driving 20 miles per hour under speed limit and \u201cweaving abruptly from one side of [the] lane to the other\u201d]; see also <em>People v. Russell </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 96, 104 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 568] [concluding summarily that fact that defendant was \u201cdrifting around in his lane\u201d justified an investigatory stop].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">While we recognize factual differences between this case and those cited above, we are not persuaded they are legally significant. The absence in the record of information regarding the officer\u2019s particular expertise, for instance, is of minimal relevance. (Cf. <em>Perez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 11 [noting that a trained officer should, be \u201cpermitted to make inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person\u201d and that the detaining officer in the case before it had seven and one-half years of experience]; <em>Bracken, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. Supp. 4 [observing that detaining officer was an expert in \u00bfriving under the influence cases].) Weaving within a lane is a widely recognized characteristic of an intoxicated driver and recognizing a weaving driver is undoubtedly within the province of even the most junior officer. It is, we posit, even within the ability of most fellow drivers. The DMV\u2019s failure to relate the particular training and experience of the arresting officer thus does not prevent us from crediting the officer\u2019s reasoned inference that Arburn\u2019s erratic driving was the result of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Likewise, the lack of evidence that Arburn was observed weaving over a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cconsiderable\u201d distance does not prevent a finding of reasonable suspicion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Perez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 11 [weaving within lane for a \u201csubstantial distance\u201d sufficient justification for investigatory stop]; <em>Bracken, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. Supp. 4 [following <em>Perez; </em>weaving within lane for a \u201cconsiderable distance\u201d supports reasonable suspicion].) \u201cWeaving\u201d for even the length of a block may signify that something is amiss, and the distance of observation is not a controlling factor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>evaluating a traffic stop. In <em>Perez, </em>the issue presented was whether, weaving over three-quarters of a mile (referred to as a \u201csubstantial distance\u201d) alone could provide sufficient justification for an investigatory stop. <em>(Perez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 10.) The court found that it did, and had no cause to determine whether a shorter distance would be sufficient. (See <em>id. </em>at p. Supp. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Arburn also stresses that there is a bend in Bascom Avenue at Naglee Road, one block north of where Officer Lira was stopped when he observed Arburn \u201cweaving\u201d and \u201calmost hit[ting] the west curb.\u201d He claims that this accounts for any erratic driving on that block of road. We question Arburn\u2019s presumption that a mere bend in the road would cause an attentive, sober driver to be \u201cweaving\u201d in the lane to the extent that he or she almost hits the curb. More importantly, \u201c[t]he possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 894.) \u201cEven if the circumstances are as consistent with lawful activity as with criminal activity, the officer may still rightfully \u2018inquire into such circumstances \u201cin the proper discharge of the officer\u2019s duties.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Kodani v. Snyder </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 471, 476 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 362], quoting <em>Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 894.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">The facts presented in this case support more than a mere \u201chunch\u201d regarding criminal activity; Arburn\u2019s weaving and near miss of the curb created an immediate concern for public safety and raised a reasonable suspicion that he was driving under the influence. Officer Lira had the right and the duty to determine exactly what was causing Arburn\u2019s car to weave and whether he could continue driving without presenting a safety risk. (See <em>Brierton, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 510 [\u201cThe officer\u2019s duty is to resolve\u2014through investigation\u2014any ambiguity presented as to whether the activity observed is, in fact, legal or illegal\u201d].) We conclude the superior court erred in reversing Arburn\u2019s suspension on the grounds that his detention was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">The judgment granting Arburn\u2019s petition for writ of mandate is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj2\">McAdams, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">All further statutory references are to the Vehicle Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1246-13\">The facts are taken from Officer Lira\u2019s sworn statement and unsworn narrative in the investigation report. Both documents were properly admitted in the proceedings below. (See generally <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 150, 153 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 48, 81 P.3d 975].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">As an aside, we note that Arburn\u2019s assertion that he was observed weaving for only 50 to 60 yards is not supported by admissible evidence. Arburn was not present at and did not testify at the administrative hearing. His attorney <em>argued </em>that Arburn only weaved for 50 to 60 yards at most, but that assertion is supported only by an exhibit drawn by the attorney that shows the Bascom/Forest intersection and surrounding area. Neither of Officer Lira\u2019s reports indicate how far away Arburn\u2019s vehicle was when he first noticed the erratic behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1250-8\">DUFFY, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A4a\">The majority finds a sufficient record that San Jose Police Officer Lira had a reasonable suspicion to make the traffic stop that ultimately resulted in respondent Jeffrey J. Arburn\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>\u201c[I]n order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken, place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity.\u201d <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957], superseded on other grounds by Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28.) In determining the lawfulness of a temporary detention, courts look at the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>(United States v. Arvizu </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 266, 273 [151 L.Ed.2d 740, 122 S.Ct. 744]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Souza </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 224, 239 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 885 P.2d 982].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">The totality of the circumstances here do not justify the detention. The sole undisputed evidence\u2014namely, Officer Lira\u2019s two written statements (one sworn and the other unsworn) presented \"at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) hearing\u2014was that bn March 31, 2005, at 5:00 p.m., Officer Lira, while stopped at a stop sign on Forest Avenue (facing east) at the intersection of Bascom Avenue, observed (1) by looking to his left, that Arburn\u2019s vehicle was proceeding south on Bascom; (2) that Arburn was traveling \u201cat about the speed limit\u201d; (3) that Arburn\u2019s vehicle was \u201cweaving in lane # 2, S/B from the controlled intersection at Bascom/Forest\u201d; (4) that Arburn\u2019s vehicle \u201calmost hit the west curb of Bascom Ave.\u201d; and (5) that Arburn \u201cimmediately turned into a parking lot of a business on the west side of Bascom Ave.\u201d after passing him. Officer Lira then initiated the traffic stop that ultimately led to Arburn\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">But for the incomplete state of the record presented at the DMV hearing, I might well agree with my colleagues that the traffic stop was proper. However, the evidence supporting the detention omitted potentially important information, such as (1) the nature and extent of the officer\u2019s training and experience investigating cases of driving under the influence; (2) the specifics underlying Officer Lira\u2019s statement that he observed Arburn\u2019s vehicle \u201cweaving\u201d (i.e., the number of times that the car weaved, and the amount of drift within the lane for each weave); and (3) the precise meaning of the officer\u2019s observation that the vehicle \u201calmost hit the west curb of Bascom Ave.\u201d (i.e., how close the vehicle came to hitting the curb, and the lateral distance that the vehicle drifted from the center of the lane to the location near the curb). All that may be gleaned from the record is that respondent, while proceeding at the speed limit, drove poorly for a brief period of time and over a short distance. In sum, this showing does not demonstrate that Officer Lira had \u201ca \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Arvizu, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>The majority cites four cases in which detentions were found to have been justified: <em>People </em>v. <em>Bracken </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 481] (Bracken); <em>People v. Russell </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 96 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 568] (Russell); <em>People v. Perez </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8 [221 Cal.Rptr. 776] <em>(Perez); </em>and <em>People v. Perkins </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d Supp. 12 [179 Cal.Rptr. 431] <em>(Perkins). </em>Although my colleagues acknowledge that there are factual differences between those cases and the circumstances here, they find them not to be legally significant. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1485.) I respectfully disagree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">In <em>Perez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8, the driver, at 2:15 in the morning, caught the attention of the officer because of his \u201c \u2018pronounced weaving\u2019 \u201d within the lane on an interstate highway over a distance of approximately three-quarters of a mile. <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 10.) Based upon this \u201cpronounced weaving\u201d that \u201ccontinue[d] for a substantial distance,\u201d the court in <em>Perez </em>held that the temporary detention of the defendant was lawful. <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 11.) The facts here are quite different: the stop occurred late in the afternoon as a result of a momentary weave within the motorist\u2019s lane on a city street.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Similarly, in <em>Bracken, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at page Supp. 3, the basis for the detention was the citing officer\u2019s observation that the defendant\u2019s vehicle had weaved within its lane for approximately one-half mile. The court\u2014 citing Perez\u2014concluded that the officer\u2019s observation of the defendant\u2019s \u201cvehicle weaving] within its lane for a considerable distance\u201d provided justification for the traffic stop. <em>(Bracken, supra, </em>at p. Supp. 4.) Here, unlike <em>Bracken, </em>the detention was not founded upon Arburn\u2019s vehicle having weaved within its lane for a distance even approaching one-half mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">The <em>Perez </em>court noted that the motorist\u2019s weaving \u201ccontinue[d] for a substantial distance.\u201d <em>(Perez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 11.) In <em>Bracken, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at page Supp. 4, the court noted that the weaving occurred \u201cfor a considerable distance.\u201d I agree with the majority that \u201cthe lack of evidence that Arburn was observed weaving over a \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018considerable\u2019 distance does not prevent a finding of reasonable suspicion.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1485, fn. omitted.) (Indeed, the <em>Perez </em>court did not define \u201csubstantial,\u201d and the <em>Bracken </em>court did not define \u201cconsiderable.\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>But by the same token, the momentary weaving within the motorist\u2019s own lane\u2014of itself, and even where the record discloses (ambiguously) that the driver \u201calmost hit the . . . curb\u201d\u2014is unlikely to satisfy the reasonable suspicion requirement for a detention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">The officer in <em>Perez </em>had extensive training and experience in dealing with motorists under the influence of drugs and alcohol. <em>(Perez, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 11.) And the <em>Bracken </em>court noted that the officer had five and one-half years\u2019 experience and had qualified as an expert in prior drunk driving cases. <em>(Bracken, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. Supp. 4.) Here, there was no evidence of the length of time Officer Lira had served with the highway patrol, what type of training he had received, or what experience he had, if any, in investigating cases of driving under the influence. While I agree with the majority that the existence of a record concerning the officer\u2019s experience in addressing such cases is not determinative (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1485), I nonetheless view its absence here to be of some significance, particularly in light of the minimal information concerning the officer\u2019s observations preceding the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">In <em>Russell, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at page 98, the defendant contended that evidence found in a vehicle should have been suppressed because \u201cit was improperly obtained as a result of an unreasonably prolonged detention.\u201d The court only briefly addressed the defendant\u2019s \u201csuggestion]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 102) that the traffic stop was unjustified, concluding summarily\u2014based upon the officer\u2019s observation at 7:00 a.m. that the subject vehicle was traveling approximately 10 miles under the speed limit on an interstate highway and was \u201crepeatedly drifting] around within its lane and sometimes out of its lane\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 99, fn. omitted)\u2014that the erratic driving justified the traffic stop. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 102.) The repeated drifting of the slow-moving vehicle in <em>Russell </em>is plainly distinguishable from the momentary weave of the Arburn vehicle observed by Officer Lira.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">And in <em>Perkins, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d at page Supp. 14, the court held that the detention was justified, where the defendant drove his vehicle 20 miles under the speed limit and was \u201cweaving abruptly from one side of his lane to the other.\u201d The individual circumstances here are distinguishable from, and significantly less extreme than, the evidence of erratic driving found in <em>Perkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>The events that Officer Lira observed immediately before detaining Arburn were not sufficient for the officer to have had \u201cspecific and articulable facts causing him to suspect\u201d that Arburn was involved in \u201csome activity relating to crime.\u201d <em>(In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 893.) The cases cited by the majority do not support a contrary conclusion. As one court has aptly noted: \u201c[I]f failure to follow a perfect vector down the highway or keeping one\u2019s eyes on the road were sufficient reasons to suspect a person of driving while impaired, a substantial portion of the public would be subject each day to an invasion of their privacy.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Lyons </em>(10th Cir. 1993) 7 F.3d 973, 976, overruled on another ground in <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Botero-Ospina </em>(10th Cir. 1995) 71 F.3d 783, 786-787.) I therefore agree with the trial court that Arburn\u2019s detention was constitutionally infirm arid would affirm the judgment entered on the order granting of the petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Two cases that distinguished <em>Perez </em>in which the detentions were held unlawful\u2014and in which the facts were much more similar to the case here than those in Perez\u2014are instructive. In <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Colin </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 314 F.3d 439, the court held the traffic stop unlawful because there was neither \u201c \u2018pronounced weaving,\u2019 \u201d nor a \u201cweave for a \u2018substantial distance\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 446); rather, the vehicle simply \u201ctouchfed] the right fog line and the center yellow line each for 10 seconds, after legitimate lane changes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Binette </em>(Tenn. 2000) 33 S.W.3d 215, 219, the defendant\u2019s vehicle at least touched the yellow line on multiple occasions, but the court held that the detention was unjustified, finding no evidence of \u201cpronounced weaving or hard swerving.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">The majority notes: \u201c \u2018Weaving\u2019 for even the length of a block may signify that something is amiss, and the distance of observation is not a controlling factor in evaluating a traffic stop.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1485-1486.) But the record does not support the majority\u2019s implication that Officer Lira observed Arburn\u2019s vehicle weaving for one block, or for a distance even approaching it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
