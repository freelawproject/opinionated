Defendants filed a protective cross-appeal, claiming the trial court erred by denying their motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the ground the action was barred by a United States treaty with Japan. Defendants also filed a motion for sanctions against plaintiffs and their counsel, claiming the appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">We conclude the trial judge\u2019s conduct was sufficiently egregious and pervasive that a reasonable person could doubt whether the trial was fair and impartial and reverse on that ground. On remand, the case shall be assigned to a different judge. Because we reverse, the motion for sanctions is denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>As to defendants\u2019 cross-appeal, the court properly found the treaty did not bar the action and thus we affirm its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Based on the nature of this appeal, few of the underlying facts are relevant. Plaintiffs were employed by defendant Ricoh. They sued Ricoh and certain of its employees for damages for statutory and common law discriminatory employment practices, claiming they were passed over for promotions, and Litton ultimately wrongfully terminated, because they were Caucasian and complained about racial discrimination. After a 30-day-plus trial, the jury returned a defense verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">THE MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We recite only the most egregious instances of the judicial misconduct cited by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Ricoh sought to introduce a video it used for training or public relations purposes. (Characterization by the trial court.) Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer contended, among other reasons for excluding it, that the video was \u201cprejudicial. . . and it\u2019s a marketing piece and has no bearing on the lawsuit.\u201d The court announced it would watch the video during the lunch hour and did so together with defense counsel without notifying plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer that he would be present or inviting her to join them. It then overruled plaintiffs\u2019 objections to admission of the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Somewhere midpoint in trial, in overruling one of plaintiffs\u2019 objections, the judge held up a hand-lettered sign, apparently prepared by him, stating \u201coverruled.\u201d The next day, when the court overruled another of plaintiffs\u2019 objections, defendants\u2019 attorney presented the judge with a different sign, stating: \u201cYour honor, I want to help you if I may. This is a much nicer version, [ft] The Court: Better than my homemade one. [ft] Ms. Reinglass: Plaintiffs object to Mr. Callahan presenting another \u2018overruled\u2019 sign to the court. The court\u2019s sign was adequate enough, [ft] The Comt: The court will await receiving a \u2018sustained\u2019 sign from plaintiff[s] so we can split the benefits here, [ft] Ms. Reinglass: How many do I get?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">A week later, when plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer objected to a question, the court apparently used Mr. Callahan\u2019s \u201coverruled\u201d sign. \u201cMs. Reinglass: [I am objecting to a]ny reading of the document not in evidence, [ft] The Court: He\u2019s not reading, [he\u2019s] asking questions, [ft] Ms. Reinglass: Hopefully he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>won\u2019t read. [][] The Court: And hopefully he won\u2019t keep talking, HQ Mr. Callahan: Your honor, I didn\u2019t get a chance to make that, HQ The Court: It took too much time to make that sign. HQ Ms. Reinglass: And there\u2019s a sign, and I object to that. HO The Court: He is directing it to me. It\u2019s lightening things up. And the jury nods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Midway into the trial, the court stated, \u201cJeffrey [the clerk], we\u2019re going to the soccer style method here. Red card, 50 bucks each. Okay. If I say, red card plaintiff, write it down, 50 bucks. Red card defense, 50 bucks. HQ We\u2019ll keep a running tab. End of trial, we\u2019ll collect it from them and we may take you guys [presumably the jury] to lunch at a very nice place. Okay. Court has enough money for now, and that will either <em>stop the talking </em>or give you a very nice lunch.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Over the next 20 pages of transcript, during which plaintiff Litton was being examined, defendants\u2019 lawyer raised at least nine objections, six of which were overruled, with no mention of a red card. Then, when plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated she was reading the last portion of a deposition, defendants\u2019 counsel stated, \u201cVery good. HQ . . . HQ I probably shouldn\u2019t say very good. No objection.\u201d The court states, \u201cThat\u2019s an orange card, not a red card.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">During the next 12 pages or so in the transcript, defendants\u2019 lawyer made three objections, two of which were overruled. As plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer continued her examination of Litton, she noted she was almost finished with a section. Defendants\u2019 counsel stated \u201c352.\u201d The court responded, \u201c351 and a half. HQ Go ahead.\u201d After several questions, defendants\u2019 lawyer stated, \u201c351 and three-quarters,\u201d to which the court replied, \u201cOverruled. Numbers junky.\u201d No red cards were mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Over the next 10 pages of transcript, defendants\u2019 lawyer raised two more objections, one of which was overruled. Defendants then interposed a hearsay objection. The court asked, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have [the expert witness] testify, right? HQ Ms. Reinglass: Pardon me? HQ The Court: We\u2019re going to have him testifying, right? HQ Ms. Reinglass: Yes. HQ The Court: And [Litton] is testifying to his numbers pretrial and questioned on the complaint and not about experts and discovery, so we\u2019ll wait for the expert to tell us what those numbers were and how had he arrived on them. HQ Sustained. HQ Ms. Reinglass: May I? HQ The Court: Red card plaintiff, Jeffrey. HQ Ms. Reinglass: I was asking. HQ The Court: 5-0. Next question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>In testifying as to his emotional distress, Litton stated that he felt like he was in a white room without doors or windows that had no boundaries. On cross-examination as to this testimony, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">\u201cMr. Callahan: Q Have you ever heard of The Twilight Zone? [][] A Yes sir. [ft] Q Goes kind of like this, do do, do do. [f] Ms. Reinglass: Your Honor, I would just object. This is argument, [f] The Court: Your objection\u2019s on the record, ma\u2019am. [][] Ms. Reinglass: Also improper argument. [|] Mr. Callahan: You\u2019re traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind, a journey into a wondrous land,- whose boundaries are that of imagination^] that\u2019s a sign post up ahead, your next stop, The Twilight Zone. Do do, do do. Do do, do do. [f] The Court: That was terrible. Get to the question, please, [f] Ms. Reinglass: Noting for the record, counsel was singing The Twilight Zone theme song, [f] The Court: And how the jurors left it will be reflected on the same record, [f] By Mr. Callahan: Q Endless white room with no doors or windows. [][] Is that where you got your idea of this white room theory? [|] . . . [f] A From where? [][]... [f] The Court: Twilight Zone. That\u2019s his question. [][] The Witness: No sir. [&lt;j[] Mr. Callahan: Do do, do, do. Do do, do do. [][] Ms. Reinglass: I request that counsel stop singing. As entertaining as it is for the jury, it\u2019s mocking my client and mocking the trial, [f] By Mr. Callahan: Q Ever heard of The Twilight Zone, the show? [][] A Yes sir! [f] The Court: For the record, he hit a few. notes of The Twilight Zone theme song which I don\u2019t see as mocking. He was off color [sic], [f] Mr. Callahan: I go through life tone deaf and colorblind. This is tough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Litton, he read approximately 30 pages of the deposition of Rhonda Stevenson, a one-time employee of Ricoh. Stevenson was not a defendant and at the time of her deposition no longer worked for Ricoh. She never-testified at trial. Litton had complained to her about what he believed was unfair treatment. Litton was asked whether he had read her deposition and then counsel was allowed to read several portions of her testimony and ask Litton if he recalled reading that testimony. For example, \u201cDid you read . . . where [Stevenson] said you were insincere and tried to- manipulate- both her and [another employee]?\u201d \u201cDo you recall [Stevenson\u2019s] testimony that you were a proper candidate for layoff . . . ?\u201d When Litton said he did not recall, the court permitted defendants\u2019 lawyer to read Stevenson\u2019s testimony to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">During that testimony, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer raised numerous objections. At one point she asked to \u201chave a running objection until I add anything new. [][] The Court: That would help. Same objection that\u2019s been going on all day will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>be deemed to be made to every question and every answer throughout time. [|] Ms. Reinglass: There may be some I like. [|] The Court: With the same ruling. Well, until I die. Same ruling. Okay, [f] Ms. Reinglass: Just as to Ms. Stevenson\u2019s deposition. I\u2019ll settle for that for now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">As defendants\u2019 counsel continued to cross-examine Litton using that deposition, before one question he stated, \u201cOkay. This one is not good -for Mr. Haluck ....[][] Ms. Reinglass: Objection , to the characterization by counsel. Improper argument, [f] The Court: It\u2019s a warning. Just giving the witness a heads up. [][] What\u2019s the question, sir?\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The next day, as defendants\u2019 lawyer again began to cross-examine Litton using the deposition,. plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer objected, to which the court responded: \u201cOverruled. Objection, 187. [1] Ms. Reinglass: Huh? Q] The Court: I got a number for all these things, [f] Mr. Callahan: 187 in the Penal Code, what is that, your honor? [j[] The Court: Murder.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In another instance, when Litton was testifying that he was discriminated against because of his race, his lawyer asked: \u201cAnd did you feel that it was based upon your race because of comments by [defendant] Nomura?\u201d The court sustained an objection as leading. Counsel then rephrased, asking, \u201cWas there any other reason why you felt that it was based upon your race? []Q A [D]ue to the comment by [defendant] Nomura.\u201d Defendants\u2019 attorney stated, \u201cWhat- a surprise,\u201d to which\u2019 the judge remarked, \u201cAren\u2019t they clever, [f] (Laughter).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">As defendants\u2019 counsel was concluding his cross-examination of Litton, the following exchange occurred: \u201cWith that, your honor\u2014[][] Oh, do you [Litton] play poker? [][] A No, sir. [f] Q Terrific poker face.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer objected \u201cto the editorializing by counsel.\u201d There was no ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">After a question by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, defendants\u2019 attorney stated, \u201cObjection. Gosh, what is that? H] The Court: What is it? [f] Mr. Callahan: Hearsay, [f] The Court: Overruled, [f] Mr. Callahan: How about\u2014[f] The Court: No. Go back to sleep. [][]... [][] Mr. Callahan: Wake me when it\u2019s break time, [f] The Court: It\u2019s very close, [f] (Laughter).\u201d Later that day, when Mr. Callahan made an objection, the court stated, \u201cDon\u2019t wake him up,\u201d to which Mr. Callahan replied, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t get a lot of sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">1. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Plaintiffs assert the judgment should be reversed because the judge committed misconduct so egregious they were denied a fair trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In conducting trials, judges \u201c \u2018should be exceedingly discreet in what they say and do in the presence of a jury lest they seem to lean toward or lend their influence to one side or the other.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sturm </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1218, 1237-1238 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 799, 129 P.3d 10].) Their conduct must \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018accord with recognized principles of judicial decorum consistent with the presentation of a case in an atmosphere of fairness and impartiality.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hernandez v. Paicius </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 452, 462 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 756].) \u201c \u2018The trial of a case should not only be fair in fact,... it should also appear to be fair.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 455.) The judge\u2019s actions and comments during trial violated these principles such that \u201c \u2018it shocks the judicial instinct to allow the judgment to stand.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">2. <em>Ex Parte Contact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Plaintiffs challenge the judge\u2019s viewing of the videotape with defendants\u2019 counsel present, claiming it was improper ex parte contact that \u201ctainted\u201d the court\u2019s ruling on its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">Generally ex parte contacts between a judge and counsel are improper, and if not unjust in actuality, give the appearance of injustice. (See <em>In re Hancock </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 943, 947-949 [136 Cal.Rptr. 901].) \u201cA judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications . . . concerning a pending . . . proceeding, except\u201d \u201cwhere circumstances require, for . . . administrative purposes . . . that do not deal with substantive matters provided; [][]... the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication, and [][]... the judge makes provision promptly to notify all other parties of the substance of the ex parte communication and allows an opportunity to respond.\u201d (Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 3B(7)(d); see also Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5-300(B) [lawyer shall not communicate with judge about merits of pending contested case except in open court, in writing, or in presence or with consent of opposing counsel].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">The record shows defendants\u2019 lawyer was present when the court previewed the video. Although it also reflects that the judge stated he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>review the video at lunch, there was never any indication he would do so with defendants\u2019 counsel present or that plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer was invited to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">And the contact between defense counsel and the court dealt with a substantive matter\u2014whether or not the videotape, to which plaintiffs objected, would be admitted. As plaintiffs note, we have no way of knowing whether there was discussion during which defendants\u2019 counsel explained the video, to which plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer would be entitled to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We are not holding that either the judge or defendants\u2019 counsel intended to violate any professional standards in this instance. However, the trial judge should not have permitted counsel for only one party to participate in viewing the video with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">3. <em>Lack of Courtesy and Decorum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The remainder of the court\u2019s conduct set out above was also improper. Judicial ethics require a judge to \u201cbe patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants . . . [and] . . . lawyers . . . and . . . require similar conduct of lawyers . . . under the judge\u2019s direction and control.\u201d (Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 3B(4).) The delineated exchanges between the court and counsel are the antithesis of judicial decorum and courtesy. They cannot in any sense be characterized as \u201ctempered miscellaneous comments,\u201d as defendants suggest. (Boldface, capitalization, and underscoring omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">a. Twilight Zone</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">We are not persuaded by defendants\u2019 assertion that many of the exchanges between the judge and defendants\u2019 lawyer, such as the <em>Twilight Zone </em>colloquy, cannot be judicial misconduct because they were made by counsel, not the judge. That misses the point. Although some of these comments were counsel\u2019s, the judge instigated and encouraged many of them. He also allowed, indeed helped create, a circus atmosphere, giving defendants\u2019 lawyer free rein to deride and make snide remarks at will and at the expense of plaintiffs and their lawyer. That was misconduct. (Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 3B(3) [\u201cA judge shall require order and decorum in proceedings\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">b. <em>\u201cOverruled\u201d Signs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">The \u201coverruled\u201d signs also demonstrated the court\u2019s lack of courtesy and decorum. Defendants\u2019 arguments justifying this conduct are imaginative but fatuous. We reject their characterization of use of the sign as the court</p>\n<p id=\"Ayf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>\u201coverruling certain objections in writing.\u201d (Boldface, underscoring, and capitalization omitted.) The judge\u2019s suggestion to plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer that she supply a \u201csustained\u201d sign was not \u201ccircumspect\u201d nor is counsel to be faulted for not \u201cchoosing\u201d to provide one. This conduct was a sideshow in the overall circus atmosphere mocking a serious proceeding important to the parties, and it \u201ccast the judicial system itself in a bad light in the eyes of the litigants and the public at large.\u201d <em>(Hernandez v. Paicius, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.4th at p. 455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Defendants challenge plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the court used these signs only when ruling on their objections. Again, this misses the mark. It is like saying a baseball team could not complain if the umpire decided to call balls and strikes with his eyes closed, as long as he kept them closed for both teams. The point is not that the acts were evenhanded, it is that the game could not safely be said to have been played according to the rules. And if defendants\u2019 lawyer was enjoying the spectacle, he would not object to use of the signs to overrule his objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Plaintiffs argue the court\u2019s use of the sign was persistent. The record does not specifically reflect it. But the fact that the sign was still in use a week after first being displayed lends support to this assertion. We agree this conduct made a mockery of plaintiffs\u2019 objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Defendants\u2019 argument plaintiffs waived ,their challenge to this behavior by failing to object to the judge\u2019s initial use of the sign he made, by commenting it was adequate, or by failing, to ask for a curative instruction does not persuade. Counsel did note the judge\u2019s sign for the record; that certainly was not to approve of it. She also objected to use of defendants\u2019 sign, twice, and the court denied the objections. A request for a curative instruction would have been futile. <em>(People v. Sturm, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">4. <em>Stevenson Deposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">a. <em>Improper Use of Deposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">There was also misconduct connected to the reading of the Stevenson deposition. Plaintiffs argue actual use of the deposition testimony was improper for several reasons, including that it contained improper opinion and hearsay, and lacked foundation, and based on the failure to comply with Evidence Code section 1291, subdivision (a)(2). In addition to the erroneous ruling on admissions, plaintiffs protest the demeaning manner in which the court overruled their objections. Plaintiffs are correct on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Under Evidence Code section 1291, subdivision (a)(2), subject to certain conditions not at issue here, previously recorded testimony may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>offered at trial only if the deponent is unavailable as a witness. Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.620, subdivision (b) is an exception to this rule in that it allows the deposition of a party or one who was an employee of a party at the time the deposition is taken to be used at trial against the other party, whether or not the deponent is available. Here, however, Stevenson was not employed by Ricoh at the time her deposition was taken. Thus the conditions of section 2025.620, subdivision (b). were not met, and the record does not reflect any showing of Stevenson\u2019s unavailability. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1291, subd. (a)(2); see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2025.620, subd. (c).) Thus, it was error to admit the testimony, and plaintiffs sufficiently objected to its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">b. <em>\u201cUntil 1 Die\u201d and \u201c187\u201d (\u201cMurder\u201d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">When plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer asked for a running objection to use of the Stevenson deposition, the court agreed the objection would apply to every question \u201cuntil I die.\u201d Later, when counsel raised another objection, the judge overruled it, noting, \u201cObjection, 187.\u201d In response to defendants\u2019 lawyer\u2019s facetious question about Penal Code section 187, the court stated, \u201cMurder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">It is unclear from the record exactly what the court meant when it used \u201c187\u201d in overruling plaintiffs\u2019 repeated objections. It could have been a sarcastic reference to the number of objections plaintiffs had made, as they contend. The \u201cuntil I die\u201d statement makes it clear the court had no use for the objections. If the colloquy had stopped at the court stating \u201c187,\u201d it probably would not have been a factor in this case. But the judge again allowed defendants\u2019 counsel to make an inappropriate remark and joined in the continuing antics by responding to the Penal Code question with the answer, \u201cmurder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The court and defendants\u2019 lawyer may just have been having a good time; defendants comment in their brief that the Penal Code reference was \u201c[ojbviously ... a humorous question.\u201d But while humor may have a legitimate place in a trial, it should not be used to belittle litigants or their counsel. Here the judge and defendants\u2019 lawyer had fun by making plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer the butt of their jokes. They took turns providing straight lines and punch lines to each other in a way that could only convey to the jury that they were a team and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was an outsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">5. <em>Soccer Game</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Use of the \u201csoccer-style\u201d \u201cred card\u201d procedure was glaringly inappropriate, also violating the requirement of judicial decorum. In addition, in employing it the court demonstrated favoritism toward defendants. After it was initiated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>defendants\u2019 attorney was allowed to raise numerous objections, some of which were overruled, and to joke with the judge without being fined. When plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer attempted to address an objection, however, she was immediately given a \u201cred card.\u201d In instituting this game, the judge stated he wanted to \u201cstop the talking.\u201d However, apparently he only wanted to stop plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer from talking. This unequal treatment improperly \u201ccreated the impression that the trial judge was allied with [defendants].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sturm, </em>supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 1241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We reject defendants\u2019 argument based on their self-described scorecard showing they received 12 red cards compared to plaintiffs\u2019 three, and concluding the \u201cmatch favors [plaintiffs.]\u201d (Boldface, underscoring, and capitalization omitted.) The problem with this claim is the same as with the court\u2019s conduct. A trial is not a sporting event. Defendants\u2019 spin on this conduct is ludicrous; it, was not a \u201ccircumspect\u201d way to \u201c \u2018tone down\u2019\u201d imposition of sanctions. There was nothing circumspect about it; it was designed to make the sanctions -as obvious as possible to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">6. <em>\u201cAren\u2019t They Clever\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The \u201caren\u2019t they clever\u201d comment disparaged Litton\u2019s testimony and implied he was not telling the truth and that his lawyer was trying to sneak in otherwise inadmissible evidence. <em>(People v. Sturm, supra, 37 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1240.) \u201c[A] trial court must avoid comments that convey to the jury the message that the judge does not believe the testimony of the witness. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1238.) In addition, \u201c \u2018[i]t is completely improper for a judge to advise the jury of negative personal views concerning the competence, honesty, or ethics of the attorneys in a trial.\u2019 . . . The trial court\u2019s comment implying that . . . counsel was behaving unethically or in an underhanded fashion constituted misconduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1240-1241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The fact that the judge used the word \u201cclever\u201d at many times throughout the trial and in different, contexts not all unfavorable to plaintiffs, as defendants point out, does not undo the damage inflicted by the instance of misconduct. Here there was no question, the word \u201cclever\u201d was a derogatory reference to plaintiff Litton\u2019s testimony. That the word was used neutrally in other contexts is wholly irrelevant. \u201c[I]t is \u2018the duty of the judge to <em>control </em>all proceedings during the trial, and to <em>limit </em>the introduction of evidence and the <em>argument </em>of counsel to relevant and material matters, with a view to the expeditious and effective ascertainment of the truth regarding the matters involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Sturm, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1237, italics added.) Obviously, that was not done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>The other comments by defendants\u2019 counsel that the court allowed over plaintiffs\u2019 objections, including reference to Litton\u2019s \u201cpoker face\u201d and that a question was \u201cnot a good one\u201d for Haluck, are more examples of the inappropriate conduct that mocked plaintiffs and their testimony and impugned their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">7. <em>Defendants\u2019Assertions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In addition to their other arguments discussed above, defendants maintain plaintiffs waived their claims of judicial misconduct because they did not object. We disagree. Although the general rule requires objection to preserve the right to appeal acts of judicial misconduct, \u201cfailure to object does not preclude review \u2018when an objection and an admonition could not cure the prejudice caused by\u2019 such misconduct, or when objecting would be futile. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Sturm, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1237.) In the atmosphere of this trial, such was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Defendants also point to curative instructions, which they claim mitigated any misconduct. After a lunch break one day the judge informed the jurors he would be instructing them later about how to apply law to the facts. He pointed out that he \u201ctalk[ed] a lot and you shouldn\u2019t take anything that I say seriously [because] I have no role in this trial. T have not intended by anything I have said or done or any question that I may have asked or by any rulings that I may have made to suggest how you should decide any question of fact or that I believe or disbelieve any witness. If anything I\u2019ve done or said has seemed to so indicate, you must disregard it and form your own opinions.\u2019 \u201d One of the standard jury instructions given at the end of trial repeated the language the jury should not decide based on the judge\u2019s statements or actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">But neither.instruction was directed to any particular misconduct, so the jury would have no way of knowing to what it referred. Further, in light of all the improper comments by the court and those it allowed from defendants\u2019 lawyer, the instructions constituted only a dribble of water incapable of quenching a blazing fire. \u201cJurors rely with great confidence on the fairness of judges, and upon the correctness of their views expressed during trials. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Sturm, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1233; see also <em>People v. Santana </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1207 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 158] [admonitions throughout trial did not cure judge\u2019s statements giving impression he found defense case weak].) Having served in that capacity, we are well aware of the tremendous power the comments and attitude of a trial judge have on a jury. That power was repeatedly abused during this case and a passing admonition was not enough to cure it.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>Defendants examine each act of misconduct individually and argue that a jury could not have perceived bias based on one comment during a 31-day trial. But it is the total effect of these acts and statements that is fatal. \u201cAlthough no one instance of misconduct appears to, in itself, require reversal, the cumulative effect of the trial judge\u2019s conduct requires reversal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sturm, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1243.) Further, we reject defendants\u2019 argument that the misconduct on which plaintiffs rely cannot be characterized as pervasive because it only spanned day seven to day 22 of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">In addition, defendants\u2019 50-page-plus list of, instances where they lost objections does not ameliorate the misconduct. Likewise, the fact the judge chastised their lawyer many times or was rude to him does not justify his other improper acts, and comments. Moreover, to the extent this is true, neither side received a fair trial. That both parties were subjected to this conduct should not be: a basis for affirming the judgment. Furthermore, as plaintiffs note, they bore the burden of proof. So the question is whether the court so interfered with their case it was impossible to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">8. <em>Misconduct Requires Reversal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\u201cWhere, as here, the appearance of judicial bias and unfairness colors the entire record, we depart from the general rule requiring plaintiff to make an affirmative showing of prejudice. The test is not whether plaintiff has proved harm, but whether the court\u2019s comments would cause a reasonable person to doubt the impartiality of the judge or would cause us to lack confidence in the fairness of the proceedings such as would necessit\u00e1te reversal. The record here inspires no confidence in either case.\u201d <em>(Hernandez v. Paicius, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.4th at p. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">\u201cWe scrupulously guard against bias and prejudice, actu\u00e1l or reasonably perceived, not only to prevent improper factors from influencing the fact finder\u2019s deliberations, but to vindicate the reputation of the court itself. . . . \u2018We must also keep in mind . . . that the source of judicial authority lies ultimately in the faith of the people that a fair hearing may be had.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hernandez v. Paicius, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.4th at p. 462; see Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 2A [\u201cA judge . . . shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">It is obvious that much of the judge\u2019s conduct was not malicious but rather a misguided attempt to be humorous, and defendants\u2019 lawyer played into it, often acting as the straight man. But a courtroom is not the Improv and the presider\u2019s role model is hot Judge Judy.'We can only imagine what was in the jurors\u2019 minds as they endured a 30-day-plus trial in this atmosphere or the impression of the judicial system they took away with them posttrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>\u201cWhere the average person could well entertain doubt whether the trial judge was impartial, appellate courts are not required to speculate whether the bias was actual or merely apparent, or whether the result would have been the same if the evidence had been impartially considered and the matter dispassionately decided [citation], but should reverse the judgment and remand the matter to a different judge for a new trial on all issues.\u201d <em>(Catchpole v. Brannon </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 237, 247 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 440].) We do that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Defendants filed a protective cross-appeal from the court\u2019s denial of their motions for summary judgment and motions for summary adjudication of issues on the ground that the action was barred by the Japanese Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty of 1953 (Apr. 2, 1953, 4 U.S.T. 2063, T.I.A.S. No. 2863) (treaty), particularly article VHI(l). Article VIII(l) provides that \u201ccompanies of either Party [to the treaty] shall be permitted to engage, within the territories of the other Party, accountants and other technical experts, executive personnel, attorneys, agents and other specialists of their choice.\u201d (4 U.S.T. 2063, 2070.) Article VIII(l) is \u201cintended to give both parties to the treaty a degree of discretion in staffing enterprises operating in the other\u2019s country with managerial or technical personnel from the home country. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kirmse v. Hotel Nikko </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 311, 317 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 96].)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Defendant Ricoh, a United States company, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ricoh Corporation, a New Jersey corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ricoh Company, Ltd., a Japanese corporation (Ricoh Japan). Defendants assert that any claim of discrimination against plaintiffs on the basis of their race or national origin was only Ricoh Japan placing its employees at defendant Ricoh \u201con a temporary basis in key management and technical positions ... as permitted by the [t]reaty.\u201d Since the treaty allows such temporary employees, they continue, it bars plaintiffs\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The one California case on this subject, <em>Kirmse </em>v. <em>Hotel Nikko, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th 311, rejects defendants\u2019 claim, holding that the treaty \u201cdoes not apply to a domestically incorporated subsidiary of a Japanese corporation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 317.) In arriving at this decision, <em>Kirmse </em>relied on <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 176.[72 L.Ed.2d 765, 102 S.Ct. 2374], It contained a detailed analysis of the treaty and its underlying intent and went to great lengths to distinguish between United States branches of a Japanese corporation, which would be subject to the terms of the treaty, and locally incorporated subsidiaries, which would not. <em>Sumitomo </em>reasoned that because Sumitomo Shoji America was incorporated in New York, it was \u201ca company of the United States, not a company of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>Japan. As a company of the United States operating in the United States, under the literal language of . . . the [t]reaty, Sumitomo cannot invoke the rights provided in Article VIII(l), which are available only to companies of Japan operating in the United States and to companies of the United States operating in Japan.\u201d <em>(Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, supra, </em>457 U.S. at pp. 182-183, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Defendants primarily rely on a footnote in <em>Sumitomo </em>in which the court noted that it expressed no view on whether a United States subsidiary of a Japanese corporation could assert its parent\u2019s rights under the treaty. <em>(Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, supra, </em>457 U.S. at pp. 189-190, fn. 19.) They claim defendant Ricoh may assert .such rights. <em>Kirmse </em>considered that issue, noting that in some circumstances, namely piercing the corporate veil or where there was a -closely related third party, a subsidiary could have standing to assert rights under the treaty. <em>(Kirmse v. Hotel Nikko, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at p. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Here, there is no claim of piercing the corporate veil. Defendants advance the theory that Ricoh Japan is a closely related third party. They point to <em>Edmonson </em>v. <em>Leesville Concrete Co. </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 614 [114 L.Ed.2d 660, 111 S.Ct. 2077], which stated that in \u201c \u2018certain, limited exceptions,\u2019 ... a litigant may raise a claim on behalf of a third party if the litigant can demonstrate that he or she has suffered a concrete, redressable injury, that he or she has a close relation with the third party, and that there exists some hindrance to the third party\u2019s ability to protect his or her own interests.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Defendants fail to meet this burden. They argue Ricoh Japan has suffered injury but do not address whether defendant Ricoh, \u201cthe litigant,\u201d has been harmed. Moreover Ricoh is not even a direct subsidiary of Ricoh Japan; it is owned by Ricoh Corporation, a New Jersey corporation, which is the subsidiary of Ricoh Japan. Defendants have not shown <em>Edmonson. </em>or any other authority would allow standing in such an attenuated circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Defendants also rely on <em>Fortino </em>v. <em>Quasar Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1991) 950 F.2d 389, which distinguished <em>Sumitomo </em>on the ground that in that case, there was no claim the subsidiary\u2019s discriminatory conduct had been mandated by the Japanese parent. In a well-reasoned discussion, <em>Kirmse </em>found <em>Fortino </em>unpersuasive and rejected it. <em>(Kirmse </em>v. <em>Hotel Nikko, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at pp. 319-321.) We agree with its conclusions and see no need to reiterate that discussion. Likewise, none of the other federal cases defendants cite dissuades us from our conclusion the treaty does not protect defendant Ricoh.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The judgment is reversed. The motion for sanctions is denied. On remand the case shall be assigned to a different judge. Appellants Michael Litton and James Haluck are entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Sills, P. J., and Bedsworth, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">On June 21, 2007, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
