Braeseke shot his parents and Barker shot the grandfather, after first hitting him several times on the head with a chisel. Tried as an adult, Barker was convicted of two counts of second degree murder and one count of first degree murder. Now almost age 47, Barker has been in state prison for 29 years, during which time he has participated in numerous self-help programs, obtained his General Education Diploma (G.E.D.), earned 45 units of college credit, acquired several vocational skills, and has been discipline-free since 1995. And Barker\u2019s development in prison culminated in a September 2005 mental health evaluation that confirmed earlier evaluations: \u201crisk for recidivism on a violent crime while in the free community is within the low range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Against that background, Barker appeared on November 14, 2005, before a two-person panel of the Board of Parole Hearings (Board),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in his ninth attempt to obtain parole. Barker was sworn and answered questions from the Board members and from his counsel. No other witnesses appeared. Following a relatively brief hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Board orally announced its two decisions: it refused Barker parole and deferred his next parole hearing for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">In this petition for writ of habeas corpus Barker makes five arguments, the first of which is in essence that the Board\u2019s denial of parole violated his due process rights because it was based on findings supported by no evidence, based on grounds supported solely on the unchangeable facts of his commitment offenses, and/or based on grounds inherent in the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and definitions of the commitment offenses. We conclude that this contention has merit, and thus grant the petition and order a new parole suitability hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ACD\">1. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Although 16 years old at the time he committed the crimes, Barker was tried as an adult.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was convicted by a jury on April 14, 1977, and received three concurrent sentences\u2014five years to life for each of the second degree murder convictions for the killing of Braeseke\u2019s parents, and life for the first degree murder conviction for the killing of Braeseke\u2019s grandfather. Barker\u2019s minimum parole eligibility date was set at August 25, 1983. The Board has denied Barker parole 10 times: in 1982, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 2000 and, most recently, 2005.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">On February 28, 2006, Barker filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Alameda County Superior Court challenging the Board\u2019s most recent denial of parole. The superior court denied that petition on July 13, 2006. Barker filed his petition for habeas corpus in this court on July 31, 2006, accompanied by 13 exhibits. On October 4, 2006, we issued an order to show cause directed at the Director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, pursuant to which respondent John Marshall, warden at the California Men\u2019s Colony (Warden), filed a return, accompanied by 22 exhibits of his own.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Barker filed a denial and traverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">2. <em>The Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The following description of .the crimes comes from the Board\u2019s initial decision in 1982 denying parole, part of which the Board quoted in its decision at the November 14, 2005 parole hearing (Parole Hearing): In June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of 1976, Barker and codefendant Braeseke met over citizens\u2019 band (CB) radio. Soon after they met, Braeseke asked Barker to help kill Braeseke\u2019s parents. The two talked of living and traveling together with the money they would get after the parents were dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Barker often boasted to Braeseke he had killed chickens before. Several times, Barker had tied a bag around some chickens\u2019 heads and thrown them up in the air to watch them hit the ground. He had also buried a chicken up to its head, then put hay in a circle around the chicken and lit it on fire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based on these experiences, Barker suggested the best way to kill Braeseke\u2019s parents would be by hitting them on the head and choking them.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On August 23, 1976, after Barker and Braeseke had spent the day together, they went to Barker\u2019s garage and selected weapons. Barker chose a chisel and Braeseke chose a heavy mug. They then went to Braeseke\u2019s house. In Braeseke\u2019s bedroom they discussed their plan. The discussion was interrupted when Braeseke was called to dinner. After dinner, Braeseke returned to Barker, who had waited in the bedroom. They went downstairs to the family room where Braeseke\u2019s mother, father and grandfather were watching television. After being in the family room a brief period, Barker and Braeseke went back upstairs where Braeseke said he wanted to use his .22 rifle rather than choke his parents and grandfather. The two agreed. Barker then went back downstairs. Braeseke remained in his room for a few more minutes then went downstairs. At approximately 8:00 p.m., Braeseke walked up behind his father and shot him in the head three times. Braeseke then shot his mother two times, once in the head and once in the stomach. Barker struck the grandfather on the head with a chisel three to four times.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After shooting his mother and father, Braeseke came over to help Barker by throwing the grandfather on the floor next to the mother. Barker then picked up the .22 rifle and shot the grandfather twice in the head. All these events, Barker said, happened in very quick succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Afterwards, Barker and Braeseke ransacked the house to make it look like a burglary. Afraid of leaving fingerprints, Barker and Braeseke removed some of the objects they had touched while ransacking the house, along with the .22 rifle. While driving towards Hayward, they stopped at a gas station to wash blood off of their clothes. They went to a secluded road where Barker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>threw the .22 rifle under a bridge. Barker hid the objects they had removed from the house in his backyard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">3. <em>Barker\u2019s Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">According to a September 2005 psychological assessment, Barker grew up in a stable family without serious problems. He described his parents as supportive. While his brother was an alcoholic, there was no other family history of alcoholism or drug abuse. There was no domestic violence, no mental disorders, and no legal problems. Barker has maintained contact with his half sister and his mother while in prison. His father and brother are deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Barker\u2019s criminal record consists of the commitment offenses and one arrest, in 1973, when Barker was 13 years old. Barker was arrested (along with four other juveniles) for burglary and vandalism of items from an apartment complex storage locker. He received a reprimand and his parents paid for his share of the damage. At the Parole Hearing Barker testified no charges were ever filed. In a separate incident almost two years later, Barker\u2019s parents reported him to the sheriff\u2019s department when he did not return home on time. This incident did hot lead to any arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The April 2004 life prisoner evaluation report indicated that \u201c[njeighbors described [Barker] as a troublemaker and stated they saw him torture animals and light fire to a neighboring property that resulted in $45,000 worth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>damage.\u201d Regarding the fire, Barker admitted at the Parole Hearing that he and a neighbor boy his age had been playing with bottle rockets in his backyard, and they may have accidentally started the fire in the house across the street, but it was not intentional or malicious. No charges were ever filed and Barker was not arrested in connection with this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Regarding torturing animals, Barker admitted during the Parole Hearing he had been cruel to chickens as a young teenager. However, he has since told a psychologist that his behavior was \u201csenseless and stupid, and he is ashamed that he behaved that way.\u201d His background otherwise shows he was able to take care of animals, as Barker was an active member in the 4-H club for some seven years (including three years as club president), and he raised cattle, pigeons, rabbits, and chickens.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">4. <em>Barker\u2019s Conduct While in Prison</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation received Barker on June 14, 1977, when he was 17 years old. He had not yet completed his high school diploma and had \u201cvirtually no work experience or skills.\u201d While in prison, Barker has had numerous jobs for which he has received consistent above-average to exceptional ratings. He also obtained his G.E.D. on August 14, 1980, and has completed 45 units in college courses. He completed vocational and on-the-job training as an airframe mechanic, auto mechanic, carpenter, plumber, and clerk. Since 1987, he has participated in numerous therapy and self-help programs. These include the Category T therapy program, Anger Management, House of Healing, Hands of Peace, Four Agreements (a personal development and maturity course), and Advanced Alternatives to Violence. In March 2005, he completed an inmate peer education program to become a peer HIV educator.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Barker has not had any disciplinary problems since 1995, and none of the six earlier disciplinary problems involved violent behavior. The disciplines were: in February 1978 for possessing contraband ($5 belonging to another inmate); in March 1979 for possessing 12 marijuana joints; in April 1979 for allowing another inmate in his cell; in October 1983 for possessing contraband; in September 1990 for manipulating staff; and in June 1995 for smoking in bed. Barker also received four counseling memoranda: in November 1987 for possession of contraband (pornography, sugar, and a bottle of unidentified \u201cflammable liquid substance\u201d); in April 1993 for photos displayed; in May 1993 for covering his cell windows with paper; and in December 1993 for being absent from his vocational assignment. The September 15, 2005 psychological assessment by Cynthia Glines, Psy.D., summed up Barker\u2019s record as follows: he \u201chas only had 6 CDC 115 rules violation reports, and of those only one was serious, and none were violent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>He has not had a disciplinary write-up since 1995. Further, his score on the PCL-R [(Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, 2nd ed.) instrument for assessing risk of future violence] . . . was significantly below that of the average inmate, and did not support psychopathy as a risk factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">5. <em>Barker\u2019s Insight into the Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Braeseke told Barker he wanted to kill his father because he had abused Braeseke, and wanted to kill his mother and 76-year-old grandfather because they had been silent witnesses to the abuse, having done nothing to stop it. Barker admitted he did not know whether Braeseke had ever actually been abused by his father, but that is what Braeseke told him. Barker believed Braeseke was going to commit the murders with or without Barker\u2019s help.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">At the Parole Hearing, Barker testified regarding why he committed the crimes, testimony which suggested Braeseke was like an older brother or parental figure to him. Specifically, Braeseke was four or five years older than Barker, around the same age as Barker\u2019s older brother who had stopped spending time with him some years before the murders. With his brother absent and both his parents working full time, Barker felt unable to relate to his family. He had no guidance, was lost on his own, lacked self-esteem, and was full of self-doubt. Braeseke, on the other hand, had a strong personality, and Barker, fearing Braeseke would reject him, sought his acceptance. He helped Braeseke with the killings because he, Barker,, was. weak, and had succumbed to Braeseke\u2019s persuasion and allowed Braeseke to take control over him. Braeseke \u201cwore [him] down.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Though, as noted, in a September 2005 psychological assessment Barker described his parents as \u201csupportive,\u201d he testified at the Parole Hearing that he felt vulnerable because he could not connect with his family, that his father did not teach him life\u2019s lessons, and that he did not have any discipline or structure. Despite that, Barker also told the .Board he did not blame- his family for his crimes. As he summed it up at one point, at the time of the killings he \u201cwas a boy who out of misguided .loyalty, out of self-doubt and the inability to connect, with others, foolishly helped this guy kill his family, and you know, foolishly killed those chickens too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Barker has accepted full responsibility for his part in the murders since at least 1995. At the Parole Hearing he told the Board he was \u201cterribly sorry\u201d for his crimes, that he had grown up, that he was no longer a person who could be influenced the way he had been at age 16, and that he was no longer a danger to society. And Barker\u2019s description of himself found independent support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>6. <em>Letters Received by the Board</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Board received 10 letters urging that parole be granted. The letters themselves are not in the record, and what we know of their content and authors is from the descriptions by Board Presiding Commissioner Tracey St. Julien and Barker\u2019s responses about his relationship with the writers. Most of the letters were from people Barker had met while he was in prison and who had come to know him through various proprisoner programs in which they volunteered or participated, .some of whom no longer participated in these programs but nevertheless continued to visit Barker. One such letter was from a marriage and family therapist who described \u201chow long of a way\u201d Barker had come \u201cin accepting responsibility for the crime,\u201d and who went on to say that, if paroled, Barker \u201chas solid support from his mother, myself, and my family and many of our friends.\u201d Another letter was from Barker\u2019s 86-year-old mother, who wrote how she \u201cvisited [her] son almost every week since his incarceration . . . [and] watched him and enjoyed seeing him grow from a boy to a man.\u201d In sum, these letters offered Barker places to live and personal and financial support upon his release on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s office submitted the only letter urging the Board to deny parole. The letter was written by an assistant district attorney with no firsthand knowledge of the case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> who without elaboration characterized Barker\u2019s crimes as \u201csome of the most gruesome, brutal, senseless and premeditated murders in Alameda County history.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s position was based on the facts of the commitment offenses, Barker\u2019s earlier \u201clawless behavior,\u201d and the conclusion in an April 2004 life prisoner evaluation report that Barker still poses a \u201cmoderate degree of threat to the public if released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">7. <em>The Risk to Public Safety</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">As discussed at length below, the \u201coverarching consideration\u201d in determining whether to grant parole \u201cis \u2018public safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Scott </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 573, 591 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 905] <em>(Scott II).) </em>That is, under the applicable \u201cPenal Code section 3041, the Board \u2018shall set a release date unless it determines that the gravity of the current convicted . . . offenses, or the timing and gravity of current or past convicted . . . offenses, is such that <em>consideration of the public safety </em>requires a more lengthy period of incarceration for this individual . . . .\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Every psychological evaluation in the record dating back at least to 1999 has concluded Barker would pose little or no danger to public safety if released on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The most recent evaluation was the September 15, 2005 psychological assessment prepared by Dr. Glines, who concluded that \u201coverall test results suggest that the risk for recidivism on a violent crime while in the free community is in the low range.\u201d Dr. Glines also concluded Barker did not suffer from a personality disorder and did not need therapy'</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Dr. Glines\u2019s report noted that a 1986 assessment (not in the record bef\u00f3te us) characterized Barker \u201cas an arrogant and haughty young man who viewed himself as a 'victim of circumstance in relationship to his crime. '. . . [The Psychiatric Council] believed [Barker\u2019s] judgment to be sound, but \u2018with occasional incidents marred by youthful immaturity and naivet\u00e9.\u2019 In their conclusions, they attributed much of his lack of insight, internal conflicts, and personality weakness to his lack of maturity.\u201d However, Dr. Glines further noted, even that 1986 report concluded early on that Barker would \u201c \u2018continue to grow and mature through his own initiative and that psychotherapy is not indicated in this case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Similarly, a psychological evaluation prepared in 2004 by Dr. Henry Greenstone opined that Barker\u2019s potential for violence outside of prison was below average, and that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d Barker could be influenced again to engage in criminal, behavior. Dr. Greenstone described Barker as having \u201cchanged from the sixteen-year-old who was incarcerated and can verbalize that he is now \u2018grown up\u2019 and understands the \u2018terrible ramifications of [his] crime.\u2019 [Barker] has improved himself vocationally, educationally, and in his self-awareness and ability to observe his own thinking and behavior.\u201d Dr. Greenstone concluded Barker was free of psychopathology and had grown in maturity and insight\u2014this, despite 27 years of living in a prison environment \u201cthat had little to teach him regarding appropriate psychosocial development.\u201d Dr. Greenstone also concluded that Barker had shown remorse for the crimes. Indeed, during the Parole Hearing Deputy Commissioner D.H. McBean acknowledged that in the psychological evaluations prepared about Barker over the years, the doctors had given Barker more and more credit for the insight he has gained.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The 1999 mental health evaluation done by Dr. Katherine Powell, put before us as an exhibit by the Warden, confirms this as well. Though indicating in her clinical assessment some concerns about Barker\u2019s emotional makeup, Dr. Powell\u2019s report provided an \u201cAssessment of Dangerousness\u201d where she opined as follows: Barker \u201chas not been a behavior problem and has not acted out in a dangerous manner in the institution. He has been involved in nothing that can be representative of problematic, aggressive, or antisocial behavior. It is highly likely he will continue to live in a well-constructed life and will not become inter-related with any individuals in a manner that will lead him to act out in a way that is based on emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>content. He simply does not have the internal structure in his personality to participate in this kind of interaction. Therefore, while in the institution, it would be highly surprising if he became a disciplinary problem or committed any crimes. The assessment for dangerous behavior, if released to the community would appear to be generally the same for the same reasons.\u201d This, as noted, was an evaluation done some six years before the Parole Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">8. <em>The Board\u2019s 2005 Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Presiding Commissioner St. Julien rendered the Board\u2019s decisions orally,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as follows: \u201cMr. Barker, we are going to deny your parole. . . . [W]e\u2019ve reviewed all the information received from the public and relied on the following circumstances in concluding that the inmate is not suitable for parole and would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society or a threat to public safety if released from prison. Specifically, as it regards to the commitment offense, the offense was carried out in an especially cruel and callous manner in that you and your crime partner, Mr. Braeseke, shot and killed his parents . . . and also his grandfather . . . who was 76 years of age at the time. And this was carried out in a dispassionate and calculated manner in that you and Mr. Braeseke planned the murder, got the weapon, which was a .22 caliber rifle and used it to kill the three people, and so multiple victims were also killed in this crime. And your crime partner was the one who actually killed his parents. And you, Mr. Barker, hit . . . [Braeseke\u2019s] grandfather, on the head with a chisel approximately three or four times, and then took the gun that was used on [Braeseke\u2019s parents] and shot [the grandfather] twice in the head which caused his death. The offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptional callous disregard for human suffering in that again the murders were planned. The victims were particularly vulnerable as they were in their residence and had absolutely no idea what was about to take place. And the motive for the crime was inexplicable or very trivial in relation to the offense in that these murders did not have to take place. At any point in time, you could have let the authorities know what your crime partner was planning. And at various points in time during the event itself, you could have stopped those actions. And these conclusions are drawn from the Statement of Facts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">After quoting the facts from the April 2004 life prisoner evaluation report (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 9), the presiding commissioner continued with the Board\u2019s decision: \u201cAnd in regards to your previous criminal record, you have a juvenile [arrest for] burglary and vandalism. . . . [T]here was an incident with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the sheriffs,' and you agreed with that, for burglary and vandalism. And then there [was] some abuse with livestock, in particular chickens. And in terms of your incarceration, your institutional behavior, you have completed many self-help programs and therapy programs, and you also have good vocational skills, although, we only note that you have one vocational skill and you could definitely benefit from securing another one if that\u2019s possible. And we\u2019ll give you some more comments on this as to what other things you might be doing as you had requested. The psychological report dated September 15, 2005, authored by Dr. Glines, is not totally supportive of release in that. . . her final conclusion states that your risk for recidivism on a violent crime is in the low range. However, she previously states that you\u2019re in the low end of the moderate range of risk for future violence. In terms of your parole plans, you appear to have realistic parole plans in that you do have viable residential plans. You have several offers of residence with your friends and mother. And you do have acceptable employment plans, and you do. have a marketable skill. And we do note that in response to Penal Code [section] 3042 Notices indicate an opposition to a finding of parole suitability, and we have received such comments from the District Attorney .of Alameda County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Presiding Commissioner St. Julien then stated that the Board- made \u201cthe following findings, that the inmate needs therapy in order to face, discuss, understand, and cope with stress in a nondestructive manner, and until progress is made, the inmate continues to be unpredictable and a threat to others. And the inmate\u2019s gains are recent. He must demonstrate an ability to maintain these gains over an extended period of time.\u201d Switching gears, the presiding commissioner next listed Barker\u2019s achievements while in prison, commending him \u201cfor receiving your GED. You also have approximately 45 units of college [credit], which is definitely a noteworthy achievement, as is your being disciplinary-free since 1995. And you have completed the vocational airframe and power plant. Your job skills include being a plumber and an auto mechanic. And ... it looks like you\u2019ve been working very hard on your self-help areas, in the CAT T Program, 1994; [Inmate] Peer Educator, 1995 . . . and Advanced Alternatives to Violence, 2005 as well; Narcotics Anonymous, 1998 to 2001;[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] Anger Management; House of Healing, 2001; Hands of Peace, 1993; and participated in the Personal Growth Seminar in 2001. However, these positive aspects of your behavior do not outweigh the factors of unsuitability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201c[I]n a separate decision\u201d rendered immediately after the one above, the Board found \u201cthat the inmate has been convicted of murder, and it is not reasonable to expect that parole would [be] granted at a hearing during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>next three years. And the specific reasons for this are again as it goes to the commitment crime. The offense was committed in an especially cruel manner in that three innocent victims were killed by the inmate and his crime partner. They were the crime partner\u2019s parents and grandfather. And the victims were killed with gunshot wounds. The parents were shot with a .22 rifle, and the grandfather was first hit in the head with a chisel three or four times by the inmate and then subsequently shot twice in the head with the .22 rifle. So multiple victims were attacked and killed in this same incident. And the offense was carried out in a dispassionate and calculated manner in that these individuals were in their own home, minding their own business and not having any suspicion at all about what was going to be in store for them. The offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering, and the motive for the crime was inexplicable or very trivial in relation to the offense. We can only surmise that the crime partner had a difficult [sic] with his parents and wanted them dead. And the recent psychological report dated September 15, 2005, by- Dr. Glines indicates a need for a longer period of observation and evaluation and treatment, and therefore, a longer period of observation and evaluation is required before the Board should find that the inmate is suitable for parole. And we recommend that you remain disciplinary-free, if available, upgrade vocationally and educationally, if available, participate in self-help and therapy programming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The .presiding commissioner then discussed \u201cthe insight component.\u201d She acknowledged Barker felt remorse and was \u201csorry this happened,\u201d but she just did not \u201csee ... the insight component. And that\u2019s ... a very important component that I think the Board has to feel that you have and you fully understand in order to give you a parole date. Because without you[r] really fully understanding what made you do this . . . not because of the lack of discipline you might have had, or you had too much freedom or . . . anything your parents did or your brother did, and those are things that all played a part ... in your reckoning all of . . . this situation in your mind . . . not discounting that those things did not happen and that they weren\u2019t very serious, but you need to find out why you did this. And ... it\u2019s a hard thing probably for you to face. Like you said, it took you quite awhile just to admit it. And sometimes things are so bad that. . . you just cannot face what you have done. But you have to do that in order to really, really, really put this behind you and not bring in these other factors of what other people did. So I would suggest that you really\u2014and this is something that has to come from within . . . maybe some other self-help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">At this point, Barker\u2019s counsel asked the presiding commissioner whether the Board was rendering a three-year denial \u201cbecause it\u2019s going to take [Barker] three years to gain this insight, or is it three years because of the severity of the crime, or is it the combination of those two things?\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>presiding commissioner answered that it was \u201cbecause [Barker has] been here so long and the insight hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d She explained that although Barker was \u201cdefinitely making progress\u201d and \u201ca significant amount of progress,\u201d \u201cthe things that you\u2019re saying, you say in . 1999 ... in the psych evaluation] in 1999, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing. And this year . . . you just haven\u2019t broken that barrier that needs to be broken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Deputy Commissioner McBean also acknowledged Barker\u2019s progress, but to little avail. As the deputy commissioner put it, \u201cBut at this point, we feel that you could really benefit from more self-help, and we know there is a limited amount available to you, but . . . you\u2019ve done well, and . . . you are moving towards participating in things that will increase your sense of compassion, by working with the HIV inmates. . . ..And I think that as we read through the psych evaluations and we look at the crime, that there was a big piece missing for you and for many, many years. It\u2019s that sense of . . . what is it like to bury an animal alive? What is it like to ... be killed for no reason? What is it like- to be a victim of a senseless crime, and that ability to have compassion for somebody else is a very important part of your recovery. So I see you moving in that direction .... But this Panel believes that you just have more work to do. And there\u2019s no getting around that heinous nature of the crime. You also have job skills, and that\u2019s good. You have only completed one vocational. We recommend you try to get another vocational trade under your belt. You don\u2019t have to, but I think it would be important for you. And that\u2019s another goal you can set for yourself, and you know, to continue to remain disciplinary-free. So . . . we\u2019re not saying that you\u2019re not moving in the right direction. We just think that you just have more work to do, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">1. <em>The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We begin here, as we recently began in <em>Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cai.App.4th at p. 487, \u201cwith an overview of the law as summarized in <em>In re Rosenkrantz </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 616 . . . , and two subsequent decisions of our own court, <em>In re Scott </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 871 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 32] <em>(Scott I), </em>and <em>[Scott II, supra,] </em>133 Cal.App.4th 573 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 905], and by setting out applicable constitutional, code and regulatory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\u201cParole suitability decisions for inmates serving indeterminate life terms are made, in the first instance, by the Board. <em>(Scott I, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 884-885.)

Circumstances which taken alone may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>firmly establish unsuitability for parole may contribute to a pattern which results in a finding of unsuitability.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Scott II, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u201cCalifornia Code of Regulations, title 15, section [2281], subdivision (c) specifies six nonexclusive factors tending to show <em>unsuitability, </em>the relative importance of which \u2018is left to the judgment of the panel.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Scott II, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 592.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cSubdivision (d) of section [2281] of California Code of Regulations, title 15, which is the converse of subdivision (c), specifies nine factors tending to show <em>suitability </em>for release, leaving the importance to be attached to any circumstance or combination'of circumstances in a particular case to the judgment of the panel.\u201d <em>(Scott II, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at pp. 592-593.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The goal of subdivision (a) of Penal Code section 3041, it has been noted, is that \u201crelease on parole is the rule, rather than the exception.

Indeed, \u2018[i]t is irrelevant that a court might determine that evidence in the record tending to establish suitability for parole far outweighs evidence demonstrating unsuitability for parole.\u2019 <em>(Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 677.)\u201d <em>(Scott I, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 899.) \u201cOnly a modicum of evidence is required\u201d to satisfy the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard. <em>(Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 677.) However, that evidence \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust have some indicia of reliability\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Scott I, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 899) and \u201c \u2018suitability determinations must have some rational basis in fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">As our Supreme Court has summarized it, \u201cthe judicial branch is authorized to review the factual basis of a decision of the Board denying parole in order to ensure that the decision comports with the requirements of due process of law, but ... in conducting such a review, the court may inquire only whether <em>some evidence </em>in the record before the Board supports the decision to deny parole, based upon the factors specified by statute and regulation. If the decision\u2019s consideration of the specified factors is not supported by some evidence in the record and thus is devoid of a factual basis, the court should grant the prisoner\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus and should order the Board to vacate its decision denying parole and thereafter to proceed in accordance with due process of law.\u201d <em>(Rosenkrantz, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 658, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Finally, as has been recently stated, because the overarching consideration is public safety, the test in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision denying parole \u201cis not whether some evidence supports the <em>reasons </em>[the Board] cites for denying parole, but whether some evidence indicates a parolee\u2019s release <em>unreasonably endangers public safety. </em>[Citations.] Some evidence of the existence of a particular factor does not necessarily equate to some evidence the parolee\u2019s release unreasonably endangers public safety.\u201d <em>(Lee, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 1408, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">3. <em>No Evidence Supports the Board\u2019s Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">As quoted above, the Board actually made two of what it referred to as \u201cfindings\u201d: \u201cthat the inmate needs therapy in order to face, discuss, understand, and cope with stress in a nondestructive manner, and until progress is made, the inmate continues to be unpredictable and a threat to others. And the inmate\u2019s gains are recent. He must demonstrate an ability to maintain these gains over an extended period of time.\u201d We begin our discussion with these findings, and conclude there is not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting either of them. Indeed, the record is 180 degrees to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Regarding the Board\u2019s first finding, that Barker needed therapy, none of the recent psychological reports in the record mentions any need for therapy\u2014or, for that matter, any difficulty in dealing with stress in a nondestructive manner. To begin with, the April 26, 2004 report by Dr. Greenstone praises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Barker for maturing and growing in judgment and insight, and commends Barker for his development despite having grown up in prison, \u201can environment that had little to teach him regarding appropriate psychosocial development.\u201d More on point is Dr. Glines\u2019s assessment in her September 15, 2005 report, which could not be clearer: \u201c[tjhere are no therapeutic recommendations at this time.\u201d And, as noted; she concluded that the risk Barker would commit another violent crime -is low.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">None of this is surprising, as the psychological reports as early as 1982t\u2014when Barker was 22 years old\u2014were all of the same opinion: no therapy was required. Illustrative is the Board\u2019s decision denying parole in 1982, which expressly acknowledged the Board panel \u201cwas aware of, and commends [Barker] for his positive work efforts, and the panel further notes that the psychiatric reports indicate that [Barker] has no mental disorder and is not in need of therapy.\u201d The 1984 Board decision was the same. And neither the Board\u2019s 1986 nor 1987 decisions mention any professional recommendation for therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">These conclusions, of course, are the opinions of trained experts, all of whom said Barker did not need therapy. We are troubled therefore by a contrary finding, especially in light of the uncontradicted evidence in the record. And we are particularly troubled by the mere presence of this finding, which appears to be, yet again, a boilerplate finding that seems to make its way into every denial of parole, whatever the record\u2014and despite repeated criticisms, from the courts. The harsh criticism by Division Three of this court in <em>In re Ramirez </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 549 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 381], disapproved on another ground in <em>In re Dannenberg </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1061, 1086-1087, 1100 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 417, 104 P.3d 783] <em>(Dannenberg), </em>is illustrative. There, Justice Parrilli first described the finding of the \u201cneed for further therapy\u201d as an even \u201cmore troubling aspect\u201d of the Board\u2019s decision, explaining why it was utterly unfounded. She then concluded as follows: \u201cThis finding was an affront not only to Ramirez, whose progress in therapy was undisputedly exemplary, but also to the Department of Corrections, which provided the therapeutic programs and found Ramirez\u2019s participation in them to be outstanding. The Board\u2019s readiness to make a finding so at odds with the record supports Ramirez\u2019s claim that his parole hearing was a sham. It is not surprising that the trial court regarded the Board\u2019s findings with deep suspicion.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 571.) We made a similar observation in <em>Scott I, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th 871, noting that the finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Scott \u201c \u2018needs [further] therapy\u2019 ... is as bereft of factual support as the similar finding in <em>Ramirez,\u201d </em>whose criticism we went on to quote. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 896-897.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Board\u2019s second finding, that Barker\u2019s gains are recent, is likewise unsupported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d As the Board itself acknowledged, Barker has been \u201cdisciplinary-free since 1995.\u201d More importantly, as mentioned above, Barker has taken responsibility for his crimes since at least 1995\u2014and perhaps as early as <em>1990. </em>As Dr. Greenstone\u2019s evaluation recites, Barker has \u201cmatured and grown in judgment and insight. He has written a twenty-page letter (in his Central File) <em>dated 11-06-00, </em>outlining his state of mind at the time of the offense, his difficulty with but eventual acceptance of his role in the crime, and his remorse over what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Moreover, review of earlier Board decisions also suggests many of the suitability factors which the Board itself acknowledges Barker has satisfied (and which we discuss, <em>post) </em>are not recent gains. Rather, from all indications Barker\u2019s gains began long ago, and have been consistent. He has participated in, and completed, self-help programs going back over 20 years; and he has not received even a minor infraction in over 10 years. Those gains are hardly \u201crecent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">That they are not is confirmed in spades in the Warden\u2019s own return, his argument describing the record this way: \u201cBarker admitted that he had only recently, in approximately 1995, accepted responsibility for the crime. [Citation.] [his October 6, 1997 review hearing noted that Barker stated \u2018he can now take responsibility for crime(s), not lie and give [the Board] \u201chalf truths\u201d \u2019].). . . Barker said that he was different now bec\u00e1use he is a \u2018thinking adult,\u2019 he realized he is not weak, he does not allow himself to be used, and he has something to contribute. [Citation.] Barker said he has learned too much to act out or commit heinous acts. [Citation.]\u201d How can gains demonstrated more than 10 years ago be called \u201crecent\u201d? To ask the question is to answer it. There is not \u201csome evidence\u201d of recency.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Nor is this a valid reason for denying parole in any event. None of the suitability factors require that a prisoner\u2019s gains be maintained \u201cover an extended period of time,\u201d as the Board\u2019s decision states. (See Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2281, subd. (d) [suitability factors].)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we said in <em>Elkins, </em>\u201cThere is no minimum time requirement. Rather, acceptance of responsibility works in favor, of release \u2018[no] matter how longstanding or recent it is,\u2019 so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>long as the inmate \u2018genuinely accepts responsibility ... .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 495.) Or as the Court of Appeal put it in <em>Lee, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 1414: \u201cTo deny parole, the reason must relate to a defendant\u2019s continued unreasonable risk to public safety. So long as [the inmate] genuinely accepts responsibility, it does not matter how longstanding or recent it is. As Justice Felix Frankfurter observed, \u2018Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.\u2019 <em>(Henslee </em>v. <em>Union Planters Bank </em>(1949) 335 U.S. 595, 600 [93 L.Ed. 259, 69 S.Ct. 290] (dis. opn. of Frankfurter, J.).) The same can be said about responsibility and remorse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In sum, the only two \u201cfindings\u201d actually made by the Board are not supported in the record. The Board, however, did recite other conclusions in the course of its decision denying Barker parole, and we turn to a discussion of them, again in the context of the statutory/regulatory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">4. <em>The Suitability Factors Support Barker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">As set forth above, the regulation specifies six nonexclusive factors for unsuitability (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)) and nine factors for suitability (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)). The regulation further provides that as to the unsuitability factors, their relative importance \u201cis left to the judgment of the panel,\u201d (\u00a72281, subd. (c)) and as to the suitability factors, \u201cthe importance attached to any circumstance or combination of circumstances in a particular case is left to the judgment of the panel\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Nine factors showing suitability for parole are listed in the regulations, eight of which could possibly pertain to Barker.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Two of these factors\u2014 realistic plans for release or development of marketable skills (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(8)) and institutional activities indicating \u201can enhanced ability to function within the law upon release\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(9))\u2014were favorably commented on by the Board. In particular, the Board acknowledged Barker had \u201cbeen working very hard on [his] self-help areas,\u201d and listed eight programs he had participated in while in prison. The Board noted Barker had \u201cgood vocational skills,\u201d later mentioning he had completed vocational training in airframe and power plant and that his skills included \u201cbeing a plumber and an auto mechanic.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Board also noted that Barker had \u201crealistic parole plans,\u201d including viable residential plans both with friends and with his mother, and that he had \u201cacceptable employment plans\u201d and \u201cmarketable skills.\u201d Finally, the Board commended Barker for obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>his G.E.D. and 45 units of.college credit, the latter of which the Board called \u201cdefinitely a noteworthy achievement.\u201d And with it all Barker was \u201cdisciplinary-free, since 1995.\u201d All this, of course, demonstrated that Barker had enhanced his ability to function outside of prison. (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(8), (9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The Board did not comment on- the remaining six suitability factors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, any objective review of the record demonstrates beyond peradventure that' at least five of these apply to Barker as well<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Barker has no record as a juvenile of assaulting others or committing crimes with harm to victims. (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(1).) He has no history of violent crime. (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(6).) He acknowledged the nature and magnitude of his crime and accepted responsibility for it. (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(3).) His conduct in prison and the numerous letters from the people Barker met while he was there demonstrate that he has experienced reasonably stable relationships with others. (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(3).) And his maturation, growth, understanding, insight, and age reduce the probability of recidivism, as confirmed by the psychological evaluations. (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">5. <em>The Unsuitability Factors Do Not Support Denial of Parole and the Board\u2019s Reliance on the Circumstances of the Commitment Offenses Violated Barker\u2019s Due Process Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">There are, as noted, six factors indicating unsuitability, only one of which was cited by the Board here: that the \u201coffense was carried out in an especially cruel and callous manner.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This is a reference to section 2281, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>subdivision (c)(1), which indicates a prisoner may be unsuitable if he committed the crime \u201cin an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner,\u201d and which goes onto list five factors to be considered in determining whether the crime was committed in that manner: \u201c(A) Multiple victims were attacked, injured or killed in the same or separate incidents, [ft] (B) The offense was carried out in a dispassionate and calculated manner, such as an execution-style murder, [ft] (C) The victim was abused, defiled or mutilated during or after the offense, [ft] (D) The offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering, [ft] (E) The motive for the crime is inexplicable or very trivial in relation to the offense.\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(l)(A)-(E).)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">After stating Barker\u2019s offenses were committed in \u201can especially cruel and callous manner,\u201d the Board proceeded to list, however conclusorily, four of the five listed factors. Specifically, the Board first stated that Barker and Braeseke \u201cshot and killed his parents . . . and also his grandfather . . . who was 76 years of age at the time.\u201d The Board next stated the commitment offenses were \u201ccarried out in a dispassionate and calculated manner\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(1)(B)) because Barker \u201cand Mr. Braeseke planned the murder, got the weapon . . . and used it to kill the three people.\u201d And \u201cmultiple victims were also killed in this crime.\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(1)(A).) These offenses, the Board stated, were \u201ccarried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally] callous disregard for human suffering\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(1)(D)) based on evidence \u201cthe murders were planned\u201d and \u201c[t]he victims were particularly vulnerable as they were in their residence and had absolutely no idea what was about to take place.\u201d Finally, the Board stated \u201cthe motive for the crime was inexplicable or very trivial in relation to the offense\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(1)(E)), apparently premised on the basis \u201cthat these murders did not have to take place. At any point in time, [Barker] could have let the authorities know what [his] crime partner was planning. And at various points in time during the event itself. . . [Barker] could have stopped those actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We discuss these observations in turn in light of the principles applicable to a denial of parole where the Board relies on the nature and circumstances of commitment offenses, which principles are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cThe nature of the prisoner\u2019s offense, alone, can constitute a sufficient basis for denying parole.\u201d <em>(Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 682.) However, Chief Justice George noted in the next paragraph, \u201cIn some circumstances, a denial of parole based upon the nature of the offense alone might rise to the level of a due process violation\u2014for example where no circumstances of the offense reasonably could be considered more aggravated or violent than the minimum necessary to sustain a conviction for that offense. . . . \u2018The Board\u2019s authority to make an exception [to the requirement of setting a parole date] based on the gravity of a life term inmate\u2019s current or past offenses should not operate so as to swallow the rule that parole is \u201cnormally\u201d to be granted. ... [A] life term offense or any other , offenses underlying an indeterminate sentence must be particularly egregious to justify the denial of a parole date.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We observed in <em>Scott II </em>that, the \u201cassumption that a prisoner may be deemed unsuitable for release on the basis of the commitment offense \u2018alone\u2019 is correct [citation], but the proposition must be properly understood. The commitment offense is one of only two factors indicative of unsuitability [which] a prisoner cannot change .... Reliance on such an immutable factor \u2018without regard to or consideration of subsequent -circumstances\u2019 may be unfair [citation], and \u2018runs contrary to the rehabilitative goals espoused by the prison system and could result in a due process violation.\u2019 [Citation.] The commitment offense can negate suitability only if circumstances of the crime reliably established by evidence in the record rationally indicate that the offender will present an unreasonable public safety risk if released from prison. Yet, the predictive value of the commitment offense may be very questionable after a long period of time. [Citation.] Thus, denial of release based solely on the basis of the gravity of the commitment offense warrants especially close scrutiny.\u201d (Scott <em>II, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at pp. 594\u2014595, fns. omitted.) As we recently elaborated on this concept in <em>Elkins, </em>\u201cit violates due process to deny parole \u2018 \u201cwhere no circumstances of the offense reasonably could be considered more aggravated or violent than the minimum necessary to sustain a conviction for that offense.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">It is true that Barker participated with Braeseke in \u201cplanning\u201d the murders, a word mentioned several times in the Board\u2019s decision. Since he did, the murders could be said to be \u201cdispassionate and calculated,\u201d though they were not \u201cexecution-style\u201d murders, the example given in the regulation. And while the murders were \u201cplanned,\u201d we fail to see how planning could by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>itself demonstrate an <em>\u201cexceptionally </em>callous disregard for human suffering\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(1)(D), italics added) as, except for felony murders, first degree murders by definition involve premeditation and deliberation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Further, Barker\u2019s murder of Braeseke\u2019s grandfather did not involve any of the characteristics that make a first degree murder particularly egregious under the Board\u2019s own matrix for setting base terms for life prisoners in section 2282, subdivision (b). There was no torture, as where the \u201c[v]ictim was subjected to the prolonged infliction of physical pain through the use of nondeadly force prior to act resulting in death.\u201d (\u00a7 2282, subd. (b).) Nor was there infliction of severe trauma not involving immediate death, as where \u201c[d]eath resulted from severe trauma inflicted with deadly intensity; e.g., beating, clubbing, stabbing, strangulation, suffocation, burning, multiple wounds inflicted with a weapon not resulting in immediate death or actions calculated to induce terror in the victim.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>And there was no murder for hire. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Barker\u2019s petition appropriately concedes that Braeseke\u2019s grandfather did suffer until he was shot, but goes on to assert that the murder was no \u201cmore callous, dispassionate, calculated, cmel or committed with more disregard for suffering than most such offenses.\u201d Without in any way minimizing the severity of Barker\u2019s crimes, we agree with this argument. (See <em>Scott I, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 891 [\u201cthe offense in question must have been committed in a more aggravated or violent manner than that ordinarily shown in the commission of . . . minder\u201d]; see <em>Lee, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 1409 [\u201cThe measure of atrociousness is not general notions of common decency or social norms, for by that yardstick all murders are atrocious\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">As to the two convictions for second degree murder, they were for the killings of Braeseke\u2019s parents, both of whom were shot by Braeseke and who apparently died instantly. Barker\u2019s convictions were thus for his participation in the planning and preparation and for his conduct following the murders. \u201c[A]// second degree murders by definition involve some callousness\u2014i.e., lack of emotion or sympathy, emotional insensitivity, indifference to the feelings and suffering of others. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.4th 343, 366.) But however horrific the murders, however horrific the outcome of Barker\u2019s participation, again it is difficult to discern how that participation can be considered anything other than the minimum for \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d (See <em>Dannenberg, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 1095 [\u201cviolence or viciousness . . . must be more than <em>minimally necessary to convict. . </em>.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The Board\u2019s observation that \u201c[m]ultiple victims were also killed\u201d is, of course, accurate. It is also among the \u201cimmutable\u201d facts of the crimes which, \u201cGiven the lapse of 2[9] years and the exemplary rehabilitative gains made by [Barker] over that time, continued reliance on these aggravating facts of the crime no longer amount[s] to \u2018some evidence\u2019 supporting denial of parole.\u201d <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 498.) Moreover, as Barker argues, it could be said that reliance on this factor could be viewed as a dual use of facts, as one victim was killed in each of the three crimes for which Barker was convicted, and for each of which he has already received a separate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Regarding the Board\u2019s statement that \u201cthe motive for the crime was inexplicable or very trivial,\u201d as we observed in <em>Scott I, </em>\u201cThe Board did not indicate whether it found [Barker\u2019s] motive \u2018inexplicable\u2019 or \u2018very trivial in relationship to the offense,\u2019 as it could not be both.\u201d <em>(Scott I, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 892.) \u201cAn \u2018inexplicable\u2019 motive, as we understand it, is one that is unexplained or unintelligible, as where the commitment offense does not appear to be related to the conduct of the victim[s] and has no other discernible purpose. A person whose motive for a criminal act cannot be explained or is unintelligible is therefore unusually unpredictable and dangerous.\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at p. 893.) ..Barker\u2019s motive was not \u201cinexplicable\u201d under this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">It is undisputed that Barker committed the crime because (1) Braeseke told him that Braeseke\u2019s father had abused Braeseke, and that the mother and grandfather had done nothing to stop the abuse; and (2) Barker, 16 years old at the time, sought the older Braeseke\u2019s acceptance and succumbed to his persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Similarly, the record does not indicate that Barker\u2019s motive was \u201cvery trivial in relation to [his] offense.\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(1)(E).) \u201cThe offense committed by most prisoners serving life terms is, of course, murder. Given the high value our society places upon life, there is no motive for unlawfully taking the life of another human being that could not reasonably be deemed \u2018trivial.\u2019 The Legislature has foreclosed that approach, however, by declaring that murderers with life sentences must \u2018normally\u2019 be given release dates when they approach their minimum eligible parole dates. . . . The reference in Board regulations to motives that are \u2018very trivial in relationship to the offense\u2019 therefore requires comparisons; to fit the regulatory description, the motive must be materially less significant (or more \u2018trivial\u2019) than those which conventionally drive people to commit the offense in question, and therefore more indicative of a risk of danger to society if the prisoner is released than is ordinarily presented.\u201d <em>(Scott I, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 893.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Turning lastly to the presiding commissioner\u2019s comment that \u201cat various points in time . . . [Barker] could have stopped those actions,\u201d the complete answer is found in Elkins: \u201cBecause it violates due process to deny parole \u2018 \u201cwhere no circumstances of the offense reasonably could be considered more aggravated or violent than the minimum necessary to sustain a conviction for that offense\u201d \u2019 <em>(Scott II, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 598), the [Board] could not rely on the fact that [Barker] might have avoided killing to show his killing to be especially brutal.\u201d <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We are mindful of a position recently asserted by the California District Attorneys Association (CDAA) in its amicus curiae support for a petition seeking review or depublication of our opinion in <em>Elkins. </em>Commenting on our discussion about the caution with which the immutable facts of the crime must be applied, the CDAA urged that \u201cas advocates for victims, prosecutors recognize that the ability of victims to imagine their loved one\u2019s last moments and to relate their feelings regarding the pain and suffering their loved one experienced empowers those victims and allows them to feel as though they have a voice in the administration of justice. To the Court of Appeal, after a period of time, the commitment offense becomes irrelevant. To the victims of violent crime, the circumstances of the crime are indelibly stamped upon their memories and are never irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">To begin with, nowhere in <em>Elkins </em>did we say the facts of the crime become \u201cirrelevant.\u201d What we said is they are immutable. <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at pp. 496, 498.) And while we are not aware of any victims (or family of victims) in the setting here, not for a moment do we ignore the lasting effect a crime may have on a victim or a victim\u2019s family, an effect that may well never diminish, let alone disappear. That said, the effect on the victim is not, and cannot be, the guiding factor in a parole hearing, especially as it is not even mentioned as an unsuitability factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">6. <em>There Is No Evidence of Any Threat to Public Safety</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">As discussed above, the \u201coverarching\u201d factor determining whether parole should be granted or denied is whether the criminal poses \u201can unreasonable risk of danger to society.\u201d <em>(Scott II, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 591; \u00a7 2281, subd. (a); see <em>Lee, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 1409.) As also discussed above, every psychological evaluation in the record dating back at least to 1999 has concluded Barker would pose little or no danger to public safety if released on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The presiding commissioner did note in her decision that Dr. Clines\u2019s September 15, 2005 psychological report was \u201cnot totally supportive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>release in that . . . her final conclusion states that [Barker\u2019s] risk for recidivism on a violent crime is in the low range. However, she previously states that [Barker] is in the low end of the moderate range of risk for future violence.\u201d This observation is, in a word, inaccurate. Dr. Glines clearly stated her overall conclusion was that Barker\u2019s risk for recidivism on a violent crime was in the low range. In reaching this conclusion, she used three instruments, two of which indicated Barker was a low risk and only one of which (the \u201cViolence Risk Appraisal Guide\u201d) showed results \u201cwithin the low end of the moderate range of risk.\u201d In sum, at no point in her report did Dr. Glines opine Barker was \u201cin the low end of the moderate range of risk for future violence.\u201d The Board\u2019s observation is not supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Last, but by no means incidentally, the Board failed to consider Barker\u2019s age at the time he committed the crimes. In <em>Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th 475, we agreed with the observations of the federal district court in <em>Rosenkrantz v. Marshall </em>(C.D.Cal. 2006) 444 F.Supp.2d 1063, that \u201c \u2018the general unreliability of predicting violence is exacerbated in [a] case by . . . petitioner\u2019s young age at the time of the offense [and] the passage [in that case] of nearly twenty years since that offense was committed ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>at p. 500.) There, granting the petition for habeas corpus, the district court talked of Rosenkrantz\u2019s age, one month past 18. <em>(Rosenkrantz v. Marshall, supra, </em>444 F.Supp.2d at p. 1085.) This fact, the district court noted, \u201cdiminished further\u201d the \u201creliability of the facts of [Rosenkrantz\u2019s] crime as a predictor for his dangerousness.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Stating that \u201c[w]hile [Rosenkrantz] was not legally a minor, he was very close to being one,\u201d the district court confirmed the recognition by the United States Supreme Court that, the \u201cevidentiary/predictive value of the conduct of such a young person is diminished.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Then, after making the statement quoted by us in <em>Elkins, </em>the district court went on to quote various observations of the Supreme Court about young criminals: \u201cTheir own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment. <em>See Stanford </em>[v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1989) 492 U.S. 361, 395 [106 L.Ed.2d 306, 109 S.Ct. 2969].] (Brennan, J., dissenting). The reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.1 From a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor\u2019s character deficiencies will be reformed. Indeed, \u2018[t]he relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient; as individuals mature, the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside.\u2019 <em>Johnson </em>[v. <em>Texas </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 350, 368] [125 L.Ed.2d 290, 113 S.Ct. 2658][;] <em>Roper v. Simmons </em>[(2005)] 543 U.S. 551, 561-562 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>[161 L.Ed.2d 1, 125 S.Ct. 1183]; <em>see also Thompson v. Oklahoma </em>[(1988)] 487 U.S. 815, 835 [101 L.Ed.2d 702, 108 S.Ct. 2687] (Stevens, J.) (plurality opinion) (*[L]ess culpability should attach to a crime committed by a juvenile than to a comparable crime committed by an adult. . . . Inexperience, less intelligence and less education make a teenager less able to evaluate the consequences of his or her conduct while at the same time he or she is more apt to be motivated by mere emotion or peer pressure than as an adult.\u2019)\u201d <em>(Rosenkrantz v. Marshall, </em>supra, 444 F.Supp.2d at p. 1085, fn. omitted.) These observations are a fortiori applicable to the 16-year-old Barker who committed the crimes here.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In sum and in short, the record before us contains no evidence Barker poses an unreasonable risk to public safety even under the deferential \u201csome evidence\u201d standard.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The crimes Barker committed and for which he was convicted were horrific, resulting in the senseless deaths of three people. Those crimes cannot be excused. Or minimized. At the same time, the system provides for parole in appropriate circumstances, if the prisoner has met the prerequisites for release. Resolution of these competing considerations led to the conclusion of the Court of Appeal granting Wen Lee\u2019s petition for habeas corpus: \u201cAll murders represent the basest form of human behavior. Our laws, however, provide for mechanisms by which even murderers, in limited circumstances, are entitled to be paroled. The judiciary has an obligation to execute those laws. The record establishes that Lee does not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. Any contrary conclusion lacks any evidentiary support.\u201d <em>(Lee, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 1414.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>This, we conclude, describes' the record as to Barker as well. Barker\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is granted, and the Board is ordered to vacate the denial of parole and to conduct a new parole suitability hearing for Barker no later than July 27, 2007. At that hearing, the Board shall consider evidence of all relevant circumstances identified in its own regulations as tending to show a prisoner suitable for release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Kline, P.

Much of this summary also appears almost verbatim in an April 2004 life prisoner evaluation report. Our 1979 opinion affirming the judgment against Barker also summarizes the facts of the crimes, which summary is more detailed and differs in many respects from the facts recited at Barker\u2019s parole hearings. <em>(People v. Barker </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 321, 324-327 [156 Cal.Rptr. 407].) Most significantly, our opinion provides Barker\u2019s trial testimony regarding Braeseke\u2019s dominant leadership role in the killings. (See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at p. 326 [Barker testified Braeseke instructed him to hit the grandfather with the chisel and Barker \u201cdid so only because [Braeseke] \u2018walked around with the gun pointing at\u2019 \u201d him]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Braeseke </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 691 [159 Cal.Rptr. 684, 602 P.2d 384] [the record resulting in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion states Braeseke \u201curged Barker to kill his grandfather, and when Barker hesitated, [Braeseke] threw his grandfather on top of his mother\u2019s body and ordered Barker to hit him\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">Barker relies, on some of the facts recited in our 1979 opinion in his habeas corpus petition and supporting papers. It is unclear whether the Board ever reviewed trial transcripts or our opinion in reaching its decisions denying parole, and the transcripts from Barker\u2019s trial are not in the record before us. In any event, at the Parole Hearing Barker did not dispute the Board\u2019s summary of his offenses. Moreover, Barker told a psychologist in 2005 that the facts recited by the Board at the Parole Hearing \u201care essentially correct.\u201d Similarly, the April 2004 life prisoner evaluation report\u2019s section entitled \u201cPrisoner\u2019s Version\u201d indicates Barker admitted \u201cfull responsibility for his part in this offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The deputy district attorney who wrote the letter in 2005 was at that time only six years into his legal career.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The presiding commissioner told Barker he would receive a copy of the Board\u2019s \u201cwritten tentative decision\u201d on the day of the Parole Hearing.

Our Supreme Court has made it very clear that \u201cprisoners possess a protected liberty interest in connection with parole decisions rendered by the Board,\u201d and that imposing \u201ca standard of review that is less stringent than the \u2018some evidence\u2019 test . . . would permit the Board to render a decision without any basis in fact\u201d which \u201cwould be arbitrary and capricious, thereby depriving the prisoner of due process of law.\u201d <em>(Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 661, 657.) This holding of <em>Rosenkrantz </em>was cited and confirmed in <em>Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th 475, 488, which was filed on October 31, 2006, three weeks before the Warden\u2019s return here was signed and filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We note that the Warden may be distancing himself from such a finding, as the summary of the argument in his return eschews any reliance on any need for therapy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\">All unspecified section references hereafter are to title 15 of the California Code of Regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The battered woman syndrome factor (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(5)) cannot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Earlier the Board observed that Barker had \u201cone vocational skill and [he] could definitely benefit from securing another one if that\u2019s possible.\u201d The fact is Barker had multiple vocational skills, as an airframe mechanic, auto mechanic, carpenter, plumber, and clerk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> \u201cThe Board\u2019s failure to undertake the \u2018individualized consideration of all relevant factors\u2019 required by <em>Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at page 655, also offends the Board\u2019s own regulations, which require that <em>\u2018[a]ll </em>relevant, reliable informatiqn available to the panel <em>shall be considered </em>in determining suitability for parole.\u2019 ([\u00a7 2281], subd. (b), italics added.)\u201d <em>(Scott I, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 898.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The suitability factor that might not pertain is that Barker committed the crimes \u201cas the result of significant stress in his life, especially if the stress had built over a long period of time.\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(4)). \"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The other five factors demonstrating unsuitability are that the prisoner (1) has a previous record of violence; (2) has an unstable social history; (3) has previously sexually assaulted another individual in a sadistic manner; (4) has a lengthy history of severe mental problems related to the offense; and (5) has engaged in serious misconduct while in prison. (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(2)-(6).) None of these was mentioned, much less relied on, by the Board, and they are properly disregarded here. (See <em>Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 493; <em>Scott II, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at pp. 595-596.) In any event, not one of the five finds any support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">It is true that tire presiding commissioner observed that Barker had \u201ca juvenile burglary and vandalism\u201d and \u201cthere [was] some abuse with livestock, in particular chickens.\u201d However, there is no evidence in the record that either the incident leading to Barker\u2019s arrest for burglary and vandalism or his abuse of chickens involved an actual or potential risk of harm to people. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Thus, neither incident comes within the ambit of the unsuitability factor which provides as follows: \u201cPrevious Record of Violence. The prisoner on previous occasions inflicted or attempted to inflict serious injury on a victim, particularly if the prisoner demonstrated serious assaultive behavior at an early age.\u201d (\u00a7 2281, subd. (c)(2); cf. \u00a7 2281, subd. (d)(1) [listing as a suitability factor no juvenile record of \u201cassaulting others\u201d or \u201ccommitting crimes with a potential of personal harm to victims\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Barker\u2019s petition makes four additional arguments: (1) the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard of judicial review should not apply because it is insufficient to protect his due process rights; (2) the Board\u2019s separate decision to defer Barker\u2019s next parole hearing for three years was arbitrary and violated his due process rights; (3) the Board\u2019s antiparole bias violated Barker\u2019s due process rights; and (4) the Board\u2019s use of the statutes and regulations promulgated under the determinate sentencing law violated his due process rights as well as the ex post facto clauses of the federal and state Constitutions All these arguments are, of course, moot in light of our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Nevertheless, we note certain of these arguments are apparently made as a matter of routine, despite that they have been consistently rejected. For example, the argument that the \u201csome evidence\u201d rule does not apply has been rejected in both <em>Rosenkrantz </em>and <em>Elkins (Rosenkrantz, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 652-658; <em>Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 488), as has the retroactivity/ex post facto argument. <em>(Rosenkrantz, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 636-652; <em>Elkins, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at pp. 489-490.) Such arguments should not be made, at least not without recognizing the earlier holding(s) and without argument why any such holding was wrong.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
