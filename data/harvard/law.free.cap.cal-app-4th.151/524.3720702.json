Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211-212.5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found that defendant suffered prior strike convictions (\u00a7 1170.12, subds. (b), (c)), two prior serious felony convictions (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), and served two prior state prison terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). He was sentenced under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law to an aggregate state prison term of 210 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In this appeal, defendant claims that his waiver of the right to counsel was invalid, his request for appointment of advisory counsel was improperly denied, and he was denied the right to appointed counsel in the bifurcated proceeding on the prior conviction allegations. He also argues that the robbery statute is unconstitutionally vague, his motion for severance of counts 5 and 6 from the remaining charges was erroneously denied, he was denied the right to a pretrial lineup, and his conviction on one of the robbery counts is not supported by the evidence. Finally, he complains of instructional and sentencing errors. We conclude that no prejudicial errors were committed in the resolution of defendant\u2019s motions before and during trial related to his right to counsel, the robbery statute is not vague, no instructional error occurred, the robbery convictions are all supported by the evidence, and defendant\u2019s sentence did not violate any constitutional principles. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The convictions are based upon a series of six robberies that occurred between early January and late March of 1996 in Concord, Orinda and Antioch. All of the robberies were similar in the method of commission; each was committed in a bank in the afternoon shortly before the scheduled close of business by a sole perpetrator who gave the bank teller a note with a demand for money and a warning that the robber possessed a gun. The disputed issue at trial was the identity of the robber.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\n<em>The Home Savings in Concord (Count 1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Five or 10 minutes before the 6:00 p.m. closing time on Friday, January 5, 1996, at the Home Savings of America branch office on Clayton Road in Concord, a man appeared at Christine Rauson\u2019s teller window. He displayed a note to Rauson printed in block letters that read: \u201cIt\u2019s a gun. Give me your money.\u201d The man warned Rauson \u201cnot to hit the alarm until he left.\u201d She \u201cgrabbed the cash and handed it to him.\u201d As the man left the window with the money and walked out of the bank, Rauson \u201chit the alarm,\u201d which activated the bank security cameras. Rauson identified photographs of the robber taken by the security cameras, but was not able to identify defendant from a pretrial photo lineup or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Lolita Kumar, the operations officer who was working at another teller window nearby, observed a man enter the bank, and run right past her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Ransom\u2019s.window. As the man then.left the bank \u201cin a hurry,\u201d Kumar \u201clooked at his face.\u201d Rauson said to Kumar, \u201cHe took my money.\u201d Immediately after the man left the bank, Kumar locked the door and \u201ccalled 911.\u201d When the police arrived, Kumar described the robber. She identified defendant as the robber from a six-person photo lineup she viewed on March 27, 1996, and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\n<em>The World Savings Bank in Concord (Count 2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Barbara Lyons testified that she was working at the \u201cend of the teller find\u201d at World Savings on Clayton Road in Concord about 1:00 p.m. on January 13, 1996, as the bank was \u201cjust getting ready to close.\u201d Lyons asked a man in line if she \u201ccould help him.\u201d The man directed Lyons to read a note that stated, \u201cI have a gun,\u201d and ordered her to hand over \u201call your large.\u201d Lyons refused to give the man any money, and activated the alarm. The man then turned to Corey Ryan, a part-time employee, and said, \u201cI want you to give me all your money.\u201d Ryan replied, \u201cNo problem sir,\u201d and gave him the money from the drawer next to Lyons. Lyons whispered to the bank supervisor, Shirley Warren, \u201cthat she was being robbed.\u201d Lyons and Warren looked at the man as he took the money from Ryan and walked out of the bank. They both identified photographs of the robber taken by bank security cameras, and identified defendant as the robber at trial, although they did not identify his picture in the pretrial photo lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\n<em>The Home Savings in Orinda (Count 3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The Home Savings branch office on Br\u00f3okwood Road in Orinda was robbed about 3:30 p.m. on January 16, 1996. The branch manager Margaret Teufel testified that a man she assisted at one of the teller windows put a small printed note in her face \u201cthat said, T have a gun. Give me all your money.\u2019 \u201d When Teufel responded affirmatively to the man\u2019s question, \u201ccan you read?\u201d he said, \u201cWell, do it.\u201d Teufel took the money from her cash drawer and placed it oh the counter. The man stuffed the money in his pocket and left the bank. Teufel activated the alarm and bank security camera. Teufel gave a description of the robber to the police that matched defendant\u2019s appearance, then identified him as the robber from the photo lineup and again at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\n<em>The Wells Fargo Bank in Orinda (Count 4)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">On February 8, 1996, \u201cjust before\u201d the Wells Fargo Bank office on Moraga Way in Orinda was scheduled to close at 4:00 p.m., someone approached the teller window of Susan Mills with a handwritten note directing her \u201cto give him all [her] large bills.\u201d- The man then told Mills to \u201churry up,\u201d so she gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>him the \u201clarger bills\u201d from her lower drawer. As soon as the man started to leave the bank, Mills pressed the alarm, but the man was already \u201cout before they got a picture of him.\u201d Mills gave a fairly accurate description of defendant to the police, and although she identified him as the robber at trial, she had not been able to identify defendant\u2019s picture from a photo lineup shown to her by the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Gerri Batiza, who was \u201cworking for Wells Fargo in Orinda,\u201d also saw defendant in the bank when the robbery occurred. Batiza was \u201cwalking across the lobby\u201d when she noticed a tall, \u201cstriking\u201d man she \u201cdidn\u2019t recognize\u201d enter the bank and walk to.the teller line. Batiza \u201cwent to the ATM\u2019s,\u201d then heard one of the tellers yell out \u201cthat they had been robbed.\u201d Batiza asked, \u201cWas it that guy in line, the tall guy?\u201d She identified defendant.from an FBI photo lineup and at trial as the man she observed in the bank on the day of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>The Bank of America in Antioch (Count 5)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Nicole Lopez was engaged in her duties as a teller at the Bank of America on East 18th Street in Antioch on February 27, 1996, at 5:53 p.m., when a man appeared at her window with a note that read in part, \u201cHave a gun,\u201d in large, printed letters. The man with the note said, \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t do anything stupid,\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t press any buttons.\u2019 \u201d In compliance with bank policy, training, and federal banking regulations, Lopez cooperated with the demand and did not offer resistance. Lopez \u201cscooped up a bunch of money\u201d and \u201chanded it to him.\u201d After the man grabbed the money and walked away, Lopez pushed the silent alarm and video camera buttons beneath her counter, and advised the manager that she had been robbed. She gave a general description of the robber\u2014tall, male Caucasian, with long hair and a ponytail, wearing a baggy sweater' and corduroy pants\u2014that matched defendant\u2019s appearance. She also stated that photographs taken by the security cameras at Bank of America and during the World Savings Bank robbery depicted the man who robbed her.' She did not select from any of the six photographs shown to her by the FBI. Lopez testified at trial that defendant \u201cappear[ed] to be\u201d the robber, but could not \u201csay for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\n<em>The Citibank in Concord (Count 6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Taxi driver Martin Grocholski testified that on March 20, 1996, he picked up defendant at the Concord BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) station between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. Defendant stated that he \u201cwanted to go to. Treat Boulevard in the 5000 block,\u201d and \u201cneeded to be there before 6:00.\u201d The address indicated by defendant was mistaken, so Grocholski. .made a brief stop at a Shell gas station, before driving defendant to a Coco\u2019s restaurant on Treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Boulevard adjacent to the Concord Citibank. Defendant left the cab briefly, ostensibly to make a telephone call, returned, then gave Grocholski $10 to wait while he \u201cwent back into Coco\u2019s restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">About 5:55 p.m., Marc Pattison, a customer waiting in line at the Citibank on Treat Boulevard in Concord, noticed defendant, who resembled a friend, standing in line behind him. Pattison went to the teller on the right; defendant went to the teller on the left. Defendant\u2019s teller, Teresa Watson, testified that defendant \u201cslouched forward\u201d as if to block her window and pushed a note toward her that said, \u201cI have a gun. Give me all your large bills.\u201d When Watson hesitated momentarily, defendant told her, \u201cDo it.\u201d Watson gave defendant her large bills, which he folded and put in his pocket. Defendant left the bank through the Treat Boulevard exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Watson alerted her manager and fellow employee Parvin Kashabi-Enright that she \u201chad just been robbed.\u201d Enright noticed defendant, who was \u201cdressed oddly\u201d in a sweater and looked uncomfortable, as he left the bank, crossed the street, and walked to a cab \u201con the side of Coco\u2019s\u201d restaurant. The bank doors were locked and the police were immediately notified of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">About five minutes after defendant left Grocholski\u2019s cab parked in front of Coco\u2019s restaurant, he returned. He \u201crushed to the cab,\u201d hopped inside, and hurriedly removed his sweater. Defendant was \u201cnervous\u201d; his behavior made Grocholski uneasy. Defendant directed Grocholski to drive to the Pleasant Hill BART station. As Grocholski drove along Treat Boulevard less than a \u201cquarter mile\u201d from the bank, he was \u201cpulled over by a police officer and stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Defendant was removed from the cab by Concord police officers and placed in handcuffs. Watson and Pattison were taken to the scene of the detention, where they were asked to look at a \u201csuspect.\u201d Although defendant had removed his sweater, and his hair was no longer \u201cpulled back,\u201d they both positively identified him at the scene and at trial as the robber. Defendant was then placed under arrest. Enright identified defendant from a photo lineup and at trial as \u201cthe person who robbed the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Watson also recognized a sweater taken from the cab as the one worn by defendant in the bank. Seized from defendant were a \u201cwad of American currency\u201d in the amount of $2,200, and a note with the words, \u201cHave a gun. Give me all large everything now.\u201d Watson identified the note taken from defendant as the one he showed her in the bank. Two other notes were found in defendant\u2019s front pants pocket: one with telephone numbers written on it; another with the address of Concord Citibank, 4420 Treat Boulevard.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\n<em>The Defense Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The defense produced evidence on the vagaries of eyewitness testimony from Dr. Martin Blinder, a psychiatrist with expertise in the field of eyewitness identification. Dr. Blinder explained the \u201cmechanisms by which eyewitnesses make identifications\u201d and \u201ccounterintuitive elements that can mislead the eyewitness.\u201d He stated that certain factors in the \u201cthree stages\u201d of identification\u2014perception, storage, and retrieval\u2014may mislead \u201cthe eyewitness, though perfectly sincere and often persuasive,\u201d into making an inaccurate identification. In the \u201cperception\u201d stage, in addition to the \u201cobvious physical factors\u201d\u2014such as lighting, proximity, and duration of observation\u2014 the \u201cstate of mind of the witness\u201d and quality of perception is influenced by the degree of anxiety associated with the event, the \u201cnature of the event[] being observed,\u201d the presence of a weapon, familiarity with the subject, and the \u201cexpectation\u201d of the observer. The \u201cstorage\u201d stage is adversely affected by \u201cdecay\u201d of memory, particularly short-term memory, and \u201cmisinformation,\u201d such as repetitious exposures or identifications, that contaminate memory and rearrange facts. Dr. Blinder testified that the retrieval process is tainted by \u201cpushy\u201d questioning of a witness and suggestive identification procedures, specifically the \u201cshowup process.\u201d He added that the degree of confidence in an identification asserted by the witness does not correlate with its accuracy. Although Dr. Blinder did not offer any opinion on the reliability of the eyewitness identifications in the present case, he testified that the stress associated with the crimes, the \u201celements of suggestiveness\u201d inherent in the \u201cshowup\u201d conducted at the scene of defendant\u2019s detention, and the long delay between the robberies and the identifications in court, all militated against accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Defendant presented alibi evidence related to count 3, the robbery of Home Savings in Orinda on January 16, 1996. His friend Dolores Deufemia testified that on that date defendant was at her house, along with a few other friends, from around noon until 7:00 or 8:00 p.m., helping her \u201cpack and move\u201d before she began to serve a sentence the next day for a drug conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">As to count 6, the defense offered evidence that Citibank teller Teresa Watson stated to a private investigator that when she and Marc Pattison were transported to the detention scene to view defendant they \u201cdiscussed the description of the subject,\u201d and the transporting officer claimed \u201cthey had the responsible and they had him detained and they just needed them to ID him.\u201d Finally, evidence was presented that defendant\u2019s fingerprints were not identified at the scene of any of the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">I. <em>The Vagueness of the Bank Robbery Statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Defendant presents a novel challenge to the constitutionality of section 211, the \u201crobbery statute\u201d under which he was prosecuted and ultimately convicted. He claims section 211 is \u201cimpermissibly vague\u201d due to the failure of the statute to provide an adequate definition of \u201cbank robbery.\u201d For purposes of comparison, defendant points out that in section 1192.7, subdivision (c), which designates \u201cserious felonies,\u201d the offense of \u201cbank robbery\u201d is defined differently and more comprehensively: not only by inclusion of a specific reference to a taking of property from a bank, credit union or savings and loan association, but also with an explanation that the offense is committed by means of \u201cforce or violence, or by intimidation\u201d exerted upon the victim, rather than \u201cagainst his will, accomplished by means of force or fear\u201d as specified in section 211. Defendant complains that in light of the \u201csignificant differences\u201d between the two statutes and the jury instruction given by the trial court \u201conly as to the general definition of robbery\u201d pursuant to section 211, \u201cas opposed to bank robbery,\u201d the jury was left without proper guidance in consideration of \u201cthe lesser included offense in this case, namely grand theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Our analysis of this issue is guided by well-established legal principles. \u201c \u2018The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the California Constitution, each guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This constitutional command requires \u201ca reasonable degree of certainty in legislation, especially in the criminal law . . . .\u201d [Citation.] \u201c[A] penal statute [must] define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Maciel </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 679, 683 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 628]; see also <em>People v. Bamba </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1120 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 450]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 533 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].) \u201c \u2018No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the state commands or forbids.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 71, 79 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 830].) \u201cWhen definite guidelines are absent, a criminal statute may deny due process by allowing a \u2018 \u201cstandardless sweep\u201d \u2019 by which police, prosecutors and juries may indulge their personal predilections. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 717 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365].) \u201cConsequently, the \u2018void for vagueness\u2019 doctrine dictates that the terms of a penal statute must be explicit enough to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>part will render them liable to its penalties. A statute which requires individuals of ordinary intelligence to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates due process.\u201d <em>(People v. Prevost </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1394 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">(2) \u201cTo withstand a facial vagueness challenge, a penal statute must satisfy two basic requirements. First, the statute must be definite enough to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed. [Citation.] Ordinary people of common intelligence have to be able to understand what is prohibited by the statute and what may be done without, violating its provisions. [Citation.] [][] Second, the statute must provide sufficiently definite guidelines. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to the police, judges and juries for resolution on a subjective basis, with the attendant risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ellison </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 203, 207 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 120]; see also <em>People v. Moore </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 37, 44 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 914].)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u201cHowever, \u2018[t]he starting point of our analysis is \u201cthe strong presumption that legislative enactments \u2018must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears. . . \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Albritton </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 647, 657 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 169]; see also <em>People v. Campbell, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 71, 79-80.) \u201cOnly a reasonable degree of certainty is required and there is a strong presumption in favor of the constitutionality of statutes; thus a statute will not be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language.\u201d <em>(People v. Misa </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 837, 844 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 805].) \u201cThe fact that a term is somewhat imprecise does not itself offend due process. Rather, so long as the language sufficiently warns of the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and experience, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>(People v. Ellison, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 203, 207-208.) \u201cInasmuch as \u2018 \u201c[w]ords inevitably contain germs of uncertainty,\u201d \u2019 mathematical precision in the language of a penal statute is not a sine qua non of constitutionality. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 698, 718.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u201cAlthough a particular statute is somewhat vague or general in its language because of difficulty in defining the subject matter with precision, it will be upheld if its meaning is reasonably ascertainable. [Citation.] Courts must view the statute from the standpoint of the reasonable person who might be subject to its terms. Thus, \u2018[i]t is not necessary that a statute furnish detailed plans and specifications of the acts or conduct prohibited. The requirement of reasonable certainty does not preclude the use of ordinary terms to express ideas which find adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Deskin </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1400 [13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 391]; see also <em>People v. Prevost, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1394; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ervin </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1328 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 231]; <em>People v. Heilman </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 391, 400 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 422]; <em>People v. Gamez </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 957, 971-972 [286 Cal.Rptr. 894].) The terms of a statute, \u201calthough nonmathematical, are not impermissibly vague if their meaning can be objectively ascertained by reference to common experiences of mankind.\u201d <em>(Suter v. City of Lafayette </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1133 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The only vagueness we perceive is in defendant\u2019s argument, not in the general robbery statute, either on its face or as applied to defendant. \u201c \u2018Robbery is defined as \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 456, 463 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 867], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 72].) The requirement of use of force or fear has no technical meaning which must be explained to jurors, but rather the terms articulated in the statute have established common meaning. (See <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633, 640 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1996) 52 Cal.App.4th 203, 210-211 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 316].) The failure of section 211 to define <em>bank </em>robbery does not render the statute vague.

(See <em>People v. Ervin, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1329; <em>People v. Zucker </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 172, 177-178 [2 Cal.Rptr. 112].) Section 211 is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">II. <em>The Validity of Defendant\u2019s Waiver of the Right to Counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Defendant argues that he was denied the right to counsel. Defendant exercised his right of self-representation under <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806, 820 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525] <em>(Faretta), </em>but claims his waiver of the right to counsel was defective for lack of proper admonitions. Defendant does not claim his waiver of the right to counsel was other than voluntary, but rather that the record fails to show \u201cthe warnings required by <em>Faretta </em>were given.\u201d He argues that therefore \u201cthis court as a matter of law\u201d must find the waiver of the right to counsel was not \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>\u201cA defendant in a criminal case possesses two constitutional rights with respect to representation that are mutually exclusive.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 20 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262].) \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel but also allows him to waive this right and to represent himself without counsel.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Erskine </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 355 F.3d 1161, 1167, italics omitted; see also <em>People v. Williams </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1577, 1585 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 890].) \u201cCriminal defendants have the right both to be represented by counsel at all critical stages of the prosecution and the right, based on the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in <em>Faretta, supra, </em>422 U.S. 806, to represent themselves.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis and Oliver </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 970, 1001 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 467, 140 P.3d 775].) Thus, in any case in which a <em>Faretta </em>request for self-representation has been made, the court must evaluate, sometimes under problematic circumstances, two countervailing considerations: on one hand, the defendant\u2019s absolute right to counsel, which must be assiduously protected; on the other hand, the defendant\u2019s unqualified constitutional right to discharge counsel if he pleases and represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">A criminal defendant may not waive his right to counsel, however, \u201cunless he does so \u2018competently and intelligently,\u2019 [citations].\u201d <em>(Godinez v.

The defendant \u201cshould at least be advised that: self-representation is almost always unwise and that the defense he conducts might be to his detriment; he will have to follow the same rules that govern attorneys; the prosecution will be represented by experienced, professional counsel who will have a significant advantage over him in terms of skill, training, education, experience, and ability; the court may terminate his right to represent himself if he engages in disruptive conduct; and he will lose the right to appeal his case on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. [Citation.] In addition, he should also be told he will receive no help or special treatment from the court and that he does not have a right to standby, advisory, or cocounsel.

More specifically, we examine whether there is a \u201creasonable probability that defendant was unaware of his right to be represented by appointed counsel at trial or that he would have accepted the appointment of counsel had the court made the statutorily required inquiry at arraignment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 365.) \u201cThe complete record of the trial court proceedings often will shed light upon whether a defendant, despite the absence of an explicit readvisement by the superior court at arraignment, nonetheless was aware that he or she had the right to appointed counsel at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>subsequent proceedings and whether an explicit advisement at the arraignment would have been likely to lead the defendant to reconsider the decision to represent himself or herself and request that counsel be appointed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Upon our review of the entire record<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we conclude that any error was harmless, and defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel was both knowing and voluntary. During the excessively prolonged course of these proceedings, defendant did not falter in his assertion of his right and intention to represent himself, other than to seek advisory counsel and make an apparently aborted request for appointment of an attorney for the limited purpose of representing him in the separate, bifurcated proceeding on the prior conviction allegations. Defendant never indicated a desire to surrender his right of self-representation during the pretrial or trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The record is also replete with illustrations of defendant\u2019s knowledge of the difficulties and pitfalls he faced while acting as his own attorney. Defendant often mentioned and sought to use his status as a disadvantaged pro. per. defendant to request from the trial court continuances, transcripts, additional discovery, service of subpoenas, access to his \u201clegal papers,\u201d \u201clegal runners\u201d and other support services, special investigative, paralegal, or other \u201cancillary\u201d legal assistance, fees, and even advisory counsel to assist with the presentation of his testimony. In his motions, defendant specifically complained that \u201cacting as his own attorney while incarcerated\u201d placed him \u201cat a tremendous disadvantage\u201d when opposed by an \u201cexperienced\u201d prosecutor with access to the \u201cenormous\u201d resources of the district attorney\u2019s office. Defendant also declared as part of his request for advisory counsel that if he realized \u201cduring the course of the trial\u201d that he \u201cis overwhelmed,\u201d advisory counsel could \u201cstep right in and take over.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He was advised at trial that as a \u201cpro per defendant\u201d he was \u201cbound by the same rules of law that apply to a represented defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Finally, the record shows us that defendant acted as his own counsel in numerous prior criminal actions against him, and thus through considerable experience was well aware of the consequences of self-representation. \u201c \u2018[A] defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system\u2019 is, as the United States Supreme Court has concluded, \u2018relevant to the question [of] whether he knowingly waived constitutional rights.\u2019 <em>(Parke v. Raley </em>(1992) 506 U.S. 20, 37 [121 L.Ed.2d 391, 113 S.Ct. 517].) That is so because previous experience in the criminal justice system is relevant to a recidivist\u2019s \u2018 \u201cknowledge and sophistication regarding his [legal] rights.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Parke, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>pp. 36-37; see <em>United States v. Dawson </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 193 F.3d 1107, 1110-1111 [the defendant, who had received full advisements in state court action two months before he entered a guilty plea on incomplete advisements in federal court, knowingly waived rights of confrontation and silence despite lack of advisement on either].)\u201d <em>(People v. Mosby, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th 353, 365, fn. omitted.) The record before us \u201csuggests no confusion on defendant\u2019s part\u201d regarding the \u201crisks of self-representation, or the complexities of his case, much less that his election to represent himself was other than voluntary.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 102, 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We are convinced that a recitation of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation in superior court would have led to the same result; defendant would have voluntarily proceeded without counsel; the trial would have still occurred with defendant representing himself. Nothing would have changed had defendant been advised or readvised of the dangers of self-representation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilder, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th 489, 502.) Additionally, the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt of the charged offenses was quite overwhelming. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 502-503.) We find that the lack of any record on appeal of the advisements given when defendant first waived his right to counsel, and the omission of further admonishments in the superior court of the significance and consequences of the decision to waive the right to counsel, did not result in prejudicial error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crayton, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 346, 365-366; <em>People v. Wilder, supra, </em>at pp. 502-503; <em>People v. McArthur, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 619, 629-630.) We conclude based upon our examination of the totality of the record that defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel was both knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">III. <em>The Denial of Defendant\u2019s Request for Appointment of Advisory Counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Defendant next asserts that the trial court erred by declining to appoint advisory counsel for him as he requested several times before the commencement of trial. He claims that in \u201cthe context of this case\u201d\u2014particularly, the \u201cconditions in the jail,\u201d lack of proper medical attention, poor access to law books or other necessary materials, and the inadequate \u201cancillary services\u201d such as legal mnners to assist with his defense\u2014the denial of his motion for advisory counsel \u201cwas decidedly an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Once defendant elected self-representation, he did not have the constitutional right to advisory counsel to assist with his defense. <em>(McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 168, 183-184 [79 L.Ed.2d 122, 104 S.Ct. 944]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloom </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1194, 1218 [259 Cal.Rptr. 669, 774 P.2d 698].) \u201c[C]ocounsel status, advisory counsel and other forms of \u2018hybrid\u2019 representation are not constitutionally guaranteed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Cal.4th 41, 111 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561].) \u201c \u2018[T]he powers and responsibilities which attend the representation of a criminally accused person should never be conferred jointly and equally on the accused and the attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Stewart, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th-425, 518, citing <em>People v. Bloom, supra, </em>at pp. 1218-1219.) \u201c \u2018Rather, in all cases of shared or divided representation, either the accused or the attorney must be in charge. Stated otherwise, at all times the record should be clear that the accused is either self-represented or represented by counsel; the accused cannot be both at once. ... [A] self-represented defendant who wishes to obtain the assistance of an attorney in an advisory or other limited capacity, but without surrendering effective control over [the] presentation of the defense case, may do so only with the court\u2019s permission and upon a proper showing.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Stewart, supra, </em>at p. 518, quoting <em>People v. Bloom, supra, </em>at p.,1219.) \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">If the right of self-representation has been granted, the trial court <em>\u201cmay, </em>in its discretion, appoint counsel to \u2018render . . . advisory services\u2019 to a defendant who wishes to represent himself, in order to promote orderly, prompt and just disposition of the cause.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1430 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 796].)

[Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 41, 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s failure to appoint advisory counsel to assist defendant. As we have observed, defendant had extensive familiarity and experience with the justice system, having acted as his own attorney many times in the past. He demonstrated his competence and ability to act as his own attorney during pretrial proceedings in the present case by making a plethora of motions that related to admission of evidence, presentation of defenses, discovery, and ancillary legal services, among other requests from the court and the prosecution. At trial, defendant vigorously and effectively pursued his defenses of misidentification and lack of force or fear,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which included the presentation of expert testimony. Defendant successfully interposed objections, cross-examined prosecution witnesses, and presented evidence in his own defense. The trial court also granted defendant\u2019s request for advisory counsel for the limited purpose of investigating and presenting mental defenses, thereby manifesting its exercise of discretion in this matter. And finally, given defendant\u2019s unrelenting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>prodigious and effectual efforts to manipulate, obstruct, and prolong these proceedings, the court was justified in finding that further delays associated with appointment of advisory counsel were unjustified. (See <em>People v. Lawley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 102, 149-151.) We conclude that the trial court did not err by declining to appoint advisory counsel for defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 151; <em>People v. Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 41, 111-112; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crandell, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 833, 863.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">IV. <em>The Refusal of the Trial Court to Appoint Counsel to Represent Defendant in the Bifurcated Trial on the Prior Conviction Allegations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Defendant also complains that he was denied the right to counsel to represent him in the bifurcated jury trial proceeding on the prior conviction allegations. Defendant moved for appointment of an attorney for trial on \u201cthe truth of the prior convictions\u201d in the event of a guilty verdict. The court advised defendant that an attorney could be appointed to represent him for \u201cthe balance of the trial,\u201d which would include \u201cthe priors,\u201d but not for different aspects of the trial. The court then deferred the request \u201cuntil such time as before the trial of the priors commences, if that\u2019s going to commence.\u201d Defendant was invited to \u201caddress\u201d the court \u201cat that time.\u201d After the jury verdict, defendant did not renew his request or otherwise move again for appointment of counsel for the trial of the prior conviction allegations, but rather continued to represent himself. He now claims that the \u201cbifurcated trial on the priors was a critical stage\u201d of the proceedings, and he was entitled to counsel upon request. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u201cA trial judge is not obligated to restore counsel if a <em>Faretta </em>defendant changes his mind in midtrial and no longer wants to represent himself. A request for restoration of the services of counsel is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, exercised in light of several factors, including: \u2018 \u201c(1) defendant\u2019s prior history in the substitution of counsel and the desire to change from self-representation to counsel-representation, (2) the reasons set forth for the request, (3) the length and stage of the trial proceedings, (4) disruption or delay which reasonably might be expected to ensue from the granting of such motion, and (5) the likelihood of defendant\u2019s effectiveness in defending against the charges if required to continue to act as his own attorney.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Brookner v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1394 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 68]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 102, 149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Here, prior to commencement of trial defendant requested appointment of counsel only for proceedings related to the separate trial on \u201cthe truth of the prior convictions.\u201d The trial court was justified in deferring a ruling on the request until \u201csuch time\u201d as a \u201ctrial on the priors\u201d became necessary, as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>proceeding was entirely contingent upon the prosecution obtaining guilty verdicts on the charged offenses. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s failure to grant to defendant at that stage of the proceedings a restoration of counsel for future proceedings which might never occur. Following the trial and jury verdict, defendant had the obligation and opportunity to renew the motion and obtain a ruling if he still desired to relinquish responsibility for his own defense and obtain the appointment of counsel to represent him for the remainder of the action. (See <em>People v. Thompson </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 923, 931-932 [270 Cal.Rptr. 863]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hallman </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1330, 1340 [264 Cal.Rptr. 215].) He did not do so. Without a renewal of the motion by defendant the trial court was not compelled to appoint an attorney. We conclude that the record fails to establish a miscarriage of justice or violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to appointed counsel. <em>(People v. Lawley, supra, </em>27 Cal .4th 102, 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">V. <em>The Denial of Defendant\u2019s Severance Motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Defendant next claims that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for severance of counts 5 and 6 from the remaining charges. He acknowledges that section 954 authorized joinder of all of the robbery charges, but claims that severance of counts 5 and 6 was appropriate and necessary to prevent the \u201cuse of evidence which otherwise was not cross-admissible\u201d in the case for the \u201cimproper purpose\u201d of establishing a \u201cpattern of behavior\u201d or disposition to commit the crimes in violation of Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (a). He adds that the failure to sever trial of the charges resulted in an improper joint trial of a relatively \u201cweak\u201d case\u2014count 5\u2014with the other counts that offered comparatively more convincing identification testimony. Defendant further argues that even if the denial of the pretrial severance motion was correct, the joint trial of all the charges \u201cactually resulted in \u2018gross unfairness,\u2019 amounting to a denial of due process,\u201d and thus the convictions \u201cmust be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Section 954 states in part that an \u201caccusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, ... or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, . . . provided, that the court in which a case is triable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion order that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading be tried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried separately.\u201d All of the charged crimes were the \u201csame class\u201d of robbery offenses, so under section 954 joinder was proper unless \u201ca clear showing of prejudice\u201d was made. <em>(People v. Koontz, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 1041, 1075; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 947 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044].)

The robber- entered the banks in the late afternoon shortly before scheduled closing times. He stood in line or approached the teller windows as would any bank customer. He then handed the tellers notes that bore essentially the same message: I have a gun; give me your money or large bills. If the tellers did not immediately respond, the robber ordered them to comply. Many of the tellers were warned not to hit the alarm.

The following relevant factors must be considered in determining whether the prejudicial effect of evidence of uncharged offenses outweighs its probative value: (1) whether the inference created by the evidence is strong; (2) whether the source of evidence concerning the present offense is independent of and unaffected by information about the uncharged offense; (3) whether the defendant was punished for the prior misconduct; (4) whether the uncharged offense is more inflammatory than the charged offense; and (5) whether the two incidents occurred close in time. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th 380, 404-405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">None of the robbery offenses were more inflammatory than the others, and the evidence was,- as we have observed, quite probative on the issue of common plan or scheme. Hence, the evidence was not unduly prejudicial under section 352. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe \u2018prejudice\u2019 referred to in . . . section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against. . . [one party] as an individual and which has very little effect on the issues.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garceau </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 140, 178 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664]; see also <em>People v. Garcia </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1850 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 127].) The source of the evidence on each robbery charge was also unrelated to any of the other robberies. Further, the acts occurred very close in time, within a 10-week period. And finally, defendant did not present antagonistic or even distinctive defenses to the charges. <em>(People v. Jackson, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 1164, 1208-1209; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pinholster </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 934 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 824 P.2d 571].) He essentially claimed that for all of the charges the identification testimony offered against him was unpersuasive. We therefore conclude that all of the evidence would have been cross-admissible in separate trials, so the trial court\u2019s failure to grant severance was not error. <em>(People v.

Defendant argues that his motions were timely made and supported by \u201cmany factors pointing to a probability of a faulty identification\u201d of him as the robber. He submits that the trial court\u2019s failure to grant his motion for a pretrial lineup was \u201coutlandish,\u201d and \u201ccompels reversal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u201cIn <em>Evans v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 617, 625 [114 Cal.Rptr. 121, 522 P.2d 681],\u201d the California Supreme Court \u201cconcluded that \u2018due process requires in an appropriate case that an accused, upon timely request therefor, be afforded a pretrial lineup in which witnesses to the alleged criminal conduct can participate. The right to a lineup arises, however, only when eyewitness identification is shown to be a material issue and there exists a reasonable likelihood of a mistaken identification which a lineup would tend to resolve.\u2019 (Fn. omitted.)\u201d <em>(People v. Farnam </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 183 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 47 P.3d 988]; see also <em>People v. Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1155 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1].) The \u201cquestions whether eyewitness identification is a material issue and whether fundamental fairness requires a lineup in a particular case are inquiries which necessarily rest for determination within the broad discretion of the magistrate or trial judge.\u201d <em>(Evans, supra, </em>at p. 625.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Without considering the timeliness of defendant\u2019s motion in superior court, we conclude that he failed to make the prima facie showing required by <em>Evans. </em>Upon our review of the record we find no \u201creasonable likelihood of a mistaken identification\u201d that would have been resolved by a pretrial lineup. First, witnesses to the robbery at Citibank positively identified defendant in the field after he was apprehended near the crime scene in a taxi\u2014the same one that brought him to the bank\u2014in possession of the money and demand note, along with a sweater that matched the one worn by the robber. Another Citibank employee identified defendant from a photo lineup and at trial as \u201cthe person who robbed the bank.\u201d The witnesses identified photographs of the robber taken by bank surveillance cameras, which were exhibited to the jury. The descriptions of the robber provided by the witnesses, although not identical, were fairly uniform and corresponded to defendant\u2019s appearance. Most of the witnesses managed to get a good look at the face of the robber during the crimes. Many, although not all, of the witnesses identified defendant from the photo lineups displayed to them, and defendant has not established that those photo lineups were in any way impermissibly suggestive. Defendant was provided with the statements and descriptions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>witnesses, along with all of the information associated with the photo lineups. He thus had ample opportunity to challenge the identifications at trial, even without a pretrial physical lineup. We are convinced that an additional pretrial lineup would not have yielded any different testimony by the witnesses, or cast doubt upon any of the identifications made by them. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a lineup. <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 235-236 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">VII. <em>The Instruction on Eyewitness Identification Factors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Defendant presents two objections to the jury instructions, the first of which is that the trial court erred by failing to delete sua sponte the reference to witness \u201ccertainty\u201d from the standard instruction (CALJIC No. 2.92) on the factors to be considered in \u201cdetermining the weight to be given eyewitness testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defendant complains that the expert opinion testimony presented by Dr. Blinder discredited the certainty expressed by the witnesses as a legitimate factor bearing on the accuracy of an identification. He claims that CALJIC No. 2.92 as given by the trial court with the \u201cuse of the \u2018certainty\u2019 factor\u201d thus violated his \u201cright to due process, because it reinforced a pervasive misconception and lightened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">For two reasons, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s challenge to CALJIC No. 2.92 as given by the trial court. First, the trial court had no duty to either give or modify CALJIC No. 2.92 on its own motion. (See <em>People v. Cook </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 566, 599 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 22, 139 P.3d 492]; <em>People v. Ward </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 186, 213-214 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 464, 114 P.3d 717]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 742, 802-803 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192].) Second, although the California Supreme Court, like defendant\u2019s expert, has referred to studies that indicate a lack of correlation between the degree of confidence an eyewitness expresses in an identification and the accuracy of that identification,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaglione </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1302-1303 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 169],<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> observed that defendant\u2019s argument was \u201cexpressly rejected\u201d in <em>People v. Wright </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1126 [248 Cal.Rptr. 600, 755 P.2d 1049]. In <em>Wright, supra, </em>at page 1141, the court held that \u201ca proper instruction on eyewitness identification factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>should focus the jury\u2019s attention on facts relevant to its determination of the existence of reasonable doubt regarding identification, by listing, in a neutral manner, the relevant factors supported by the evidence, [f] The instruction should not take a position as to the impact of each of the psychological factors listed.\u201d (Italics omitted.) In <em>Gaglione, </em>we noted that the <em>Wright </em>opinion \u201cexpressly approved CALJIC No. 2.92, commenting that CALJIC No. 2.92, with appropriate modifications to take into account the evidence presented at trial, will usually provide sufficient guidance on eyewitness identification factors. <em>([Wright, supra,] </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1141.)\u201d <em>(People v. Gaglione, supra, </em>atp. 1303; see also <em>People v. Johnson (1992) </em>3 Cal.4th 1183, 1230-1231 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 842 P.2d 1].) As in <em>Gaglione, </em>we therefore \u201creject defendant\u2019s arguments and find no error in CALJIC No. 2.92\u201d as given with reference to degree of certainty as a factor in assessing the reliability of eyewitness identification testimony. <em>(Gaglione, supra, </em>at p. 1303.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">VIII. , <em>The Instruction on the Lesser Offense of Grand Theft.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Defendant also argues that his due process and jury trial rights were denied by the trial court\u2019s instruction, over his objection, on the lesser included offense of grand theft. His position is that the \u201cbetter rule in American jurisprudence\u201d is to grant to \u201cthe defendant\u201d the \u201cultimate decision to instruct on a lesser-included offense.\u201d (See <em>People v. Brocksmith </em>(1992) 237 Ill.App.3d 818 [178 Ill.Dec. 536, 604 N.E.2d 1059].) The \u201cperil\u201d of conviction of the greater offense is entirely on the defendant, he submits, so the decision to request or preclude a lesser included offense instruction should also be the defendant\u2019s alone. Defendant adds that without an instruction on the lesser grand theft offense, he would not have been convicted of the robberies if the jury had accepted his defense of lack of \u201cforce or fear\u201d associated with the takings from the bank tellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The glaring flaw in defendant\u2019s argument is that it runs directly contrary to established California Supreme Court authority. <em>(People v. Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 154-155 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present and there is evidence that would justify a conviction of such a lesser offense.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] As we have explained, instructing on lesser included offenses shown by the evidence avoids forcing the jury into an \u2018unwarranted all-or-nothing choice\u2019 [citations] that could lead to an unwarranted conviction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 365 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cThat obligation has been held to include giving instructions on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>present [Citation.] \u2018[R]egardless of the tactics or objections of the parties, or the relative strength of the evidence on alternate offenses or theories, the rule requires sua sponte instruction on any and all lesser included offenses, or theories thereof, which are supported by the evidence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 422 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442].) Thus, \u201cThe obligation to instruct on lesser included offenses exists even when, as a matter of trial tactics, a defendant not only fails to request the instruction but also expressly objects to it being given.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Joiner </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 946, 972 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 270].)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Our high court has \u201cconsistently held that neither party need request such instructions, and neither party can preclude them, because neither party has a greater interest than the other in gambling on an inaccurate all-or-nothing verdict when the pleadings and evidence suggest a middle ground, and neither party\u2019s \u2018strategy, ignorance, or mistake[]\u2019 should open the way to such a verdict.

Further, if the record contains substantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthe possibility that the trier of fact might reasonably have reached a different conclusion does not warrant reversal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 628, 639 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 550].)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Despite the failure of the victim to positively identify defendant at trial or in a pretrial photo lineup, we find substantial evidence to support the count 5 robbery conviction. Lopez may not have been \u201csure\u201d of her identification at trial, but she testified that defendant \u201cappealed] to be\u201d the robber. She gave a description of the robber to the police that fairly well matched defendant\u2019s appearance, and testified that a photograph taken by the Bank of America security camera depicted the man who robbed her. Lopez also identified the subject in a World Savings Bank surveillance camera photograph as the person who robbed her, and defendant was positively identified by eyewitnesses as the man who robbed the teller at the World Savings Bank robbery in Concord. Finally, the perpetrator of the robbery at Bank of America used methods and committed acts that were essentially identical to the other robberies committed by a man positively identified as defendant. The descriptions of the robber given by all of the witnesses, including Lopez, were also similar. The evidence to support the conviction on count 5 may not have been as overwhelming as it was on the other charges, but it was at least substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">X. <em>The Imposition of Consecutive Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Defendant also presents two issues related to the imposition of the sentence imposed upon him of six consecutive 25-year-to-life terms under the Three Strikes law, each enhanced by 10 years for two prior serious felony convictions (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) found by the trial court, for a total term of 210 years to life. He first claims that the \u201cconsecutive sentencing violated the Due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, because no jury determined beyond a reasonable doubt (or at all) that the government had proven the facts necessary to permit the judge to impose consecutive sentences,\u201d as required by <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296, 301 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531] <em>(Blakely), </em>and <em>United States v.

New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466, 490 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] <em>(Apprendi), </em>that \u201c \u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301.) The court found that an exceptional sentence beyond the standard range sentence for the offense imposed by a trial judge under Washington\u2019s determinate sentencing law based upon several specified facts found by the trial judge violated the <em>Apprendi </em>rule that the jury verdict alone must \u201cauthorize the sentence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 305, fn. 8; see also <em>People v.

The court in <em>Blakely </em>operated from the premise pronounced in both its <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring </em>decisions that a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated when a judge imposes \u201ca sentence greater than the maximum he could have imposed under state law without the challenged factual finding.\u201d <em>(Blakely, supra, </em>at p. 303, citing <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>at pp. 491-497, and <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584, 603-609 [153 L.Ed.2d 556, 122 S.Ct. 2428].) The court defined \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes\u201d as \u201cthe maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>[Citations.] In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \u2018which the law makes essential to the punishment,\u2019 [citation], and the judge exceeds his proper authority.\u201d <em>(Blakely, supra, </em>at pp. 303-304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The United States Supreme Court provided additional guidance on the distinction between permissible and impermissible judicial factfinding in <em>Booker, supra, </em>543 U.S. 220, where the defendant received a term under the federal sentencing guidelines that exceeded the base range following the trial judge\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he possessed an amount of drugs in excess of that determined by the jury\u2019s verdict. In <em>Booker, </em>a majority of the court \u201cfound no significant distinction between the mandatory federal sentencing guidelines and the Washington sentencing law at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>in <em>Blakely </em>and concluded the federal guidelines [also] violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>(Booker, supra, </em>at p. 233 [160 L.Ed.2d at p. 643].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Linder, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.4th 75, 83.) The high court in <em>Booker </em>concluded that the federal guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment because \u201cthe relevant sentencing rules are mandatory and impose binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\u201d <em>(Booker, supra, </em>at p. 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The court in <em>Booker </em>acknowledged that if the guidelines had been \u201cmerely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment. We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range.\u201d <em>(Booker, supra, </em>543 U.S. 220, 233.) But the majority in <em>Booker </em>also pointed out that the federal sentencing statute requires the judge to impose a sentence within the range established by the guidelines, \u201csubject to departures in specific, limited cases.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 234; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).) \u201cThus, just as in <em>Blakely,\u201d </em>the court declared, \u201c \u2018the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Booker, supra, </em>at p. 235, quoting <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. 296, 305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The California determinate sentencing law (DSL) was temporarily spared from the reach of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>by the decision in <em>People v.

After defendant submitted his opening brief, however, the United States Supreme Court reversed the <em>Black </em>decision in <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>California </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 270,_[166 L.Ed.2d 856, 865, 127 S.Ct. 856, 860], <em>(Cunningham), </em>where the defendant was \u201ctried and convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14[, which under the DSL is] . . . punishable by imprisonment for a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term sentence of 12 years, or an upper term sentence of 16 years. Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 288.5(a).\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._[166 L.Ed.2d at p. 865].) At the sentencing hearing the trial court found six aggravating circumstances, all related to commission of the offense\u2014as the defendant had no prior record of criminal conduct\u2014and on that basis imposed the upper term. The court observed that \u201cthe DSL regime, is implemented in the following manner. The statute defining the offense prescribes three precise terms of imprisonment\u2014a lower, middle, and upper term sentence. <em>E.g., </em>Penal Code \u00a7 288.5(a) (West 1999) (a person convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child \u2018shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of 6, 12, or 16 years\u2019). See also <em>Black, </em>35 Cal.4th [1238,] 1247[, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d, 534, 538]. Penal Code \u00a7 1170(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>(West Supp. 2006) controls the trial judge\u2019s choice; it provides that \u2018the court shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.\u2019 \u2018[Cjircumstances in aggravation or mitigation\u2019 are to be determined by the court after consideration of several items: the trial record; the probation officer\u2019s report; statements in aggravation or mitigation submitted by the parties, the victim, or the victim\u2019s family; \u2018and any further evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._ [166 L.Ed.2d at p. 866].) \u201cUnder California\u2019s DSL, an upper term sentence may be imposed only when the trial judge finds an aggravating circumstance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._[166 L.Ed.2d at p. 873].) \u201cAn element of the charged offense, essential to a jury\u2019s determination of guilt, or admitted in a defendant\u2019s guilty plea, does not qualify as such a circumstance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [166 L.Ed.2d at p. 873].) \u201cInstead, aggravating circumstances depend on facts found discretely and solely by the judge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._[166 L.Ed.2d at p. 873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The court in <em>Cunningham </em>concluded: \u201cIn accord with <em>Blakely, </em>therefore, the middle term prescribed in California\u2019s statutes, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum. <em>[Blakely, supra,] </em>542 U.S. 296, 303 (\u2018[T]he \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant </em>. . .\u2019 (emphasis in original)). Because circumstances in aggravation are found by the judge, not the jury, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, [citation], the DSL violates Apprendi\u2019s bright-line rule: Except for a prior conviction, \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>[Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490.]\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._[166 L.Ed.2d at p. 873].) The court summarized: \u201cContrary to the <em>Black </em>court\u2019s holding, our decisions from <em>Apprendi </em>to <em>Booker </em>point to the middle term specified in California\u2019s statutes, not the upper term, as the relevant statutory maximum. Because the DSL authorizes the judge, not the jury, to find the facts permitting an upper term sentence, the system cannot withstand measurement against our Sixth Amendment precedent.\u201d <em>(Cunningham, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p._[166 L.Ed.2d at p. 876]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 911, 917 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 255].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">Nothing in <em>Cunningham </em>casts constitutional doubt upon the imposition of consecutive sentences by the trial court in the present case. The consecutive terms were not selected by the trial court on the basis of any findings, but rather, following the jury verdict, were mandatory pursuant to section 1170.12, subdivision (a)(6), which provides: \u201cIf there is a current conviction for more than one felony count not committed on the same occasion, and not arising from the same set of operative facts, the court shall sentence the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>consecutively on each count pursuant to this section.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The jury, not the trial court, found the predicate facts required to authorize the mandatory consecutive sentences for multiple robberies committed at separate times and places, upon separate victims. The jury verdicts specified that defendant committed six robberies upon different victims, at different locations, on different dates. <em>Once the </em>jury verdict was rendered, the sentencing court was compelled to sentence defendant consecutively. <em>(People v. Hendrix </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 508, 513 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 431, 941 P.2d 64].) Imposition of mandatory consecutive sentences which were authorized by facts reflected in the jury verdict alone, without the necessity of any additional supporting facts found by the trial court, did not offend the federal Constitution guarantees afforded to a criminal defendant to a jury determination, based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, of every element of the crime and every fact, however labeled, that increases the defendant\u2019s punishment beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. We therefore conclude that defendant was not denied his due process rights to a jury trial and finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Blakely </em>by the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive terms. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaw </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 453, 459 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 766].)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">XI. <em>Defendant\u2019s Aggregate Sentence as Cruel and Unusual Punishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Finally, we confront defendant\u2019s claim that his \u201caggregate sentence of 210 years to life violates the proscription against cruel and/or unusual punishment under both the California and United States Constitutions.\u201d Defendant complains that the sentence, \u201cbesides being ridiculous and absurd in the extreme as a matter of reality,\u201d is also \u201cgrossly disproportionate, by any conceivably rational measure. Indeed, it is in excess of what he would have received had he murdered, rather than robbed, his victims.\u201d He asks us to vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing \u201cto an appropriate term which does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u201cCruel and unusual punishment is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 17 of the California Constitution. Punishment is cruel and unusual if it is so disproportionate to the crime committed that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u201d <em>(People v.

[or] unusual punishment. First, courts examine the nature of the offense and the offender, \u201cwith particular regard to the degree of danger both present to society.\u201d Second, a comparison is made of the challenged penalty with those imposed in the same jurisdiction for more serious crimes. Third, the challenged penalty is compared with those imposed for the same offense in other jurisdictions.

The choice of fitting and proper penalties is not an exact science, but a legislative skill involving an appraisal of the evils to be corrected, the weighing of practical alternatives, consideration of relevant policy factors, and, responsiveness to the public will; in appropriate cases, some leeway for experimentation may also be permissible. The judiciary, accordingly, should not interfere in this process unless a statute prescribes a penalty \u201cout of all proportion to the offense\u201d [citations], i.e., so severe in relation to the crime as to violate the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Defining crime and determining punishment are matters uniquely legislative in nature, resting within the Legislature\u2019s sole discretion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 243, 251 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 827].) \u201c \u2018Only when the punishment is out of all proportion to the offense and is clearly an extraordinary penalty for a crime of ordinary gravity committed under ordinary circumstances, do the courts denounce it as unusual.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has emphasized \u2018the considerable burden a defendant must overcome in challenging a penalty as cruel or unusual. The doctrine of separation of powers is firmly entrenched in the law of California, and a court should not lightly encroach on matters which are uniquely in the domain of the Legislature. Perhaps foremost among these are the definition of crime and the determination of punishment. While these intrinsically legislative functions are circumscribed by the constitutional limits of article I, section 17 [of the California Constitution], the validity of enactments will not be questioned \u201cunless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v.

Commission of a series of robberies which included threatened acts of violence with a deadly weapon must be considered acts of a most heinous nature. (See <em>People v. Crooks </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 797, 807-808 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 236].) He committed the robbery offenses one. after another unabated until he was captured after the robbery at Concord Citibank.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">A consideration of defendant\u2019s nature as an offender is no more favorable to him. \u201c[T]he inquiry focuses on the particular person before the court, and asks whether the punishment is grossly disproportionate to the defendant\u2019s individual culpability as shown by such factors as his age, prior criminality, personal characteristics, and state of mind.\u201d <em>(People v. Thompson </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 299, 305 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 847].) Defendant has an extensive criminal history of serious felony offenses dating back many years. He already served two terms in state prison, and committed the present offenses while on escape status. He is an. incorrigible recidivist offender who presents a most grave and extreme level of danger to society. Defendant qualifies as \u201cprecisely the type of offender from whom society seeks protection by the use of recidivist statutes.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ingram </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1415 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].) His unrelenting criminality and current offenses valid\u00e1te the term imposed under the Three Strikes law. <em>(People v.

The \u201csecond prong of the Lynch[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] test which involves a comparison of the questioned punishment with punishments imposed within the same jurisdiction for offenses which may be deemed more serious than that for which the questioned punishment is imposed. While such a comparison is particularly striking when a more serious crime is punished less severely than the offense in question, it remains instructive when the latter is punished as severely as a more serious crime.\u201d <em>(People v. Thompson, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see also <em>People v. Cline, supra, </em>60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1327, 1338.) Defendant maintains that his sentence \u201cis in excess of what he would have received had he murdered, rather than robbed, his victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Defendant\u2019s proffered comparison between his punishment and that imposed upon convicted first degree murderers is flawed for several reasons. First, the punishment for first degree murder may indeed be greater, than defendant received. Pursuant to section 190, subdivision (a), \u201ca person convicted of first degree murder is subject to the death penalty, life in prison without the possibility of parole, or a term of 25 years to life depending on the circumstances of the offense and the offender.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 815, 826; see also <em>People v. Ingram, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1416.) Thus, the maximum punishment for the hypothecated crimes may be more severe than defendant received. <em>(People v. Cooper, supra, </em>at p. 826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u201cSecond, proportionality assumes a basis for comparison. When the fundamental nature of the offense and the offender differ, comparison for proportionality is not possible.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 815, 826; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingram, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1416.) Defendant \u201cignores that the three strikes law punishes not only his current offenses, but also his recidivism. California statutes imposing more severe punishment on habitual criminals have long withstood constitutional challenge.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cartwright, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1136-1137.) Defendant is not subject to multiple 25-year-to-life sentences merely on the basis of his current offenses alone, but also for his recidivist behavior. <em>(People v. Kinsey, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1621, 1630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Thus, a comparison of defendant\u2019s \u201cpunishment for his current crimes with the punishment for other crimes in California is inapposite since it is his recidivism in combination with his current crimes that places him under the three strikes law.\u201d <em>(People v. Ayon, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 385, 400.) \u201cBecause the Legislature may constitutionally enact statutes imposing more severe punishment for habitual criminals,\u201d we cannot logically compare appellant\u2019s \u201cpunishment for his [current offenses,] which includes his recidivist behavior, to the punishment of others who have committed more serious crimes, but have not qualified as repeat felons. Other such offenders would likely receive similar or longer sentences under the new law if the law were applicable to them because of recidivist conduct.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) \u201c[I]t is proper to punish a repeat offender more severely than a first-time offender. The proper comparison would be to a recidivist killer,\u201d whose punishment would not be less severe than defendant\u2019s. <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1512.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Further, the likelihood that he may not serve the entirety of the sentence does not, in our view, make the punishment inappropriate under the circumstances. \u201cIn practical effect, he is in no different position than a defendant who has received a sentence of life without possibility of parole: he will be in prison all his life. However, imposition of a sentence of life without possibility of parole in an appropriate case does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment under either our state Constitution <em>(People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1308-1311 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 30]) or the federal Constitution. <em>(Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan </em>(1991) 501 U.S. <em>951 </em>[111 S.Ct. 268, 115 L.Ed.2d 836] [sentence of life without possibility of parole not cruel and unusual for possession of 672 grams of cocaine].)\u201d <em>(People v. Byrd </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1383 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Finally, appellant is not only a recidivist offender, he committed a <em>series </em>of current felonies. \u201c[T]he commission of a single act of murder, while heinous and severely punished, cannot be compared with the commission of multiple felonies.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 815, 826; see <em>People v. Ingram, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1416.) We find that defendant\u2019s sentence is not out of all proportion to the punishment in California for commission of multiple, serious robbery offenses by a recidivist offender. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodwin, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1094.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Turning to an interjurisdictional comparison of punishments, defendant is required to prove that \u201c \u2018. . . the punishment prescribed for his offense, as compared to that imposed for similar offenses in other jurisdictions, is unconstitutional under the third prong of [the <em>Lynch-Dillon[</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>test].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crooks, supra, 55 </em>Cal.App.4th 797, 808.) If the challenged penalty is found to exceed punishments within the constitutional limit of severity decreed for the offense in a \u201csignificant number\u201d of jurisdictions, the disparity is considered \u201ca further measure of its excessiveness.\u201d <em>(In re Lynch, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 410, 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Defendant has not even attempted to engage in a comparison of California\u2019s punishment for recidivists with punishment for recidivists in other states. While the courts have acknowledged the status of the Three Strikes law as \u201camong the most extreme\u201d in the nation, that factor \u201cdoes not compel the concl\u00fasion that it is unconstitutionally cruel or unusual.\u201d <em>(People v. Martinez, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1516.) \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Three Strikes scheme is consistent with the nationwide pattern of substantially increasing sentences for habitual offenders.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ingram, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1416.) After undertaking a methodical comparison of repeat or habitual offender punishment schemes in other states, the court in <em>People v. Martinez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>supra, </em>at page 1516, declared that California is not required \u201cto march in lockstep with other states in fashioning a penal code. It does not require \u2018conforming our Penal Code to the \u201cmajority rule\u201d or the least common denominator of penalties nationwide.\u2019 [Citation.] Otherwise, California could never-take the toughest stance against repeat offenders or any other type of criminal conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th 815, 827, explained: \u201c[T]he needs and concerns of a particular state may induce it to treat certain crimes or particular repeat offenders more severely than any other state. Nothing in the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment per se disables a state from responding to changed social conditions and increasing the severity with which it treats its recidivist felons, [f] Whether a particular punishment is disproportionate to the offense is a question of degree. The choice of fitting and proper penalty is not an exact science but a legislative skill involving an appraisal of the evils to be corrected, the weighing of practical alternatives, consideration of relevant policy factors, and responsiveness to the public will. In some cases, leeway for experimentation may be permissible. Thus, the judiciary should not interfere in the process unless a statute prescribes a penalty \u2018 \u201cout of all proportion to the offense.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>In re Lynch, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 410, 423-424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u201c[A] comparison of California\u2019s punishment for recidivists with punishment for recidivists in other states shows that many of the statutory schemes provide for life imprisonment for repeat offenders, and several states provide for life imprisonment without possibility of parole.\u201d <em>(People v. Cline, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th 1327, 1338.) We conclude, as have other courts when presented with essentially the same issue in similar contexts, that defendant has failed to establish his sentence is disproportionate when compared to recidivist statutes in other jurisdictions. <em>(People v.

For the benefit of the parties this court attempted to obtain the reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing on May 20, 1996; we have been advised that it is not available due to the lengthy passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We also observe that when a transcript of proceedings in the trial court is unavailable, rule 8.130(g) of the California Rules of Court provides that a party \u201cmay then substitute an agreed or settled statement for that portion of the designated proceedings by complying with either (A) or (B).\u201d Following notice given, a \u201cparty may move in superior court to use a settled statement. If the court grants the motion, the statement must be served, filed, and settled as rule 8.137 provides, but the order granting the motion must fix the times for doing so.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.130(g)(1)(B).) Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 8.137(a)(1), an \u201cappellant wanting to proceed\u201d with a \u201csettled statement\u201d must file a motion in superior court \u201cto use a settled statement\u201d instead of a reporter\u2019s transcript; the motion must be supported by a showing that the \u201cdesignated oral proceedings were not reported or cannot be transcribed . . . .\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.137(a)(2)(B).) Defendant\u2019s proper remedy for the unavailability of portions of the transcript was to obtain \u201ca settled statement of the oral proceedings prepared by the parties and settled by the judge who heard the matter],] or an agreed statement prepared by the parties\u201d and \u201cconsisting of a condensed statement of the relevant proceedings.\u201d <em>(Le Font v.
