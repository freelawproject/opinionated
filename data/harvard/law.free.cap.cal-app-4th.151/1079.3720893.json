J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">In this action brought by tenants of an apartment building under California\u2019s unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 17200 et seq.) (UCL), the trial court found that the appellant property owners had committed an unfair business practice by attempting to sell subdivided interests in property without obtaining the \u201cpublic report\u201d that must be provided to potential buyers pursuant to the Subdivided Lands Act (\u00a7 11000 et seq.). The court described appellants\u2019 unfair business practice as purchasing residential rental properti\u00e9s, subdividing them through the vehicle of tenancy-in-common agreements accompanied by the right to exclusive occupancy of individual units, and then selling or attempting to sell the subdivided interests without complying with the Subdivided Lands Act. In order to create vacancy in the buildings they sought to subdivide and sell, appellants utilized the Ellis Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060 et seq.) to evict the tenants and remove the buildings from the rental market. The court issued an injunction requiring appellants to comply with the Subdivided Lands Act before either offering their interests in the building for sale or exercising their rights under the Ellis Act to recover possession of the building from the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">On appeal, the property owners contend the. tenants lack standing to pursue a UCL claim premised on a violation of the Subdivided Lands Act. After Proposition 64, a private person has standing to sue under the UCL for unfair competition only if he or she \u201chas suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property <em>as a result of </em>such unfair competition.\u201d (\u00a7 17204, italics added.) Any threatened loss of the tenants\u2019 leasehold interests here resulted not from the owners\u2019 alleged noncompliance with the Subdivided Lands Act but instead from the owners\u2019 lawful exercise of their right to withdraw property from the rental market under the Ellis Act. The tenants lack standing under the UCL to seek relief based on a purported violation of the Subdivided Lands Act because their claimed injury does' not result from the alleged violation of that statutory scheme. Accordingly, we shall reverse the order granting the injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Respondents (hereafter tenants) reside in a six-unit residential apartment building located at 424-434 Francisco Street in San Francisco (Francisco Street property). Four limited liability companies (LLC\u2019s),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>petitioners Nicole Daro and Max Schultz, purchased the Francisco Street property from the tenants\u2019 former landlord, Louise Vasquez. Escrow closed on October 7, 2003. We will refer collectively to the owners of the Francisco Street property as the \u201cowners,\u201d but where necessary to distinguish among the owners, we will refer to the appellant LLC\u2019s as the \u201cLLC owners\u201d and to Daro and Schultz by their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Appellant Gary Rossi is a real estate agent with a 50 percent ownership interest in one of the LLC owners. Appellant Gregory Todd Eichler is a principal in nonparty SF Duke Investments, which itself has an ownership interest in one of the LLC owners. Eichler\u2019s name initially appeared on the grant deed to the Francisco Street property. The inclusion of his name as an owner of record was an error by the title company, however, and the deed was subsequently corrected to omit his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Prior to the close of escrow, the owners executed a tenancy in common (TIC) agreement, which provided that each owner would have an undivided percentage interest in the Francisco Street property. The TIC. agreement provided that four of the LLC owners, and Daro and Schultz together, would each have the exclusive right to occupy one of the six units. Because there were five undivided ownership interests in a property with six units, the TIC agreement provided that one of the LLC owners had the exclusive right to occupy two of the six units. While the deed to the Francisco Street property reflects that the owners hold their interests as tenants in common, nothing in the deed reflects or otherwise refers to the exclusive rights of occupancy created by the TIC agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Daro and Schultz purch\u00e1sed their interest with the intent to make it their home. The LLC owners purchased their interests as investments for purposes of future sale. The LLC owners intended to create vacancies in the Francisco Street property, repair and remodel the units after the tenants left, and then sell, their interests to owners who would occupy the units. The owners understood before the close of escrow that they might have to invoke the Ellis Act in order to create vacancies in the units. The owners also agreed to convert the Francisco Street property into condominiums at the earliest possible date.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">When the owners acquired the property, all six units at the Francisco Street property were occupied by tenants. In order to recover possession of the premises, the owners invoked the Ellis Act on April 13, 2004, by serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>notices terminating tenancy on all of the tenants in the building. With one exception, the tenants resisted by refusing to comply with the notices terminating their tenancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">After purchasing the Francisco Street property, Rossi had discussions with two tenants, Alane Castro and Christopher Larose, about purchasing interests in the building corresponding to the units they occupied. In December 2003, Rossi told Castro he was a representative of the owners and that she and her husband could buy into the TIC for a price of $500,000, with a price range not exceeding $100,000. The $100,000 variance was based upon the amount of improvements to be done and whether a parking space was available. Rossi and Castro spoke again on April 21, 2004, when Rossi once more mentioned the sale price. Castro understood she could buy her unit if she met Rossi\u2019s price. In May 2004, Rossi told Castro that \u201cit wasn\u2019t going to be able to work\u201d at the Francisco Street property but that he had other properties he could show Castro and her husband. Castro and her husband moved out of the Francisco Street property in response to the Ellis Act notice and are not parties in the underlying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In November 2003, Rossi spoke with Larose about purchasing a TIC interest at a location other than the Francisco Street property. Subsequently, they discussed purchasing Larose\u2019s unit at the Francisco Street property. In approximately February 2004, Larose asked Rossi \u201chow much generally\u201d his unit would sell for. Rossi told him $400,000 unremodeled. The scope of what was being offered was unclear because somebody told Larose that a planned garage for the building would affect the physical layout of the unit he occupied. Larose stated he \u201creally couldn\u2019t have afforded\u201d to buy his unit and did not think there was the opportunity to do so. Rossi denied offering to sell units to any tenants, although he admitted he had general discussions with Larose regarding his ability to purchase a unit in a TIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The tenants filed suit against the owners, Rossi, Eichler, and their former landlord, Vasquez (collectively, defendants), on June 25, 2004. They alleged two primary claims. In the first cause of action seeking injunctive relief under the UCL, the tenants contended that all the defendants had committed an unfair business practice by violating the Subdivided Lands Act. The tenants also included causes of action against the owners and Eichler relating to habitability issues arising out of alleged substandard conditions at the Francisco Street property.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">In the UCL cause of action, the tenants alleged that defendants had\u2014as was their \u201cregular practice\u201d\u2014divided the Francisco Street property into five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>or more TIC interests for the purposes of sale. The tenants asserted that defendants failed to notify the Real Estate Commissioner of their intention to sell subdivided interests and failed to obtain a public report from the Department of Real Estate before creating the subdivided interests and offering them for sale, both in violation of the Subdivided Lands Act. The tenants further alleged that defendants had structured their business practices in order to avoid complying with the Subdivided Lands Act and had engaged in similar violations of the Subdivided Lands Act at other properties. The UCL cause of action did not describe the owners\u2019 attempt to recover possession pursuant to the Ellis Act as unfair, unlawful, or deceptive. Indeed, nowhere in the complaint did the tenants even mention that the owners had exercised their rights under the Ellis Act to recover possession of the Francisco Street property. Further, while they sought an injunction to prevent further violations of the law \u201cwith respect to the ownership and sale of real property,\u201d they did not specifically seek to enjoin the Ellis Act evictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The owners, Rossi, and Eichler answered the complaint and cross-complained against the tenants for declaratory relief and ejectment based on their invocation of the Ellis Act. They sought a declaration that their notices terminating the tenancies complied with applicable provisions of the San Francisco rent control ordinance. The ejectment claim was based on the tenants\u2019 failure to vacate in response to the Ellis Act eviction notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The tenants dismissed all claims against their former landlord, Vasquez, pursuant to a settlement. On March 16, 2005, the owners, Rossi, and Eichler amended their answer to assert a defense that the tenants lacked standing to bring a UCL claim after the passage of Proposition 64 in November 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Petitioners Daro and Schultz moved for summary adjudication of issues on the UCL cause of action. The trial court granted summary adjudication for Daro and Schultz, finding that (1) their purchase of a unit in which they intended to reside was not a business practice; (2) their purchase did not require compliance with the Subdivided Lands Act; and (3) the tenants were not harmed by any alleged violation of the Subdivided Lands Act and therefore had no standing under the UCL after the passage of Proposition 64,</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">The trial court thereafter conducted a bench trial focusing on the tenants\u2019 UCL claim and the owners\u2019 claim concerning the sufficiency of the notices terminating tenancy. The court found that the LLC owners, Rossi, and Eichler had engaged in an unfair business practice. The court also found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>language in the termination notices regarding relocation payments was adequate and in compliance with the San Francisco rent control ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The trial court found that the purchase of the Francisco Street property from Vasquez created five undivided interests in the property. Upon finding that the LLC owners intended to resell their respective interests, the court concluded that the manner in which the property was purchased created a subdivision subject to the requirements of the Subdivided Lands Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The court further found it was undisputed that the owners did nothing to comply with the Subdivided Lands Act either with respect to the Francisco Street property or any other similar property they owned. The court concluded based on the weight of the evidence that Rossi and Eichler, through their various business interests and LLC\u2019s, had acquired and treated other properties in a manner similar to their approach to the Francisco Street property. The court held that \u201c[defendants\u2019 practice of purchasing property, subdividing it into five or more subdivisions through the vehicle of a tenancy in common agreement with exclusive rights of occupancy, and then selling the separately owned tenancy in common interest without complying with the [Subdivided Lands Act] is an unfair business practice. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The court noted the \u201cillegality is not in obtaining property [as tenants in common with exclusive rights of occupancy], but it is in obtaining the property in such a manner with the intent to resell the individual interests and then proceeding to sell or offer for sale those interests without complying with the [Subdivided Lands Act].\u201d As for the owners\u2019 invocation of the Ellis Act, the trial court stated that \u201c[i]n and of itself, utilization of the provisions of the Ellis Act to secure vacancy in a building for newly formed tenancy in common interests is not legally objectionable.\u201d Nevertheless, the court described the Ellis Act evictions as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the LLC owners\u2019 unfair business practice. Because the Ellis Act termination notices were \u201cin furtherance of an unfair business practice,\u201d the trial court declared them to be void and without effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">On the issue of standing, the trial court acknowledged that the issue of Proposition 64\u2019s retroactivity was then before the California Supreme Court. The trial court declined to decide the retroactivity issue, concluding that the tenants had suffered injury in fact by virtue of the threatened loss of their leasehold interests. Consequently, even if Proposition 64\u2019s amended standing requirement were held to be retroactive, the tenants would still have standing to pursue a UCL claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The court enjoined the LLC owners, Rossi, and Eichler from marketing, selling, offering to sell, or transferring any interest in the Francisco Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>property unless and until they had complied with the Subdivided Lands Act either by obtaining a public report or by securing an exemption from the Subdivided Lands Act\u2019s requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court further enjoined the LLC owners, Rossi, and Eichler from pursuing any efforts to recover possession of the property through termination notices issued pursuant to the Ellis Act unless and until they had obtained either a public report for the Francisco Street property or an exemption from the Subdivided Lands Act\u2019s requirements. The order clarified that the terms of the injunction did not apply .to the undivided interest in the Francisco Street property owned by Daro and Schultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The LLC owners, Rossi, and Eichler timely appealed the order granting the injunction. Daro and Schultz did not file an appeal, apparently upon the assumption they lacked standing to appeal an injunction that specifically excluded their property interests from its scope. Instead, they sought extraordinary writ relief challenging the injunction, arguing that the injunctive relief, while not specifically directed at them, nevertheless prevented them from invoking their rights under the Ellis Act to leave the rental business.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>claimed they were forced to remain landlords against their will, were deprived of significant defenses in the second phase of the case addressing habitability violations, and were unable to pursue their ejectment claim. Their petition raises the same issues as the appeal and they have an obvious and beneficial interest in the outcome of the appeal and in setting aside the injunction. Accordingly, we issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted, ordered the writ petition consolidated with the appeal, and stayed further trial court proceedings on the habitability and ejectment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The issue presented on appeal is whether the tenants have standing under the UCL to pursue an action based on a threatened violation of the Subdivided Lands Act. The trial court\u2019s construction of the relevant statutes, including the UCL, the Subdivided Lands Act, and the Ellis Act, is subject to our de novo review. (See <em>Reis </em>v. <em>Biggs Unified School Dist. </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 809, 816 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 393].) We review any factual determinations that bear upon the standing issue under the substantial evidence standard. (See <em>Taxpayers for Livable Communities v. City of Malibu </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1126 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">2. <em>Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The trial court found that the LLC owners had committed an unfair business practice by violating the Subdivided Lands Act. The court further found that the LLC owners served eviction notices under the Ellis Act in furtherance of this unfair business practice. Thus, the issues raised in this appeal require us to consider the interplay among three statutory schemes: California\u2019s unfair competition law (\u00a7 17200 et seq.), the Subdivided Lands Act (\u00a7 11000 et seq.), and the Ellis Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060 et seq.). We begin our analysis with an overview of the relevant aspects of these statutory schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">A. <em>Unfair Competition Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The purpose of the UCL \u201cis to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.\u201d <em>(Kasky v. Nike, Inc. </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 939, 949 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>296, 45 P.3d 243].) Section 17200 defines unfair competition to \u201cmean and include \u2018any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by [the false advertising law (\u00a7 17500 et seq.)].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (27 Cal.4th at p. 949.) Because section 17200 is written in the disjunctive, a business act or practice need only meet one of the three criteria\u2014unlawful, unfair, <em>or </em>fraudulent\u2014to be considered unfair competition under the UCL. (\u00a7 17200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The \u201cunlawful\u201d act prong of the UCL embraces \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527] <em>(Cel-Tech).) </em>Thus, the UCL \u201cborrows\u201d violations of other laws and makes them independently actionable as unfair competitive practices. (20 Cal.4th at p. 180.) However, the law does more than just borrow. Under the \u201cunfairness\u201d prong of the UCL, \u201ca practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically proscribed by some other law.\u201d (20 Cal.4th at p. 180.) \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn other words, a practice is prohibited as \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018deceptive\u2019 even if not \u2018unlawful\u2019 and vice versa.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">B. <em>Subdivided Lands Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The subdivision of real property and the sale of subdivided property involve two separate statutory schemes. The subdivision of real property is regulated by the Subdivision Map Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66410 et seq.), which vests the power to regulate and control the design and physical improvements of a subdivision in the local governmental authority in which the property is located. <em>(California Coastal Com. v. Quanta Investment Corp. </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 579, 588 [170 Cal.Rptr. 263] <em>(California Coastal Com.).) </em>The sale of subdivided property is regulated by the Subdivided Lands Act (\u00a7 11000 et seq.), which is administered by the Real Estate Commissioner. <em>(California Coastal Com., supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d at p. 589.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The Subdivided Lands Act and the Subdivision Map Act define \u201csubdivision\u201d differently. (Compare Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11000 &amp; 11000.1 with Gov. Code, \u00a7 66424.) Under the Subdivided Lands Act, \u201csubdivided lands\u201d and \u201csubdivision\u201d include \u201cimproved or unimproved land or lands, a lot or lots, or a parcel or parcels, of any size, in which, for the purpose of sale or lease or financing, whether immediate or future, <em>five or more undivided interests are created or are proposed to be created.'\u2019\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(\u00a7 11000.1, subd. (a), italics added.) Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>fractional tenancy-in-common or joint tenancy interests created in the same parcel generally are considered subdivision interests under the Subdivided Lands Act. (9 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2001) \u00a7 25:6, p. 20 (Miller &amp; Starr).) Unlike the Subdivided Lands Act, the Subdivision Map Act does not include within its scope the creation of multiple \u201cundivided\u201d interests in property, except to the extent that such interests qualify as a \u201ccondominium project, \u201ca \u201ccommunity apartment project,\u201d or a \u201cstock cooperative.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">A \u201ccommunity apartment project\u201d is defined as \u201ca. development in which an undivided interest in land is coupled with the right of exclusive occupancy of any apartment located thereon.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1351, subd. ,(d).) While this definition appears to match the type of interest held by the owners here, the Francisco Street property is not a community apartment project because it lacks one critical feature of that form of ownership; Specifically, in a community apartment project the right to occupy an apartment to the exclusion of others must be specified in the deed. <em>(Adler v. Elphick </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 642, 647-648 [229 Cal.Rptr. 254].) A development in which an undivided interest in property is coupled with an exclusive right of occupancy in any apartment does not qualify as a community apartment project if an owner\u2019s exclusive occupancy right is specified by a separate agreement that is not contained or referenced in the grant deed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Because the owners\u2019 exclusive rights of occupancy here were created by an agreement not contained or referenced in the deed, the Francisco Street property does not constitute a community apartment project. As a consequence, the Subdivision Map Act is inapplicable. Although the tenants, do not suggest otherwise, we make the point for several reasons. First, it is important to clarify where the Francisco <em>Street </em>property fits within the various definitions of \u201csubdivision\u201d contained in the Subdivided Lands. Act and the Subdivision Map Act. Second, we can rule out violations of the Subdivision Map Act as a predicate for a UCL claim. In this connection, we note that the Subdivision Map Act affords tenants of an apartment building that is being converted to a community apartment project the right to receive various forms of notice from the subdivider, including notice that the subdivider has applied for a public report with the real estate commissioner and that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>report will be available upon the tenant\u2019s request. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66427.1.) A tenant is also entitled to a right of first refusal to purchase the unit in which the tenant resides. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) When the Subdivision Map Act is inapplicable, as here, tenants do not possess these same notice and first refusal rights. The Subdivided Lands Act contains no comparable provisions pertaining to tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Ind\u00e9ed, the Subdivided Lands Act is not intended to protect tenants but instead exists to protect purchasers of units in subdivisions from fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit. (See 9 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:2, p. 13.) \u201cThe purpose of the [Subdivided Lands Act] is to prevent fraud and misrepresentation in the marketing of parcels of land by requiring disclosure of the financial risks and benefits of a transaction to proposed purchasers, and lessees. [Citations.] To accomplish this, the Real Estate Commissioner issues public reports based on extensive disclosures made by the subdividers in connection with the parcels they offer for sale or lease. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California Coastal Com., supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d at p. 589; see also \u00a7\u00a7 11010-11018.1.) A subdivider may not sell or lease, or offer for sale or lease, any parcels in a subdivision without first obtaining a public report. (\u00a7 11018.2.) Any person who intends to offer subdivided lands for sale or lease must file an application for a public report with the Real Estate Commissioiier. (\u00a711010, subd. (a).) Violation of the Subdivided Lands Act is a crime. (\u00a7 11023.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The Subdivided Lands Act also requires any blanket lien or encumbrance on a subdivision to include a release clause so that purchasers of lots or parcels within the subdivision may obtain title to their lots or parcels free of the blanket lien upon compliance with the terms and conditions of their purchase - agreement. (\u00a7 11013.1.) A purchaser of a lot subject to a blanket encumbrance is subject to the risk of losing his or her interest as a result of a default by another lot owner subject to the same encumbrance. (9 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:37, p. 85.) When the blanket encumbrance does not contain an unconditional release clause, a subdivider may not sell or lease lots or parcels within a subdivision unless the subdivider complies with one of several specified conditions intended to protect purchasers from the effects of a default by an owner subject to the same blanket encumbrance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 11013.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">A subdivider must clearly disclose that a purchaser of a unit in an undivided-interest subdivision has the right to rescind the purchase offer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>any contract resulting from that offer prior to midnight of the third calendar day following execution of the purchase offer. (\u00a7 11000.2, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">A failure to comply with the Subdivided Lands Act does not render the sale of a subdivided interest void. Rather, in the event of noncompliance the purchase agreement is voidable at the option of the purchaser, who has the right to either affirm the agreement or declare it void and recover the sums paid less any allowable offsets. <em>(Drake v.

Superior Court </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 583, 589 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 205, 73 P.3d 1185].) The intent of the Ellis Act is to supersede the holding in <em>Nash </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 97 [207 Cal.Rptr. 285, 688 P.2d 894] <em>(Nash), </em>\u201cso as to permit landlords to go out of business.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060.7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In <em>Nash, </em>our Supreme Court rejected a due process challenge to a procedure requiring landlords to obtain a removal permit from the City of Santa Monica before they could withdraw rental units from the market. <em>(Nash, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 103.) In order to obtain a removal permit from the city, a landlord had to demonstrate that a fair return on investment could not be made if the unit were retained, that no low- or moderate-income persons would be displaced, and that removal of the units would not adversely affect the city\u2019s supply of housing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 100-101.) The dissent in <em>Nash </em>observed that the majority\u2019s holding \u201ccompelled] a landlord to remain in business against his will\u201d and gave the landlord \u201conly the alternative of a forced sale.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Ill (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">In response to <em>Nash, </em>the Legislature enacted the Ellis Act, which provides that no public entity shall by statute, ordinance, regulation, or other administrative action \u201ccompel the owner of any residential real property to offer, or to continue to offer, accommodations in the property for rent or lease . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060.) \u201cThe legislative history of the [Ellis] Act consistently demonstrates the purpose of the Act is to allow landlords who comply with its terms to go out of the residential rental business by evicting their tenants and withdrawing all units from the market, even if the landlords could make a fair return, the property is habitable, and the landlords <em>lack approval for future use of the land.\u2019'' (City of Santa Monica v. Yarmark </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 153, 165 [249 Cal.Rptr. 732], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>The right to withdraw residential property from the rental market is subject to certain other laws. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060.7.) Thus, for example, the Ellis Act is not intended to interfere with local authority over land use, including regulations governing the demolition and redevelopment of residential property, and regulations relating to the conversion of existing housing to condominium or other subdivided interests. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060.7, subds. (a), (b).) The Ellis Act does not override procedural protections intended to prevent abuse of the right to evict tenants (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060.7, subd. (c)), and it does not relieve any party to a lease of the duty to perform any obligation under the lease <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)). Further, the Ellis Act does not permit a landlord to withdraw from the rental market fewer than all of the accommodations in a building. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060.7, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Although local governments retain the right to regulate a property\u2019s use <em>after </em>its withdrawal from the rental market, a local government may not condition the landlord\u2019s right to go out of business on compliance with local land use regulations relating to the future use of the property. <em>(Javidzad </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 524, 530-532 [251 Cal.Rptr. 350].) \u201cWhat [a landlord] proposes to do with his property once he has gone out of the business of offering residential rental units has no bearing ... in determining [the landlord\u2019s] right to decide to go out of that business and to invoke the protection extended him for this purpose by the Ellis Act. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bullock </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1072, 1102 [271 Cal.Rptr. 44].)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">3. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Under prior law, any person acting on behalf of the general public could sue for relief under California\u2019s unfair competition law. (Former \u00a7 17204, as amended by Stats. 1993, ch. 926, \u00a7 2, p. 5198.) At the general election held on November 2, 2004, voters approved Proposition 64 and modified the UCL\u2019s standing requirement to provide that a private person has standing to sue only if he or she \u201chas suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.\u201d (\u00a7 17204, as amended by Prop. 64, \u00a7 3.) The amended standing provisions apply to cases already pending when Proposition 64 took effect. <em>(Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn\u2019s, LLC </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 227 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 57, 138 P.3d 207].)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">The owners contend the tenants have no standing under the UCL because any actual or threatened loss of money or property did not result from a violation of the Subdivided Lands Act. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>In order to have standing to sue under section 17204, it is not enough for a private person to have suffered an injury in fact. Nor is it enough to establish standing if one has lost money or property. After Proposition 64, a private person has standing to sue under the UCL only if that person has suffered injury <em>and </em>lost money or property <em>\u201cas a result of </em>such unfair competition.\u201d (\u00a7 17204, italics added.) Thus, a private person has no standing under .the UCL unless that person can establish that the injury suffered and the loss of property or money resulted from conduct that fits within one of the categories of \u201cunfair competition\u201d in section 17200.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Proposition 64\u2019s findings and declaration of purpose state: \u201cIt is the intent of the California voters in enacting this act to prohibit private attorneys from filing lawsuits for unfair competition where they have no client who has been injured in fact under the standing requirements of the United States Constitution.\u201d (Prop. 64, \u00a7 1, subd. (e).) \u201cTo prove standing under Article III [of the United States Constitution], a plaintiff must show (1) injury in fact, (2) a <em>causal connection </em>between the injury and the conduct complained of and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. [Citation.] As a general rule, a party may assert only his or her own rights and cannot raise claims on behalf of parties not before the court. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Get Outdoors II, LLC v. City of San Diego </em>(2005) 381 F.Supp.2d 1250, 1258, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Here, the unfair competition consists of an unlawful business practice\u2014the LLC owners\u2019 alleged violation of the Subdivided Lands Act. The tenants are not among the class of persons the Subdivided Lands Act was intended to protect, and they have suffered no harm as a result of any violation of its provisions. In effect, they are attempting to assert claims on behalf of parties not present before the court\u2014i.e., actual or potential purchasers of subdivided interests aggrieved by a violation of the Subdivided Lands Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The tenants\u2019 threatened loss of a property interest resulted from the owners\u2019 invocation of their right under the Ellis Act to recover possession of the Francisco Street property. As the trial court recognized, the Ellis Act evictions in and of themselves were lawful based on the evidence presented thus far.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the court went on to find that the' Ellis Act evictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>were \u201cpart and parcel\u201d and \u201cin furtherance\u201d of the \u201cunfair business practice.\u201d This finding, however, does not compel the conclusion the Ellis Act evictions were unlawful. An unlawful business practice is \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 180.) A lawful business activity is not transformed into an \u201cunlawful business practice\u201d simply because it has some relationship to an activity forbidden by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">When a UCL action is based on an unl\u00e1wful business practice, as here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a party may not premise its standing to sue upon injury caused by a defendant\u2019s lawful activity simply because the lawful activity has some connection to an unlawful practice that does not otherwise affect the party. In short, there must be a causal connection between the harm suffered and the unlawful business activity. That causal connection is broken when a complaining party would suffer the same harm whether or not a defendant complied with the law. Here, the lack of causation is illustrated by the fact the tenants would suffer the same injury regardless of whether the owners complied with or violated the Subdivided Lands Act. Indeed, even if the LLC owners fully complied with the trial court\u2019s injunction, the tenants would still face eviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">At oral argument, counsel for the tenants argued in effect that the tenants face eviction only because the owners choose to ignore the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Subdivided Lands Act. The premise of the argument appears to be that the owners lack the ability to comply with the Subdivided Lands Act. Thus, the argument goes, there would be no incentive to evict the tenants (or buy the building in the first place) if the owners were foreclosed from selling their interests in the building as a consequence of their inability to comply with the Subdivided Lands Act. A fundamental problem with this argument is that the trial court made no finding that the owners lack the ability to comply with the Subdivided Lands Act. To the contrary, the trial court found there is no impediment to a landlord complying with both the Ellis Act and the Subdivided Lands Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">To bolster their standing argument, the tenants rely, on a trio of cases addressing the scope of injunctive relief under the <em>UCL\u2014Hernandez </em>v. <em>Stabach </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 309 [193 Cal.Rptr. 350] <em>(Hernandez), Hewlett </em>v. <em>Squaw Valley Ski Corp. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 499 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 118] <em>(Hewlett), </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Murrison </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 349 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 68] <em>(Murrison). </em>These cases do not aid the tenants. Because <em>Hernandez, Hewlett, </em>and <em>Murrison </em>predate the voters\u2019 approval of Proposition 64, they obviously do not address the amended standing requirements added by that initiative measure. It is true the cases stand for the proposition that a court possesses broad power to fashion injunctive relief under the UCL, including the ability to restrict certain activities related to proven UCL violations. <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at pp. 313-315; <em>Hewlett, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at pp. 540-542; <em>Murrison, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 364-365.) However, these broad equitable powers do not afford standing to persons otherwise not entitled to sue under section 17204. Thus, for example, a party who has suffered no injury as a result of a UCL violation cannot create standing by arguing that a broad-based injunction designed to remedy the UCL violation will provide him or her some incidental benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Furthermore, allowing tenants to challenge Ellis Act evictions on the basis of violations of unrelated l\u00e1ws frustrates the purpose of the act, which is to permit landlords the right to go out of the rental business. Under the Ellis Act, no public entity, including the state, may take any legislative or administrative action compelling-a landlord to remain in the rental business. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060, subd. (a); see also Gov. Code, '\u00a7 8\u00cd1.2 [defining public entity].) Thus, it would be improper for the Department of Real Estate to adopt a regulation conditioning a landlord\u2019s right to exit the rental business upon compliance with the Subdivided Lands Act. Such a regulation would \u201cimpermissibly condition^ the landlord\u2019s right to go out of business on compliance with requirements not found in the [Ellis] Act.\u201d <em>(Javidzad v. City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d at p. 530.) Yet that is precisely what the tenants have done here. To permit such a result would allow private individuals to do in the guise of a UCL action what a public entity may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>do, i.e., preclude landlords from leaving the rental business until they satisfy conditions unrelated to the Ellis Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Accordingly, we conclude the Ellis Act evictions do not afford the tenants standing to challenge any alleged violations of the Subdivided Lands Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The order granting the injunction is reversed. The stay of further trial court proceedings is dissolved, and the order to show cause in case No. All 1947 is discharged. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Appellants in case No. A112134 and petitioners in case No. All 1947 shall recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Parrilli, J., and Poliak, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 3, 2007, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

As such, it is properly considered a permanent injunction. (See <em>Benasra v. Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 96, 110 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 644].) To avoid suggesting the trial court\u2019s order is a preliminary injunction, we have abstained from describing it as such in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">We observe that the characterization of injunctive relief as either preliminary or permanent may bear upon whether an order denying or granting that relief is appealable. (Compare <em>Department of Fish &amp; Game </em>v. <em>Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist. </em>(1999) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1560 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 222] [order denying <em>preliminary </em>injunction appealable] with <em>Bishop Creek Lodge </em>v. <em>Scira </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 631, 633 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 398] [interlocutory order denying <em>permanent </em>injunction not.appealable].) In assessing whether an order is appealable, the inquiry turns on the substance and effect of the order and not on what the parties have chosen to call it. (Cf. <em>Los Angeles Times v. Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1388 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 29].) Mindful that the order\u2019s proper characterization as a permanent injunction may raise a question about whether it is appealable (because it is an interlocutory order entered before a final judgment), we have satisfied ourselves that we possess jurisdiction to address the issues raised on appeal. (See <em>Guntert v. City of Stockton </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 203, 207-209 [117 Cal.Rptr. 601] [interlocutory order granting permanent injunction is appealable even though damages claims have yet to be tried].) In any event, even if there were a question about the order\u2019s appealability (see <em>Art Movers, Inc. v. Ni West, Inc. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 640, 650-651 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 689]), we would simply exercise our discretion to treat the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate and arrive at the same outcome <em>(Id. </em>at p. 651). Further, because we issued an order to show cause in a related writ proceeding (case No. A111947) raising the same issues as the appeal, we would have jurisdiction over this matter irrespective of the disposition of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The Ellis Act does not permit a landlord to withdraw from the rental market fewer than all of the accommodations in a building.

While it may be true the legality of the Ellis Act evictions has not been fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>adjudicated, the fact remains there is no evidence in the trial court record to suggest the owners violated the Ellis Act in any respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">The tenants agree the UCL cause of action and the injunction are based on the \u201cunlawful\u201d prong of the UCL, not the \u201cunfairness\u201d prong. Nevertheless, the tenants elsewhere have sought to conflate the \u201cunfairness\u201d prong of the UCL with the \u201cunlawful\u201d prong, arguing that we are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings as to what constitutes an \u201cunfair\u201d business practice to the extent the findings are supported by substantial evidence. What constitutes an <em>unfair </em>or <em>fraudulent </em>business practice is a question of fact, with the \u201c \u2018essential test being whether the public is likely to be deceived.....\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McKale </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 626, 635 [159 Cal.Rptr. 811, 602 P.2d 731].) That test is inapplicable here, where the question is whether the owners engaged in an <em>unlawful </em>business practice. The trial court\u2019s finding that the Ellis Act evictions were \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a business practice that included some allegedly unlawful activities does not support the conclusion the evictions were themselves unlawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\">The injunction does not absolutely forbid the Ellis Act evictions. Rather, the injunction merely prevents the LLC owners from recovering possession of the Francisco Street property pursuant to the Ellis Act until they have either obtained a preliminary public report or secured an exemption from the Subdivided Lands Act. In a petition for rehearing, the tenants claim they have standing under the UCL even though compliance with the injunction would not prevent them from being evicted. They reason one can infer the tenants\u2019 eviction would have been delayed if the owners had to comply with the Subdivided Lands Act. According to the tenants, if compliance with the law would delay their evictions by even one month, they have standing under the UCL. We are unpersuaded. First, they waived this argument (which is necesssarily fact based and not purely an issue of law) by not raising it earlier. (See <em>Gonz\u00e1lez </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(2004). 122 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 381].) Second, the trial court made no finding that the timing of the tenants\u2019 evictions depended on whether the owners complied with the Subdivided Lands Act. In short, the tenants\u2019 argument comes too late and is too insubstantial to afford standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\">We do not suggest the Ellis Act supersedes the UCL. Government Code section 7060.1, subdivision (d) provides that the Ellis Act does not supersede a number of other statutory schemes, including the UCL. Our Supreme Court has interpreted the language of subdivision (d) of section 7060.1 to mean the Ellis Act is to be harmonized and construed together with the other statutory schemes identified in that section. (See <em>Drouet v. Superior Court, </em>supra, 31 Cal.4th at pp. 593-594.) It is beyond the scope of this opinion to identify circumstances in which a party may appropriately challenge an Ellis Act eviction in a UCL action. Suffice it to say that nothing prevents a party from seeking relief under the UCL in an appropriate case when the eviction itself is unlawful, such as when the landlord\u2019s invocation of the Ellis Act is used as a pretext to discriminate unlawfully against a tenant and there is no bona fide intent to withdraw the property from the rental market. (Cf. <em>Drouet </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>at pp. 599-600 [statutory defense of retaliatory eviction unavailing provided landlord has a bona fide intent to withdraw property from rental market].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Because we conclude the tenants lack standing to sue under the UCL, we need not address any of the parties\u2019 remaining arguments, including whether the LLC owners have violated the Subdivided Lands Act to the extent it may apply under the circumstances presented here. In this connection, we note that the LLC owners sought judicial notice of a Department of Real Estate guide concerning the public report application process, ostensibly to demonstrate they were not required to apply for a public report before evicting the tenants. In light of our holding that the tenants lack standing, the request is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
