Shannon, sought records from petitioner the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) relating to a school construction project. When LAUSD refused to release the records, the trial court issued an. order compelling the production of documents under the California Public Records Act (CPRA or the Act). (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this petition for extraordinary relief, LAUSD seeks an order to stay the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">LAUSD contends that neither the City nor City Attorney Shannon is entitled to request the public documents because they are not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of the CPRA (\u00a7 6252). Thus, we are called upon to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>address an issue left unresolved by the Supreme Court, \u201cwhether a public agency is authorized to .. . seek disclosure of public records in the possession of another public agency.\u201d <em>(Filarsky </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 419, 431 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 49 P.3d 194].)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">We hold that the City and City Attorney Shannon may obtain public records from LAUSD. We deny the request for extraordinary relief and affirm the order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The City is a municipal corporation. Shannon is the duly elected city attorney and an officer of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">LAUSD wants to build a public high school on approximately 14 acres within the City at its western boundary, even though the proposed school will serve students residing in the City of Carson. The property currently is used for industrial purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Because the City expects that the school will have an impact on traffic, fire, and police services in its neighborhoods, City Attorney Shannon requested by letter dated January 26, 2006, copies of certain public records relating to the construction project. The request cited the CPRA and asked for the production of 40 categories of documents, including all correspondence between LAUSD and appointed and elected officials of the City of Carson relating to site selection, location, and construction of the proposed high school, as well as copies of all projected busing patterns and busing studies related to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">On February 7, 2006, LAUSD acknowledged that the records being sought were public records under the CPRA, but refused to produce them stating, \u201cwe are unable to make those records available because this request is . . . from a government agency, as opposed to a member of the public . . . .\u201d LAUSD asserted that the CPRA did not confer local agencies or their officers (such as City Attorney Shannon) the right to inspect public records as they were not \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201cmembers of the public\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">On February 15, 2006, City Attorney Shannon responded by letter to LAUSD stating, \u201cYour analysis of LAUSD\u2019s legal duty under the [CPRA] is incorrect.... [f] ...[][] \u2018. . . [A]ccess to information concerning the conduct of the people\u2019s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>in this state.\u2019 \u201d City Attorney Shannon asserted that the City was entitled to the documents because it was a municipal corporation, and \u201ccorporations\u201d were \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to receive documents pursuant to [CPRA\u2019s] section 6252, subdivision (c). Additionally, City Attorney Shannon stated he was entitled to the documents pursuant to section 6252.5 as \u201can elected official who is attempting to carry out his duties as a representative of the City Council, City Management and the citizens of the City . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">On April 6, 2006, the City filed a verified petition in the Superior Court for access to public records, seeking an order to direct LAUSD to turn over the requested documents. (\u00a7 6258; see, <em>post, </em>fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Following a hearing, the trial court granted the petition and directed LAUSD to produce the requested documents. Thereafter, the trial court apparently ruled on the City\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs and entered an August 11, 2006, \u201cjudgment granting petition for access to public records\u201d against LAUSD. We construe the \u201cjudgment\u201d as an order directing the disclosure of public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">LAUSD has filed a petition in this court for extraordinary relief requesting a stay of the August 11, 2006, order directing production of the public records. (\u00a7 6259, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We stayed enforcement of the \u201cjudgment\u201d and issued an order to show cause directing the parties to appear for argument on the issues raised in the petition. The City and City Attorney Shannon1 have filed an opposition and LAUSD has filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The only issue before us is whether the City and City Attorney Shannon have standing to request public records from LAUSD. The resolution of this issue turns on whether the City or City Attorney Shannon is entitled to inspect LAUSD\u2019s records under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">1. <em>The California Public Records Act (CPRA).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">\u201cImplicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions.

[Citation.] We begin with the language of the statute, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] The language must be construed \u2018in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme, and we give \u201csignificance to every word, phrase, sentence, and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] In other words, \u2018 \u201cwe do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u2018with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] If the' statutory terms are ambiguous, we may examine extrinsic sources, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. [Citation.] In such circumstances, we choose the construction that comports most closely with the Legislature\u2019s apparent intent, endeavoring to promote rather than defeat the statute\u2019s general purpose, and avoiding a construction that would lead to absurd consequences. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Smith v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 77, 83 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 394, 137 P.3d 218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">2. <em>The City is entitled to the public records.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">LAUSD. admits the documents requested are public records subject to disclosure and there is no exception precluding disclosure. LAUSD also admits it is a public agency from which public records can be sought. LAUSD contends, however, that neither the City, which is a municipal corporation, nor City Attorney Shannon, who is an elected officer, has a right to access LAUSD\u2019s public records because they are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">LAUSD\u2019s argument is primarily focused on a strict examination of the statutory language. LAUSD argues as follows: (1) Section 6253 grants \u201cevery person\u201d the right to inspect public records; (2) \u201cperson\u201d is defined in section 6252, subdivision (c) to include \u201cany natural person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm, or association\u201d; (3) this definition of \u201cperson\u201d does not include a \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d or an \u201celected officer\u201d; (4) the words used in section 6252 to define a \u201cperson\u201d are most commonly associated with private individuals and entities; and (5) only \u201cpersons\u201d are entitled to request records and not local agencies nor elected officials. Thus, neither the City nor City Attorney Shannon is entitled to the public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We first address the City\u2019s standing to request the public. records from LAUSD. Thereafter, we address City Attorney Shannon\u2019s standing to request the records and LAUSD\u2019s argument that he is not a \u201cmember of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">With regard to the City, LAUSD makes the following additional points: Had the Legislature intended to include a \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d in section 6252, subdivision (c)\u2019s definition of \u201cperson\u201d it would have done so, as the Legislature did in defining \u201clocal agency\u201d in subdivisions (a), (d), and (f) of section 6252 and as it has done in a number of other statutes. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1633.2; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 676.1; Corp. Code, \u00a7 18030.) The specific enumeration of governmental entities in one part of the statute, but not in another, weighs heavily against a conclusion that the Legislature intended to include such entities in the definition of \u201cpersons.\u201d <em>(Wells </em>v. <em>One2One Learning Foundation </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 1164, 1190 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 108, 141 P.3d 225] <em>(Wells).) </em>\u201cIn other contexts, the Legislature has demonstrated that similar definitions of \u2018persons\u2019 do not include public entities, and . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>legislators know how to include such entities directly when they intend to do so.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citing among others, the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in Fair Employment and Housing Act, \u00a7 12925, subd. (d).) \u201cA traditional rule of statutory construction is that, absent express words to the contrary, governmental agencies are not included within the general words of a statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wells, </em>supra, at p. 1192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Many of LAUSD\u2019s arguments involve maxims of statutory construction which are helpful in understanding the meaning of statutes when the legislative intent is unclear. However, they cannot override \u201cpositive indicia of a contrary legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Wells, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 1193.) To decipher a statute, we must not only examine its language, but also its structure and history. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We begin by recognizing that there is an exception to the traditional rule of statutory construction that absent express words to the contrary, governmental agencies are not included within the general words of a statute. That exception is: \u201c[G]ovemment agencies are excluded from the operation of general statutory provisions \u2018only if their inclusion would result in an infringement upon sovereign governmental powers. . . . Pursuant to this principle, governmental agencies have been, held subject to legislation which, by its terms, applies simply to any \u201cperson.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wells, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 1192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">For example, in <em>State of California v. Marin Mun. W. Dist. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 699 [111 P.2d 651], a Streets and Highways Code provision defined \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201c \u2018any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, organization, or business trust\u2019 \u201d and did <em>not </em>expressly include any governmental entities. However, a cofinty was held subject to the statute and thus, the Department of Public Works was entitled to order the \u201ccounty\u201d as a \u201cperson\u201d to move its pipeline as necessary for public safety or highway improvement. (17 Cal.2d at p. 704.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Thus, even though governmental agencies are not expressly included in section 6252, subdivision (c)\u2019s definition of a \u201cperson,\u201d the City is to be included in that definition unless to do so would infringe upon sovereign powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">LAUSD contends the City, as.a governmental agency, is not to be included in the definition of \u201cperson,\u201d and thus may not seek LAUSD\u2019s public records because to do so would infringe \u201cupon one of the state\u2019s most basic sovereign powers, public education.\u201d LAUSD suggests mandating it to disclose documents would unnecessarily divert funds away from its core educational function. This contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>As LAUSD acknowledges, it is mandated by section 6253 to make open for inspection and to copy public records upon the payment of fees to cover duplication costs, or a statutory fee, if applicable, unless it is impracticable to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, LAUSD suggests there are additional costs that divert funds from its core purpose of education when there is a disclosure request. LAUSD notes that in fulfilling a disclosure request under the Act, it incurs expenditures in addition to the copying charges it will have to bear. These include nonreimbursable indirect costs in producing documents <em>(North County Parents Organization v. Department of Education </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 144, 146-148 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 359]), attorney fees in responding to petitions seeking documents (\u00a7 6259, subd. (d); <em>Rogers v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 469, 484 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 412] [award of costs to public agency under CPRA limited to actions where request is frivolous]), and potentially the payment of the requesting party\u2019s attorney fees if the court orders disclosure (\u00a7 6259, subd. (d); <em>Motorola Communication &amp; Electronics, Inc. v. Department of General Services </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1340, 1343 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 477]). However, the nonreimbursable indirect costs are not significant in light of LAUSD\u2019s constitutionally mandated governmental function to disclose public records. We perceive no infringement upon LAUSD\u2019s sovereign governmental powers to include municipal corporations, such as the City, into the definition of \u201cpersons\u201d in section 6252.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Additionally, we cannot ignore the fact that if LAUSD incurs expenses in complying with the City\u2019s request for public documents, such expenses are necessitated only because the City must fulfill its own sovereign purpose. The City believes a proposed LAUSD project may have a dramatic impact on the City\u2019s citizens, traffic, and fire and police services in its surrounding neighborhoods. In order to assess th\u00e1t impact and whether the City should take other protective measures, the City must be able to evaluate LAUSD\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Further, the ultimate purpose of the CPRA is to encourage full disclosure and openness in governmental affairs. Thus, one governmental entity should not hesitate to provide public records to another governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Our conclusion that the City is a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to request documents from another governmental entity is the only rational and reasonable interpretation of the statute. \u201cWhere more than one statutory construction is arguably possible, our \u2018policy has long been to favor the construction that leads to the more reasonable result. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Webster </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 338, 343 [250 Cal.Rptr. 268, 758 P.2d 596].) This policy derives largely from the presumption that the Legislature intends reasonable results consistent with its apparent purpose. [Citation.] [0]ur task is to select the construction that comports most closely with the Legislature\u2019s apparent intent, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes\u2019 general purpose, and to avoid a construction that would lead to unreasonable, impractical, or arbitrary results. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Copley Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 1272, 1291 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 183, 141 P.3d 288].)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">We acknowledge that the statutory scheme is not a model of clarity, when applied to the factual situation before us. However, an absurd result would follow if we were to strictly construe sections 6252 and 6253 to preclude the City from obtaining documents from LAUSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The following illustrates this absurdity: The hypothetical John Doe and Mary Doe residing in the City are considered \u201cnatural persons\u201d pursuant to section 6252, subdivision (c). They can send a letter to LAUSD and request the same public documents, that have been described by City Attorney Shannon in his January 26, 2006, letter. City Attorney Shannon\u2019s mother, father, sister, and brother also are. \u201cnatural persons\u201d pursuant to section 6252, subdivision (c) and thus, have a right to seek public records from LAUSD. In that LAUSD concedes that the records requested are public, LAUSD will have to comply with the requests from , John Doe and Mary Doe, as well as the requests of members of the hypothetical Shannon family. Once LAUSD provides the records, these persons can simply walk down the street to the office of any representative of the City, including City Attorney Shannon\u2019s office, and drop the items on a desk.

Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1338.) We come to an absurd result and ignore the CPRA\u2019s \u201cstrong policy in favor of disclosure of public records\u201d <em>(Bakersfield City School Dist. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 1045; see <em>Williams v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 346 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 882, 852 P.2d 377]) if we conclude that all natural persons, including all City of Long Beach residents and all City Attorney Shannon\u2019s family members, are entitled to access the public records in LAUSD\u2019s possession, but the City, who is charged with conducting the City\u2019s business, is not entitled to the very same records.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>LAUSD\u2019s construction of the CPRA\u2019s statutory scheme results in prohibiting one governmental entity from obtaining public records from another governmental entity is unduly restrictive. To construe the Act in the manner articulated by LAUSD ignores its purpose of providing openness in governmental affairs <em>(BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.4th at p. 750), and contravenes the CPRA\u2019s purpose to provide \u201c[m]aximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations\u201d <em>(CBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 651-652) and to hold government agencies accountable by verifying their actions. <em>(BRV, Inc. v.

Superior Court, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 1291-1292.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Thus, in defining \u201cpersons,\u201d the Legislature did not intend to exclude municipal corporations such as the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">3. <em>City Attorney Shannon is entitled to the records.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">City Attorney Shannon also is entitled to access the records under the CPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">As stated above, LAUSD contends that because the definition of \u201cperson\u201d does not include an \u201celected officer,\u201d City Attorney Shannon is not entitled to the documents. LAUSD argues that City Attorney Shannon is not a \u201cmember of the public\u201d because section 6252, subdivision (b) specifically exempts officers of local agencies and because section 6259, subdivision (a) permits disclosure only if the \u201crecords [were] being improperly withheld from a member of the public . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">As quoted above, section 6252.5 provides that \u201cNotwithstanding the definition of \u2018member of the public\u2019 in Section 6252, an elected member or officer of any state or local agency is entitled to access to public records of <em>that </em>agency on the same basis as any other person. Nothing in this section shall limit the ability of elected members or officers to access public records permitted by law in the administration of their duties. [][] This section does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, existing law.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Focusing on the word \u201cthat\u201d in the first sentence of section 6252.5, LAUSD contends elected members or officers are only entitled to records of their <em>own </em>agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">To support this analysis, LAUSD points to the legislative history of CPRA\u2019s section 6252.5, which was part of a Senate bill designed to amend the CPRA to require state and local agencies to provide electronic files. (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 143 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) Digest, Aug. 19, 1998.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Senate Floor Analysis.) The bill also amended or added other sections within the Act, including adding section 6252.5. The legislative history of section 6252.5 available to us is scant. Some documents, as noted by LAUSD, state that the bill was intended to assure that \u201can elected member or officer of any state or local agency is entitled to access to public records of <em>that </em>agency on the same basis as any other person, and states this is declaratory of existing law.\u201d (Sen. Floor Analysis, <em>supra, </em>at p. 4, italics added; Sen. Rules Com., 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 143 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 5, 1998.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The proposed change had been originally introduced in a prior bill that, was vetoed by Governor Wilson for other reasons. (See Governor\u2019s veto message to Sen. on Sen. Bill No. 143 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) Oct. 12, 1997.) A Senate Judiciary analysis of the vetoed bill stated that the definition of \u201cmember of the public\u201d had \u201cbeen used as a basis for withholding public records from elected officials\u201d and section 6252.5 would clarify the law by ensuring \u201cthat an elected member or officer of any [public] agency\u201d has \u201cthe same access rights to public records\u201d of that agency \u201cas any other person.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 74 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 11, 1997.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">However, other documents in the legislative history of Senate Bill No. 143 do not include any limitations and do not suggest the new statute was designed <em>only </em>to enable public officials to obtain documents from their <em>own </em>agencies. For example, one analysis of the bill states that section 6252.5 \u201c[clarifies that public officials are entitled to access public records on the same basis as any other person.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Jiidiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 143 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) June 30, 1998, p. 1.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Another analysis indicates that the bill \u201cwould provide that, notwithstanding [the definition of \u2018member of the public\u2019], an elected official of any state agency is a \u2018member of the public\u2019 entitled to access to public records. It would provide that this section is declaratory of existing law.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 143 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) Jan. 26, 1998, p. 2.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of the sparse legislative history available to us and the conflict in the history on the crucial point, we cannot conclude, as urged by LAUSD, that section 6252.5 was designed to enable elected members or officers to access only public records from their <em>own </em>agencies. Stated differently, we have found nothing in the legislative history of section 6252.5 suggesting that the Legislature intended to prevent one governmental agency from obtaining public records of another governmental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Additionally, contrary to LAUSD\u2019s position, the content of section 6252.5 supports City Attorney Shannon\u2019s position that he is entitled to the requested public records. The first sentence in section 6252.5 specifically authorizes this result. It states, \u201cNotwithstanding the definition of \u2018member of the public\u2019 in Section 6252, an elected member or officer of any state or local agency <em>is </em>entitled to access to public records of that agency <em>on the same basis as any other person.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The second sentence of section 6252.5 contains no restrictions. It does not limit, as LAUSD urges, access by an elected member or officer to the records of his or her own agency. Rather, it appears to be a broad grant of authority as it states that \u201cNothing in this section shall limit the ability of elected members or officers to access public records permitted by law in the administration of their duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">.  Thus, a reasonable inteipretation of section 6252.5 is that the Legislature did not intend to draw a distinction between records of an officer\u2019s own agency and those from another agency. Section 6252.5 does not limit public officials access to the records of their own agency. Thus, City Attorney Shannon is a \u201cmember of the public\u201d entitled to access to public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We must also examine if City Attorney Shannon. is a \u201cnatural person\u201d pursuant to section 6252. Like all other \u201cnatural persons\u201d in that section, City Attorney Shannon is entitled to access public records. His status as a natural person is not extinguished because he is also an officer of the City.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As illustrated above, City Attorney Shannon , can ask his mother, father, sister, brother, or any John Q. Public to obtain for him LAUSD\u2019s public records. It makes no sense to have City Attorney Shannon obtain the records in that fashion as the law does not countenance such subterfuge.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>City Attorney Shannon is entitled to request public records in possession of LAUSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">4. <em>Two recent cases do not alter our result.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">LAUSD points to two recent Supreme Court cases to argue it was not required to release the requested documents. These two cases, <em>Wells, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 1164, and <em>State ex rel. Harris v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 1220 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 144, 141 P.3d 256] <em>(Harris), </em>addressed the meaning of \u201cperson\u201d in California\u2019s False Claims Act (CFCA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12650 et seq.), providing that any \u201cperson\u201d who knowingly presents a false claim for payment or approval is liable to the public agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In <em>Wells, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 1164, the issue was whether a lawsuit could be brought against charter schools under the CFCA and the unfair competition law (UCL) for breach of contract and misrepresentation. Among other holdings, <em>Wells </em>held (1) a public school district is not a \u201cperson,\u201d as defined in the CFCA (\u00a7 12650 et seq.), and may not be sued under the terms of the CFCA; but (2) charter schools, and the individuals, corporations, entities, or organizations that operate them <em>are </em>\u201cpersons\u201d subject to suit under the CFCA and UCL (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) and are not exempt from either law merely because they are deemed part of the public school system. <em>(Wells, supra, </em>at p. 1179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\"><em>Wells, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 1164, noted that the \u201clanguage, structure, and [legislative] history\u201d of the CFCA provided \u201cpositive indicia\u201d to \u201cstrongly suggest\u201d that public entities, including school districts were not \u201cpersons\u201d within the CFCA\u2019s definition. The legislative history demonstrated an intent to excise governmental entities from the category of person who may be sued. (39 Cal.4th at p. 1193.) <em>Wells </em>exempted public school districts from suit under the CFCA based on a rationale that allowing such suits would undermine their sovereign powers by impeding their fiscal ability to carry out their core mission. (39 Cal.4th at pp. 1193-1197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In <em>Harris, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 1220, the City and County of San Francisco, represented by its district attorney and city attorney, filed an action to recover funds from a business on behalf of the State of California. The court noted that subdivision (c)(2) of section 12652 specially described a CFCA action as an action \u201c \u2018filed by a private person\u2019 \u201d <em>(Harris, supra:, </em>at p. 1230, italics omitted) and concluded a public entity is not a \u201cperson\u201d who may bring a qui tarn action upon a false claim involving, not its own funds, but funds of another public agency. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Both <em>Wells </em>and <em>Harris </em>noted that the limited evidence from the legislative history suggested public entities were not intended to be \u201cpersons\u201d within the statute. <em>(Wells, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 1191; <em>Harris, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 1230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">LAUSD points to the analysis used in <em>Wells </em>and <em>Harris, </em>notes that the definition of \u201cperson in the CFCA (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12650, subd. (b)(5) [\u2018 \u201cPerson\u201d includes any natural person, corporation, firm, association, organization, partnership, limited liability company, business, or trust.\u2019 \u201d]) is almost identical to the definition in section 6252, subdivision (c), states that the two definitions are both in the Government Code, and urges that the results must be the same, i.e., that a governmental agency is not a \u201cperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In analyzing the CPRA, we have followed the analytical approach in <em>Wells </em>and <em>Harris. </em>Our results are different because the subject matter and public policies are different. (Cf. <em>Kibler v. Northern Inyo County Local Hospital Dist. </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 192, 201 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 41, 138 P.3d 193] [statutory construction rule that identical statutory language should be interpreted the same way applies only when statutes in question cover same or analogous subject matter].) And we must give a realistic interpretation of the CPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The CFCA \u201cis designed to supplement governmental efforts to identify and prosecute fraudulent claims made against state and local governmental entities by authorizing private parties (referred to as qui tarns or relators) to bring suit on behalf of the government. [Citation]. The ultimate purpose of the [CFCA] is to protect the public fisc. <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (City of Hawthorne ex rel. Wohlner </em>v. <em>H&amp;C Disposal Co. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1668, 1677 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 312].) The conclusions in <em>Wells </em>and <em>Harris </em>are consistent with that purpose. Thus, as stated above, <em>Wells </em>has held that public school .districts cannot be sued under the CFCA because the result contravenes the purpose of the statute and impedes, rather than protects, their fisc. <em>(Wells, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 1193-1197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In contrast, the purpose of the CPRA is to have openness in government and to enable full disclosure of public records. This policy is enshrined in the Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 3, subd. (b).) To fulfill that purpose, governmental entities must have access to the public- records of other agencies. LAUSD offers no. public policy sufficiently strong to justify precluding one governmental agency from obtaining the public records maintained by another.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The request for a writ is denied.
