Applying recent California Supreme Court precedent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we now reverse the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">The petitioner here is Marco A. Rondon (Rondon), holder of an on-sale beer and wine license for his business, Andiamo Pizza &amp; Cafe. Respondents are the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (the Department), which revoked petitioner\u2019s license, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (the Board), which affirmed the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">\n<em>Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">In July 2004, the Department filed an accusation against Rondon, seeking revocation of his license based on several allegations, including his 2002 conviction by plea for misdemeanor theft, which the Department deemed an offense involving moral turpitude. In November 2004, the Department filed an amended accusation with a single count, asserting Rondon\u2019s 2002 theft conviction as evincing moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">In January 2005, an adjudicatory administrative hearing on the accusation was conducted by an administrative law judge (ALJ). In February 2005, the ALJ issued a proposed decision, finding that Rondon\u2019s 2002 conviction involved moral turpitude and thus constituted grounds for discipline. (See Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 24200, subd. (d).) The ALJ concurred in the Department\u2019s recommendation for outright revocation of the license. He nevertheless concluded that less severe punishment might be warranted by evidence of rehabilitation, which Rondon failed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">In March 2005, the Department adopted the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision, certifying that decision as its own. It thus revoked Rondon\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">In April 2005, Rondon appealed the Department\u2019s decision to the Board. Among other things, he asserted that the Department violated his due process rights based on ex parte communication between the Department\u2019s prosecuting attorney and its decision maker. The challenged ex parte communication was a \u201cReport of Hearing,\u201d which Rondon claims was provided by the prosecuting attorney after the hearing but before the Department issued its certified decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>In May 2006, the Board filed its decision in Rondon\u2019s administrative appeal, affirming the Department\u2019s license revocation decision. Although the Board acknowledged\u2014as a general principle\u2014that a due process violation results when the Department\u2019s prosecuting attorney communicates ex parte with its decision maker, the Board found against petitioner in this particular case, since the Department adopted the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision without additions or changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">\n<em>Judicial Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Rondon promptly sought judicial review by direct petition to the California Supreme Court. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23090.) He also sought a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">In June 2006, the high court transferred Rondon\u2019s petition for writ of review to us. We issued a temporary stay. We also invited opposition from respondents, with-an opportunity for petitioner to reply. Both sides submitted letter briefs. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">In August 2006, we issued a writ ordering the Board to certify and return to this court any additional materials in the administrative record not contained in Rondon\u2019s petition. The Board submitted a certified record on appeal. As permitted by our order issuing the writ of review, the Department submitted a formal written return, which it called a \u201csupplemental brief.\u201d Rondon did not submit any further reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">Oral argument in this matter was scheduled for April 19, 2007. On April 17th, the Department submitted a document entitled \u201cNotice of Withdrawal of Opposition to Petition for Writ of Mandate.\u201d In an accompanying letter, the Department informed us that it would \u201cdismiss its disciplinary action against Mr. Rondon, which is the basis for the Petition for Writ of Mandate.\u201d The Department\u2019s letter also advised us that it was withdrawing both its request for sanctions and its request for oral argument. We agreed only to take the matter off the oral argument calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">Rejecting the Department\u2019s belated request to withdraw its opposition to Rondon\u2019s petition, we shall reach the merits of the controversy. (Cf. <em>Tuchscher Development Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego Unified Port Dist. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1227, fn. 2 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 57] [court is \u201cnot required to dismiss the appeal on stipulation at this stage\u201d].) Having considered the parties\u2019 written submissions and pertinent legal authority, we now reverse the Department\u2019s decision to revoke Rondon\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">We begin by describing the nature and function of the Department and the Board. Next, we summarize the legal principles that inform our analysis. Finally, we apply those principles to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">I. <em>The Agencies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Both the Department and the Board are \u201cconstitutional agencies upon which limited judicial powers have been conferred.\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Munro </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 67, 73 [2 Cal.Rptr. 737]; see also <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 238, 241-242 [340 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">A. <em>The Department</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">The Department \u201chas exclusive licensing authority over entities that sell alcoholic beverages.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 4; see Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.) Thus, by constitutional provision, it is within the Department\u2019s authority \u201cto deny, suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverages license if it shall determine for good cause that the granting or continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare or morals, or that a person seeking or holding a license has violated any law prohibiting conduct involving moral turpitude.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.) Pursuant to a complementary statute, \u201cgrounds that constitute a basis for the suspension or revocation of licenses\u201d include a \u201cplea, verdict, or judgment of guilty, or the plea of nolo contendere to any public offense involving moral turpitude....\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 24200, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">B. <em>The Board</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">The Board has administrative appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Department: \u201cWhen any person aggrieved thereby appeals from a decision of the department ordering any penalty assessment, issuing, denying, transferring, suspending or revoking any license for the manufacture, importation, or sale of alcoholic beverages, the board shall review the decision subject to such limitations as may be imposed by the Legislature.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.) \u201cIn such cases, the board shall not receive evidence in addition to that considered by the department. Review by the board of a decision of the department shall be limited to the questions whether the department has proceeded without or in excess of its jurisdiction, whether the department has proceeded in the manner required by law, whether the decision is supported by the findings, and whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>II. <em>Administrative Hearing Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">When the Department initiates license revocation or other discipline by accusation, the proceedings are governed by California\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (APA). (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25750; see Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11340-11529 [codifying the APA].) \u201cThe APA covers both (1) administrative regulations and rulemaking ([Gov. Code,] \u00a7\u00a7 11340-11357), and (2) administrative adjudications ([Gov. Code,] \u00a7\u00a7 11400-11529).\u201d <em>(California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 589 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 514].) Only the latter is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">A. <em>Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">In proceedings conducted under the APA, \u201can ALJ may hear a contested case.\u201d <em>(Automotive Management Group, Inc. v. New Motor Vehicle Bd. </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1002, 1013 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 904], citing Gov. Code, \u00a7 11517, subd. (b).) As an alternate to using an administrative law judge, the Department may appoint its \u201cagency head, member of the agency head, hearing officer, or other person [to] preside[] in an adjudicative proceeding.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11405.80 [defining \u201cpresiding officer\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">The ALJ or other presiding officer conducts \u201can evidentiary hearing at which a Department prosecutor makes the Department\u2019s case\u201d against the licensee. <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 5.) By statute, within 30 days after the case is submitted, the presiding officer must prepare \u201c \u2018a proposed decision in such form that it may be adopted as the decision in the case. The agency itself may adopt the proposed decision in its entirety, or may reduce the proposed penalty and adopt the balance of the proposed decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Automotive Management Group, Inc. v. New Motor Vehicle Bd., supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 1013; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 11517, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">B. <em>Administrative Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">After the ALJ or other presiding officer issues a proposed decision, there is \u201ca second level of decisionmaking in which the Department\u2019s director or a delegee decides whether to adopt the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 5.) Alternatively, the Department may modify the decision, \u201creject it and remand for a new hearing, or reject it and decide the case on the record.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 6, citing Gov. Code, \u00a7 11517, subd. (c)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>The final decision by the Department is then \u201csubject to administrative review by the Board.\u201d <em>(Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1071 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 278] <em>(Deleuze), </em>citing Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23084.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">C. <em>Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">\u201cAfter the Board has issued a final order, the Department\u2019s decision is also subject to judicial review in the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal.\u201d <em>(Deleuze, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 1071, citing Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23090.2.) The procedural vehicle by which review is obtained is a petition for writ of review, which may be brought in the Supreme Court or in the courts of appeal. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23090.) The writ of review is also called certiorari. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1067.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">1. <em>Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">\u201cThe scope of review of both the Board and the courts is a narrow one.\u201d <em>(Delueze, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 1071; see Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23084.) As relevant here, \u201cwe confine our review to the question whether the Department \u2018has proceeded in the manner required by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 7.) \u201cWe evaluate the decision of the Department in light of the jurisdiction of the Department and the legislative purposes of the Act.\u201d <em>(Delueze, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 1072.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">2. <em>Standards of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Generally speaking, the Department\u2019s decision to revoke a liquor license is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. The Department has \u201cbroad discretion to revoke or suspend liquor licenses \u2018for good cause\u2019 if continuing the license would be \u2018contrary to public welfare or morals.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.) In the absence of a clear abuse of discretion, the courts will uphold the Department\u2019s decision to suspend a license for violation of the liquor laws.\u201d <em>(Provigo Corp. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 561, 566 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 638, 869 P.2d 1163].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">In contrast to the deference typically accorded Department decisions, some situations call for de novo review. As relevant here: \u201cThe ultimate determination whether an administrative proceeding was fundamentally fair is a question of law to be decided on appeal.\u201d <em>(Southern Cal. Underground Contractors, Inc. v. City of San Diego </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 533, 542 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>III. <em>Procedural Protections</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The Department is required to \u201cproceed[] in the manner required by law.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23084, subd. (b).) That requirement implicates general due process rights as well as specific statutory protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">A. <em>Due Process. Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">\u201cThe protections of procedural due process apply to administrative proceedings [citation]; the question is simply what process is due in a given circumstance.\u201d <em>(Nightlife Partners, Ltd. v. City of Beverly Hills </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 81, 90 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 234].) Thus, due process is a flexible concept that requires protections appropriate to the particular situation. <em>(Civil Service Assn. v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 552, 561 [150 Cal.Rptr. 129, 586 P.2d 162].) \u201cWhile the state\u2019s administrative agencies have considerable leeway in how they structure their adjudicatory functions, they may not disregard certain basic precepts.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">B. <em>Statutory Protections</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">The APA contains its own \u201cAdministrative Adjudication Bill of Rights.\u201d (Gov. Code, tit. 2, div. 3, pt. 1, ch. 4.5, art. 6; see 2 Cal.Jur.3d (2007) Administrative Law, \u00a7 424.) \u201cThe administrative adjudication bill of rights provisions of the APA apply to Department license suspension hearings.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 15.) Among the statutory protections are: (1) separation of adjudicative and prosecutorial functions, and (2) restrictions on ex parte communications. <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 9-10.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>IV. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">At issue here is a claimed practice by the Department of allowing the ultimate decision maker ex parte access to the report of hearing prepared by the prosecuting attorney. As disclosed in the parties\u2019 written submissions to this court, there is a factual dispute about whether that practice actually took place in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">A. <em>The Parties\u2019 Factual Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">In his petition, Rondon contends that \u201cthe prosecutor in this administrative hearing provided a form written communication to the decision-maker pertaining to the facts and process of the administrative hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the petition itself provides no declaration or other evidentiary support for that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">1. <em>The Department\u2019s Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">In connection with its informal opposition to Rondon\u2019s petition, filed in this court, the Department submitted a declaration from John Peirce, who supervises the Department\u2019s Hearing and Legal Unit. Peirce declares: \u201cMy instructions to my staff attorneys are that, if they prepare a Report of Hearing (ABC-104), it is not to be sent to the Director, to me or to the Hearing and Legal Unit and the official file.\u201d He further declares: \u201cMy instructions to the Hearing and Legal Unit are that if they receive a Report of Hearing in error, it is not to be given to the Director, to me or to be placed in the official hearing file but is to be returned to the attorney who prepared it.\u201d Peirce also declares: \u201cI have personally reviewed the file in this matter. There is no Report of Hearing in the File, nor any other memo or communication prepared by the prosecuting attorney. The attorney who presented this case did not communicate in any manner with me regarding this case. On information and belief, the attorney who prosecuted this case did not communicate in any fashion with the independent attorney who reviewed the Proposed Decision or with the Director about this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">2. <em>Rondon\u2019s Response</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">In his reply to the Department\u2019s informal opposition, Rondon challenges the adequacy of Peirce\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>Rondon also includes declarations from three current or former Department prosecutors\u2014Winters, Logan, and Lewis\u2014who all confirm that they prepared such reports in other cases. All three declare: \u201cI was not responsible for distributing the Report of Hearing; distribution was handled by staff in the Cerritos office.\u201d Logan and Lewis state that they \u201cdo not know who, if anyone, the Report of Hearing was distributed to.\u201d Winters goes further, acknowledging that in his particular case, \u201cit does appear from a notation on the file that a copy of the Report of Hearing was sent to the Hearing and Legal Unit at the ABC Headquarters in Sacramento.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Based on the information contained in those three declarations, Rondon argues that the Department \u201cfailed-to establish proper screening procedures\u201d to ensure that its decision makers do not receive reports of hearing from its prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">3. <em>Propriety of Considering the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Writs of review are governed by Business and Professions Code section 23090.1, which provides: \u201cNo new. or additional evidence shall be introduced in [the reviewing] court, but the cause shall be heard on the. whole record of the department as certified to by the board.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Chevron Stations, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 116 [57 Cal.Rptr.3d 6] <em>(Chevron).) </em>This limitation is in keeping with the typical practice for writs of review. (See, e.g., 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 261, p. 1057.)</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">However, an exception to that limitation applies in this case, since the disputed evidence is not offered to undermine the Department\u2019s substantive factual findings; rather, its proffer is intended to shed light on whether the illegal practice in fact took place here. In <em>Quintanar, </em>the high court discussed Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22, which \u201climits the Board to consideration of the record before the Department . . , .\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 15, fn. 11; see also, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23083 [similar statutory limitation on the record before the Board].) In dicta, the court said: \u201cWe interpret the record limit as applying to prevent parties from relitigating substantive matters by submitting new evidence, but not to prevent the Board from carrying out its obligation to detemfine whether the Department has complied with the law.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, </em>at p. 15, fn. 11.) By parity of reasoning, the use of extra-record evidence in this case allows us to carry out our obligation to make that same determination judicially, without violating the limitations imposed by Business and Professions Code section 23090.1. (Cf., e.g., <em>Nasha v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 485 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 772] [in administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>mandamus proceeding, where the issue is \u201cwhether the administrative hearing was procedurally fair, \u2018the trial court may consider evidence not presented at the administrative hearing if the evidence addresses the petitioners claim that he or she was denied due process or a fair hearing at that hearing\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">4. <em>Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Taken as a whole, the declarations do not affirmatively demonstrate that a report of hearing was distributed or otherwise made available to the decision maker in this particular matter. Furthermore, unlike the factual scenario in <em>Quintanar, </em>the Department has not conceded that the decision maker here \u201chad access to the reports of hearing.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 16.) The Department therefore characterizes Rondon\u2019s contentions, as \u201cunsupported speculation that the prosecuting attorney engaged in ex parte communication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">By the same token, however, the declarations do not foreclose the possibility that improper ex parte communication took place in this case. And given the circumstances presented here, we may assume that the Department did engage in the challenged practice in this case. For one thing, as a general matter, the Department\u2019s concession in <em>Quintanar </em>suggests a widespread agency practice of allowing access to such reports. (See <em>Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 16.) For another thing, and more specific to the case at hand, we agree with Rondon that Peirce\u2019s declaration is inadequate. On the critical issue of whether ex parte communication took place in this case, Peirce\u2019s declaration contains only his second hand information and belief that no such contact occurred. Presumably, the Department was capable of providing direct proof on that pivotal question, through Prosecuting Attorney Thomas Allen and/or the unnamed advisors/decision makers in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">In short, the Department has not offered any evidence that it did <em>not </em>engage in the challenged practice here, and the record before us does not foreclose that possibility. As was said in the <em>Howitt </em>case, \u201cthe burden is always on the party relying on [an ethical] wall to demonstrate its existence and effectiveness.\u201d <em>(Howitt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1575, 1587 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 196].) \u201cAs a practical matter, were the burden allocated otherwise, it would seldom if ever be possible for the opposing party to demonstrate that the lawyer in question had not been adequately screened.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>\u201cIf the adviser has been screened, it should be relatively easy for [the agency, there the district attorney\u2019s office] to explain the screening procedures in effect. On the other hand, if there has been improper contact, it would likely be known only to the lawyers involved and perhaps to the [agency]. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>party challenging the dual representation would have virtually no way of obtaining evidence to demonstrate any impropriety.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cSimilar pragmatic considerations are applicable here.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">In sum, the Department has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that it employed an effective ethical wall in Rondon\u2019s case, despite having had the opportunity to submit evidence on the point.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We shall therefore assume as a factual matter that the Department\u2019s decision maker had access to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s report of hearing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">B. <em>Statutory Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">As explained by the California Supreme Court in <em>Quintanar, </em>the challenged practice implicates two related concerns: impermissible ex parte communication and illegal extra-record information. <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 9-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">1. <em>Improper ex parte communications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">In the words of the California Supreme Court, the APA does not \u201cpermit prosecutors and other adversarial agency employees to have off-the-record contact about substantive issues with the agency head, or anyone to whom the agency head delegates decisionmaking authority, during the pendency of an adjudicative proceeding.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 10.) In the words of the Legislature: \u201cWhile the proceeding is pending there shall be no communication, direct or indirect, regarding any issue in the proceeding, to the presiding officer from an employee or representative of an agency that is a party or from an interested person outside the agency, without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate in the communication.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11430.10, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>Applying that authority here, we conclude that the Department\u2019s practice of allowing its ultimate decision maker to have access to prosecuting attorneys\u2019 reports of hearing violates statutory prohibitions against ex parte communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">2. <em>Improper extra-record information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">As the California Supreme Court has long held: \u201cAdministrative tribunals exercising quasi judicial powers which are required to make a determination after a hearing cannot act on their own information. Nothing may be treated as evidence which has not been introduced as such, inasmuch as a hearing requires that the party be apprised of the evidence against him in order that he may refute, test and explain it.\u201d <em>(La Prade </em>v. <em>Department of Water &amp; Power </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 47, 51-52 [162 P.2d 13].) \u201cThe action of such an administrative board exercising adjudicatory functions when based upon information of which the parties were not apprised and which they had no opportunity to controvert amounts to a denial of a hearing.\u201d <em>(English </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 155, 158 [217 P.2d 22].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">More recently\u2014and in this specific context\u2014the high court again stressed the importance of \u201crecord exclusivity. \u2018The decision of the agency head should be based on the record and not on off-the-record discussions from which the parties are excluded.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">The Department\u2019s practice of allowing its ultimate decision maker access to prosecuting attorneys\u2019 hearing reports thus constitutes a second type of statutory violation, the use of extra-record information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Furthermore, as recent case law explicitly confirms, the challenged ex parte practice violates the APA, regardless of whether the Board adopts the Department\u2019s decision. As the <em>Chevron </em>opinion states, \u201cit is clear from the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Quintanar </em>. . . that it does not make any difference that the Department decision maker in this case adopted rather than rejected the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision. The Department decision maker could have been influenced to affirm the ALT by the ex parte communication from the Department\u2019s prosecuting attorney.\u201d <em>(Chevron, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th at p. 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>C. <em>Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Having concluded that the Department' violated statutory requirements, we reach the final step in our analysis\u2014determining the proper remedy. More precisely, we consider whether prejudice must be shown in order to warrant reversal of the Department\u2019s decision. We conclude that a showing of prejudice is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">In <em>Quintanar, </em>the high court rejected a. similar claim of harmlessness asserted by the Department, articulating two reasons: \u201cFirst, because the Department has refused to make copies of the reports of hearing part of the record, despite a Board order that it do so, whether their contents are as innocuous as the Department portrays them to be is impossible to determine. Second, .although both sides no doubt would have liked to submit a secret unrebutted review of the hearing to the ultimate decision maker or decision maker\u2019s advisers, only one side had that chance. The APA\u2019s administrative adjudication bill of rights was designed to eliminate such one-sided occurrences. We will not countenance them here. Thus, reversal of the Department\u2019s orders is required.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">The second reason alone persuades us here. As long-standing California Supreme Court precedent teaches: \u201cAdministrative tribunals which are required to make a determination after a hearing cannot act upon their own information, and nothing can be considered as evidence that was not introduced at a hearing of which the parties had notice or at which they were present., [Citations.] The fact that there may be substantial and properly introduced evidence which supports the board\u2019s ruling is immaterial.\u201d <em>(English v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at pp. 158-159.) \u201cA contrary conclusion would be tantamount to requiring a hearing in form but not in substance, for the right of a hearing before an administrative tribunal would be meaningless if the tribunal were permitted to base its determination upon information received without the knowledge of the parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">In this case, based on the violation of statutory protections designed to ensure due process and a fair hearing, we. conclude that \u201creversal of the Department\u2019s orders is required.\u201d <em>(Quintanar, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">The Department\u2019s decision to revoke Rondon\u2019s license is reversed and its request for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Elia, Acting P. J., and Duffy, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">On June 11, 2007, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">See <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 1 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 585, 145 P.3d 462] (hereafter, <em>Quintanar).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">Concerning the separation of functions, the statute provides: \u201cThe adjudicative function shall be separated from the investigative, prosecutorial, and advocacy functions within the agency as provided in Section 11425.30.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11425.10, subd. (a)(4).) The referenced section states in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person may not serve as presiding officer in an adjudicative proceeding in any of the following circumstances: [ft] (1) The person has served as investigator, prosecutor, or advocate in the proceeding or its preadjudicative stage.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11425.30.) With respect to ex parte communications, the statute reads: \u201cEx parte communications shall be restricted as provided in Article 7 (commencing with Section 11430.10).\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11425.10, subd. (a)(8).) According to the referenced section: \u201cWhile the proceeding is pending there shall be no communication, direct or indirect, regarding any issue in the proceeding, to the presiding officer from an employee or representative of an agency that is a party or from an interested person outside the agency, without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate in the communication.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11430.10, subd. (a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">As reflected in the Board\u2019s decision, Rondon made the same contention in his administrative appeal. As that decision also reflects, Rondon moved to augment the record in his administrative appeal to include the report of hearing, a motion that the Board denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">In that respect, this case is in a different posture from the situation presented in <em>Howitt. (Howitt v. Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 1587.) There, the court observed: \u201cThe record in this case contains no evidence of any procedure in the county counsel\u2019s office to screen lawyers who advise the appeals board from the advocacy functions of the office. We are nonetheless reticent to rely on this record in concluding that the county counsel\u2019s office has failed to meet its burden where the screening issue was not raised below and has only been highlighted as part of the process of appellate review. Under these circumstances, we believe it only fair to deny Howitt\u2019s petition without prejudice ... [to] give county counsel\u2019s office the opportunity to make any showing it can to demonstrate that the Board\u2019s adviser has been adequately screened.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, by contrast, the parties raised the issue both in the administrative proceedings and in this court. The evidence submitted by the Department here is simply inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
