The appeal from so much of the order dated May 9, 2011, as denied those branches of the defendants\u2019 respective motions which were for leave to renew must be dismissed as academic in light of our determination on the appeal from the order entered November 9, 2010.</p><p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>The plaintiff commenced this action asserting causes of action to recover damages for, inter alia, medical malpractice, lack of informed consent, and fraud. The gravamen of the cause of action alleging fraud is that the plaintiff was induced to undergo unnecessary spinal cord detethering surgery based on the defendants\u2019 knowingly false representations. Due to this alleged fraudulent conduct, the plaintiff claimed that she sustained serious physical, emotional, and financial injuries.</p><p id=\"b763-4\">The Supreme Court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 respective motions pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7) to dismiss the third cause of action, which alleged fraud, insofar as asserted against each of them since the injuries arising from the alleged fraud are no different from those resulting from the alleged lack of informed consent and malpractice <em>(see Simcuski v Saeli, </em>44 NY2d 442 [1978]; <em>McNamara v Droesch, </em>49 AD3d 511 [2008]; <em>Karlin v IVF Am., </em>239 AD2d 560 [1997], <em>mod on other grounds </em>93 NY2d 282 [1999]; <em>Luciano v Levine, 232 </em>AD2d 378 [1996]; <em>Spinosa v Weinstein, </em>168 AD2d 32 [1991]).</p><p id=\"b763-5\">In light of our determination, the remaining contention of the defendant Chanland Roonprapunt has been rendered academic.
