Finding that a significant portion of the transcript was missing and that meaningful review was precluded, Supreme Court partially granted the petition by annulling the determination and remitting for a new hearing. Petitioner appeals.</p><p id=\"b1532-5\">Petitioner\u2019s sole contention is that Supreme Court should have ordered expungement instead of a new hearing. We find this claim to be unpersuasive. As this Court has noted, \u2018 \u2018 [ejxpungement will be ordered only where there has been a showing that \u2018(1) the challenged disciplinary determination is not supported by substantial evidence . . . ; (2) there has been a violation of one of the inmate\u2019s fundamental due process rights, as enunciated in <em>Wolff v McDonnell </em>(418 US 539 . . .); or (3) other equitable considerations dictate expungement of the record rather than remittal for a new hearing\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Monko v Selsky, </em>246 AD2d 699, 700 [1998], quoting <em>Matter of Hillard v Coughlin, </em>187 AD2d 136, 140 [1993], <em>lv denied </em>82 NY2d 651 [1993] [citations omitted]). None of the foregoing concerns are implicated by the missing testimony in the case at hand. Therefore, Supreme Court properly ordered a new hearing <em>(see Matter of La Van v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>47 AD3d 1153 [2008]; <em>Matter of Auricchio v Goord, </em>273 AD2d 571, 572 [2000]; <em>Matter of Monko v Selsky, </em>246 AD2d at 700).</p><p id=\"b1532-6\">Peters, P.J., Mercure, Malone Jr., Kavanagh and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
