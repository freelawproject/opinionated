The actions were tried together before a jury, and a verdict for each plaintiff was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-18\">The defendant, who has appealed, contends that the actions abated by reason of the death of the driver of the automobile ; and that the refusal of an instruction offered, by her constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-19\">In each instance the plaintiff was riding in an automobile, operated by Milton D. Newman, which collided with an auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>mobile owned by the defendant, which was being driven with her permission by J. R Deasy. Deasy was joined as a party to the action and ansAvered the complaint, but died before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict is not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">It was decided in <em>Sayles </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>11 Cal. App. (2d) 401 [54 Pac. (2d) 94], that the liability of the oAAnier of a car is joint and several Avith that of the driver, and that the death of the latter is not a bar to an action against the former. (See, also, <em>Broome </em>v. <em>Kern Valley Packing Co., </em>6 Cal. App. (2d) 256 [44 Pac. (2d) 430]; <em>Millburn </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>8 Cal. App. (2d) 478 [47 Pac. (2d) 1106]; <em>Pascoe </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>124 Cal. App. 528 [12 Pac. (2d) 1091].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The refusal to give appellant\u2019s offered instruction was not prejudicial as the matters therein were fully covered by other instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">We find no merit in the appeal, and the judgments are accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
