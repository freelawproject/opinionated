The promissory note was originally secured by a deed of trust on real property which was subject to a first mortgage. The first mortgage was foreclosed, the property sold and the time for redemption elapsed. The security for the note which is the subject of the present action became entirely valueless before the commencement of the action. The note was for the sum of $4,150, but before the commencement of the action only $1780.68 remained unpaid. Plaintiffs asked judgment for the last-mentioned sum and interest. Judgment was rendered in accordance with the prayer of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cMunicipal court shall have original jurisdiction of civil eases and proceedings as follows: (a) In all cases at law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>which the demand, exclusive of interest, or the value of the property in controversy, amounts to two thousand dollars or less, ...\u201d The present action is a \u201ccase at law\u201d.
