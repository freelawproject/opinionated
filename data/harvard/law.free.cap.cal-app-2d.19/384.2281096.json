While it is true one action filed in the Superior Court of San Joaquin County entitled <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Banta-Carbona Irrigation District and E. Draper, Treasurer of Banta-Carbona Irrigation District, </em>being numbered among the records thereof as 27487, wherein the petitioners sought, by writ of mandate, to compel the respondents therein to pay certain matured interest bearing coupons, has been dismissed, there is still pending in the courts of San Joaquin County, an action entitled <em>Keyston et al. </em>v. <em>Banta-Carbona Irrigation District, </em>and being numbered therein 27527. This latter proceeding was brought by three of the four petitioners who are here seeking this writ, praying for a judgment against the Banta-Carbona Irrigation District for the amount due them on certain interest coupons of bonds issued by the district, and will involve a consideration of practically the same questions presented in the petition for the writ now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">It is true that the action still pending in San Joaquin County is an action at law, and the petitioners or parties plaintiffs and defendants are not identical with the parties in the present action, but it does appear that generally they are the same and that in order to present the issues sought to be raised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the petition filed in this court the issues there suggested must be considered and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">It is also asserted by respondents and conceded by petitioners that they are not in accord as to all of the facts in the case before us which would require the taking of testimony by this court directly or through a referee. In accordance with rule XXVI of the Rules for the Supreme Court and District Courts of Appeal, petitioners have set forth in their petition for the writ, a statement of circumstances, which in their opinion renders it proper that this writ should issue originally from this court, but an examination of these circumstances in the light of our study of the record and the facts there presented does not justify our assuming jurisdiction. The attitude of this court is well expressed in the case of <em>Brougher </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works, </em>205 Cal. 426 [271 Pac. 487], where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\u201cPetitioners have advanced no sufficient reason why this court should assume jurisdiction of the proceedings to determine and settle in the first instance the facts involved in this controversy. The matter is now before us simply upon an order to show cause why the alternative writ of mandate prayed for by petitioners should not issue. It has never been the policy of this court to encourage the institution of proceedings herein, particularly where there is a dispute as to the facts involved, when such proceedings could as well have been instituted in the first instance in the superior court of the' county where the controversy arose. No good reason appears to us why we should depart from this policy in the present proceeding. The motion of petitioners to file an amended petition, therefore, is hereby denied and the order to show cause dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cThese orders are made, however, without prejudice to the right of petitioners to seek in the proper tribunal such relief, not inconsistent with the views herein expressed, as they may be advised they are entitled to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u25a0Therefore, in view of the fact that there is an action now pending that will present the question here attempted to be raised and that the superior court is better able to determine all of the conflicting facts than is this court, and that petitioners have a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the superior court, the peremptory writ of mandate is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>An application by petitioners to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on April 26, 1937.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
