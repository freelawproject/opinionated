The cases were consolidated and tried de novo on appeal to the circuit court, ORS 221.350, 221.360, which affirmed the convictions.

We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The Hillsboro Charter authorizes the city council to \u201clicense, tax and regulate any and all persons engaging in mercantile, manufacturing, mechanical, business or professional pursuits or vocations * * \u201cto prevent and remove nuisances and to declare what shall constitute the same * * Chapter VI, \u00a7\u00a7 39, 52.

The city has declared door-to-door solicitation a nuisance punishable as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Cases from an earlier era disposed of anti-solicitation ordinances similar to Hillsboro\u2019s as beyond authority of local governments to enact under their \u201cpolice\u201d powers. <em>Jewel Tea Co. v. City of Geneva, </em>137 Neb 768, 291 NW 664 (1940); <em>N.J. Good Humor, Inc., v. Bradley Beach, </em>123 NJL 21, 7 A2d 824 (1939), 124 NJL 162, 11 A2d 113 (1940) (former judgment vacated and ordinance struck); <em>White v. Town of Culpeper, </em>172 Va 630, 1 SE2d 269 (1939); <em>Prior v. White, </em>132 Fla 1, 180 So 347, 116 ALR 1176 (1938); <em>Tea Company v. Bel Air, </em>172 Md 536, 192 A 417 (1937); <em>City of Orangeburg v. Farmer, </em>181 SC 143, 186 SE 783 (1936). But we no longer take such a limited view of the regulatory powers of governments, <em>Burt v. Blumenauer, </em>299 Or 55, 61, 699 P2d 168 (1985), even if we do not ordinarily make reference to \u201cpolice\u201d powers. <em>See </em>Linde, <em>Without \u2018\u2018Due Process, \u201d </em>49 Or L Rev 125,146-158 (1970). The Hillsboro City Council has, within its authority, designated door-to-door sales a nuisance punishable as a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question is whether the authorized ordinance exceeds constitutional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The Hillsboro \u201cGreen River\u201d ordinance is an almost verbatim replica of its namesake enacted by the town of Green River, Wyoming, in 1931. The ordinances seemed to have swept the country in the Thirties, followed closely by court challenges to their legality. <em>See </em>Note and Comment, <em>Constitutional Law </em>\u2014 Freedom <em>of Press </em>\u2014 Freedom <em>of Speech </em>\u2014 Right <em>of Religious Sects to Distribute Literature, </em>21 Or L Rev 76 (1941). Tea, brush, ice cream, hosiery, magazine and vacuum cleaner merchants, some representing substantial national concerns which generated business only through door-to-door sales, challenged the ordinances under theories then in currency: violation of liberty of contract, interference with interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>commerce, discrimination against non-residents and, as mentioned above, excessive police powers. As the above cases indicate, the ordinances were sometimes struck down; in other cases they were sustained. <em>See City of Shreveport v. Cunningham, </em>190 La 481, 182 So 649 (1938); <em>Town of Green River v. Bunger, </em>50 Wyo 52, 58 P2d 456 (1936). When the United States Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana town\u2019s conviction of a door-to-door magazine seller, an employee of a national periodical distributor, the legality of the \u201cGreen River\u201d ordinance was, for a time, secure. <em>Breard v. Alexandria, </em>341 US 622, 71 S Ct 920, 95 L Ed 1233 (1951). Shortly after the <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>decision, this court upheld Bend\u2019s \u201cGreen River\u201d ordinance against, among other federal constitutional claims, a First Amendment challenge. <em>Phillips v. City of Bend, </em>192 Or 143, 161, 234 P2d 572 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the asserted free speech claims of \u201csolicitors for gadgets and brushes\u201d because selling, though involving speech and, in that case, a printed product, carried a \u201ccommercial feature.\u201d 431 US at 641, 642. The sentiments echoed those of an earlier opinion, <em>Valentine v. Chrestensen, </em>316 US 52, 62 S Ct 920, 86 L Ed 1262 (1942), which upheld New York city\u2019s prohibition on handbill distribution in the streets as applied to a primarily commercial advertisement for a submarine tour. In <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>the Court carefully distinguished the door-to-door contacts that governments could not prohibit: the distribution of religious or political handbills and circulars, an activity the Court in <em>Martin v. City of Struthers, </em>319 US 141, 63 S Ct 862, 87 L Ed 1313 (1943), had called \u201cessential to the poorly financed causes of little people.\u201d 319 US at 146; <em>cf. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Tr. Counc., </em>No. 86-1461 (US April 20, 1.988) (construing the NLRA not to prohibit peaceful handbilling by union during labor dispute). The <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>dissenters objected to enforcing the ordinance against distributors of magazines, a printed product, but they were willing to uphold the ordinance if applied to a \u201cmerchant\u201d who goes door-to-door \u201cselling pots.\u201d 341 US at 650 note *, <em>Martin v. City of Struthers, </em>319 US at 144. When a Virginia newspaper publisher was convicted for printing an advertisement for legal abortions at a New York clinic in violation of a Virginia statute prohibiting \u201cpromoting\u201d abortions, the full Court confronted restraints on \u201cfreedom of * * * the press\u201d and embarked on a reconsideration of First Amendment protections for \u201ccommercial\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>speech. <em>Bigelow v. Virginia, </em>421 US 809, 95 S Ct 2222, 44 L Ed 2d 600 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The United States Supreme Court has since come to consider \u201ccommercial\u201d speech \u201cprotected\u201d by the First Amendment. It has held, though not with uniformity of rationale, that governments can regulate it to a greater degree and for different purposes than other protected speech. <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, </em>453 US 490, 101 S Ct 2882, 69 L Ed 2d 800 (1981); <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 US 557, 100 S Ct 2343, 65 L Ed 2d 341 (1980); <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., </em>436 US 447, 98 S Ct 1912, 98 S Ct 1925, 56 L Ed 2d 444 (1978); <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer Council, </em>425 US 748, 96 S Ct 1817, 48 L Ed 2d 346 (1976). Having placed the ordinance in its historical setting, we turn to the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The nature of the prohibition, either civil or criminal, is immaterial to the first sentence of Article I, section 8, which directs that \u201cno law\u201d shall restrict or restrain speech, writing and printing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have made distinctions between civil and criminal remedies with regard to an \u201cabuse\u201d of speech or writing and held that civil remedies but not criminal may redress \u201cabuses\u201d of these rights. <em>Lewis v. Oregon Beauty Supply Co., </em>302 Or 616, 733 P2d 430 (1987); <em>Bank of Oregon v. Independent News, </em>298 Or 434, 693 P2d 35 (1985); <em>In re Lasswell, </em>296 Or 121, 673 P2d 855 (1983); <em>Hall v. The May Dept. Stores, </em>292 Or 131, 145-46, 637 P2d 126 (1981); <em>Wheeler v. Green, </em>286 Or 99, 593 P2d 777 (1979). These cases, with the exception of <em>Lasswell, </em>concern abuses after they cause damage, and in <em>Lasswell </em>the attorney disciplinary rule prohibiting prosecutors from commenting publicly on an ongoing investigation or trial was based on incompatibility with the prosecutor\u2019s function and was held to require a highly likely effect. 296 Or at 126. With regard to prohibitions on speech or writing before some completed abuse of these rights, we have held that government, with few historical exceptions, cannot prohibit speech outright by making it a crime. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Robertson, </em>293 Or 402, 649 P2d 569 (1982); <em>State v. Spencer, </em>289 Or 225, 611 P2d 1147 (1980). Neither may it do so through civil prohibitions. <em>City of Portland v. Welch, </em>229 Or 308, 320, 364 P2d 1009, 367 P2d 403 (1961) (on rehearing, unrestrained, unguided discretion to grant licenses can be a prior restraint prohibited by Article I, section 8); <em>see also Ivancie v. Thornton, </em>250 Or 550, 557, 443 P2d 612 (1968) (First Amendment prohibits governments from restricting speech by taxes, license, punishment or withholding of benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The relevant distinction is between outright prohibitions \u2014 either criminal or civil \u2014 on the one hand, and regulations that do not foreclose expression entirely but regulate when, where and how it can occur. Prohibiting expression by making certain speech or writing criminal, as were the threats in <em>State v. Robertson, supra, </em>and the pornographic literature in <em>State v. Henry, </em>302 Or 510, 732 P2d 9 (1987) and <em>State v. Ray, </em>302 Or 595, 733 P2d 28 (1987), or imposing an oppressive licensing procedure, as in <em>City of Portland v. Welch, supra, </em>are examples of the former. The zoning ordinance this court recently addressed in <em>City of Portland v. Tidyman, </em>306 Or 174, 759 P2d 242 (1988), is an example of the latter. With regard to these latter regulations, even free speech activities \u201care not immune from regulations imposed for reasons other than the substance of their particular message,\u201d <em>Tidyman, </em>306 Or at 182.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In either case, laws must proscribe harm rather than expression itself. <em>Tidyman, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><em>A </em>facially unconstitutional law \u2014 that is, one that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>expressly prohibits speech \u2014 may be upheld if \u201cthe restraint is wholly confined within some historical exception that was well established when the first American guarantees of freedom of expression were adopted and that the guarantees then or in 1859 demonstrably were not intended to reach.\u201d <em>State v. Robertson, supra, </em>293 Or at 412. The city and amici assert that an exception applies here because prohibitions on door-to-door selling appear in the Deady Code. But the first Oregon statutes <em>licensed </em>\u201cpeddlers\u201d; they did not prohibit them. <em>See, e.g., </em>General Laws of Oregon 775-76 (Deady 1845-64). These laws may be seen as the lawmakers\u2019 acceptance rather than rejection of door-to-door sales as a legitimate way of doing business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any case, the Hillsboro ordinance prohibits uninvited entries to private property or \u201ccalling at residences,\u201d but it does not by its terms prohibit speech. It is not unlawful as an outright prohibition on speech. <em>State v. Robertson, supra, </em>293 Or at 412, 416; <em>State v Moyle, </em>299 Or 691, 699, 705 P2d 740 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Although facially valid, the ordinance focuses on one type of entry \u2014 for the purpose of selling merchandise. Selling is a form of communicative behavior that includes speech and may involve goods that are protected expression. Because speech is implicated, we must examine the ordinance for over-breadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The parties debate the activities the ordinance prohibits. The city argues that the ordinance prohibits only solicitation by commercial enterprises and exempts the same activities if carried out by community, religious, charitable or political entities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The minutes of the city council meeting at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>which the ordinance was adopted do not show any distinction or exception for solicitations for these purposes or for sales of books, magazines, or newspapers. Councillors were told, and the council\u2019s legislative \u201cfindings\u201d preceding the prohibitory language of the ordinance reflect, only that the ordinance was designed primarily to control fraud by unscrupulous and unethical solicitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The ordinance is overbroad, not because it regulates solicitation for one purpose differently from another, but because it prohibits all solicitation for any purpose at any time. The ordinance as written is broad enough to preclude any person or group from approaching a door in a residential neighborhood to solicit financial support for any purpose through the sale of merchandise. This is far more than a regulation limited to and contained by the consequences the law seeks to prevent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Though we have on occasion narrowed an overbroad statute to the constitutional confines intended by lawmakers, <em>see, e.g., State v. Moyle, supra, </em>we are unable to discern the intended boundaries of this ordinance. The city impermissibly has prohibited all persons from approaching people in their homes at any time to sell merchandise.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not suggest that the city could not place reasonable limitations on door-to-door solicitations. The city may yet choose to regulate, rather than totally proscribe, door-to-door solicitations. It has not yet done so. We hold that under Article I, section 8, the ordinance is overbroad and cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. The decision of the circuit court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\"> The Hillsboro City Council passed Hillsboro Ordinance No. 2488-2-72 on February 15, 1972. It was referred to the voters and adopted on May 23, 1972. Section 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">\u201cThat the practice of persons going in and upon private property or calling at residences in the city of Hillsboro, Oregon, by solicitors, peddlers, hawkers, itinerant merchants, transient vendors of merchandise and transient photograph solicitors, not having been requested or invited so to do by the owner or owners, occupant or occupants of said private residences, for the purpose of soliciting orders for the sale of goods, wares, merchandise and/or for the purpose of disposing of and/or peddling or hawking the same, or soliciting orders for photographs, is hereby prohibited and declared to be a nuisance and punishable as such nuisance as a misdemeanor. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to utilities, franchised to operate in the city of Hillsboro.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> Defendants made the argument below, as did the defendants in <em>Phillips v. City of Bend, </em>192 Or 143, 161-62, 234 P2d 572 (1951), that the city\u2019s authority to \u201clicense, tax and regulate\u201d did not include authority also to prohibit commercial pursuits. Distinctions can be drawn between the Hillsboro and the Bend charter. Bend\u2019s charter not only authorized the city to \u201clicense, tax and regulate\u201d trades and professions but also to \u201crestrain or suppress\u201d those that were \u201coffensive.\u201d Hillsboro\u2019s authority to \u201cregulate\u201d authorizes this ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> The city presents the fine as a form of civil regulation. In fact, defendants were \u201cadjudged guilty\u201d and \u201cconvicted\u201d under an ordinance that characterizes the prohibited conduct as a \u201cmisdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> \u201c [A] communication may be offensive in two different ways. Independently of the message the speaker intends to convey, the form of his communication may be offensive \u2014 perhaps because it is too loud or too ugly in a particular setting. Other speeches, even though elegantly phrased in dulcet tones, are offensive simply because the listener disagrees with the speaker\u2019s message. The fact that the offensive form of some communication may subject it to appropriate regulation surely does not support the conclusion that the offensive character of an idea can justify an attempt to censor its expression.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of New York, </em>447 US 530, 546, 100 S Ct 2326, 65 L Ed 2d 319 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment; footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> <em>Compare DeJonge v. Oregon, </em>299 US 353, 364, 57 S Ct 255, 81 L Ed 278 (1937) (striking a conviction under Oregon\u2019s Criminal Syndicalism Law for \u201cassisting in the conduct\u201d of a meeting of the Communist Party: \u201c[First Amendment] rights may be abused by using speech or press or assembly in order to incite to violence and crime. The people through their legislatures may protect themselves against that abuse. But the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b595-6\"> Of course, licensing may implicate speech rights if applied to the sale or distribution of products, such as newspapers and magazines, involving expression. A plurality of the United States Supreme Court recently so held in <em>Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., </em>56 US 4611, 108 S Ct 2138, 100 L Ed 2d 771 No. 86-1042 (US June 17, 1988), where it struck portions of a city ordinance giving the mayor discretion without guidelines to grant or deny a newspaper\u2019s application to place its newspaper vending machines on public property. The Court observed: \u201cNewspapers are in the business of expression, while soda vendors are in the business of selling soft drinks. Even if the soda vendor engages in speech, that speech is not related to the soda; therefore preventing if from installing its machines may penalize unrelated speech, but will not directly prevent that speech from occurring.\u201d Slip op at 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> The city acknowledges that the First Amendment would forbid an all-out ban on door-to-door solicitation by charitable, religious or political groups. <em>Schaumburg v.
