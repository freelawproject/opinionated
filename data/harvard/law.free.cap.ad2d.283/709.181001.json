In 1972, he was disbarred in New Jersey because he was convicted of criminal offenses in connection with a conspiracy to defraud an insurance carrier <em>(see, Matter of Perwin, </em>67 NJ 174, 287 A2d 3). Although a US District Court granted applicant\u2019s writ of habeas corpus on double jeopardy and collateral estoppel grounds in 1973 and the criminal proceeding was therefore terminated in his favor <em>(see, State of New Jersey v Perwin, </em>67 NJ 594, 342 A2d 178), the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied his petition for reconsideration of his disbarment in 1974 and denied his application for reinstatement in 1982. In 1990, applicant applied to take the Pennsylvania Bar exam but his application was denied on character and fitness grounds. This Court\u2019s Committee on Character and Fitness has interviewed applicant and recommends his admission, albeit by a divided vote <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 805.1 [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Based upon our consideration of his application for admission, we conclude that applicant does not possess \u201cthe character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law\u201d (Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 [1] [a]). Accordingly, we deny his application for admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Spain, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., Ordered that applicant\u2019s application for admission to the New York State Bar is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
