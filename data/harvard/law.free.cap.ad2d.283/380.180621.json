Immediately before the impact, the defendant driver moved to the far left lane and began to slow down, but he could not avoid colliding with the plaintiffs\u2019 out-of-control automobile. The plaintiff driver had no recollection of the collision, and testified at her deposition that, \u201cI was driving, I got hit. That\u2019s all I remember after that.\u201d She also testified that there were no other vehicles in the immediate vicinity. The involvement of the defendant driver in the accident \u201cwas the result of an emergency situation not of his making, and any error in judgment on his part does not constitute negligence\u201d <em>(DiGiorgio v Sil Serv. Corp., </em>243 AD2d 535, 536). Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment dismissing the complaint <em>(see, Lazar v Fea Leasing, </em>264 AD2d 818; <em>Packer v Mirasola, </em>256 AD2d 394).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Santucci, J. P., S. Miller, Luciano, Feuerstein and Adams, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
