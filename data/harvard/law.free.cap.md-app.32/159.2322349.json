It charged that he \u201cdid unlawfully violate Article 66V2, \u00a7 11-902\u201d by \u201cdriving while intoxicated.\u201d Prior to trial in the District Court he demanded a jury trial, and the case was transferred to the Criminal Court of Baltimore. He was arraigned on 17 August 1975 and prayed a trial by jury. Trial was set for 22 September. On that date the trial was postponed by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d and scheduled for 4 November.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The transcript of the proceedings shows what transpired when the case came on for trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">\u201cMR. SALKIN [James Salkin, Esq. Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: At this time, Your Honor, the State will call the case of Samuel Royster as to driving while impaired, warrant number 47504115.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">THE CLERK: Samuel Royster under warrant 47504115 the State of Maryland charges you with driving while impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>MR. SHERMAN [Robert Sherman, Esq., Defense Counsel]: The plea would be not guilty. The appearance of Robert Sherman entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">THE COURT: He is not entitled to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">MR. SHERMAN: I understand that because the State is only calling B although there is an A charge in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The trial proceeded without a jury. The verdict of the court was guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The sentence was 60 days in the Baltimore City Jail. Royster appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>ISSUE FOR DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Royster does not challenge the propriety of the State\u2019s prosecuting him under \u00a7 11-902 (b). Section 16-104 of Art. 66V2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">\u201cIt shall be sufficient to charge any person with a violation of \u00a7 11-901 (reckless and negligent driving) and \u00a7 11-902 (driving while intoxicated, impaired or under the influence of drugs) and the court is empowered to make a finding under any subsection of either \u00a7 11-901 or \u00a7 11-902.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The citation charged him with violating \u00a7 11-902 without designating a subsection, although it expressed the charge as \u201cdriving while intoxicated.\u201d See <em>Insley v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 46 (1976). He claims that he was unconstitutionally denied a jury trial. He presents the contention by asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">\u201cIs it a violation of due process of law to, in effect, deny a defendant a requested trial by jury by using the simple device of calling for trial a lesser included offense than that charged when said lesser offense carries a penalty not severe enough to warrant trial by jury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Courts Art. \u00a7 4-301 vests exclusive original jurisdiction in the District Court over certain designated crimes including those in which a person at least 16 years old is charged with violation of the motor vehicle laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 4-302 sets out certain exceptions to this jurisdiction, including those in subsection (d) thereof, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cJury trial. \u2014 (1) The District Court is deprived of jurisdiction if a defendant is entitled to and demands a jury trial at any time prior to trial in the District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">(2) A defendant may demand a jury trial in a criminal case if the penalty for the offense with which he is charged permits imprisonment for a period in excess of three months; the state may not demand a jury trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Section 4-302 (e) provides, with certain exceptions not here applicable, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201c... the District Court does not have jurisdiction of an offense or offenses otherwise within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction if a person is charged with an offense or offenses arising from the same circumstances but not within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. In this case, the circuit court for the. county has exclusive original jurisdiction over all the offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Driving while intoxicated, proscribed by Art. 6672, \u00a7 11-902 (a) is punishable upon conviction by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by fine of not more than $1,000 or both. Art. 6672, \u00a7 17-101 (b) (i)'. Driving while ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol, proscribed by Art. 6672, \u00a7 11-902 (b), is punishable upon conviction by imprisonment for not more than two months or a fine of not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>more than $500, or both. Art. 66V2, \u00a7 17-101 (b) (ii). Because of the penalty authorized upon conviction under Art. 66V2, \u00a7 11-902 (a), Royster was entitled to demand a jury trial prior to trial in the District Court. His timely demand therefor divested the District Court of its jurisdiction with respect to both the offense under \u00a7 11-902 (a) and the offense under \u00a7 11-902 (b), and the Criminal Court of Baltimore properly acquired jurisdiction over the offenses, both arising from the same circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Royster\u2019s question acquires a new dimension in the light of <em>Thompson v. State, </em>278 Md. 41 (1976). <em>Thompson </em>tells us that the Criminal Court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction over a case is not dependent upon an accused\u2019s being prosecuted in that court for an offense punishable by more than three months imprisonment. The Court of Appeals expressly held that nothing in the provisions of \u00a7 4-302 or of any other statute or Maryland Rule indicated that the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court may be subsequently ousted by the State\u2019s dropping an intoxicated driving charge and proceeding on a driving while impaired charge. 278 Md. at 48. More significantly, <em>Thompson </em>also held that a defendant once under the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court by reason of demand in the District Court for a jury trial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was entitled to a trial by jury on any criminal charge, regardless of the sentence authorized, even though a jury trial was not constitutionally mandated. The right, the Court found, was under the common law. 278 Md. at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">It is clear, in the light of <em>Thompson, </em>that Royster was entitled to the jury trial which he sought and that the denial of it was improper. Royster\u2019s question, phrased without the benefit of <em>Thompson, </em>does not now precisely convey the issue. But the import of the issue is there and the answer is that the right to a jury trial is not lost in any event by the prosecution\u2019s proceeding to trial on an offense which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>carries a penalty not severe enough to warrant a trial by jury under the federal constitution or existing statutes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Of course, the right to a jury trial may be waived. As the right in the circumstances here does not have a constitutional source, the waiver need not meet constitutional standards. See <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458 (1938). But we see no effective waiver here under any criteria. The trial court precluded any consideration of the point by flatly stating: \u201cHe is not entitled to a jury trial.\u201d If defense counsel appeared to agree, it was because both the court and counsel entertained that belief, pursuant to the decision of this Court in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>26 Md. App. 442, decided 2 June 1975. The Court of Appeals on certiorari to this Court, tells us in its <em>Thompson, supra, </em>that all of us were wrong. See <em>Howard v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 75 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">As we reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial, there is no need to reach the claim that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial; costs to be paid by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-14\">.
