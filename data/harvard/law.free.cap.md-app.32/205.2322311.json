Mathias in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In order to determine whether the circuit court action was proper, we must set out a brief recitation of the circumstances underlying this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">McKinney Drilling Company (McKinney), appellant, contracted with Mach I Limited Partnership (Mach), appellee, to supply materials and construct concrete caissons for an office building being constructed by Mach in Maryland. Mach refused to pay McKinney the approximately $51,000 contract balance for the work performed, asserting that the concrete did not meet the strength specifications required by Mach. The contract between the parties provided for resolving such disputes. Under the terms of the contract, disputes initially were to be submitted to the architects of the project. After they had made their determination, if either party was dissatisfied, it could demand that the dispute be submitted to the American Arbitration Association whose decision shall be final and enforceable under the law of the project situs.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In this case, the architects considered the dispute and, on November 1, 1973, notified McKinney that testing results indicated that the concrete did not meet the contract strength specifications. McKinney demanded arbitration of the dispute, and Mach counterclaimed in the arbitration proceeding for a minimum of $75,000 damages which it averred resulted from delays and additional construction costs arising out of the concrete\u2019s weaknesses. The parties selected an arbitrator from a list supplied by the Association, and hearings were held.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In addition to the parties to the dispute, Maloney Concrete Company, the concrete supplier to McKinney, was permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>to participate indirectly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 28, 1974, the arbitrator found in favor of McKinney by awarding it $51,107.80 plus six percent interest from November 28, 1973. There were no findings of fact made. The counterclaim of Mach was not decided. The only statement made by the arbitrator, besides the amount of the award, was that \u201c[t]his award is in full settlement of all claims submitted to this arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">On June 18, 1974, McKinney filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 3-227, seeking confirmation of the arbitration award inasmuch as Mach had not yet paid the amount awarded. Mach answered and both parties moved for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The motions were denied, according to McKinney, because the pleadings and arguments of counsel left doubt in the judge\u2019s mind as to how Mach\u2019s counterclaim had been treated by the arbitrator. McKinney then sought to reopen the arbitration for the purpose of clarifying the award. On June 27, 1975, the court granted the motion and ordered the parties to exchange questions and agree upon those to be asked of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Prior to the inquisition of the arbitrator by the parties, the arbitrator notified the American Arbitration Association that his construction company, subsequent to the arbitration award in this case, submitted a bid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>develop a building on property owned by Maloney Concrete Company. The parties were also notified, and Mach immediately objected to the arbitrator\u2019s continuing to act in this dispute. When Mach\u2019s objection was overruled by the Association, Mach then moved that the court strike its order reopening the arbitration. The motion was denied, but the court issued a supplemental order permitting the parties to ask questions of the arbitrator concerning his prior relationship with Maloney Concrete Company.</p>\n<p id=\"AXJ\">Pursuant to that order, a hearing was held on August 13, 1975, in which McKinney and Mach inquired of the arbitrator as to his relationship with Maloney. The arbitrator explained that he bought concrete from Maloney to use in his company\u2019s construction projects. The record indicates that the relationship was ongoing at the time the arbitrator considered the McKinney-Mach dispute, although the amount of concrete bought in recent years had been extremely small. When questioned about his treatment of Mach\u2019s counterclaim, the arbitrator stated \u201c... I neither granted it [the counterclaim] or denied it. I did not consider it because it was outside the scope of the arbitration.\u201d The arbitrator further said that he had issued no findings of fact or conclusions of law because neither is required by the Association\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Subsequent to the arbitrator inquiry hearing, Mach, on September 11,1975, filed an amended answer to the petition for confirmation in which Mach asserted that the arbitration award should be vacated because (1) not all the claims were adjudicated; (2) Maloney participated in the arbitration hearings even though Mach had no agreement with Maloney; and (3) the arbitrator did not disclose his own relationship with Maloney. Both McKinney and Mach again moved for summary judgment. McKinney\u2019s motion was denied, but summary judgment was granted for Mach, and Judge Mathias ordered that the arbitration award be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">No transcript of the hearing or findings of fact, if any, or conclusions of law reached by the judge are included in the record. While McKinney\u2019s brief and argument advance a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>number of issues for our review,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we think the only question is whether the hearing judge erred in granting Mach\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The duties of an appellate court, when reviewing a motion for summary judgment, are extensively discussed in <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordinance Products, Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 327 A. 2d 502 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the propriety of the grant of a summary judgment we are concerned primarily with deciding whether a factual issue which was material to the resolution of the controversy existed and whether the trial judge was legally correct.... Where the record shows that there was no such genuine dispute as to any material fact necessary to resolve the controversy as a matter of law, and it is shown that the movant is entitled to judgment, the entry of summary judgment is proper.\u201d 273 Md. at 8. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">This is the test we shall apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">McKinney does not dispute the material facts that the arbitrator never expressly ruled on Mach\u2019s counterclaim even though it was properly before him, did not disclose his ongoing relationship with Maloney Concrete, and allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Maloney, indirectly, to participate in the arbitration hearing through its counsel and vice-president although it had no agreement with Mach. It is clear to us that the hearing judge granted summary judgment based on Mach\u2019s amended answer which was grounded on the above recited undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We were told on oral argument that there was a verbal opinion delivered by the hearing judge at the time he granted summary judgment for Mach, but no transcript thereof is included within the record so that we are unable to pass on the substance of the judge\u2019s opinion. We, therefore, of necessity, review the record before us as the basis for the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">McKinney admits on appeal that it was an error for the arbitrator not to consider the counterclaim, but asserts that the court should have corrected the award accordingly or remanded the issue to the arbitrator for determination. Mach counterargues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in making a final award \u201cin full settlement of all claims submitted\u201d when the arbitrator did not even consider the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We note (1) that paragraph number 7.10.1 of the contract between McKinney and Mach provides that \u201c[a]ll claims .. . shall be decided by arbitration . .<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) the claim and counterclaim arise from the same factual dispute; and (3) the arbitrator\u2019s award purports to settle all claims submitted to him. It is manifest from the questions asked of the arbitrator that the counterclaim was presented, but that he failed to consider it under the mistaken belief that it was outside the scope of the arbitration. Patently, such belief is inconsistent with the statement in the arbitration award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that the \u201c... award is in full settlement of <em>all </em>claims submitted to the arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Under Md. Ann. Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 3-224 (b) (3), an arbitrator\u2019s exceeding his power is sufficient reason to vacate an arbitration award. Perhaps Judge Mathias concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his power by not considering <em>all </em>the claims that were before him. <em>See Bel Pre Medical Center, Inc. v. Frederick Contractors, Inc., supra </em>note 5. Consequently, as a matter of law, the judge was justified in granting summary judgment for Mach and vacating the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The same result would have been reached by the judge if he had decided that the arbitrator was not neutral at the time the claim was considered. According to the \u201cConstruction Industry Arbitration Rules,\u201d an arbitrator must disclose any information which may impair his neutrality.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Courts Art. \u00a7 3-224 (b) (2) permits an arbitration award to be vacated if \u201c[t]here was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption in any arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party.\u201d The hearing judge had before him the evidence showing that the arbitrator\u2019s ongoing relationship with Maloney Concrete might have tainted the arbitrator\u2019s neutrality. Moreover, the evidence disclosed that Maloney\u2019s vice-president was permitted by the arbitrator to attend the arbitration sessions and to testify notwithstanding Mach\u2019s motion to exclude all witnesses. Furthermore, Maloney\u2019s counsel actively participated in the sessions as co-counsel for McKinney and, inferentially, simultaneously, did so to protect Maloney from the liability to which it had subjected itself by virtue of its indemnity agreement with McKinney. Such evidence was sufficient, as a matter of law, to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the judge to draw a rational inference that the arbitrator was not neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">If the foregoing reasons were not enough to vacate the award, we observe that the arbitrator permitted Maloney\u2019s vice-president to attend all sessions and testify even though all witnesses were to be sequestered. Maloney, although not a party to the arbitration, had an interest in the outcome. Based on that decision by the arbitrator, Judge Mathias could have believed that the arbitrator exceeded his power in permitting Maloney\u2019s presence and participation, and, thereby, denied Mach procedural fairness. <em>See Chillum-Adelphi Volunteer Fire Dept. v. Button </em>&amp; <em>Goode, Inc., </em>242 Md. 509, 517, 219 A. 2d 801, 806 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">As we have previously stated, we do not know the precise grounds upon which the hearing judge bottomed his ruling because there is no transcript of the judge\u2019s opinion included in the record. Any one of the three possible alternative routes we have discussed herein would have justified the vacating of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-7\">.

Although McKinney denies that Maloney actively participated, the appellant concedes that (1) despite the arbitrator\u2019s order that all witnesses be sequestered, Maloney\u2019s vice-president was permitted to attend the arbitration sessions \u201c... as a \u2018person with a direct interest ..and he testified as a concrete expert; (2) McKinney\u2019s counsel was assisted by Maloney\u2019s attorney who played an active role in the arbitration hearings; and (3) Maloney had agreed to reimburse McKinney for any award against McKinney because of weak concrete.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">.
