Officer William F. Green of the Montgomery County Police Department promptly executed a statement of charges, No. 195999, signed by a judicial officer as returned on the day of the arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charging document gave 24 March 1974 as the offense date, the time as 12:10 A.M. and the location as Mrs. Howard\u2019s address. It alleged that she \u201cdid unlawfully violate Art. 27, Sect. 121 of the State of Md. to wit did make a disturbance of the Public Peace by wilfully disturbing the public peace by making loud and unseemly noises, profanity, swear &amp; curse, against the peace government and dignity of the state.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She was released upon posting an unsecured personal bond in the amount of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Richard Alden Howard, Sr., the husband of Laura Agnus Howard, was also arrested on 24 March 1974. Four statements of charges emanated from his arrest. Three of them, Nos. 198408, 198404, and 195996, were executed by Sergeant Jack W. Hall and the other one, No. 195998, was executed by Corporal J. E. Eekenrode, both members of the Montgomery County Police Department. All four charging documents were signed by a judicial officer as returned on 24 March 1974, and all pertained to arrest no. 37376 and report no. RD412510. In the statement executed by Eekenrode the time of the offense was given as 12:10 A.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>and the place as Lynn Court and Neal Drive. It alleged that Mr. Howard \u201cdid unlawfully commit the crime of Disturbance of the peace (Public) art. 27, Sec. 121 of the annotated Code of Maryland by willfully disturbing the public peace by making loud and unseemly noises, profanity, swear and curse against the peace, government, and dignity of the State.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Statement of Charges no. 195996 executed by Hall alleged that Mr. Howard \u201cdid unlawfully commit the crime of Disturbance of the Public Peace Art. 27 section 121 Annotated Code of Maryland by willfully disturbing the public peace by making loud and unseemly noises, profanity curse and swear and use obscene language against the peace, government and dignity of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Statement of Charges no. 198403 executed by Hall alleged that Mr. Howard \u201cdid unlawfully make an assault upon Jack W.

Commonlaw of the state of Maryland against the peace, government, and dignity of the state.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Statement of Charges no. 198404 executed by Hall alleged that Mr. Howard \u201cdid unlawfully hinder and prevent Jack W.

Bond was continued as to each accused. The five Statements of Charges were filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and docketed on 30 September 1974.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to the docket entries in each case under date of 1 November 1974, a motion by Mr. and Mrs. Howard to consolidate the cases was granted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It appears from the docket entries that at a preliminary inquiry hearing on 1 November Mr. Howard and Mrs. Howard stood \u201cmute on plea\u201d and demanded a jury trial. The court entered a plea of not guilty. Bond was continued as to each accused. On 24 January 1975 the State filed a \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The relief sought was that (1) the case in which Mrs. Howard was charged be severed from the four cases in which Mr. Howard was charged and remanded to the District Court for Montgomery County for trial, and that (2) with respect to the four cases in which Mr. Howard was charged, Criminal 15234 and Criminal 15235, each alleging a disturbance of the peace in violation of Code, art. 27, \u00a7 121, be severed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>remanded to the District Court for Montgomery County for trial. Mr. and Mrs. Howard answered, opposing the motion. The State requested a hearing and the matter was heard on argument of counsel on 12 March 1975. The court issued an order dated 7 May 1975 and filed 8 May 1975:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cORDERED that Criminal Numbers 15234 and 15235 charging Richard A. Howard, Jr. with disturbing the peace on two different occasions under Article 27, Section 121, be and they are hereby severed from Criminal Numbers 15232 and 15233 and 15230 and remanded for disposition to the District Court for Montgomery County; and it is. further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">ORDERED that Criminal Number 15230 charging Laura A.

The argument in support of the motion was that the order appealed from was a proper exercise of the lower court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>discretion granted by Rule 735.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Neal v. State, </em>272 Md. 323 (1974) is cited as indicating that a \u201crightful exercise\u201d of the court\u2019s discretion is not immediately appealable. Mr. and Mrs. Howard oppose the motion in their reply brief. Rule 1036 \u00a7 d. They claim that the order of 7 May 1975 was not merely an exercise of judicial discretion resulting in a severance of offenses and defendants authorized by Rule 735. They assert that the order finally terminated the proceedings in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County as to three cases, criminal 15230 against Mrs. Howard and criminals 15234 and 15235 against Mr. Howard, and that it finally adjudicated both their right to a jury trial in those cases and the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to try them. We agree that it was a final judgment going to the jurisdiction of the court. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied. See <em>State v. McCray, </em>267 Md. 111, 126 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Statement of Charges no. 195999 (Criminal 15230) as to Mrs. Howard and Statements of Charges no. 195998 (Criminal 15235) and no. 195996 (Criminal 15234) as to Mr. Howard alleged a commission of the crime proscribed by Code, art. 27, \u00a7 121.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The offense created by the statute is a misdemeanor. Any person convicted thereof shall \u201cbe sentenced to a fine of not less than one dollar and not more than one hundred dollars or shall be subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or shall be subject to both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court and shall pay costs of the prosecution.\u201d Statement of Charges no. 198403 (Criminal 15232) alleged that Mr. Howard committed the crime of assault and battery, and Statement of Charges no. 198404 (Criminal 15233) alleged that he committed the crime of hindering a police officer in the execution of the officer\u2019s duty. These crimes are common law misdemeanors without statutory designation of punishment. Thus, punishment is within the discretion of the trial court with the limitation that it be not cruel or unusual. <em>Roddy v. Finnegan, </em>43 Md. 490, 500-506 (1876); <em>Wilkins v.

Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (d) (1). He is entitled to it \u201cif theJpenalty for the offense with which he is charged permits imprisonment for a period in excess of three months;...\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (d) (2). Thus, considering the cases separately, Mr. Howard and Mrs. Howard were not entitled to a jury trial in the cases charging a violation of art. 27, \u00a7 121, disturbing the peace, and could not deprive the District Court of its exclusive original jurisdiction over those cases by demanding a jury trial. Mr. Howard, however, could deprive the District Court of its jurisdiction to try the two cases in which he was charged with assault and obstructing a police officer by demanding the jury trial to which he was entitled because the charges permitted imprisonment for a period in excess of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>three months. As he made timely demand for a jury trial in those two cases, the District Court was deprived of its jurisdiction over them which it had concurrently with the circuit court, and jurisdiction as to them vested in the circuit court. The question is: Did the demand for a jury trial by Mr. Howard as to the offenses of assault and obstructing an officer not only deprive the District Court of its jurisdiction over those two offenses and bestow exclusive original jurisdiction over them on the circuit court, but also deprive the District Court of its exclusive original jurisdiction over the disturbing the peace offenses against Mr. Howard, or against both Mr. and Mrs. Howard, and bestow exclusive original jurisdiction over them on the circuit court?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (e) declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201cExcept as provided in Subtitle 5, the District Court does not have jurisdiction of an offense or offenses otherwise within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction if a person is charged with an offense or offenses arising from the same circumstances but not within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. In this case, the circuit court for the county has exclusive original jurisdiction over all the offenses.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">This appeal requires a construction of \u00a7 4-302 (e) and specifically of the phrase \u201cnot within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">On 17 June 1976 the Court of Appeals filed its opinion in <em>Thompson v. </em>State, 278 Md. 41 (1975). Thompson was charged with three violations of the motor vehicle laws arising out of the same circumstances. Only one of the offenses carried such a maximum penalty as would entitle him to demand a jury trial prior to trial in the District Court. He demanded a jury trial and the entire case was transferred to the Criminal Court of Baltimore for trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>When the case came on for trial, the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>with respect to the offense which met the penalty requirements for entitlement to a jury trial under Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (d) (2). Thompson demanded a jury trial on the two remaining offenses or, in the alternative, that they be remanded to the District Court for trial. The trial judge rejected the demand for a jury trial. It was his opinion that there was no right to a jury trial at the circuit court level<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> on those \u201cpetty\u201d offenses. He also refused to return them to the District Court for trial on the ground that jurisdiction once obtained by a circuit court remained in that court. Thompson, convicted at a bench trial of one of the charges and acquitted of the other, appealed. This Court affirmed the judgment. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>26 Md. App. 442 (1975) and the Court of Appeals granted certiorari. It reversed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remanded with direction that we reverse the judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore and remand the case to that court for a new trial. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">(1) Upon Thompson\u2019s timely demand in the District Court for a jury trial, exclusive original jurisdiction over all three offenses became vested in the Criminal Court of Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">(2) The jurisdiction of the Criminal Court of Baltimore over the two \u201cpetty\u201d offenses did not depend on the prosecution of Thompson on the offense punishable by more than three months imprisonment. Therefore, the entry of the nolle prosequi on the charge which entitled Thompson in the District Court to demand a jury trial did not divest the Criminal Court of jurisdiction over the two remaining offenses. \u201cSection 4-302\u201d, the Court of Appeals said, at 47-48, \u201cdeals only with circumstances whereby jurisdiction <em>attaches </em>in the circuit courts over offenses \u2018otherwise within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>District Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u2019 Nothing in the provisions of that section or of any other statute or Rule of this Court supports Thompson\u2019s contention that the Criminal Court\u2019s jurisdiction may be subsequently ousted by dropping the [charge punishable by a sentence of more than three months].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">(3) Thompson was entitled to a jury trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore on the two remaining charges. The Court of Appeals construed Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (d) as concerning \u201conly, the right to make a demand, in the District Court, for a jury trial. It has no application to the right to a jury trial for charges pending in the Criminal Court.\u201d 277 Md. at 48. It opined that \u201cthe right to a jury trial in criminal cases in the circuit court and Criminal Court of Baltimore, as opposed to the District Court, has not been limited by statute. In such circumstances, where a defendant is charged with a crime in a court of general common law jurisdiction, and where no legislative enactment restricts his right to a jury trial, we believe he is entitled to the common law mode of trial, <em>i.e., </em>trial by jury. ... No Maryland statute denies a defendant, charged in the Criminal Court with a so-called \u2018petty\u2019 crime, the right to a jury trial. While it may be constitutional to do so, [citations omitted], the statutory provisions do not reflect 'such an intent on the Legislature\u2019s part. . . . Absent legislative action taking the right away (in those instances where it would be constitutional to do so), the common law right to a jury trial remains applicable .... Moreover, nothing in the Maryland Rules purports to remove the common law right of a defendant to a jury trial in the Criminal Court.\u201d 277 Md. at 49, 52-53.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">It is manifest that under the <em>Thompson </em>rulings, the trial court erred with respect to Mr. Howard in its order issued 7 May 1975 at the instance of the Motion for Appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Relief by the State. Upon Mr. Howard\u2019s demand for a jury trial in the District Court, the Circuit Court properly \u00e1cquired jurisdiction over all of the offenses with which Mr. Howard was charged.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He was entitled to have all those offenses tried in the Circuit Court, and by a jury upon proper demand. Therefore, we vacate that part of the order of the Circuit Court which severed Criminal Numbers 15234 and 15235, charging Richard A. Howard, Sr. with disturbing the peace, and remanded them for disposition to the District Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The part of the order of 7 May 1975 which remanded the charge against Mrs. Howard to the District Court for disposition is in a different posture. As we have indicated, the penalty for that offense did not permit imprisonment for a period in excess of three months, so she was not entitled to demand a jury trial prior to trial in the District Court. Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (d). Apparently, the charge against her was transferred to the Circuit Court upon demand for a jury trial by Mr. and Mrs. Howard because it had been consolidated with the charges against Mr. Howard, but the record before us does not show a consolidation in the District Court. See note 8 <em>supra. </em>In any event, even if the charge against Mrs. Howard were consolidated in the District Court with the charge against Mr. Howard, and even if such consolidation were proper<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> for the purpose of trial in the District Court, it could not serve to divest the District Court of its exclusive original jurisdiction over the case against Mrs.\" Howard. Courts Art. \u00a7 4-302 (d) plainly states \u201cThe District Court is deprived of jurisdiction if <em>a defendant </em>is <em>entitled to </em>and demands a jury trial at any time prior to trial in the District Court.\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 4-302 (e) speaks in terms of \u201ca person\u201d charged with an offense or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>offenses arising from the same circumstances but not within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. We see no intendment in statute or Rule to permit the divesting of the exclusive original jurisdiction of the District Court in the circumstances here. The jurisdiction to try the criminal case against Mrs. Howard remained in the District Court and the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction to try it. That part of the order of 7 May 1975 which remanded Criminal No. 15230, charging Laura A. Howard with disturbing the peace, to the District Court for disposition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We have several final observations prompted by appellant\u2019s arguments. Even if the point had been preserved for review, we do not believe that the statutes and Rules as applied to decide this appeal deny due process of law or are otherwise constitutionally offensive. Mrs. Howard has no absolute right, constitutional or otherwise, to be. tried jointly with her husband, whose voluntary action divested the court, having exclusive original jurisdiction over both, of its jurisdiction over him. And we point out that jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a court by the parties by way of agreement or acquiescence. <em>State v.
