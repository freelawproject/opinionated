Slade, in, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-17\">Powers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlC\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-18\">Joseph Walton Insley was convicted by a jury in St. Mary\u2019s County of driving a vehicle while he was in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>intoxicated condition. He complains in this appeal that the trial judge, Joseph A. Mattingly, erred in declining to instruct the jury that it may consider the lesser crime of driving while his ability to drive was impaired by the consumption of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Appellant bases his contention upon the provisions of Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 11-902, read together with \u00a7 16-104. Section 11-902 at that time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defined different offenses, making it unlawful for any person to drive or to attempt to drive or to be in actual physical control of any vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">(a) While he is in an intoxicated condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">(b) While his driving ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">(c) While he is under the influence of any narcotic drug.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Section 16-104, in words which appear to be permissive, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">\u201cIt shall be sufficient to charge any person with a violation of \u00a7 11-901 (reckless and negligent driving) and \u00a7 11-902 (driving while intoxicated, impaired or under the influence of drugs) and the court is empowered to make a finding under any subsection of either \u00a7 11-901 or \u00a7 11-902.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">The charging document, a Maryland Uniform Complaint and Citation, issued by a Maryland State Trooper, charged that on Sunday, March 2, 1975, at 8:58 P.M., the defendant did unlawfully violate Article 66V2 \u00a7 11-902, Subsection (a), by operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, at State Route 235, Hollywood, St. Mary\u2019s County. See Maryland District Rules 702, 706. Cf. <em>State v. Dodd, </em>17 Md. App. 693, 304 A. 2d 846 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">In the District Court Insley filed a notice exercising his right to trial by jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The papers were transmitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County. See <em>Wilson v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 557, 321 A. 2d 549 (1974). At the beginning of the jury trial in the Circuit Court the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney moved for and was granted leave to amend the charging document \u201cby striking the words, \u2018under the influence of alcohol,\u2019 and inserting in lieu thereof, \u2018in an intoxicated condition,\u2019 so as to conform to the statutory language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The sufficiency of the evidence, which included the results of a breathalyzer test showing .26 blood alcohol,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was not questioned. Appellant\u2019s complaint is that he was not afforded what he deemed to be the tactical advantage of offering the jury the compromise alternative of finding him guilty of driving while his ability was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We hold that such a choice was not available to Insley. The State charged him with one offense, and only one offense. He was charged with driving a vehicle while he was in an intoxicated condition, specified as being the conduct proscribed by Art. 66V2, \u00a7 11-902 (a). The State\u2019s choice to proceed on an \u201call or nothing\u201d basis meant that the State forewent the right to drop down to a lesser charge, should its proof fail to result in a conviction of the greater charge. If this choice involved risk, the risk was on the State, not on the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">If an appeal to the jury\u2019s intelligence could not result in an acquittal on the charge of driving while in an intoxicated condition, then submission of a lesser charge could serve no purpose but to permit an appeal to the jury\u2019s sympathy. Such a purpose is not a valid reason for an instruction. The judge was correct in declining to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\n<em>Appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-14\">. Effective 1 July 1975 Subsection (c) was amended, and Subsection (d) was added. We are concerned here only with Subsections (a) and (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-15\">. We note that if Insley had been charged with violating both Subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 11-902, he would have been entitled, under Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Courts Art., \u00a7 4-302 (e), to a jury trial on both, Thompson v. State, 26 Md. App. 442, 338 A. 2d 441, <em>cert. granted, </em>276 Md. 751 (1975). Had he been charged with violating only Subsection (b), he would not have been entitled to oust the jurisdiction of the District Court by praying a jury trial. _ _</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-11\">. The trial judge advised the jury of the provisions of Code, Courts Art., \u00a7 10-307 that if there was in the defendant\u2019s blood at the time of testing 0.15 percent, or more, by weight, of alcohol, it shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant was in an intoxicated condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
