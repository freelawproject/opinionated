Lyons, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-14\">Morton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aye\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">The appellant went to trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Karwacki, J., presiding) on an indictment charging murder and armed robbery. The jury returned a not guilty verdict on the murder charge, but guilty on the armed robbery charge. In this appeal it is first contended that the trial judge committed reversible error in denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">The record indicates that as the victim and her eleven-year old son were leaving a shopping center in Baltimore City about 9:15 p.m. on October 18, 1974, the mother was attacked by two young men. In the course of the attack her purse was stolen and she was shot three times, resulting in her death. The son testified that the assailants were nineteen- or twenty-year old blacks, one of whom had his hair plaited in \u201ccornrows.\u201d He observed them run down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Argonne Drive while he sought help. In a police line-up and at trial, the son was unable to identify the appellant as one of the assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Another witness who lived next door to the appellant on Argonne Drive testified that during the evening of October 18, 1974, he was leaving his house and observed the appellant and an individual named Harris come down an alley. He stated that the appellant had a gun sticking out of one pocket and money out of another pocket. According to the witness, the appellant\u2019s hair was braided in cornrows. He was not sure whether the time was 9:15 p.m. or whether it could have been 8 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">On Sunday, October 20, 1974, appellant took a bus to the home of his aunt and uncle in North Carolina where, according to the testimony, he was to enter school the next day. The aunt testified that on the day following his arrival appellant told her that he had witnessed an attack on a woman in Baltimore the previous Friday night. He told her that prior to the attack an acquaintance named Maurice had stopped by appellant\u2019s home and when he went outside with Maurice, there were three other individuals. They then walked about two blocks where they encountered a woman and a little boy walking out of a shopping center. Maurice and one of the individuals grabbed the woman\u2019s pocketbook and when she resisted, the other individual shot and killed her. The appellant told his aunt that he had watched the attack from across the street and did not participate in it. He was told by the individual who fired the shots that he would kill the appellant <em>\u201cif he </em>told.\u201d According to the aunt, appellant said that the gun had been thrown away in the area; that there was $4 and change in the pocketbook; and that each one got 50 cents, although appellant never stated specifically that he himself got 50 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The appellant, his mother and one of his brothers testified that appellant was at home with his mother, three brothers and a sister during the entire evening of October 18, 1974. There was also testimony that the day following the shooting, the police questioned appellant with respect to the murder and robbery and he was then released. The next day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>appellant\u2019s mother and step-father decided to send him to North Carolina to go to school. One week later the police advised appellant\u2019s parents that they wanted to question him further and the parents then had appellant sent back home. The police intercepted the bus he was traveling on in Washington, D. C., where they arrested the appellant and returned him to Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In the course of appellant\u2019s testimony he admitted he had told his aunt in North Carolina that a woman in the neighborhood had been killed but denied giving his aunt the details she had testified to, telling the jury simply that he was not there and did not know who had done it.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In contending that it was error to deny his motion for judgment of acquittal, appellant asserts that the trial judge \u201cerred by applying the wrong standard in determining the legal sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction in that the trial court looked only to whether there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could <em>infer </em>guilt, rather than whether there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find guilt <em>beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The record indicates that the trial judge, in response to appellant\u2019s motion at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I appreciate the argument, gentlemen. You have covered the points very well, and I can say I feel there is sufficient evidence from which a jury can infer guilt of the crimes charged in both indictments, and I will therefore deny the motion for judgment of acquittal for the reasons I have expressed in the course of my colloquy with counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The motion was renewed at the close of all the evidence and summarily denied. While the state suggests that the issue is not preserved because the judge\u2019s remarks were addressed to the first motion and not the second, we think the issue should be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">In appraising \u201ca contention that the evidence was insufficient in law so as to preclude it from being submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>to the jury, the test is whether the evidence either shows directly or supports a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which the trier of fact could fairly be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Williams and McClelland v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 450, 459 (1968). <em>See also Metz v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It is true, as appellant asserts, the trial judge did state in the course of his assessment of the evidence that \u201cI feel there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer guilt of the crimes charged in both indictments * * We think, however, that his failure to recite the magic litany \u201cguilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is not fatal. His failure to do so does not demonstrate, as appellant contends, that he employed the wrong standard in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal. The trial judge was an able, experienced judge and it is inconceivable that he was unaware that an accused\u2019s guilt \u201cmust be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>260 Md. 227 (1970). Any thought to the contrary is completely dispelled by looking at his instructions to the jury during which he advised the members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">\u201c * * * The burden of proof is upon the State to prove every element of the crime charged against the Defendant and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. * * * While the burden is on the State of establishing every fact material to the guilt of the Defendant, including every circumstance that enters into the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, that does not mean that the State must prove the Defendant guilty to an absolute or mathematical certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cGuilt beyond a reasonable doubt may be based on direct evidence of the facts or it may be based on circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence consists of proof of collateral facts and circumstances from which the existence of the main fact may be inferred according to reason and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>common experiences. * * * For in either case, the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In any event, the ultimate question is \u201cwhether-the State\u2019s evidence was, in fact, legally sufficient to permit the case to go to the jury.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 450, 456 (1974). We think it was. There was the witness who, although equivocal on the exact time, saw the appellant on the evening of the crime with a gun sticking out of one pocket and money out of the other. There was the highly incriminating story the appellant related to his aunt upon his arrival in North Carolina. She testified that she could not have learned of the crime from the newspaper because \u201cwe don\u2019t get that paper.\u201d There was appellant\u2019s own concession that he told the aunt of the murder. There was his departure for North Carolina shortly after the crime. There was the testimony of the victim\u2019s young son that one of her assailants had a \u201ccornrow\u201d hair style, contradicted only by the testimony of the appellant that he had a \u201cbuckwheat\u201d hair arrangement. \u201cIt has been consistently held that in order to overturn a judgment entered on the verdict of a jury for insufficiency of the evidence, it is necessary that there be no legally sufficient evidence or inferences drawable therefrom on which the jury could find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Agresti v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 278, 284 (1968). We cannot make that finding on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">It is next contended that the trial judge erred in permitting the state to inquire of appellant\u2019s mother about the results of a lie detector test given her and her husband thereby allegedly forcing appellant\u2019s trial counsel to object and leave the jury with the impression the results were unfavorable to appellant. The record indicates that the following colloquy took place during the state\u2019s cross-examination of the appellant\u2019s mother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201cBY MR. LYONS [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">Q. Mrs. Price, you cooperated with the police? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Q. You did whatever you could for them? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">Q. And as part of your cooperation, you even agreed to take a polygraphic examination, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">Q. Do you know what a polygraphic examination is? A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Q. And do you know the results of that examination? A. I know what they said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">MR. MITCHELL [Appellant\u2019s Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">THE COURT: Sustained. Mrs. Price, you don\u2019t have to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">BY MR. LYONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">Q. Do you know also if your husband did take the polygraphic test? A. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">Q. Do you know the results of that? A. No. I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">MR. MITCHELL: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-14\">MR. LEE [Appellant\u2019s Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-15\">THE COURT: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">We think the issue cannot be properly raised for the first time in this appeal. The questions with respect to the taking of the polygraph tests were not objected to at the time they were propounded and when an objection was interposed to the questions concerning the results of the tests, appellant\u2019s objections were sustained. Maryland Rule 1085. There was no request for a curative instruction or an admonition to the jury and, as it appears in the record, the trial judge accorded the appellant all that he asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-17\">It is next contended that the trial court \u201cerred in permitting the State to inquire as to Appellant\u2019s alleged past criminal activity of which Appellant had not been convicted at the time of trial.\u201d The contention is based upon the state\u2019s cross-examination of appellant\u2019s step-father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-18\">\u201cQ. How was Wendall [appellant] doing in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>A. He was doing good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">Q. He was doing well here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Q. Had Wendall been in any trouble here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">MR. MITCHELL: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">MR. LEE: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">BY MR. LYONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">Q.

MITCHELL: May we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">THE COURT: You have made the point on your objection. No, you may not. I overrule your objection. You may answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-15\">BY MR. LYONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-16\">Q.

And what type trouble was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-19\">A. Him and another boy was picked up for collecting March of Dimes money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-20\">Q. Were they also picked up for anything else? Was Wendall picked up for anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-21\">MR. LEE: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-22\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-23\">You may answer, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-24\">A. Beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-25\">BY MR. LYONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-26\">Q. Was he also picked up for something else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-27\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-28\">Q. What else was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-29\">A. Some boys attacked a man and said that he was involved in some way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-30\">Q. I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-31\">MR. LEE: We would object and move to strike, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-32\">THE COURT: Denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>It is, of course, well settled that evidence of an accused\u2019s prior arrest, indictment or criminal activity, not resulting in conviction, is ordinarily not admissible. <em>Arbaugh v. Director, </em>27 Md. App. 662 (1975); <em>McLaughlin v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 515, 524 (1967). In order, however properly to assess the contention appellant here makes, the questions propounded by the state on cross-examination and the answers elicited must be viewed in the context of the step-father\u2019s testimony on direct examination. The step-father had been asked by appellant\u2019s counsel why appellant was sent to North Carolina two days after the murder. The step-father stated that he and appellant\u2019s mother had discussed on several prior occasions the desirability of sending appellant to North Carolina for schooling, although conceding he was presently doing well in school here. The step-father further stated that on the Sunday morning after the Friday night murder and the appellant\u2019s questioning by the police on Saturday, he found a hunting knife on top of a cabinet in their home which appellant acknowledged to be his. According to the step-father, \u201cI was upset by him having the knife and told him he was going to have to go to North Carolina * * *. I told him that he was going to pack his clothes. He was going on the next bus and the wife called the station to find out what time the next bus left and she put him on it.\u201d The purpose of this testimony, obviously, was to establish the reason appellant went to North Carolina and to allay any suspicion that the trip was made because of the murder and questioning of the appellant by the police. It was in this context that the trial court ruled on the above set forth questions by the state on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In discussing the principles of excluding prior criminal conduct, it is stated in <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>ch. 17, \u00a7 157:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201cThe rule is that the prosecution may not introduce evidence of other criminal acts of the accused unless the evidence is substantially relevant for some other purpose than to show a probability that he committed the crime on trial because he is a man of criminal character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We think a fair reading of the challenged questions and answers demonstrates that the questions were not propounded for the purpose of showing a probability that appellant participated in the murder and robbery. Rather, they were asked in further exploration of the reason the appellant went to North Carolina shortly after the murder. In fact, the appellant concedes that the questions and answers \u201cfurthers, rather than weakens, the appellant\u2019s position\u201d for they tended to show that \u201cappellant\u2019s parents were having a supervisory problem with him and that this was the reason he was sent to North Carolina * * *.\u201d Moreover, the jury was advised, by way of stipulation, that the man the step-father said the appellant attacked had told the prosecutor that appellant was not the individual involved in the assault upon him. Under all the circumstances, we cannot find error in the trial'judge\u2019s ruling on the challenged questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Finally, it is contended that the trial court \u201cerred in permitting the State to use a statement of appellant given the police to cross-examine and impeach appellant when the State in response to appellant\u2019s discovery motion misled the appellant into believing that the State did not have or would not use any such statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The record indicates that in response to discovery procedures taken by appellant, pursuant to Maryland Rule 728, the state replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201cThe Defendant made no oral or written statement to any agent or office of the State, in response to any question asked of him, following his arrest, which the State intends to introduce into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">At trial, over appellant\u2019s protest, the state was permitted, in cross-examining appellant, to use a statement he had given to the police, shortly after his arrest, for the purpose of impeaching his testimony that he had never owned a gun. In the statement to the police, appellant admitted having previously owned or possessed handguns. One of the police officers who interrogated appellant was also permitted to testify in rebuttal concerning appellant\u2019s admission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>owning or possessing guns. Appellant\u2019s motions for a mistrial at the conclusion of the cross-examination and at the conclusion of the officer\u2019s testimony in rebuttal were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">When the prosecutor first apprised the court and appellant\u2019s counsel that he intended to use the statement given to the police by the appellant, counsel for appellant were permitted to read the statement which was in the form of handwritten notes taken by the officer during the interrogation. The prosecutor explained that he had permitted appellant\u2019s counsel to inspect the state\u2019s file but admitted \u201cI did not show him everything * * Later on, the prosecutor stated to the court that \u201cI was assuming in rebuttal or cross-examination that there would be a statement I could use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The appellant concedes that there are no sanctions for the state\u2019s violation of Maryland Rule 728 <em>(Powell v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 666 (1974)), but argues that \u201cappellant\u2019s constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel and due process of law\u201d were violated by the state\u2019s \u201cdeceptive and misleading tactics * * *. \u201d While we certainly agree that the conduct of the prosecutor was anything but commendable, we cannot find, under all the circumstances, that there was such an invasion of appellant\u2019s rights to effective assistance of counsel and due process as to compel a reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
