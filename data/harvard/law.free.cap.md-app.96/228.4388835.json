Mr. Tognocchi was killed while operating a UNO-33E manlift manufactured by Figgie International, Inc., Snorkel-Economy Division (Snorkel). Following Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s death, his wife, Virginia Tognocchi, and his son, Scott C. Tognocchi, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Snorkel and against the lessor of the manlift.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint contained claims for wrongful death on behalf of Mrs. Tognocchi as surviving spouse and on behalf of the Tognocchi\u2019s son and their minor daughter, Dawn. The complaint also contained personal representative\u2019s survival claims on behalf of Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The matter proceeded to trial before a jury, and at the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the court granted Snorkel\u2019s motion for judgment on the issue of punitive damages. At the conclusion of all the evidence, Snorkel argued that it was entitled to judgment since the uncontradicted evidence established, as a matter of law, that Mr. Tognocchi had assumed the risk of his injury. Snorkel also raised the issue of its duty to warn. The court denied Snorkel\u2019s motion, and submitted the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">On October 18, 1991, the jury returned a special verdict in which it awarded damages for economic loss of $704,000 to Mrs. Tognocchi, $278,000 to her minor daughter, and $85,000 to her son. With regard to noneconomic damages, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>awarded $675,000 to Mrs. Tognocchi and $650,000 to her daughter. Mrs. Tognocchi was also awarded $250,000 for loss of household services and $12,000 for counseling expenses. So, too, her daughter was awarded $8,000 for counseling expenses. On the survival claim, the jury awarded $125,000 to Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s estate for his pain and suffering. For Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s funeral expenses, the jury awarded $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Snorkel subsequently filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion to conform the verdict to \u00a7 11-108 of the Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. On March 9, 1992, the court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and granted the motion to reduce the damages award in accord with \u00a7 11-108. On March 19, 1992, the court entered final judgment reducing Mrs. Tognocchi\u2019s award for noneconomic damages from $675,000 to $178,000 and similarly reducing Dawn\u2019s award for noneconomic damages from $650,-000 to $171,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The $125,000 awarded to the estate for Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s pain and suffering was unchanged. On April 9, 1992, Snorkel filed its appeal, and on April 13, 1992, the Tognocchis filed their cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Snorkel presents the following questions for us to decide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">1. Did Appellees\u2019 decedent assume the risk of injury, as a matter of law, when he, knowing that a prior operator of a manlift had been seriously injured, voluntarily drove the same manlift down the same slope, in the same configuration and in the same manner as the prior operator while attempting, before a video camera, to investigate or illustrate the prior accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">2. Did the decedent\u2019s conduct, in using the manlift to ascertain or illustrate how the previous accident happened, constitute product misuse as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">3. Did the manufacturer of the manlift owe [the] decedent a duty to warn him that the vehicle had a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>propensity, when he already knew that it had caused serious injury to a prior operator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">A. Did the trial judge err in refusing to grant the manufacturer\u2019s motions for judgment and j.rno.v. as to its alleged failure to warn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">B. Did the trial judge err in refusing to instruct the jury that a manufacturer need not warn users of known dangers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">4. Did the trial judge err in admitting evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by the manufacturer of a manlift for the purpose of establishing an alleged negligent failure to warn <em>of </em>a product defect and alleged manufacturer culpability, when the manufacturer did not contest feasibility?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The Tognocehis\u2019 cross-appeal presents several other questions for us to resolve:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">1. Was Snorkel\u2019s Notice of Appeal filed more than thirty days after the entry of final judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">2. Did the legislature intend to exclude the cap from wrongful death actions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">3. Was the trial court correct in applying a separate cap to the claim by the estate as opposed to the wrongful death claimants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">4. Did the trial court err in applying an aggregate cap to Virginia and Dawn Tognocchi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">5. Does an aggregate cap violate the equal protection clause and right to trial by jury of the United States Constitution and Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">6. Did the trial court err in refusing to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Central to the facts of this case is the UNO-33E manufactured by Snorkel. The UNO-33E is a \u201ccherry-picker\u201d type manlift that has a basket attached to the end of a boom, and the operator controls -the machine while standing in the basket. The basket is located over a wheel base that rotates 180 degrees. This allows the operator to drive the manlift in the \u201cforward\u201d configuration, with the basket centered over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>drive wheels, or in the \u201creverse\u201d configuration, with the basket centered over the steer wheels.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">On June 19, 1989, AAI employee Roy Flaharty drove the lift, in the reverse configuration, down a slope. As he did so, the lift accelerated and then stopped suddenly. At that point, the rear wheels of the vehicle rose into the air and Flaharty was thrown upward and forward in the basket. Flaharty was seriously injured as a consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">AAI then assigned Mr. Tognocchi, its Assistant Safety Director, to investigate the Flaharty accident. Mr. Tognocchi was an engineer with more than twenty years of experience in industrial safety. During the course of the investigation, Mr. Tognocchi consulted with Gary Wampler, a representative of Snorkel. Wampler had come to AAI to test the unit that had been driven by Flaharty. On June 20, 1989, with Tognocchi and several others present, Wampler drove the unit up and down the slope in both the forward and reverse configurations without incident. It was then collectively decided that the Flaharty accident was the result of operator error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Notwithstanding this conclusion, Tognocchi maintained the vehicle in a red-tagged status and did not allow it to be returned to service. On June 23, 1989, while in the presence of Alfred Young, in-house counsel for AAI, Mr. Tognocchi drove the manlift. Young videotaped the events as Mr. Tognocchi drove the manlift down the slope in the forward configuration and then in the reverse configuration. Mr. Tognocchi drove the lift in the reverse configuration only a short distance when the lift suddenly pitched forward. The rear wheels came several feet off the ground, and Mr. Tognocchi was catapulted against the controls. He died as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">I. Timeliness of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Preliminarily, the Tognocchis argue that Snorkel did not file its notice of appeal within thirty days of the entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 8-202. The Tognocchis contend that the memoranda filed by the court on March 9, 1992 constituted a final, appealable judgment. In order for a judgment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>be final and appealable, two criteria must be met: first, the judgment must settle the rights of the parties thereby concluding the cause of action, and second, the judgment must be entered on the docket. <em>Estep v. Georgetown Leather Design, </em>320 Md. 277, 282, 577 A.2d 78 (1990). The docket sheet reflects that final judgment was entered on March 19, 1992. Snorkel\u2019s April 9, 1992 notice of appeal was, therefore, timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">II. Assumption of Risk</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Snorkel contends that Mr. Tognocchi was attempting to replicate the Flaharty accident, and in so doing, Mr. Tognocchi assumed the risk as a matter of law. To assume the risk, Mr. Tognocchi must have known and appreciated the risk and must have voluntarily chosen to encounter it. <em>Schroyer v. McNeal, </em>323 Md. 275, 282, 592 A.2d 1119 (1991). The test of whether an individual knows of and appreciates the risk in a certain situation is an objective one and is a question that is usually to be resolved by the jury. <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283, 592 A.2d 1119. \u201c[T]he doctrine of assumption of risk will not be applied unless the undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences therefrom <em>clearly </em>establish that the risk of danger was <em>fully </em>known to and understood by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Kasten Constr. Co. v. Evans, </em>260 Md. 536, 544, 273 A.2d 90 (1971) (emphasis in original, citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Despite Snorkel\u2019s assertions, it is far from clear that any risk of danger, much less this risk of danger, was known to and was voluntarily encountered by Mr. Tognocchi. Snorkel first contends that Mr. Tognocchi knew the circumstances of the Flaharty accident. The evidence on this point is not as definitive as Snorkel would like us to believe. Mr. Tognocchi was not present at the time of the Flaharty accident. Anything that he might have been told about the accident came from persons who may have observed the incident but who were ultimately forced to speculate about what precise actions Mr. Flaharty took or failed to take while he was alone in the operator\u2019s basket. Regardless of any such speculation, the consensus reached by Snorkel\u2019s representative and by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Tognocchi was that operator error caused the Flaharty accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This conclusion was reached after Snorkel\u2019s representative, Gary Wampler, drove the manlift in the reverse configuration down the same slope as Flaharty had driven it. After doing .so, Wampler reported that the unit was safe, and the evidence shows that Mr. Tognocchi believed Wampler\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The unit was not immediately returned to service, however, pending additional testing by Mr. Tognocchi to further explore the idiosyncracies, if any, of this lift particularly with regard to braking. When driven down the slope subsequent to the Flaharty accident, the lift was observed to skid to a stop. Such skidding was not considered by anyone, including Snorkel, to be unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On the day of the videotaping, Mr. Tognocchi drove the lift down the slope first in the forward configuration and then in the reverse configuration. Young testified that \u201cthere was never any impression in [his] mind at any time that Mr. Tognocchi intended to replicate the circumstances of the Flaharty accident.\u201d Rather, the purpose was to demonstrate how the equipment operated and to deduce how the Flaharty accident could have occurred if Mr. Tognocchi had operated the lift in the same manner as did Flaharty.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">On his first \u201crun\u201d down the slope, Mr. Tognocchi drove the lift in the forward configuration, and some skidding occurred as he brought the machine to a stop. Mr. Tognocchi then rotated the lift to the reverse configuration. Before proceeding down the slope, it appears from the videotape that Mr. Tognocchi commented to Mr. Young, \u201cI\u2019m going to take it down the other way. I think we\u2019ll get some more impact. Okay ... I think this is the way it was.\u201d Mr. Tognocchi drove only a few feet when the lift stopped suddenly and pitched. He was thrown forward and upward into the control panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Snorkel points to Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s comment concerning \u201cimpact\u201d as definitive proof that he intended to replicate the circumstances of the Flaharty accident and, therefore, assumed the risk of his injuries as a matter of law. We believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that there are several inferences that may be drawn from Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s comment and that, in light of these multiple inferences, the issue of assumption of risk was a question for the jury to decide. It may be that Mr. Tognocchi used the word \u201cimpact\u201d not in the sense of a forcible contact, but rather in the sense of producing greater demonstrative effect. Perhaps Mr. Tognocchi thought that by operating the lift in the reverse configuration, he could better capture on film any likelihood of the machine to skid and could subsequently use the film as a training guide to inform operators of the lift\u2019s characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">While it is, of course, possible to infer that Mr. Tognocchi sought to replicate the circumstances of the Flaharty accident, such an inference seems, at best, implausible to us. Whatever he knew or did not know of the precise circumstances surrounding the Flaharty accident (including the pitching that occurred), Mr. Tognocchi was well aware that Flaharty sustained serious injury. It hardly seems likely that an engineer, with over twenty years of experience concerning industrial equipment and whose responsibility it was to ensure the safety of numerous employees, would have undertaken to replicate the circumstances of an accident that he knew resulted in serious injury. In addition, it would not have been possible for him to replicate the accident since no one knew what caused Flaharty\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We offer our impression not as the correct or only inference that could have been drawn from the evidence, but to illustrate the point that the evidence was susceptible to more than one inference. In order to prevail on its contention that Mr. Tognocchi assumed the risk as a matter of law, Snorkel was required to prove that the \u201c \u2018undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences therefrom <em>clearly </em>established] that the risk of danger was known to and <em>understood </em>by [Mr. Tognocchi].\u2019 \u201d <em>Kahlenberg v. Goldstein, </em>290 Md. 477, 494-495, 431 A.2d 76 (1981) (quoting <em>Kasten Construction Co., </em>260 Md. at 544, 273 A.2d 90). As we have decided that conflicting permissible inferences could have been drawn from the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>dence, it follows, then, that the question of assumption of risk was a question for the jury to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">III. Product Misuse</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Snorkel next contends that Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s conduct in using the manlift to ascertain or to illustrate how the previous accident occurred constituted product misuse as a matter of law and should have served as a bar to recovery. Snorkel\u2019s argument is premised on the assumption that Mr. Tognocehi sought to replicate or did in fact replicate the circumstances surrounding the Flaharty accident. As discussed above, the evidence on this issue was not so compelling as to warrant a finding as a matter of law. The evidence, even though now couched in terms of product misuse, was still subject to various interpretations and, as such, created a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">IY. Duty to Warn</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In its motions for judgment and for j.rno.v., Snorkel argued, as it does on appeal, that \u201cit owed no duty, as a matter of law, to warn Tognocehi of the propensity of the manlift to pitch, since the undisputed evidence at trial demonstrated that Tognocehi was aware of the hazard.\u201d Again, on this issue, the evidence is not as clear as Snorkel contends. While it is true that in Maryland there is no duty to warn someone of an obvious danger or of a danger of which he is already aware, <em>Banks v. Iron Hustler Corp., </em>59 Md.App. 408, 423, 475 A.2d 1243 (1984), it is equally true:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Whether a particular danger is obvious or patent can depend on a number of things \u2014 the complexity of the machine, the knowledge, age, background, experience, intelligence, and training of the person injured, the extent to which his required contact with the device is routine and repetitive, whether he is subject to distractions, for example. It necessarily is a question of fact then, and, if there is any dispute about it, the question is for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGF\"><em>Banks, </em>59 Md.App. at 424, 475 A.2d 1243 (citations omitted, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Snorkel argues, \u201cBecause Tognocchi possessed actual knowledge of the propensity of the manlift to cause injury under the circumstances, Snorkel had no duty, as a matter of law, to warn him.\u201d If Mr. Tognocchi did possess actual knowledge of the propensity of the manlift to cause injury \u201cunder the circumstances,\u201d the question then becomes, under what circumstances? Under the circumstances of the Flaharty accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The Flaharty accident was the only other incident known to anyone at AAI in which a Snorkelift pitched. Wampler subsequently tested the same lift and pronounced it safe. As a result, the Flaharty accident was blamed on operator error. This, once again, returns us to the question of whether Mr. Tognocchi sought to recreate the circumstances of the Flaharty accident. We need not reiterate our analysis of the evidence on this issue, but we simply state that, for the reasons delineated above, this was a question for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Snorkel further argues that the trial court erroneously refused Snorkel\u2019s request for an instruction that it owed no duty to warn Mr. Tognocchi of known dangers. Among other things, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">[T]he manufacturer is not responsible for injuries caused by danger which is apparent to the user.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">You are instructed there is no duty on a manufacturer to warn of open and obvious dangers associated with the use, operation or functioning of its products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">Now, where a dangerous condition is not obvious and is hidden, it should be disclosed to the user. Thus, if you find that the danger of the machine suddenly tipping or pitching forward is not one that is obvious to the operator of the machine, then the defendant manufacturer, Figgie, had a duty to warn the operator of the danger. However, if you find that the danger of the machine suddenly tipping or pitching forward is one that is obvious to the operator of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>machine, then the defendant manufacturer has no duty to warn the operator of that danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We conclude that the court did not err and that Snorkel\u2019s request was fairly covered by the instructions actually given. Maryland Rule 2-520.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">V. Subsequent Remedial Measures</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">After Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s accident, Snorkel issued a product safety bulletin that provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">WHEN DRIVING WITH THE BOOMS NESTED, THE TURNTABLE MUST ALWAYS BE ROTATED SO THE STEERING WHEELS ARE IN THE FRONT OF THE UNIT WITH THE COUNTERWEIGHT ABOVE THESE WHEELS. The drive wheels should be at the rear of the unit nearest the platform. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">It has come to our attention that some operators are driving the unit with the turntable rotated 180 degrees so that the drive wheels are in the forward position under the counterweights and the steering wheels are in the aft position just in front of the platform. Braking the unit while driving in this position can result in very abrupt stops. This abruptness can result in injuries to an operator from being thrown about the platform. This is especially true when driving in this reversed position down a slope where faster than usual speeds may be attained if coasting is allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_1\">Snorkel also issued revised decals to be affixed to its manlifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The court admitted these documents into evidence, and Snorkel contends that, in so doing, the court erred. Snorkel cites <em>Troja v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>62 Md.App. 101, 105, 488 A.2d 516, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 471, 494 A.2d 939 (1985), for the proposition that subsequent remedial measures are inadmissible in product liability cases to show manufacturer wrongdoing. <em>See also, Wilson v. Morris, </em>317 Md. 284, 296, 563 A.2d 392 (1989). Snorkel further contends that the exception allowing evidence of subsequent remedial measures for another purpose such as impeachment, proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures (if feasibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>is controverted), <em>Troja, </em>62 Md.App. at 115, 488 A.2d 516, is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">By relying on <em>Troja, </em>Snorkel attempts to sidestep the \u201cstandard of care exception\u201d discussed in <em>Wilson, </em>317 Md. at 298-302, 563 A.2d 392. The standard of care exception allows evidence of subsequent remedial measures if that evidence is used to provide \u201c \u2018circumstantial proof that the applicable standard of care had not been met at the time of the accident or other occurrence in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>317 Md. at 298, 563 A.2d 392 (quoting 5 L. McLain, <em>Maryland Practice: Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 407.1, at 410 (1987, 1989 Supp.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The Snorkelift product engineer testified that, prior to June, 1989 (the time of Mr. Tognoechi\u2019s accident), he did not drive the UNO-33E in the reverse configuration down slopes because he knew that there could be difficulties or problems. He also testified that, \u201cif anyone had asked,\u201d Snorkel\u2019s recommendation with regard to driving the UNO-33E down slopes would have been to operate the machine in the forward configuration, not in the reverse configuration. The engineer also added that \u201cnothing has changed between June of \u201989 and now relative to driving in that position [the reverse configuration].\u201d In light of this evidence, the safety bulletin and decal were admissible as circumstantial proof that the applicable standard of care had not been met at the time of Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s accident. <em>Wilson, </em>317 Md. at 298, 563 A.2d 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">VI. Application of Courts Article, \u00a7 11-108 to Wrongful Death Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Section 11-108 of the Courts Article establishes a cap of $350,000 for noneconomic damages that may be awarded in a personal injury action. In the case now before us, the trial court applied \u00a7 11-108 to the noneconomic damages awarded to Mrs. Tognocchi and to her daughter on their wrongful death claims. The court reduced Mrs. Tognocchi\u2019s award for noneconomic damages from $675,000 to $178,300 and similarly reduced Dawn\u2019s award for noneconomic damages from $650,-000 to $171,000. As a result, the aggregate amount of noneconomic damages awarded on the wrongful death claims totalled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>$350,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No adjustment was made to the $125,000 amount awarded to Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s estate on the survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Tognocchis contest the application of \u00a7 11-108 to their wrongful death claims and argue that, even if the cap is applicable, it should not be applied in the aggregate. \u25a0 Lengthy discussion on these issues is unnecessary in light of <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 620 A.2d 905 (1993). In <em>Streidel, </em>329 Md. at 537, 620 A.2d 905, the Court of Appeals overruled <em>Potomac Electric v. Smith, </em>79 Md.App. 591, 558 A.2d 768, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 393, 564 A.2d 407 (1989), and held \u201cthat the damages cap in \u00a7 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article does not apply to wrongful death actions.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) We shall, therefore, remand this case so that the trial court may reinstate the awards for noneconomic damages as rendered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">VII. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The Tognocchis\u2019 last assignment of error concerns the trial court\u2019s refusal to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time this case was tried, \u201cimplied malice\u201d was the standard for imposition of punitive damages in non-intentional tort cases. <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Co., </em>267 Md. 149, 297 A.2d 721 (1972). The Court of Appeals overruled <em>Smith, </em>however, and established an \u201cactual malice\u201d standard with regard to the imposition of punitive damages in products liability cases. <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 462, 601 A.2d 633 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court defined actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>malice as \u201cactual knowledge of the defect and deliberate disregard of the consequences.\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 462, 601 A.2d 633. The Court further opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">Therefore, in order for actual malice to be found in a products liability case, regardless of whether the cause of action for compensatory damages is based on negligence or strict liability, the plaintiff must prove (1) actual knowledge of the defect on the part of the defendant, and (2) the defendant\u2019s conscious or deliberate disregard of the foreseeable harm resulting from the defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">The knowledge component, which we hold is necessary to support an award of punitive damages, does <em>not </em>mean \u2018constructive knowledge\u2019 or \u2018substantial knowledge\u2019 or \u2018should have known.\u2019 More is required to expose a defendant to a potential punitive damages award. The plaintiff must show that the defendant <em>actually </em>knew of the defect and of the danger of the product at the time the product left the defendant\u2019s possession or control. [Emphasis in original; footnotes and citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">Furthermore, the plaintiff is required to show that, armed with this actual knowledge, the defendant consciously or deliberately disregarded the potential harm to consumers.... We [adopt] the characterization \u2018conscious or deliberate disregard,\u2019 and emphatically state that negligence alone, no matter how gross, wanton, or outrageous, will not satisfy this standard. Instead the test requires a bad faith decision by the defendant to market a product, knowing of the defect and danger, in conscious or deliberate disregard of the threat to the safety of the consumer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\"><em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 462-463, 601 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s estate argues that punitive damages were appropriate because Snorkel knew of the tendency of the machine to pitch and still refused to issue a warning or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>remove the lift from the market. The evidence certainly demonstrates that Snorkel was aware that there could be problems if the lift were driven down a slope in the reverse configuration. Snorkel\u2019s concern stemmed primarily from the fact that the controls would be reversed thereby increasing operator confusion. With regard to the lift pitching, Snorkel\u2019s concern focused on what might occur when the boom was elevated. After Wampler tested the machine, it was decided by all parties that operator error had been the cause of the Flaharty accident. While the wisdom of this conclusion may now be suspect, particularly in light of Mr. Tognocehi\u2019s death, we cannot say that the evidence was sufficient to show actual malice on the part of Snorkel so as to warrant submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT/CROSS APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">. The lessor, Seims Rental and Sales Company, Inc., is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\">. The aggregate amount of noneconomic damages was reduced from $1,325,000 to $350,000, in keeping with the $350,000 cap established in \u00a7 11-108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">. The jury did not award noneconomic damages to the Tognocchi\u2019s son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">. Punitive damages were sought only in connection with the estate\u2019s survival action; the Tognocchis did not seek punitive damages on their wrongful death claims. Had the Tognocchis requested punitive damages, their request would have been denied, as punitive damages are not recoverable in wrongful death actions. <em>Streidel, </em>329 Md. at 552, 620 A.2d 905.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\">. The Court decided that the new standard should be applied prospectively as well as retrospectively. <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 471, 601 A.2d 633. The Court also changed the burden of proof for punitive damages from a preponderance of the evidence to \"clear and convincing evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>dence\u2019\u2019 and ruled that the new burden of proof should not be applied retrospectively. <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 470, 601 A.2d 633. Thus, in order to recover punitive damages in this case, Mr. Tognocchi\u2019s estate must have shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, actual malice on the part of Snorkel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b272-8\">WENNER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The majority has concluded that the question of whether Tognocchi\u2019s use of the Snorkelift to ascertain or illustrate how the Flaharty accident happened was properly submitted to the jury. I most respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Snorkel contends that Tognoechi assumed the risk of injury as a matter of law while attempting to replicate the Flaharty accident. In doing so, Tognoechi drove the Snorkelift down the same ramp and in the same configuration that it had been driven by Flaharty when Flaharty was injured. I agree. In my opinion, just as <em>Ciriago v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 563, 471 A.2d 320, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 152, 476 A.2d 721 (1984), presented us with the \u201cvery model of the <em>bona fide </em>inventory of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>property ... [and] the very model of the spontaneous blurt,\u201d <em>Id., </em>57 Md.App. at 566, 471 A.2d 320, we are here presented with the very model of assumption of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Although I agree with the majority that \u201c[T]he doctrine of assumption of risk will not be applied unless the undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences therefrom clearly establish that the risk of danger was fully known to and understood by the plaintiff,\u201d I believe that that is exactly what we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In the first place, Tognocchi knew the circumstances of Flaharty\u2019s accident. Moreover, it is obvious that Tognocchi was not satisfied with the \u201cclean bill of health\u201d given the Snorkelift by Wampler, although Tognocchi was present during Wampler\u2019s examination of the machine. Despite Wampler\u2019s \u201cclean bill of health,\u201d Tognocchi continued to red-tag the Snorkelift because he believed there was \u201csomething peculiar about the brakes and the way the machine stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AhI\">Instead of obtaining an outside expert, Tognocchi himself conducted a further investigation of the Snorkelift. After arranging for Young to videotape his examination of the machine, Tognocchi drove the Snorkelift just as Flaharty had driven it. In fact, the transcript of the videotape reveals that Tognocchi reversed the configuration of the Snorkelift and said to Young, \u201cI\u2019m going to take it down the other way. I think we\u2019ll get some more impact. Okay ... I think this is the way it was.\u201d Under these circumstances, it is inconceivable to me that Tognocchi was doing anything other than replicating the Flaharty accident. Consequently, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s assertion that there were several inferences that could have been drawn from Tognocchi\u2019s comment. Thus, I conclude that Tognocchi assumed the risk of injury as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">As the Court of Appeals put it recently in <em>Schroyer v. McNeal, </em>323 Md. 275, 283-284, 592 A.2d 1119 (1991),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">The test of whether the plaintiff knows of, and appreciates, the risk involved in a particular situation is an objective one, ... and ordinarily is a question to be resolved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>jury---- Thus, \u201cthe doctrine of assumption of the risk -will not be applied unless the undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences therefrom <em>dearly </em>establish that the risk of danger was <em>fully </em>known to and <em>understood </em>by the plaintiff----\u201d On the other hand, when it is clear that a person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff must have understood the danger, the issue is for the court. (Emphasis in original. Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Under the circumstances that I have just described, it is absolutely clear to me that Tognocchi, a person of normal intelligence, must have understood the danger of operating the Snorkelift in the manner in which it had been operated by Flaharty at the time of his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Of course, there are circumstances under which one may knowingly and intentionally undertake an action that he or she knows exposes him or her to risk without foreclosing his or her ability to recover for injuries sustained as a consequence. For example, if a tenant in an apartment complex attempts to traverse an icy sidewalk that is the tenant\u2019s only means of egress from the tenant\u2019s apartment, the doctrine of assumption of the risk would not apply because taking the risk is neither voluntary nor unreasonable. The tenant\u2019s alternative would constitute a form of imprisonment. <em>See, Rountree v. Lerner Dev. Co., 52 </em>Md.App. 281, 285-86, 447 A.2d 902 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Thus, when one is confronted with a Hobson\u2019s choice, that is, either take a risk or give up a valuable right, <em>e.g., </em>reaching one\u2019s place of employment, the reasonableness of taking the risk is a question for the jury. Nonetheless, Tognocchi was under no such compulsion. I would reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Judges Bloom and Harrell have authorized me to say that they join in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
