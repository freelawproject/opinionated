Goldberg, now 44, and Anita M. Goldberg,- now 41, were married in 1971. They have two children: Nicole, born June 13, 1976, and Jeffrey, born July 25, 1979. During their marriage, Mr. Goldberg worked long hours outside the home \u2014 first for a family trucking company and then as a real estate developer and investor and as the chief executive officer of a clothing manufacturer. On the other hand, Ms. Goldberg, although employed part time as a travel agent, spent most of her married life in equally long hours working in activities centered around the home involved with being a wife and mother. The parties accumulated substantial assets during their marriage. When the trial of this case began on January 22, 1992, the parties agreed that they had been separated since October 14, 1989, and that the separation was mutual and voluntary with the express intent and purpose of ending their marriage. Virtually every other issue, except for custody of their children, was vigorously contested. As to custody, it was agreed that Mr. and Ms. Goldberg would have joint custody of Nicole and Jeffrey; Nicole\u2019s primary residence would be with her mother and Jeffrey\u2019s would be with his father. After seven days of testimony, this agreement was repudiated by Jeffrey\u2019s counsel and by Ms. Goldberg and so the custody and primary residence of Jeffrey also became a contested issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Judge Dana Levitz of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County heard a total of nine days of testimony from numerous witnesses including four experts, and received into evidence 115 exhibits. At the conclusion of the testimony the court reviewed extensive proposed findings of fact submitted by the parties and heard closing argument for approximately three hours. On March 4, 1992, Judge Levitz issued a sensitive, well reasoned, 31 page opinion in which he meticulously made numerous findings of fact, explained the basis for those find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>ings, and carefully applied the law to the facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Goldberg appeals, raising five questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">1. Did the lower court err in the monetary award</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">A. By adding all values and then subtracting the total of the marital debt father than subtracting marital debt from the value of each item of marital property and then totalling the net values?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">B. By utilizing incorrect appraisals or methods?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">2. Did the court err in determining alimony, child support and the monetary award</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">A. Did the court err in finding as a fact husband\u2019s ability to earn $400,000.00 a year when husband\u2019s employment ended without fault of husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">B. Was child support based upon erroneously attributed income?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">C. Was alimony based upon erroneously attributed income?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">3. Should custody of the son have been awarded to husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">4. Was the removal of husband as custodian of Uniform Gifts to Minors Act Accounts in error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">5. Was the award of counsel fees and costs to wife excessive?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">Ms. Goldberg cross appeals, conditionally, asking us to consider the following issues only if we determine a remand is necessary because of the questions raised by Mr. Goldberg\u2019s appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-16\">6. Did the trial court err when it subtracted appellant\u2019s debt from marital property without first determining that it was marital debt and was appellant harmed by the error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-17\">7. Did the trial court err when it failed to award indefinite alimony to appellee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>8. Did the trial court err in failing to award more of appellee\u2019s counsel fees and costs to her?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Mr. Goldberg initially asserts that the circuit court erred in two respects in making a monetary award to Ms. Goldberg. Both involve the valuation of the marital assets. Mr. Goldberg\u2019s principal claim of error is that the court relied upon \u201cincorrect appraisal methodology\u201d in determining the value of marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In making the monetary award, the circuit court first determined which assets were marital property and then individually valued each of the assets. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol., 1992 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 8-203, 8-204 of the Family Law Article. Specifically, the court found that Ms. Goldberg\u2019s total assets had a value of $240,000, that she had \u201cno significant debts\u201d and that \u201cthe marital portion of those assets is $163,000; the non-marital portion is $75,000.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It found that Mr. Goldberg had assets of $2,950,000 and liabilities of approximately $996,-000 for a net worth of $1,954,000; it further found that $1,899,000 of Mr. Goldberg\u2019s \u201cnet worth is marital [assets] and $55,000 is non marital.\u201d Mr. Goldberg claimed below that certain assets titled in his name were his property alone; the circuit court rejected this claim, finding all five of these disputed assets marital property. On appeal Mr. Goldberg does not assert that the court erred in any way in determining which property was marital and which was non-marital.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Mr. Goldberg does vehemently assert, however, that the circuit court erred in valuing some of the marital property. Approximately $1 million of the marital property, titled in Mr. Goldberg\u2019s name, was real estate and bank accounts, marketable securities, or other liquid assets; Mr. Goldberg does not dispute the value given to this portion of the marital property. The remainder of the marital assets that were titled in Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Goldberg\u2019s name were interests in partnerships or closely held corporations or demand notes owed by the closely held corporations to Mr. Goldberg. It is the values the circuit court placed on some of these interests that Mr. Goldberg claims is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We note at the-outset that many witnesses \u2014 including Mr. Goldberg\u2019s own accountant \u2014 testified that Mr. Goldberg was, as the circuit court found, \u201can astute, diligent and cautious investor.\u201d His net worth statements indicated that in the recent past virtually all of his assets were liquid. The parties came to own \u201cilliquid\u201d assets because, as the circuit court noted, \u201c[sjince 1987 when [Mr. Goldberg] first suggested a divorce ... he has invested approximately two million dollars of liquid assets into businesses and ventures that are extremely illiquid and whose values in the interim appear to be depressed because of the current economy.\u201d Judge Levitz further found that Mr. Goldberg</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN5\">was astute enough when he invested to believe that the effect of these investments would cause their value to appear to be less in the short term for the purposes of these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We have carefully reviewed the enormous record \u2014 there is certainly substantial support for these findings. Mr. Goldberg\u2019s own expert conceded on cross examination that over the \u201ccourse of the last two years\u201d Mr. Goldberg \u201ctook $2j\u00e9 to $3 million in liquid assets\u201d and put them into partnerships and closely held corporations. Mr. Goldberg\u2019s net worth statements also reflect this change in investment strategy. Perhaps for those reasons, Mr. Goldberg does not directly challenge these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">He does assert, however, that the circuit court improperly valued these illiquid assets. The lower court heard extensive testimony from Mr. Goldberg and four experts as to the value of these assets. The court noted that it had considered and found \u201chelpful\u201d the testimony of all four experts, and believed \u201csome, but not all of the testimony of each of the expert witnesses.\u201d The valuations found by the circuit court reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>precisely this. Thus, although only Mr. Goldberg asserts that the circuit court\u2019s valuation of these \u201cilliquid\u201d assets was error, the circuit court did not by any means accept <em>all </em>the evaluations placed on them by Ms. Goldberg\u2019s expert, Dennis Weiner. Indeed, Judge Levitz accepted the valuations of Mr. Goldberg\u2019s expert as to a number of assets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The circuit court remarked that it was \u201cparticularly impressed with the professional manner in which Mr. [Dennis] Weiner [Ms. Goldberg\u2019s expert] testified.\u201d Again, the record contains a sound basis for this finding. Mr. Weiner, a certified public accountant, was a friend of both Mr. and Ms. Goldberg. He had worked as <em>Mr. </em>Goldberg\u2019s accountant in the past and was able to testify only because Mr. Goldberg waived the possible conflict. Mr. Weiner testified that, when he reviewed Mr. Goldberg\u2019s records for the divorce case, he found them in \u201cdisarray\u201d and they were given to him \u201chelterskelter,\u201d although in the past when he worked for Mr. Goldberg, the records had always been \u201cvery orderly and organized.\u201d Mr. Weiner testified that in valuing these properties he attempted to determine their fair market value, which he defined as \u201cwhat a willing buyer would pay and a seller accepts, neither being compelled to enter into the transaction.\u201d In formulating his valuations, he interviewed Mr. Goldberg, his accountants, and Gary Gomber, Mr. Goldberg\u2019s comptroller. Mr. Weiner examined all of the records provided to him, which included bank statements, cancelled checks, working papers of Mr. Goldberg\u2019s accountants, copies of tax returns, agreements, correspondence, and \u201creams of [other] papers.\u201d Mr. Weiner testified that he was not provided all the information that he had requested and that, if he had been, his valuations would probably have been higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Mr. Weiner further explained that his methodologies for valuing the <em>assets </em>\u2014 i.e., adjusted historical cost, capitalization of earnings, etc. \u2014 were set forth in a manual \u201csubjected to a peer review and accepted by the practice [sic] companies practice section and the SEC practice section of ... the American Institute of CPAs,\u201d of which he was a member. He specifically described the reason for using a particular methodology for a particular piece of property. Many of the valuations disputed by Mr. Goldberg were based on an adjusted historical cost methodology. Mr. Weiner explained that when companies were newly formed or being developed by Mr. Goldberg, there was no past income or earnings on which to base a value. Because these investments were recently made by Mr. Goldberg, in an arms length transaction, and because Mr. Goldberg was known as an astute, cautious business investor, Mr. Weiner determined to value these properties at their adjusted historical <em>cost </em>\u2014 i.e., how much Mr. Goldberg had recently invested in the corporation or partnership. This methodology was a \u201cmost conservative\u201d one, Mr. Weiner asserted, because it assumed that Mr. Goldberg would only recover his costs and make no profit at all on any of these investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We have reviewed the record and find, as the circuit court did, that Mr. Weiner\u2019s testimony was, indeed, \u201cimpressive\u201d; his valuations appear to be solidly based on the facts available to him and a recognized methodology. It well may be that adjusted historical cost is not often an appropriate valuation method. This method, however, appears an entirely appropriate way to evaluate some of the assets at issue in this case, involving as they did, interests in newly formed companies without any earning or profit history, recently purchased by a sophisticated, cautious investor in arms length transactions. As Mr. Goldberg acknowledges, a trial court is afforded \u201cdiscretion ... in accepting or rejecting evidence to arrive at valuations for determining marital property.\u201d In <em>Quinn v. Quinn, </em>83 Md.App. 460, 470, 575 A.2d 764 (1990) we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Where, as here, there are two experts, the trier of fact must evaluate the testimony of both of them and decide which opinion, if any, to accept.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Judge Levitz did precisely this. There was no error in his valuations of the marital property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Mr. Goldberg\u2019s only remaining argument as to the monetary award is that the circuit court erred in adding all the marital assets together and then subtracting all the marital debts. This is not precisely what the circuit court did. What the court did was value the assets of each party and determine which of those assets were marital property and then subtract the marital debt in each party\u2019s name from the marital assets in that party\u2019s name. In Mr. Goldberg\u2019s case it determined that $2.9 million of his assets were marital property and that $996,000 in debts owed by him were marital debts. The court then subtracted the marital debts in Mr. Goldberg\u2019s name from the marital property in his name to conclude that $1,899,000 was his marital \u201cnet worth.\u201d The court found that the marital assets in Ms. Goldberg\u2019s name worth $163,000 and because she had no significant debts her marital \u201cnet worth\u201d was $163,000. The court then determined to \u201cadjust the equities of the parties\u201d: awarding Ms. Goldberg a $861,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>monetary award plus a $39,123 award to equalize their IRAs (Mr. Goldberg does not challenge the IRA award) so that Mr. Goldberg and Ms. Goldberg would each be left with \u201cjust <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> about $900,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">There was certainly logic in what the circuit court did; however it did not follow the procedure mandated by the Court of Appeals. <em>See Zandford v. Wiens, </em>314 Md. 102, 549 A.2d 13 (1988). What the circuit court should have done after it valued each marital asset was to subtract from the value of the marital asset any debt that is attributable to that asset. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 549 A.2d 13. Here, Mr. Goldberg\u2019s accountant testified as to Mr. Goldberg\u2019s debts, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atc\">a liability to Maryland National Bank for $125,000 related to Thirty-one Twenty-one St. Paul Street, $550,000 related to Ritters Lane, and $300,000 related to Republic National Bank on Parn\u00e9s Feinstein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The circuit court valued Mr. Goldberg\u2019s total interests in 3121 St. Paul Street as a marital asset with a value of $168,365; it should have subtracted the marital debt attributable to that asset, $125,000, to arrive at a net value of $43,365. Similarly, the lower court valued Mr. Goldberg\u2019s total interest in 61 Ritters Lane, Inc. as marital property with a value of $94,000; it should have subtracted the marital debt attributable to that asset, $550,000, to arrive at a net value of zero. As to Parn\u00e9s Feinstein, the circuit court valued Mr. Goldberg\u2019s total interest in it as marital property with a value of $580,324; it should have subtracted the marital debt attributable to that asset, $300,000, to arrive at a net value of $280,324. If the circuit, court had used the method mandated in <em>Zandford </em>then the amount of total marital property would have increased approximately $450,000 because the debt attributable to 61 Ritter Lane, Inc. was approximately $450,000 greater than the value of the asset and \u201cmarital debt cannot be transferred from one item of marital property to another. If the marital debt exceeds the value of the marital property acquired as a result of incurring the debt, the result is a zero value for the marital property acquired; marital property cannot have a negative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>value.\u201d <em>Kline v. Kline, </em>85 Md.App. 28, 45, 581 A.2d 1300 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>322 Md. 240, 587 A.2d 246 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">This error, however, as Mr. Goldberg\u2019s counsel straightforwardly conceded at oral argument, has not in any way prejudiced Mr. Goldberg. Judge Levitz determined, based on the erroneous calculation that net marital assets were $2,062,000 ($1,899,000 in Mr. Goldberg\u2019s name and $103,-000 in Ms. Goldberg\u2019s name), that a proper, equitable, monetary award to Ms. Goldberg was $861,000. If Judge Levitz had correctly calculated the net marital assets, they would have totalled $450,000 more or $2,512,000. That might have led the court to have increased the amount of the monetary award payable to Ms. Goldberg; it certainly would not have led to a decrease in the award. In view of the fact that Mr. Goldberg does not challenge the Fam.Law Art. \u00a7 8-205 determination that an $861,000 monetary award was proper<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when marital assets were improperly calculated at approximately $2 million dollars, he can hardly maintain it was error because marital assets should properly have been calculated at approximately $2.5 million. Indeed, Mr. Goldberg was arguably benefitted by the judge\u2019s error. (Of course, the court could have determined that an $861,000 monetary award was appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>priate even though marital assets were $450,000 greater). In any event, as he has conceded, he was not aggrieved by it. It has long been established that only the party aggrieved by a judgment can appeal it. <em>Pattison v. Corby, </em>226 Md. 97, 101, 172 A.2d 490 (1961); <em>Buchwald v. Buchwald, </em>175 Md. 103, 114 \u2014 15, 199 A. 795 (1938); <em>Salmon v. Pierson, </em>8 Md. 297, 300 (1855). <em>See Board of Trustees of Baltimore County Comm. Colleges v. RTKL Assoc., Inc., </em>80 Md.App. 45, 51, 559 A.2d 805 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Mr. Goldberg\u2019s next argument is that the monetary award, alimony ($4,000 a month for 120 months), and child support award ($1,000 per month per child) were erroneous. Mr. Goldberg does not claim that no award of alimony and child support would be appropriate or that Ms. Goldberg or his children are self-supporting or have the ability to be self-supporting without these awards, or that there was not a gross disparity between his earning ability and assets and theirs. Rather, his sole claim on this point is that the awards were erroneous because they were based on a finding that he was able to earn $400,000 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Mr. Goldberg initially maintains that specific findings are necessary to support a conclusion that he voluntarily impoverished himself. That argument misses the point. Judge Levitz did not find that Mr. Goldberg had impoverished himself\u2014 voluntarily or involuntarily. What Judge Levitz found was that Mr. Goldberg had consistently complicated his financial dealings to hide the true value of his assets and true amount of his income and that he had the ability- to earn in excess of $400,000 a year:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">For the last 15 years the Defendant has engaged in elaborate and complex plans for the sheltering of income by the formation of corporate entities and various accounts, that the Defendant\u2019s manipulations have been so complex that it\u2019s virtually impossible to trace the source of funds for many of the Defendant\u2019s investments. That the Defendant constantly commingled his assets and passed them through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>various corporate structures on a regular basis. That the Defendant\u2019s skill, knowledge and talent in financial manipulation make it probable that the defendant will continue to be financially successful and earn an income comparable to the average earned in the years 1984 to 1990, which is in excess of $400,000 a year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Again, the record is replete with evidence that supports this conclusion. Indeed, Judge Levitz referred in his opinion to some of this evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">The adjusted gross income of the parties as declared on their income tax returns was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">1984\u2014 $645,977 (gross income attributable to Wife \u2014 $1,400)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">1985\u2014 $1,023,332 (gross income attributable to Wife\u2014 $3,366)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">1986\u2014 $552,778 (gross income attributable to Wife \u2014 $11,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">1987\u2014 $654,990 (gross income attributable to Wife \u2014 $11,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">1988\u2014 $583,646 (gross income attributable to Wife \u2014 $10,490)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">1989\u2014 $328,726 (gross income attributable to Wife \u2014 $17,666) (This is the first year that the parties began living separate and apart)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-13\">1990\u2014 $200,229 (gross income attributable to Wife \u2014 $16,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-14\">1991\u2014 Wife\u2019s income \u2014 $13,053 (no figure reported for Husband)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-15\">Mr. Goldberg does not claim that the above figures, taken from his income tax returns, are in any way erroneous. Thus he concedes that, in the years immediately prior to his divorce for which figures were available, his average adjusted gross income exceeded $400,000. Mr. Goldberg testified that his earning capacity had greatly diminished and that none of his new investments were producing appreciable income. At oral argument, Mr. Goldberg\u2019s counsel suggested that this testimony was significant because, he asserted, since Mr. Goldberg\u2019s income was almost entirely from capital gains, if assets vere sold to pay the monetary award to Ms. Goldberg, they would not be available to produce the income necessary to fund the alimony and child support awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>There are several problems with this argument. First, a trial judge is invested with the sound discretion to believe or disbelieve any witness. Judge Levitz apparently did not believe Mr. Goldberg. There was certainly evidence from which Judge Levitz could have concluded that Mr. Goldberg was less than credible, <em>e.g., </em>his frequent memory lapses, particularly when questioned about damaging or embarrassing incidents, and his attempts to hide or obscure assets. Furthermore, although a circuit court must, of course, consider all financial resources of the party seeking alimony, including the monetary award before awarding alimony, <em>Newman v. Newman, </em>71 Md.App. 670, 674, 527 A.2d 61 (1987), it is clear that Judge Levitz did this here. It may be that <em>if </em>Mr. Goldberg does have to sell assets to pay the monetary award, he will, as he testified, not have the ability to generate substantial income, or it may be that, with or without those assets, he has, as Judge Levitz believed, the \u201cskill, knowledge and talent in financial manipulation\u201d to produce an annual income in excess of $400,000. The simple fact is that we do not know. Judge Levitz carefully made the monetary award payable over a five year period, without interest. There will be ample time for Mr. Goldberg to seek a reduction in alimony if he believes it appropriate \u2014 indeed, we were told at oral argument that he already has done so. After careful review of the record in this case, however, we cannot conclude that Judge Levitz erred in basing the alimony, child support, and monetary awards on a finding that Mr. Goldberg would earn, as he had in the past, an annual income of $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">(in)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Mr. Goldberg asserts that custody of his son Jeffrey, born in 1979, should have been awarded to him, not to his wife. His argument is based on the parties\u2019 pre-trial agreement that they would have joint custody of both children, with Jeffrey primarily residing with Mr. Goldberg and their daughter, Nicole, primarily residing with Ms. Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg maintains without citation of authority, that \u201c[i]t is the parents who are in the best position to determine the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>interests of the children.\u201d Although perhaps in an ideal world this would be so, recent social history, some of which is detailed in reported Maryland cases, makes it clear that this is not always so. <em>See, e.g., In re Maurice M. </em>314 Md. 391, 550 A.2d 1135 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Baltimore City Dept. of Social Serv. v. Bouknight, </em>493 U.S. 549, 110 S.Ct. 900, 107 L.Ed.2d 992 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">We do not suggest that there is any evidence in this record of abuse of his children by Mr. Goldberg \u2014 there is none. There is, however, uncontradicted evidence that Mr. Goldberg\u2019s unorthodox, perhaps well intentioned, care of his son might well have led to serious problems. For example, Mr. Goldberg ignored medical advice and permitted Jeffrey, who suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder, to stop taking\u2014 for several months \u2014 his prescribed medication, Ritalin. The bargain assertedly struck by father and son was that if Jeffrey\u2019s grades did not improve, he would begin to take the medication again. Yet even when Jeffrey\u2019s grades \u2014 and behavior \u2014 worsened when he was off the medication, his father did not require him to resume taking it. Moreover, it is similarly uncontroverted that in the middle of the trial Jeffrey himself, through his counsel, indicated that he no longer wished to live with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The circuit court carefully considered the evidence as to Jeffrey\u2019s custody and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">The parties are in agreement that Nicole should be in the custody of the Plaintiff. The Defendant requests that the parties have joint custody of Jeffrey with his primary residence being with the Defendant. Joint custody of Jeffrey is not a viable option at this point, based on the relationship of the parties, under the rationale of <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>supra. Hopefully at some time in the future the relationship of Mr. and Mrs. Goldberg will improve so that they can discuss important decisions regarding Jeffrey and the issue of joint custody can be revisited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">This Court was disturbed when the agreement was initially presented to the Court which provided for the separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>of Jeffrey and Nicole. It is the Court\u2019s view that these siblings should not be separated and that it is in Jeffrey\u2019s best interest to be in the custody of his mother. The Court believes that the Plaintiff can provide Jeffrey with the stability, support and discipline that he needs. The Court believes that the Plaintiff will set limits for Jeffrey. It is the Court\u2019s belief that the Plaintiff will provide him with the necessary medical care and see to it that he takes the medication that he needs. The Plaintiff will be better able to be actively involved in Jeffrey\u2019s education and school selection. It is the Court\u2019s view that the Plaintiff can best serve Jeffrey\u2019s needs at this time. After reviewing the factors previously enunciated in this opinion, it is the Court\u2019s belief that it is in Jeffrey\u2019s best interest to award his custody to the Plaintiff, the person who has been his custodian his entire life except for a recent four-month period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">Nevertheless, the Court strongly feels that the Defendant should take an active role in Jeffrey\u2019s life. Obviously Jeffrey needs both his parents. Jeffrey needs to know that both parents love him and both want him and both care about him. Nevertheless, Jeffrey needs to know that one parent has the authority to make decisions and that that decision -will be supported by the other parent. The Court believes that visitation should be awarded to the Defendant every other weekend....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 125-126, 372 A.2d 231, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 754, 54 L.Ed.2d 774 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Next, Mr. Goldberg asserts that the circuit court erred in removing him as custodian of the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts established for his children. On this issue, the circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">The extensive assets in the children\u2019s names should be managed for the children\u2019s benefit. It is the opinion of the Court that a Trustee should be appointed to manage the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>assets in the children\u2019s names. It is further the view of the Court that neither of the parties should serve as such trustee. Accordingly the Court will appoint a trustee to manage the children\u2019s assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The UTMA provides for removal of a custodian only in the following circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor\u2019s family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the conservator of the minor, or the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years may petition the court to remove the custodian <em>for came </em>and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under \u00a7 13-304 of this subtitle or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1993 Supp.), \u00a7 13-318(0 of the Est. &amp; Trusts Art. (emphasis added). There may, indeed, be reasons why the custodian of children\u2019s accounts should be changed. <em>See Sutliff v. Sutliff, </em>515 Pa. 393, 528 A.2d 1318, 1325 (1987); <em>Application of Muller, </em>18 A.D.2d 1067, 239 N.Y.S.2d 519, 520 (1963). The evidence here indicated that the younger child had $45,000 more assets in his account than his older sister and that Mr. Goldberg invested the children\u2019s assets in unorthodox investments. These facts may, or may not, constitute \u201ccause\u201d for removing Mr. Goldberg, as custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The UTMA, under which these accounts were established, however, does not sanction the action of the court below. Here, there were no findings by the trial court that the evidence indicated \u201ccause\u201d for Mr. Goldberg\u2019s removal. <em>Compare Sutliff, </em>528 A.2d at 1325. Nor did any person authorized by- \u00a7 13-318(1) (e.g., an adult member of the minor\u2019s family, guardian of the minor, the minor, or the minor\u2019s attorney) petition the court to remove Mr. Goldberg as the custodian. Accordingly, the circuit court was without authority to remove Mr. Goldberg as custodian. <em>See generally Appeal of Waitt, </em>140 Me. 109, 34 A.2d 476, 478 (1943) (unless a party authorized by statute petitions to remove a guardian court has no juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>diction to remove guardian); <em>In re Erpenbach\u2019s Will, 245 Wis. 518, 15 </em>N.W.2d 795, 797 (1944) (when statutory procedure for removing an executor is not followed court has no jurisdiction to remove him).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">(v)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Finally, Mr. Goldberg asserts that Judge Levitz erred in awarding Ms. Goldberg $40,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and $45,890 in expert fees. He asserts that these fees were \u201capparently\u201d awarded for work done to obtain the monetary award and there is \u201cno statutory authority for fees and costs in connection with the proceedings for a monetary award.\u201d Alternatively, he claims that if the fees were awarded for the \u201cother awards of the judgment\u201d then they are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">These arguments are meritless. Prior to making the fee award, Judge Levitz specifically noted that \u00a7 11-110 of the Family Law Article permitted him \u201cto order the payment of reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by a party prosecuting or defending an action for alimony.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amb\">Before ordering such payment the Court must consider the financial resources and financial needs of both parties and whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding. The section allows the Court to award reimbursement for any reasonable and necessary expense which has been previously paid, and allow the Court to order that counsel fees be paid directly to the lawyer and that judgment be entered in favor of the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsM\">Judge Levitz painstakingly examined the \u201cfinancial resources and financial needs of both parties,\u201d \u00a7 ll-110(c)(l) of the Fam.Law Art., and found as a fact that Ms. Goldberg had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>substantial justification for prosecuting this action. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 11\u2014 110(c)(2). He further found that Ms. Goldberg had legal fees and necessary expert expenses \u201cin excess of $150,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In light of these findings, the enormous financial resources of Mr. Goldberg in comparison to Ms. Goldberg, and Mr. Goldberg\u2019s testimony and conduct in attempting to hide these resources, making the time of experts and attorneys necessary, the circuit court did not err in awarding Ms. Goldberg $40,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and $45,890 in expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">(vi)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We need not reach Ms. Goldberg\u2019s issues because no remand for redetermination of alimony or monetary award is necessary here. Judge Levitz did a truly outstanding job of resolving fairly and compassionately a case in which acrimony and tension vibrate from even the written record. Except for the removal of Mr. Goldberg as custodian of the children\u2019s UTMA accounts, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">JUDGMENT REMOVING APPELLANT GARY GOLDBERG AS CUSTODIAN OF THE UTMA ACCOUNTS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-18\">. The account of the facts set forth within is largely based on Judge Levitz's written opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. The parties do not explain, or complain of, the slight mathematical discrepancy, <em>i.e., </em>$163,000 + $75,000 = $238,000 not $240,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-5\">. Judge Levitz accepted the valuations of Mr. Goldberg\u2019s expert as to Exeter Engineering, Inc. (investment valued by Mr. Goldberg as $0 and by Ms. Goldberg as $1,000; demand note valued by Mr. Goldberg as $0 and by Ms. Goldberg as $93,000); Shearson Beverly Hills Partnership (valued by Mr. Goldberg as $6,500 and by Ms. Goldberg as $10,000); Jared Associates Partnership (valued by Mr. Goldberg as $0 and by Mrs. Goldberg as $25,000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\">. The valuations that Mr. Goldberg most vigorously disputes are those involving 4115 Lincoln Ave., Inc. Mr. Weiner valued a demand note from this corporation to Mr. Goldberg at its actual amount, $152,841, and Mr. Goldberg's investment in the corporation at its actual amount, $2,424. Judge Levitz accepted $2,424 as the value of Mr. Goldberg's investment but valued the demand note at $100,000. Mr. Goldberg asserts that neither the investment nor demand note is worth anything because, he claims, the principal asset of this corporation, an option to purchase valuable real estate, had expired, a view that he asserts is supported by the testimony of Ms. Goldberg\u2019s appraiser, Mr. Billig. Although Mr. Goldberg and his expert testified in support of the zero valuation, in fact, Mr. Billig testified that although the option had expired \u201con its face,\u201d Mr. Goldberg had told him \u201cthere were ongoing discussions and possible litigation with regard to a suit for specific performance\u201d of the option. Rather than refuting this, Mr. Goldberg confirmed it, testifying it was \"his recollection\u201d that this matter was \u201cin litigation\u201d in order to keep the option \"alive.\" These facts lend credence to the view that neither the option, nor Mr. Goldberg\u2019s note from the corporation owning the option, had no value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\">. It appears to us that there is no basis for such a challenge. Judge Levitz found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">[A]pplying the law to the facts of this case leads the Court to conclude that in this case a monetaxy award is absolutely necessary to adjust the equities of the parties. No case that this Court has had in six and a half years on the Bench more clearly epitomizes the need for the Marital Property Act. Were there no Marital Property Act, equity would be entirely defeated by the title concepts of property ownership. The Court recognizes that the statute does not require an equal division of value of marital property. What is required is a fair and equitable award. <em>Ohm v. Ohm, </em>49 Md.App. 392 [431 A.2d 1371] (1981). Considering the law and the facts, it is the Court\u2019s view that the Defendant should pay to the Plaintiff the sum of $861,000.00 in addition to the transfer of the IRA funds previously mentioned to adjust the equities of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The evidence, as outlined above, certainly supports this finding. Indeed, in Mr. Goldberg\u2019s most recent financial statement, dated March 14, 1991, he stated his \"estimated divorce settlement\u201d as $800,000\u2014 only $61,000 less than the amount awarded by Judge Levitz.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">. Ms. Goldberg\u2019s counsel suggested at oral argument that this point may be moot because when the assets in these accounts were, after some time, turned over to a new custodian, the new custodian reported that the accounts, which once had assets exceeding $400,000, now had combined assets of $10,000. We trust, as Mr. Goldberg\u2019s counsel suggested, that this merely reflects a change in financial institutions holding the assets, not a depletion of the assets themselves. We are confident that Judge Levitz will deal appropriately with this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-11\">. Despite the fact that appellant was successful on reversing one issue, in our discretion, we are assessing all costs against appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
