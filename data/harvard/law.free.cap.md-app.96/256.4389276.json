Holman, was an independent contractor (and <em>not </em>an employee of appellant Kelly Catering, Inc.) and therefore was <em>not </em>eligible to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Following her appeal, an Anne Arundel County jury reversed, and determined that Holman was, in fact, an employee of Kelly. Kelly, on appeal, now asks us to address the following variations on a single theme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">I. Should the prevailing party from a previous workers\u2019 compensation hearing be allowed to offer into evidence,' at a subsequent appeal of that decision [to the circuit court], the decision of the commission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">II. Is the prevailing party from a previous workers\u2019 compensation commission hearing entitled to have the jury instructed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">a. the plaintiff is appealing a decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">b. the workers\u2019 compensation commission found that the plaintiff was an independent contractor and therefore was entitled to no benefits from defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-14\">c. the plaintiff has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the decision of the Commissioner is wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-15\">III. Given that the requirements of Md. Labor <em>&amp; </em>Employment Code Anno., \u00a7 9-745(a) through (e), allow for one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>two possible dispositions of an appeal of a workers\u2019 compensation case, <em>i.e.,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">(1) the court determines that the Commission acted within its powers and correctly construed the law and facts, <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">(2) the court determines that the Commission did not act within its powers or did not correctly construe the laws and facts, can a verdict or Order that does not make one of those two dispositions properly reverse, nullify or remand the findings or award of the Commission?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We answer each of the first two questions (and the component parts thereof) in the affirmative (ie., in favor of appellant), and therefore reverse. Consequently, we need not consider the merits of appellant\u2019s third argument. In an attempt to assist the circuit court on remand, however, we note that the form and substance of both the jury\u2019s verdict and the Order corresponding thereto were sufficient to permit the court to reverse, nullify, or remand the findings or award of \u25a0the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">We begin by presenting the undisputed facts in this case. Sandra A. Holman (\u201cHolman\u201d), appellee, drove a catering truck owned by Kelly Catering, Inc., (\u201cKelly,\u201d) appellant. The nature of Holman\u2019s business may be simply described. She was given a specific territory to operate in, and within that territory Holman would, for the most part, drive from construction site to construction site selling food and beverages to the various construction crews. On the date in question, August 29, 1989, the truck that Holman was driving was struck in the rear by a Prince William County (Virginia) police car. As a result of the accident, Holman apparently suffered various personal bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">In an attempt to seek recovery for these injuries, Holman filed a claim for benefits with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (hereinafter, the \u201cWCC\u201d). Kelly defended on the grounds that Holman was not a covered employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ee within the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>contending that Holman was an independent contractor and, therefore, not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">On May 15, 1990, an evidentiary hearing on the matter was held before Commissioner Charles J. Krysiak. Following the hearing, and based on the evidence before him, the Commissioner found in favor of Kelly, <em>ie., </em>he found that Holman was an independent contractor and, accordingly, not entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Holman filed a timely appeal to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, and a jury trial was eventually set to commence on November 7, 1991. On the day of trial, prior to <em>voir dire, </em>Holman made an oral motion in the nature of a Motion <em>in Limine. </em>By this motion, and over Kelly\u2019s objection, Holman (1) acknowledged that the Commission\u2019s decision had the effect of placing the burden of proof on Holman, b\u00fat (2) requested the court to bar Kelly from entering into evidence\u2014 <em>or even mentioning </em>\u2014 the fact that the placement of this burden resulted from the WCC\u2019s decision. The court granted Holman\u2019s motion, which lead to the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">MR. WALSH [attorney for Kelly]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">My questioning and opening statement and possibly my closing I can\u2019t say what I need to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">Okay. You may have [a standing objection to the ruling on the motion] but ... remember[,] you <em>can </em>say what the presumption is and who [has] the burden of proof[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">MR. WALSH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>And I can mention ... that there was a workers compensation hearing, too, I would presume, because I\u2019m going to be talking about testimony\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">Well.... yes, you may, but you can\u2019t get into the finding of the Commission. As a matter of law we will find in this case that the Commissioner\u2019s findings [were] correct. But it\u2019s on the issue, not his finding that\u2019s before this jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">MR. WALSH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">\n<em>I just can\u2019t mention that the Commissioner is the one that the presumption resulted from.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">MR. WALSH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">[So I can\u2019t discuss the] specific decision, but I <em>can </em>bring up the hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-13\">COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-14\">Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">Five days later, <em>i.e., </em>on November 12, 1991, the parties reconvened for the jury instructions, closing arguments, deliberations and verdict. As part of the process, Kelly requested that the court give the jury Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction [\u201cMPJI\u201d] 30:3 (\u201cBurden of Proof [in Workers\u2019 Compensation cases]\u201d),'which reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-17\">This case has been heard and decided by the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Commission. The [employee is] appealing the decision of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-18\">The Commission determined that [Holman is an independent contractor]. This decision is presumed to be correct. The [employee has] the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision is wrong. In meeting this burden the [employee] may rely on the same, less or more evidence than was presented to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>(Continue with the second and following paragraphs of MPJI 1:8a, General Instructions [as to the Burden of Proof].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The court denied Kelly\u2019s request, and instead simply used MPJI 1:8a (the general civil instruction as to the preponderance of the evidence) with the following short, additional, introductory preface:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">The posture of this case ... is [that] ... under the law the claimant in this case is presumed to be an independent contractor. She is not presumed to be an employee. The claimant in the case has the burden of proving her case to the extent that she is an employee. The claimant asserts that claim, that she is an employee, and has the burden of proving it by what we call the preponderance of the evidence. [Whereupon, the Court essentially gave MPJI 1:8a.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The jury\u2019s verdict came back in favor of Holman, and against Kelly. Specifically, this verdict came back in the form of answers to two questions, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">In August, 1989, Sandra Holman was an employee of Kelly Catering, Inc.? <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ape\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">Was Sandra Holman an independent contractor doing business with Kelly Catering, Inc. in August, 1989? <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">On November 25, 1991, the trial court signed an order with respect to the jury\u2019s finding. This order read, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">This appeal ... having been tried before a jury on November 5-7 [sic], 1991, an[d] the jury by special verdict finding that the Claimant was an employee of Kelly Catering, Inc., it is this <em>25th </em>day of <em>Nov., </em>1991, by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">ORDERED, that the May 15, 1990 Award of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission be and hereby is vacated with respect to the provision finding that Claimant was not an employee of Kelly Catering, Inc., but was an independent contractor^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Kelly subsequently filed this appeal, in which it contends that the trial court made the three above-mentioned errors: (1) Kelly should have been allowed to offer into evidence the decision of the commission, (2) Kelly was entitled to a jury instruction similar to that of MPJI 30:3, and (3) the jury\u2019s decision, along with the Court\u2019s November 25, 1991 Order, were insufficient to reverse properly, nullify or remand the findings or award of the Commission. We discuss each of these contentions respectively below.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">II. EVIDENCE AND STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Even though' ostensibly couched in evidentiary terms<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, the crux of Kelly\u2019s first issue on appeal is grounded in both statutory interpretation <em>and </em>the rules of evidence. We shall first discuss the statutory component, and then the evidentiary one.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">A. <em>The Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2y\">Relevant Statutory Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"A3p\">As Kelly correctly notes, the governing statutory language reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">[LE] \u00a7 9-745. Conduct of appeal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\"># ijs \u00ed}:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">(b) <em>Presumption and burden of proof. </em>\u2014 In each court proceeding under this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">(1) the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">(2) the party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">(c) <em>Determination by court. </em>\u2014 The court shall determine whether the Commission:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">(1) justly considered all of the facts about the accidental personal injury[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">(2) exceeded the powers granted to it under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>(3) misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Kelly directs our attention to the legislature\u2019s apparently deliberate focus on the Commission\u2019s <em>decision:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">[T]he <em>decision </em>of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct]. LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 745(b)(1).] * * * [T]he party challenging the <em>decision </em>has the burden of proof. [LE \u00a7 9-745(b)(2).] * * * * The court shall determine whether the <em>Commission </em>[complied with LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-745(c)(l) through (3) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWX\">Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8 (emphasis added by Kelly).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Ergo, Kelly contends that \u201c[t]he plain language of this statute shows that determinations to be made on appeal [to the circuit court] must and are having to do with <em>what the Commission decided.\u201d See Abell v. Goetze, Inc., </em>245 Md. 433, 437, 226 A.2d 253 (1967) (\u201cThe burden is upon the appellant to overcome the presumption that the <em>decision </em>of the Commission is prima facie correct, and he must do this to the satisfaction of the trier of the facts\u201d; emphasis suggested by Kelly). Consequently, Kelly argues, \u201cIf the fact finder is not even aware the Commission made a decision[,] how can [the fact finder on appeal] possibly decide whether the decision was supported by the facts[?]\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree, but for reasons different than those advocated by Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We begin our discussion by examining Judge Moylan\u2019s incisive analysis in <em>General Motors Corp. v. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. 68, 555 A.2d 542 (1989), a case cited extensively by both parties to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The facts in <em>Bark </em>may be summarized briefly. A salvage mechanic, Harry T. Bark, suffered a knee injury in the course and scope of his employment. The WCC awarded temporary total disability benefits to him, and his employer appealed. On appeal, in a non-jury trial before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Hammerman, J), the court reversed the WCC\u2019s decision (and thereby <em>denied </em>benefits to Bark). On Bark\u2019s subsequent appeal to an <em>en bane </em>panel of the circuit court, the panel reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision (essentially reinstating the WCC\u2019s decision in favor of coverage). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>case was then appealed to us, and we reversed the panel\u2019s decision (essentially reinstating Judge Hammerman\u2019s decision denying coverage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. The procedural posture of the case provided Judge Moylan with an opportunity to discuss the various standards of review at work in that case: <em>en banc </em>review, review of administrative agency decisions generally, and, of most importance to us presently, <em>de novo </em>review in workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">With respect to <em>de novo </em>review, Judge Moylan\u2019s discussion focused on an apparent inconsistency between two provisions in the law as then codified. On the one hand, the Workmen\u2019s [now Workers\u2019] Compensation Act, then codified as Md.Ann. Code art. 101, \u00a7 56 (governing \u201cAppeals\u201d) [now subsumed, in relevant part, into LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-737, 9-745(c) ]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, provided initially that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">Any employer, employee, beneficiary or person feeling aggrieved by any decision of the [WCC] affecting his interests under this article, may have the same reviewed by a proceeding <em>in the nature of an appeal </em>and initiated in the circuit court * * * and the court shall determine whether the [WCC] has justly considered all the facts concerning the injury, whether it has exceeded the powers granted it by the article, and whether it has misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\"><em>Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 73, 555 A.2d 542 <em>(quoting </em>art. 101, \u00a7 56(a) [now LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-737, 9-745(c)]; emphasis added in <em>Bark). </em>The effect of this provision, <em>without more, </em>suggests that the circuit court, \u201cin routinely appellate fashion, would scrutinize the action of the Commission for legal error, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ing the question of evidentiary sufficiency.\u201d <em>Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 74, 555 A.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">But the statute, noted Judge Moylan, <em>did </em>provide \u201cmore.\u201d Indeed, the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">significant[ly] departed] from the administrative agency norm, ... [and went] on to provide a <em>vastly broader recourse </em>for the appellant in a Workers\u2019 Compensation case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aky\">\u201cUpon the hearing of such an appeal the court shall, upon motion of either party filed with the clerk of the court according to the practice in civil cases, submit to a jury any question of fact involved in such case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">There is thus provided, in major measure, the prerogative of a trial <em>de novo </em>at the circuit court level of any or all of the factual issues initially determined by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUA\"><em>Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 74, 555 A.2d 542 <em>(quoting </em>art. 101, \u00a7 56(a) [now LE \u00a7 9-745(d) ]; emphasis added here).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The two provisions, Judge Moylan noted, present an apparent inconsistency. On the one hand, the statute seems to suggest that an aggrieved party is afforded a trial <em>de novo; </em>on the other hand, the disposition provided for in the statute is decidedly <em>not </em>consistent with a <em>de novo </em>proceeding. <em>Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 74-75, 555 A.2d 542. That disposition (then codified as part of art. 101, \u00a7 56(a), and now recodified substantially unchanged at LE \u00a7 9-745(e)) currently reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">If the court determines that the Commission acted within its powers and correctly construed the law and facts, the court shall confirm the decision of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 745(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The conflict between the concept of a trial <em>de novo, </em>on the one hand, and the disposition set forth in LE \u00a7 9-745(e), on the other, is obvious:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>What would happen if the circuit court concluded that the decision of the Commission was in every respect free from error (arguably requiring its affirmance) but the circuit court, in the course of its <em>de novo </em>fact finding, nonetheless reached a different conclusion? Does a different <em>de novo </em>result necessarily imply error on the part of the Commission? Hardly. If the <em>de novo </em>court found a particular witness highly credible, that would not establish that the Commission had been in error or had \u201cmisconstrued the facts\u201d in finding that same witness less credible. If the <em>de novo </em>court gave a particular bit of testimony or other evidence great weight, that would not establish that the Commission had been in error or had \u201cmisconstrued the facts\u201d in giving it less weight. Regrettably, the case law has not yet even addressed, let alone attempted to reconcile, these apparently contradictory directions[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><em>Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 75, 555 A.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We now attempt to address and to reconcile the apparently contradictory directions set forth in the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes as the same were discussed by Judge Moylan.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The Preservation of the <em>De Novo </em>Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We begin, as we must, with Judge Moylan\u2019s correct assess- ' ment of the situation in <em>Bark:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">Under the appropriate standard of review, <em>[ie., </em>the clearly erroneous standard] Judge Hammerman\u2019s <em>de novo </em>fact finding was ... free from error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">This does not remotely suggest that the Commission\u2019s finding was not also free from error. The Commission \u201cjustly considered all of the facts concerning the injury.\u201d The Commission did not exceed \u201cthe powers granted it by the Article.\u201d The Commission did not misconstrue \u201cthe law and the facts applicable in the case decided.\u201d <em>If, therefore, Judge Hammerman or the in banc panel or this Court were being called upon to assess the propriety of what the Commission did, the Commission\u2019s decision would unquestionably be affirmed. The Commission\u2019s decision is not being affirmed, however, not because that is the wrong </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>answer but because that [i.e., \u201cDid the Commission act properly?\u201d] is the wrong question.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">\n<em>Because of the very nature of de novo fact finding, we are not assessing, and the in banc panel should not have assessed, the propriety of the Commission\u2019s decision. What matters rather is the propriety of Judge Hammerman\u2019s fie., the fact finder\u2019s] decision.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><em>Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 85, 555 A.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The essence of the relevant portion of our holding in <em>Bark </em>deserves restatement: <em>Despite the language of LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-745(c) and (e) </em>\u2014 which <em>admittedly appear to focus on the propriety of the Commission\u2019s decision </em>\u2014 the <em>circuit court (in Workers\u2019 Compensation appeals) essentially sits as a de novo court. </em>Accordingly, we will not disturb that court\u2019s factual findings unless those findings (taken on their own merits) were clearly erroneous. Moreover, we will apply the clearly erroneous standard <em>irrespective as to (1) how the circuit court\u2019s findings comport with the Commission\u2019s findings, or (2) the language of the relevant statutory provisions. </em>As we noted in <em>Turner v. State, Public Defender, </em>61 Md.App. 393, 486 A.2d 804 (1985),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">We made clear in <em>Dent [v. Cahill, </em>18 Md.App. 117, 305 A.2d 233 (1973) ] that the fact finder \u201cmay disagree with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the facts and arrive at a different conclusion____\u201d 18 Md.App. at 127 [305 A.2d 233]. Unlike many other administrative law bodies, such as the Public Service Commission, the Insurance Commission, and zoning boards, where the appeal to [the] circuit court is usually determined on the basis of the record made at the hearing before the agency, workmen\u2019s compensation appeals are heard <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\"><em>Turner, </em>61 Md.App. at 398, 486 A.2d 804 <em>(quoted in Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 88-89, 555 A.2d 542).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">B. <em>Evidentiary Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Given that we now hold (notwithstanding appellant Kelly\u2019s argument to the contrary) that the \u201cplain language\u201d of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute <em>does not </em>show that determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tions to be made on appeal to the circuit court have to do with what the Commission decided, does this mean that Kelly has necessarily raised a losing \u201cevidentiary\u201d argument<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>? Not exactly. Much like <em>Bark, </em>in fact, we feel that this appellant benefits from the right answer to the wrong question.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court, without elaboration, determined that (1) the Commission\u2019s decision had the effect of placing the burden of proof on Holman, but (2) Kelly was barred from entering into <em>evidence </em>\u2014 or <em>even mentioning </em>\u2014 the fact that the placement of this burden resulted from the WCC\u2019s decision. From an evidentiary standpoint, it is implicit that the trial court\u2019s decision was grounded in the doctrine of relevance. As the trial court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">I think the point is[,] what is the issue in the case and who has got the burden of proving the issue[?] It\u2019s not a question whether the Commissioner was right or wrong. I do not have any problem with the jury being told that ... the claimant here has the burden of proving that [she is an employee]. But there\u2019s a ... presumption that she was not an employee within the meaning of the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Act and it is her burden to overcome that presumption. So, ... they\u2019re the ground rules that I\u2019m giving you[.] [Y]ou can tell [the jury] there\u2019s a presumption that [Holman] wasn\u2019t an employee, ... and she has the burden of proof of overcoming that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">From the trial court\u2019s perspective, therefore, the <em>means </em>by which the presumption was derived <em>(i.e., </em>the Commission\u2019s decision) was irrelevant. To that court, the only relevant facts concerning the WCC\u2019s decision were the <em>results </em>of that decision, <em>i.e., </em>(1) that Holman\u2019s status as an independent contractor is presumed to be prima facie correct, and (2) that Holman, as the party challenging the WCC\u2019s decision, had the burden of proof. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-745(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Accordingly, in order to assess whether the trial court properly barred Kelly from entering into evidence the WCC\u2019s decision, we must employ the standards associated with the doctrine of relevance. Those standards were recently set forth in <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 594 A.2d 1248 (1991), <em>cert. denied as Fibreboard Corp. v. Myers, </em>325 Md. 249, 600 A.2d 418 (1992), to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">Evidence, to be admissible, must be both relevant and material. Evidence is material if it tends to establish a proposition that has legal significance to the litigation; it is relevant if it is sufficiently probative of a proposition that, if established, would have legal significance to the litigation. Evidence is relevant, therefore, if it has any tendency to make the existence of a material fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence, and a fact is material if it is of legal consequence to the determination of the issues in the case, which are dependent upon the pleadings and the substantive law. * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">The general rule in this State is that all evidence that is relevant to a material issue is admissible except as otherwise provided by statutes or by rules applicable in Maryland courts. Relevant evidence may be excluded if the trial court, in its discretion, believes that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK\"><em>Myers, </em>88 Md.App. at 454, 594 A.2d 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We believe that, by any standards, the WCC\u2019s decision was both relevant and material. As we discussed above, the ultimate \u2014 indeed, the <em>only </em>\u2014 factual finding that the jury in the case at bar was asked to make was whether Holman was an employee of Kelly or an independent contractor. It is pellucid that the WCC\u2019s resolution of that very issue is both material (because it is of legal consequence to the determination of the issue) and relevant (because it tends to make the existence of a material fact, <em>i.e., </em>Holman\u2019s status as an independent contractor, more probable than it would be without the evidence; it is, of course, beyond dispute \u2014 and therefore rarely stated \u2014 that the WCC possesses considerable expertise in interpreting and applying the Workers\u2019 Compensation stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>utes, <em>see, e.g., Pigeon v. Department of IL &amp; HR, </em>109 Wis.2d 519, 326 N.W.2d 752, 755 (1982),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and accordingly the WCC\u2019s finding of a particular fact makes the existence of that fact more probable than had the WCC not so found said fact). Thus, we need only determine whether the trial court acted within its discretion by implicitly determining that the probative value of the Commission\u2019s decision was substantially outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice. <em>See Myers, 88 </em>Md.App. at 454, 594 A.2d 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the probative value of the excluded evidence <em>(i.e., </em>the Commission\u2019s decision) is obvious; it would clearly tend to prove that Holman was, in fact, an independent contractor. The importance of the excluded evidence to Kelly\u2019s case was manifest in several significant ways. First, as was apparent in the colloquy which followed the trial court\u2019s decision, it defies common sense for the parties to be able to discuss the <em>testimony </em>which occurred at a prior hearing without being able to discuss the <em>finding </em>which resulted from that testimony. Second, as aptly explained by Kelly in its brief before this court, explaining to a jury that the presumption arose from a previous proceeding gives a meaningful <em>context </em>to the presumption. Third, (as was discussed above) while the propriety of the Commission\u2019s decision is not <em>the </em>issue to be decided by the circuit court, the significance and relevance of that decision is clearly underscored by the applicable statutory language; that is, it seems clear enough from the language of LE \u00a7 9-745, <em>inter alia, </em>that the legislature wanted the finder of fact <em>to be aware </em>that the presumption resulted from the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">On the other hand, we can see absolutely no prejudice, much less <em>unfair </em>prejudice, to Holman in admitting the evidence. The Commission\u2019s decision resulted from an open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>hearing, where both parties were provided with a full and fair opportunity to have their respective cases heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We hold, therefore, that it was error for the court to exclude the Commission\u2019s decision on the implicit ground of relevance. And since admission of the evidence would have produced no discernible prejudice to Holman that would counterbalance its probative value, the trial court abused its discretion by excluding this relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The crux of this issue may be boiled down as follows: was the circuit court\u2019s short, additional, introductory preface, when coupled with its general preponderance instruction, sufficient to \u201cfairly cover\u201d the requested instruction <em>(i.e., </em>MPJI 30:3)?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We believe it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">As we stated in <em>Myers v. Alessi, </em>80 Md.App. 124, 560 A.2d 59, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 640, 566 A.2d 101 (1989),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">To determine the propriety of denying a requested jury instruction, a reviewing court must examine whether the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instructions actually given, and that the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law based on the evidence presented. It is firmly established that under Maryland Rule 2-520(c) a trial judge is not obliged to give a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered in the instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\"><em>Id. </em>80 Md..App. at 132, 560 A.2d 59 (citations omitted). We begin, therefore, by comparing the requested instruction (MPJI 30:3) with the instruction actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Both the requested instruction (MPJI 30:3) and the instruction actually given are comprised of two parts; a first part, where the jury is instructed as to the procedural posture of the case, and a second part, where the jury is given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>general instructions as to the burden of proof in a civil case <em>(ie., </em>the preponderance of the evidence standard; <em>see </em>MPJI 1:8a). The essence of Kelly\u2019s argument is that, while the court properly instructed the jury as to the general preponderance standard <em>(ie., </em>the \u201csecond part\u201d), <em>the court failed to instruct the jury adequately as to the procedural posture of the case (ie., </em>the \u201cfirst part\u201d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In explaining the procedural posture of the case, the trial court explained, simply,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">The posture of this case comes to you is ... under the law the claimant in this case is presumed to be an independent contractor. She is not presumed to be an employee. The claimant in the case has the burden of proving her case to the extent that she is an. employee. The claimant asserts that claim, that she is an employee, and has the burden of proving it by what we call the preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Nowhere in this statement in regard to the procedural posture did the court make reference to the fact that the case had been previously heard and decided by the WCC, <em>a fact which is at the heart of the case\u2019s posture. </em>In contrast, the requested instruction (MPJI 30:3) <em>focuses extensively </em>on the fact that the case had been tried previously:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">This case has been heard' and decided by the [Workers\u2019] Compensation Commission. The [employee is] appealing the decision of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">The Commission determined that [Holman is an independent contractor]. This decision is presumed to be correct. The [employee has] the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision is wrong. In meeting this burden the [employee] may rely on the same, less or more evidence than was presented to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">To the degree that the instructions actually given ignore the significance of the prior WCC hearing, we do not believe that the requested instruction was \u201cfairly covered by the instructions actually given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>We also note, significantly, that the requested instruction (MPJI 30:3) is a correct statement of the law based on the evidence that should have been presented (including, of course, the WCC\u2019s decision itself which, as discussed, was erroneously excluded in the case at bar). While the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute were intended to preserve the right to a <em>de novo </em>trial<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, it is equally true that the legislature intended that the finder of fact be made aware of WCC\u2019s hearing and decision that predated the trial. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-745. Indeed, as we have suggested previously, the existence of the WCC\u2019s decision is a necessary and proper component of the jury instructions in cases such as this. <em>See Giant Food v. Coffey, </em>52 Md.App. 572, 579-80, 451 A.2d 151 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>295 Md. 283 (1983)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>. The trial court erred by determining otherwise. We warn, however, that there is a fine line that must be tread here. On the one hand, we hold that a judge has the duty to instruct a jury as to the proceedings of the Commission below, and of the presumption of correctness accorded to the Commission\u2019s decision. On the other hand, we also hold that the right to a trial <em>de novo </em>is, by our decision today, absolutely preserved. In implementing these two holdings, trial judges, in instructing juries, must carefully avoid suggesting that the Commission\u2019s decision is binding upon the finder of fact. It is not. The Commission\u2019s decision is merely <em>evidence of </em>a particular fact (or facts) which, as with all evidence, the jury is free to disregard if it finds it to be incredible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>We believe that MPJI 30:3 does adequately direct the jury as to how to weigh the above two considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">IV. VERDICT AND. ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Finally, Kelly asks us to determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict, in combination with the circuit court\u2019s order, was sufficient to comply with the requirements set forth in LE \u00a7 9-745. Since we answered each of its first two questions (and the component parts thereof) in the affirmative, and therefore reverse, we need not consider the merits of appellant\u2019s third argument. In an attempt to assist the circuit court on remand, however, we note that the form and substance of both the jury\u2019s verdict and the Order corresponding thereto were sufficient to permit the court to reverse, nullify, or remand the findings or award of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">As aforementioned, today we\u2019ve confirmed \u2014 any language in LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-745(c) and (e) notwithstanding \u2014 that the circuit court (in Workers\u2019 Compensation appeals) essentially sits as a <em>de novo </em>court. Consequently, its mission is <em>not </em>to determine the propriety of what the Commission did, <em>see Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 85, 555 A.2d 542; rather, its duty, <em>inter alia, </em>is to resolve disputed questions of fact. That being the case, where (as here) the only issue before the circuit court is the resolution of a single factual issue, any verdict or Order which clearly sets forth that resolution is sufficient to comply with the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ARUNDEL COUNTY.
