Appellant subsequently filed a motion for new trial which the court denied. Thereafter, appellant was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, with four years suspended in favor of two years of probation commencing upon his release. Bruce appealed and raised three issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">1. Whether the trial court committed reversible error in concluding that [the] five year old [alleged victim] was competent to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">2. Whether the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the proper mental state required for child abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\">3. Whether the trial court committed reversible error by admitting highly prejudicial hearsay, despite the prosecution\u2019s failure to comply with the mandatory twenty day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>notice requirement of the Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann., \u00a7 9-103.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The pertinent facts unfolded on December 14, 1991 when the victim\u2019s mother, who was eight months pregnant, was taken to the hospital because she was believed to be in labor. Before the victim\u2019s mother departed for the hospital, however, the victim, who was then five years old, had been spanked by his great-uncle for punching holes in a toilet seat. The victim\u2019s mother testified that the spanking left no marks and that the child was healthy and had no injuries. Later that day, appellant picked up the child and stayed with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">On December 16, while the victim\u2019s mother was still in the. hospital, she spoke to appellant by telephone. Bruce told her that the boy had fallen down the stairs but was not \u201cbruised up.\u201d The next day, Bruce took the boy to the hospital to see his mother. When the child arrived, his mother observed bruises and scabs across his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The victim\u2019s grandmother was also present at the hospital on that day, and when she attempted to inquire about the boy\u2019s injuries, Bruce intervened. The grandmother, then attempting to talk privately with the boy, tried to take the child into the bathroom. Bruce placed his foot against the bathroom door to prevent it from closing. He pushed open the door, swung at the grandmother, and said to the boy, \u201cIf you tell, I will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The child left the hospital with his grandmother, and on December 18, she took him to Johns Hopkins Hospital. Photographs taken at Hopkins depicted the child\u2019s, injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">On May 1, 1992, the boy was again taken to Hopkins where he saw Dr. Lawrence Wissow, a pediatrician on the Child Advocacy Team. Two weeks later, Dr. Wissow again saw the victim at the Hopkins Pediatric Primary Care Clinic. These visits were for behavioral problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Dr. Wissow testified that, during the course of the visits, the boy stated that Bruce \u201chad done the \u2018boo-boos\u2019 on his face.\u201d The child also disclosed that Bruce had hit him and had used a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>brown belt to inflict many injuries. The victim further stated that Bruce had held his face under water in a bathtub and that Bruce choked him. In addition, the boy told Dr. Wissow that Bruce had warned that if the boy told anyone about the injuries, Bruce would hurt him. The boy also stated that Bruce would give him a G.I. Joe toy if he did not disclose the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The victim testified that the injuries to his face had been caused when Bruce hit him while wearing a ring. The boy also stated that he had sustained other injuries when Bruce hit him with a belt. The child further testified that Bruce had warned him not to discuss the injuries or Bruce would drown him. During cross examination, the victim stated that, when asked by his teacher about the injuries, he responded that he had fallen in the hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">On appeal, Bruce first complains that the court erred in allowing the child to testify. According to Bruce, the boy \u201crepeatedly told the trial judge he could not tell the difference between the truth and a lie.\u201d Bruce also contends that the judge \u201coverlooked clear signs of adult influence\u201d on the child\u2019s testimony and \u201cfailed to probe [the boy\u2019s] ability to remember and relate the events at issue----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In support of his position, Bruce points to several exchanges that occurred during the competency hearing. That hearing consumed more than twenty-five pages of transcript; during it the circuit court carefully, indeed painstakingly, questioned the victim in order to determine his competency to testify. It is impossible to set out the entire transcript of the hearing here but we do set forth below a large and representative sample of the questions asked and answered during the hearing. After getting the child comfortably situated in court, the judge inquired whether the child knew the difference between a \u201cgood person\u201d and a \u201cbad person.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">The Court: What\u2019s the difference?

I think I\u2019ve asked him all I need.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">Appellant contends that, throughout the competency hearing, the child demonstrated an inability to understand the truth, an inability to understand the nature of an oath, and a suggestability to adult influences. Our reading of the transcript, however, belies this assertion. Although the victim did give a handful of \u201cwrong\u201d answers, it seems to us that, on balance, his testimony supports the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the victim was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">In <em>Jones v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 162, 165, 510 A.2d 1091 (1986), we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-17\">Because the trial judge has the opportunity to observe the potential witness\u2019s conduct and demeanor during <em>voir dire, </em>the determination of whether a child is competent to testify is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Absent an abuse of that discretion, the court\u2019s judgment will not be disturbed. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In essence, the test of a child\u2019s competency is not age but the reasonable capacity to observe, understand, recall and relate happenings while conscious of a duty to speak the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><em>Jones, </em>68 Md.App. at 166-167, 510 A.2d 1091 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Unlike the record in <em>Jones, </em>the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>demonstrates that the victim understood and appreciated the importance of telling the truth. In <em>Jones, </em>the <em>voir dire </em>examination was very brief and consisted entirely of leading questions. The child in <em>Jones </em>voiced an answer to just two questions, and those answers were wholly unresponsive to the questions asked. With regard to other questions, the child \u201canswered\u201d by nodding her head or, in several instances, failed to indicate <em>any </em>type of response. Thus, we concluded that the <em>voir dire </em>in <em>Jones:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">demonstrated [the child\u2019s] total inability to understand basic questions. Her answers exhibited confusion and were riddled with inconsistencies. [The child] displayed an inability to communicate in any meaningful manner. She failed to exhibit an understanding or an appreciation of her obligation to tell the truth or, indeed, its very meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atz\"><em>Jones, </em>68 Md.App. at 167-168, 510 A.2d 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">By contrast, the victim in the case currently before us was able to articulate, in a manner appropriate for his age, the difference between the truth and a lie. He was also able to demonstrate, during a lengthy <em>voir dire </em>examination, that he appreciated the importance of telling the truth. Further, he indicated that he would not tell a lie even if asked to do so by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">We do not, of course, evaluate the child\u2019s responses as we would those of an adult. The child would certainly fail to meet such a standard. Undeniably, there were points during the <em>voir dire </em>questioning that the child struggled with his responses. We attribute that difficulty not to the child\u2019s incompetency, but to the form of the questions asked of him. When the questions were posed at a level appropriate for a five-year old, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the child was able to respond clearly and without hesitation. His responses demonstrated that he was able to distinguish between the truth and a lie, that he was intent on telling the truth, and that he was unwilling to tell a lie even at the behest of adults. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the victim to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Appellant\u2019s next assignment of error concerns the instructions given to the jury on the child abuse charge. Appellant was convicted of child abuse as defined in Art. 27, \u00a7 35A(a)(2)(i), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u2018Abuse\u2019 means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">The sustaining of physical injury by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of a malicious act by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member, under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">With regard to this charge, the court instructed the jury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">Child abuse is a physical abuse of a child under eighteen by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care, custody, or responsibility for supervision of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">In order to convict the defendant of child abuse, the State must prove; one, that the defendant, as a household member, had permanent or temporary care, custody, or responsibility for the supervision of [the child]; and two, that [the child] was at that time under eighteen years of age; and three, that the defendant caused physical injury as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or a malicious act; and four, that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or threatened by the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">Cruel or inhumane treatment or a malicious act means conduct or force beyond that which is reasonable or appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>priate for the child when considering all the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">At the close of instruction, the prosecutor asked for clarification that the household member need not have permanent or temporary care of the child \u2014 that the perpetrator must be either a parent, a permanent or temporary caretaker, or a household member. Defense counsel then asked for clarification of the <em>mens rea </em>required for the offense. Defense counsel argued that a \u201cwillful and malicious desire\u201d was necessary to the crime and that actual malice refers to \u201can evil state of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In response to these objections, the court re-instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">Child abuse is physical abuse of a child under eighteen by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care, custody or, responsibility for the supervision of that child or who is a household member where the child resides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">In order to convict the defendant of child abuse, the State must prove; one, that the defendant had the permanent or temporary care, custody, or the responsibility of the supervision of the child or was a household member; and two, that the child ... was at the time under eighteen years of age; three, that the defendant caused physical injury as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or a malicious act; and four, that the child\u2019s health or welfare was harmed or threatened by the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">Cruel or inhumane treatment or a malicious act means contact or force beyond that which is reasonable or appropriate for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">When considering all of the surrounding circumstances, the defendant must have intended in inflicting the physical injury as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment, his actions. In other words, he must have intended what he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Defense counsel again excepted on the basis that the inten- . tion must be \u201cmalicious and evil.\u201d The court denied the exception, and the appellant now contends that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>decision was erroneous. Appellant argues that the instruction \u201cpermitted the jury to convict based on general intent to do the acts that caused the injury, where the statute requires a cruel, inhumane, or malicious state of mind, in short, an intent to inflict pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We first note that the instruction given by the court was nearly a verbatim recitation of the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 4:07. The only variations were the court\u2019s addition of the phrase \u201cor household member\u201d and the explaT nation that the defendant must have intended to inflict injury as a result of cruel or inhumane actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 127, 389 A.2d 341 (1978), the Court of Appeals noted that the child abuse statute limited criminal liability \u201cto those cases where the parent or custodian causes his child or ward to sustain physical injury as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of other acts of malice----\u201d Moreover, \u201cOnly when the line is crossed and physical injury is intentionally and maliciously or cruelly inflicted does criminal liability attach.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 128, 389 A.2d 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The court instructed the jury that the defendant must have intended to inflict the physical injury as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment. This is a correct statement of the law, and we perceive no error in the denial of appellant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Appellant\u2019s third allegation of error concerns the State\u2019s use of hearsay testimony from Dr. Wissow. Appellant complains that he received only nineteen days notice of the State\u2019s intention to use hearsay testimony. Section 9-103.1 of the Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. provides an exception to the hearsay rule and allows, in cases such as this, the admission into evidence of out of court statements made by the victim. The statements must have been made to and be offered by a licensed physician, a licensed psychologist, a licensed social worker, or a teacher. In order to provide the defendant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>an opportunity to prepare a response to the statements, the prosecutor shall supply the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney with notice of the State\u2019s intention to introduce the statements and of the content of the statements. Such notice shall be provided at least twenty days prior to the criminal proceeding. \u00a7 9-103.1(e)(3). Appellant contends that, because he received only nineteen days notice, the State should have been prohibited from introducing the statements at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The circuit court ruled that, since the purpose of the statute is to provide the defendant with an opportunity to prepare a response and since Dr. Wissow was not expected to testify until twenty-two days after the appellant received notice, the appellant had sufficient time to prepare a response to the hearsay statements. The appellant now claims that the twenty day requirement is a condition precedent to admission of the testimony and that the court erred in looking to the purpose of \u00a7 9-103.1 to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">While it is true that the word \u201cshall\u201d ordinarily implies a mandatory directive, it is equally true that where a statement or rule contains mandatory language but fails to provide a sanction for noncompliance, the Court of Appeals has looked to the purpose of the provision in order to determine an appropriate sanction. <em>In re Keith W., </em>310 Md. 99, 104, 527 A.2d 35 (1987). In <em>In re Keith </em>W., for example, the Court declined to dismiss the case even though the State had failed to comply with a \u201cmandatory\u201d time requirement. The Court considered the overriding goal of Maryland\u2019s legislation concerning juveniles and concluded that dismissal would thwart the purpose of the statutory scheme. <em>In re Keith W., </em>310 Md. at 106-107, 527 A.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">So, too, in the current case did the trial court consider the express purpose of \u00a7 9-103.1 and determine that the defendant had been afforded an adequate opportunity to prepare a response to the proposed hearsay testimony. We perceive no error in the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
