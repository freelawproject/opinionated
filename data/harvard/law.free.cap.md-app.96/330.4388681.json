Richardson sought damages for injuries that resulted from her children\u2019s exposure to lead-based paint. The complaint alleged negligence (counts I and II), nuisance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>(counts III and IV), and violations of the Consumer Protection Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) (counts V and VI). When Richardson died, her mother, Ernestine Brunson (\u201cBrunson\u201d), Appellee, who was appointed personal representative of Richardson\u2019s estate, was substituted as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Before trial, Brunson and Baitch entered into a settlement agreement. Baitch agreed to pay Brunson $85,000 in exchange for the Baitches being released from all claims against them. The court ordered the case against the Baitches dismissed with prejudice. The court dismissed counts III and IV, and at the close of Brunson\u2019s case, it granted Appellants\u2019 motions for judgment on counts V and VI. The jury awarded damages to Jamall in the amount of $252,000, Jamika in the amount of $247,500, and the court awarded damages to Richardson\u2019s estate in the amount of $18,944. The court denied Appellants\u2019 motions for a new trial or remittitur. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal; Brunson filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Appellants present the following issues for our review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">I.

In November 1983, the Baitches rented the Building to Richardson, as the latter\u2019s residence. While a resident of the Building, Richardson gave birth to her daughter, Jamika, on March 18,1984, and her son, Jamall, on March 13,1985. Jamika and Jamall resided with their mother in the Building until January 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">In December 1985, Richwind purchased the Building, and in January 1986, Mark Chodak (\u201cChodak\u201d), Scoken\u2019s president, assumed management of the Building until January 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">On January 17,1986, Richardson complained to Chodak that paint was peeling from the walls within the Building. In response, Chodak sent a repairman whose work order indicated that the \u201cjob was completed,\u201d but Chodak did not otherwise know if the condition was remedied. Chodak hired no one\u2014 either before or after taking over management of the Building \u2014 to inspect the property for lead-based paint. Although Chodak did not recall the exact dates, he testified that he visited the Building during the day sometime between January 1986 and September 1986. Chodak knew the walls within the Building were covered with lead-based paint. He knew also, based on his prior experience as a housing inspector and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>property manager in Baltimore City, that peeling lead-based paint could be hazardous to children. Chodak did not warn Richardson of the dangers of flaking, peeling lead-based paint, or of the presence of lead in the Building. He testified that he did not know children lived in the Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">On August 12, 1986, Jamika \u2014 then twenty-nine months of age \u2014 and Jamall \u2014 then seventeen months of age \u2014 both tested positive for lead poisoning. Doctors determined that the level of lead discovered in Jamall\u2019s blood put him at high risk of injury, and consequently, he was hospitalized. Both children were later diagnosed with brain damage as a result of their exposure to the lead poisoning. On September 22, 1986, health inspectors notified Chodak of forty-two lead violations on the interior and exterior surfaces of the Building. Additional facts will be included in the discussion, <em>infra, </em>where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Appellants first contend that the court erred when it admitted expert testimony regarding average IQ loss among children exposed to lead poisoning. Appellants claim Brunson\u2019s counsel did not establish a reliable basis for the expert\u2019s opinion regarding Jamall\u2019s and Jamika\u2019s brain damage since other factors contributed to their injury \u2014 Richardson\u2019s alcoholism and diabetes; her continued alcohol consumption during her pregnancy with Jamall; her premature delivery of Jamika, whose birth weight was about four pounds; and the children\u2019s allegedly poor \u201chome environment.\u201d They further argue that the expert\u2019s conclusion that the children \u201clost something\u201d and that Jamall is \u201cnot as smart as [he] would have been without the lead\u201d is inadmissible because it lacks \u201ccertainty\u201d and \u201cspecificity.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">Under Maryland law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">the standard for the admissibility of expert evidence is whether the finder of fact can receive appreciable help from an expert on the subject matter. No longer need the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>subject matter be so far \u201cbeyond the ken of laymen\u201d that the finder of fact could not have any understanding of the particular issue without expert help.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">6 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Practice </em>\u00a7 702.1 (1987) (citations omitted). \u201cThe admissibility of expert testimony is largely within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Ali v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 339, 346, 507 A.2d 648 (1986), <em>aff'd, </em>314 Md. 295, 550 A.2d 925 (1988). \u201cSeldom will the decision in this regard constitute grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 43, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988). \u201c[T]he proposed expert testimony must be competent, that is, the expert\u2019s conclusions must be based upon a legally sufficient factual foundation. Ideally, the expert will testify from firsthand knowledge, such as that gained from a personal examination of an individual____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 542 A.2d 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Julian Chisolm, a pediatrician at Kennedy-Kreiger Institute, was qualified, without objection from Appellants, to testify as an expert to the existence, causes, and consequences of lead exposure in children, and the treatment of children so affected. Dr. Chisolm explained for the jury the general effect lead poisoning has on a child\u2019s learning process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">I think, if we are dealing with what might be called low level or moderate level lead exposure in which we don\u2019t see any symptoms, the child doesn\u2019t vomit, he doesn\u2019t have belly pains or any serious thing, he at least appears to be well, the main affect [sic] of that is learning disability, and that\u2019s been demonstrated, I think, in a number of studies around the world. You are really not able to demonstrate this until they reach school age. All of the damage is being done when they\u2019re much younger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Dr. Chisolm explained that the main way in which the amount of lead in a child\u2019s body is measured is in the blood. He then provided testimony regarding the loss of IQ as a result of a child\u2019s ingestion of lead.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">[A]s the average blood lead concentration increases above the baseline of ten, for every ten microgram increment, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the various studies that have been published, you get a loss, an average loss, in large groups of children of about four points on the IQ</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">So you would expect that all other things \u2014 and in these studies, other things are taken into account, how good the mothering is, how old the mother is, is it the first baby, so forth and so on. The main thing is the nurturing the child gets. It appears you lose, on average, about four points on the IQ, and that\u2019s been pretty consistent, I would say, around the world.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">With regard to the research upon which he based his testimony, Dr. Chisolm explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">The studies are designed to exclude obvious things. They would exclude gross prematurity, two pound babies, for example, and they would exclude other obvious things. I think if a child \u2014 if some children get hit on the head, as you say, that child might be excluded or the data would be analyzed with and without him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Dr. Chisolm testified that the 1991 United States Center for Disease Control guidelines set the maximum acceptable level of lead in the blood at ten micrograms per deciliter. He explained that the level of lead in Jamall\u2019s blood reached fifty-nine micrograms per deciliter in September 1986. He then proceeded to testify as to the specific effect of lead poisoning on Jamall\u2019s IQ.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">I would think that he probably, if we judge these blood leads over these first three years or so of life, one would say that he probably had lost eight to ten [IQ] points, but I would knock that down on two accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">One, his mother is diabetic, and two, there is evidence in the record that she was alcoholic, so we have to take that into account, and I think I knocked that down to maybe six to eight [IQ] points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Appellants\u2019 counsel did not object to the testimony. Dr. Chisolm testified that Jamika had thirty-six micrograms per deciliter of lead in her blood. He explained that Jamika <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u2022 might have lost, all other things being equal, perhaps seven to eight [IQ] points, but we have to knock that down, again, because of her mother\u2019s probable deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">And so I think I estimated four to no more than six [IQ] points.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Again, Appellants did not object to counsel\u2019s inquiry. We find that Appellants did not preserve this issue for our review since at no time did they object to the testimony. <em>See </em>Rule 2-517(a), 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Because we believe that this is an issue that will arise in the future, we exercise our discretion and address it at this time, even though it was not preserved. The court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed Dr. Chisolm to testify as to average IQ loss among children suffering from lead poisoning. Any reference to studies of average IQ loss \u2014 while not dispositive of the children\u2019s injuries \u2014 offered \u201cappreciable help\u201d to the jury to determine the extent of the injuries Jamall and Jamika sustained, and was not mere conjecture or speculation. McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 702.1; <em>see, e.g., Lumber Terminals, Inc. v. Nowakowski, </em>36 Md.App. 82, 92, 373 A.2d 282 (1977) (\u201c[E]vidence of the present value of future lost earnings is not improper <em>per se, </em>and when offered, may be a valid consideration by the jury.\u201d); <em>cf. Byrum v. Maryott, </em>26 Md.App. 130, 134, 337 A.2d 142, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 753 (1975) (\u201c \u2018[c]ertainly evidence tending to show only a <em>possibility </em>of permanency is not sufficient to take that issue to the jury.\u2019 \u201d Based on his expertise, as well as his evaluation of each child, Dr. Chisolm testified that Jamall and Jamika ingested lead into their blood in quantities sufficient to cause brain damage. He also gave the opinion that the children ingested lead-based paint while residing in the Building. Further, Dr. Chisolm fully considered the effect of other factors, such as the mother\u2019s alcoholism and the children\u2019s home environment, on the children\u2019s IQ loss. <em>See Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 43, 542 A.2d 1258; <em>see also </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 703.1 (\u201cThe basis for an expert\u2019s opinion must suffice to support a reasonably accurate conclusion.\u201d). Accordingly, had there been a timely objection, we would still have held that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The court refused to qualify Dr. Barry Hurwitz, a psychologist, as an expert on the issue of medical causation. Appellants claim that the court erred when it did permit Dr. Hurwitz to testify to damage to certain parts of the brain caused by the lead poisoning. Appellants assert that Dr. Hurwitz\u2019s testimony was not relevant since Dr. Chisolm \u2014 the only expert qualified to testify as to causation \u2014 determined that the children did not suffer any brain damage. As a result, they maintain the testimony confused and misled the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">There is a \u201clong-standing principle that the admission or exclusion of evidence is a function of the trial court which, on appeal, is traditionally viewed with great latitude.\u201d <em>Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 104, 118, 481 A.2d 250 (1984) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>303 Md. 581, 495 A.2d 348 (1985) . \u201cAn appellate court will only reverse upon finding that the trial judge\u2019s determination was \u2018both manifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lomax v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>88 Md.App. 50, 54, 591 A.2d 1311 (1991) <em>(quoting Paige v. Manuzak, </em>57 Md.App. 621, 633, 471 A.2d 758, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 154, 476 A.2d 722 (1984)). During cross-examination, Appellants\u2019 counsel directed Dr. Chisolm to consider Kennedy-Kreiger Institute records and other data that showed that in 1990 Jamika had an IQ of 87, and in 1991, an IQ of 113, and that Jamall\u2019s IQ increased from 94 in 1990 to 107 in 1991. Counsel questioned whether it would be impossible to assign brain damage to children whose IQ subsequently improved.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar7\">[Counsel]: Isn\u2019t it true, based on that, that it would not be possible to assign any brain damage to these two children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">[Dr. Chisolm]: I think you could still say \u2014 one of the things that corroborates that is they were both reading at or above grade level on the wide range achievement test, so it\u2019s quite consistent with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">I\u2019d still have to say that they would have been a little smarter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Dr. Chisolm testified, during cross-examination, that, although each child\u2019s IQ increased, they still \u201cwould have been a little smarter\u201d without being exposed to lead: Moreover, putting this testimony in its proper context, at the time Jamall\u2019s and Jamika\u2019s IQ\u2019s were tested, they were living in South Carolina with their grandmother, and Dr. Chisolm posited that the new environment \u201cstimulated\u201d the children. At no time did Dr. Chisolm concede that the children <em>did not </em>suffer brain damage. Indeed, during his. direct examination, Dr. Chisolm testified extensively that, but for their being exposed to lead poisoning, the children\u2019s IQ\u2019s would be higher. The court ruled that Dr. Hurwitz was qualified to testify' as an expert \u201cstrictly\u201d within the area of psychology, and [could] render an opinion regarding neuropsychological testing and their results.\u201d Dr. Hurwitz testified that, based on his expertise, both children suffered brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On two occasions, Appellants\u2019 counsel directly solicited from Dr. Hurwitz additional references to blood lead levels. Appellants\u2019 counsel explicitly asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">Now, the studies that Doctor Needleman, for instance, has done, and which you have relied upon in the past have indicated that half of the children with <em>elevated lead levels </em>may have a problem, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">We hold that the court correctly admitted the testimony into evidence. Contrary to Appellants\u2019 bald assertion, Dr. Chisolm\u2019s testimony, in its entirety, was that exposure to lead more likely than not caused the children to suffer brain damage. <em>See Byrum, </em>26 Md.App. at 134, 337 A.2d 142; McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 702.1. Dr. Hurwitz opined that Jamall and Jamika were brain damaged. Any references to lead poisoning by Dr. Hurwitz, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that his remarks were improper, were of <em>de minimis </em>effect. Moreover, Appellants solicited similar testimony and thereby waived any objection. <em>See </em>Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Appellants suggest that the court committed reversible error when it admitted into evidence an economist\u2019s report that projected the children\u2019s future incomes. They maintain that, since Jamall and Jamika did not suffer permanent injury or \u201cspecific IQ loss,\u201d the report was \u201cirrelevant, unreliable, and misleading.\u201d They also argue that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>the children did suffer permanent injury, any projection of future earning capacity constitutes \u201cconjecture\u201d and \u201cspeculation.\u201d We conclude that Appellants waived their objection to the admission of this testimony. <em>See </em>Rule 8-131(a). Appellants stipulated without objection to the report\u2019s admissibility they now contest. Thus, we need not address the merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Appellants suggest the court committed reversible error when it permitted Brunson\u2019s counsel to impeach Chodak \u2022with notices of four lead-based paint violations at locations other than the Building. They argue Chodak\u2019s testimony\u2014 that he was unaware of the dangers of lead-based paint, and specifically, the harm it causes children \u2014 -was not inconsistent with his deposition testimony. Since Chodak was an adverse witness, and therefore, \u201c[Brunson\u2019s] theories as to the basis for [Chodak\u2019s] alleged knowledge were amply in evidence,\u201d Appellants further contend the impeachment was cumulative and unduly prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">Under Maryland law, a witness may be impeached by cross-examination to show that the witness previously made a statement ... in a way inconsistent with his ... testimony relevant to the case. The statement ... must contradict the trial testimony either expressly or by omission. The contradiction or inconsistency must be significant. The inference then may be made that the witness could not have been correct both times and may be wrong at trial either because of faulty memory or deliberate prevarication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 613.1 (footnotes omitted); <em>see also Bane v.

Before trial, the court heard argument on the motion. The court deferred ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">During direct examination, Chodak denied knowing that exposure to lead can cause children to experience learning problems. The testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Q: Isn\u2019t it a fact, Mr. Chodak, that at least at some time prior to January 1986, you had read in the newspapers that there was a problem with lead based paint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">Q: And isn\u2019t it a fact, furthermore, that you knew that that caused injuries to children, lead based paint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">A: I think that what it caused to children was something I wasn\u2019t quite sure of.

The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Counsel then proceeded to offer into evidence \u201cEmergency Violation Notiee[s] and Order[s] to Remove Lead Nuisance from a Property Located at\u201d (1) 1950 Perlman Place, dated November 22, 1985; (2) 1410 Holbrook Street, dated July 1984; (3) 937 North Washington Street, dated August 11, 1983; and (4) 2227 East Biddle Street, dated July 10, 1981. Each notice contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">It has been determined ... from blood level results and investigation by the Baltimore City Health Department that a child who frequents the above dwelling has an abnormal blood lead level. An inspection of this dwelling shows it contains lead based paint. Such condition has been deemed by the Commissioner of Health to be hazardous to life and health and public health nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">This evidence has been introduced not for the purpose of establishing that because one piece of property managed by Scoken had lead violations other properties of Scoken had lead violations. It is not being offered for that purpose. It is being offered strictly for the purpose of determining whether Mr. Chodak, the present witness, had knowledge of the possible dangers of lead paint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Counsel then solicited testimony from Chodak that he knew in 1986 that older houses, those built before 1957, contained lead-based paint; that the Building is old; and that peeling lead-based paint was dangerous to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">We hold that the court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted into evidence the four notices, as well as testimony that Chodak received other such notices. Chodak\u2019s deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>was flatly inconsistent with his trial testimony and, therefore, counsel\u2019s impeachment by way of showing that he received four notices of lead nuisance violations was proper. Moreover, what Chodak knew or should have known with regard to the possible dangers of lead-based paint to children was highly probative of whether Appellants were on notice of the dangerous condition, and negligently failed to warn the tenants of hazards within the Building. The court further cautioned the jury that the evidence of the prior notices was not being offered substantively but, rather, to assist the jury in determining whether Appellants did, in fact, have knowledge of the potential danger of lead-based paint to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, Appellants argue that the court erred when it allowed counsel to question Chodak about the illegality of \u201cintact\u201d paint as opposed to \u201cpeeling\u201d paint. In light of our discussion in Section <em>VI., infra, </em>we hold that counsel\u2019s inquiry, although arguably irrelevant, was not \u201csubstantially injurious\u201d to Appellants. <em>See Lomax, </em>88 Md.App. at 54, 591 A.2d at 1312-13. Thus, reversal is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Appellants next insist that the court abused its discretion when it refused to admit into evidence Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) records. Appellants claim evidence of Richardson\u2019s alleged abusive home environment was relevant to their theory that factors other than exposure to lead contributed to the children\u2019s injuries. They contend, therefore, that disclosure of social services records was \u201cimperative\u201d to an effective cross-examination of Dr. Chisolm. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Brunson filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude DSS records concerning Richardson\u2019s suspected abuse of her older son, Benjamin, and unsubstantiated allegations of her neglect of Jamall and Jamika. Before ruling on the motion, the court asked defense counsel if he intended to offer into evidence records pertaining to her suspected abuse of Benjamin. Counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\"><em>No, sir, not as to Benjamin Richardson. </em>However, the other information, I think, is relevant because it tends to show the chaotic condition of the household in which these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>children lived, which, under the evidence that will be presented, will be significant in terms of their development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGM\">(Emphasis added). The court then granted the motion only as to records relating to alleged abusive incidents involving Benjamin. Appellants waived the issue of the admissibility of the record relating to specific references of the alleged abuse of Benjamin. <em>See </em>Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The court subsequently granted the motion with regard to an unsubstantiated allegation of the mother\u2019s neglect of Jamall and Jamika. Appellants concede that the court properly exercised its discretion when it excluded the record \u201cas to the neglect charge.\u201d <em>See Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 76 n. 10, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992) (the privacy interest of education records of students \u201ccertainly is not so strong as the privacy interest protected by the statute\u201d protecting [the disclosure of child abuse records]; <em>State v. Runge, </em>317 Md. 613, 620-21, 566 A.2d 88 (1989) (\u201c \u2018[t]he statute was never intended to be a vehicle to permit the willy-nilly disclosure of the very records the Legislature sought to keep confidential.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Appellants\u2019 contention is, therefore, limited to the court\u2019s exclusion of \u201cother records\u201d that indicate that Richardson was a diabetic and an alcoholic and that the children\u2019s home environment was in a state of turmoil. The record shows two social services files were offered into evidence. Exhibit ten contains the record that addresses the alleged abuse of Benjamin; exhibit eleven contains the record that addresses the alleged incidents of child neglect. Appellants failed to direct this Court to the specific portions of the records within these two files that support their assertion. <em>See </em>Rule 8-504(a)(4). Since Appellants concede on appeal that the court was correct when it excluded the records as to the \u201cneglect charge,\u201d we will not examine exhibit eleven any further to decide this issue. <em>See </em>Rule 8-504(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">We conclude that Appellants meant to direct us to parts of exhibit ten to support their assertion that, other than general references to the abuse of Benjamin, Richardson maintained an unstable home environment to the detriment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the children\u2019s development. The report shows that the disposition indicated by the social worker was that the family needed supportive services, but on April 11, 1980, since there were no further allegations of neglect or abuse, the case was closed. The court properly refused to admit the record into evidence. <em>See Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 76, 602 A.2d 1247. Richardson\u2019s privacy interest was <em>not </em>outweighed by the need to disclose the report, particularly since the situation addressed in the report was dated about five years prior to the time the children ingested lead, and the case was closed soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Further, Dr. Chisolm fully considered the effect of Richardson\u2019s dysfunction and alleged chaotic home environment on the children\u2019s development, as discussed in Section <em>I, supra. </em>To this extent, admitting the evidence would have been cumulative. <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 611.2 (\u201cThe trial court, in its discretion, may exercise reasonable control over the examination of witnesses and the presentation of evidence, so as to avoid needless consumption of time.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>VI.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Appellants complain that the court erred when it denied defense counsel\u2019s request for a mistrial and for a cautionary instruction to the jury after Brunson\u2019s counsel allegedly misstated the law during opening argument. Specifically, Appellants argue that they were prejudiced when counsel stated that the mere presence of lead paint was illegal. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">Brunson\u2019s counsel stated during opening argument:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">Mr. Chodak knew what housing violations \u2014 what housing code violations were. He knew that peeling paint in a house, as was found to be in this house, was a housing code violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>He knew that it was <em>illegal to have lead </em>in a house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">He knew that it was illegal to expose children\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">(Emphasis added). The court overruled Appellants\u2019 objection, and subsequent request for a mistrial. Counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">He knew ... that <em>peeling paint </em>exposes lead to anyone who is nearby to eat it, such as children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Assuming, without deciding, that counsel\u2019s reference to the .illegality of <em>intact </em>lead-based paint was a misstatement of the law, the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Appellants\u2019 motion for a mistrial. \u201c \u2018It has been repeatedly held that a trial judge shall declare a mistrial only under extraordinary circumstances and where there is a manifest necessity to do so.\u2019.\u201d <em>Leak v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 353, 357-58, 579 A.2d 788 (1990) <em>(quoting Russell v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 554, 562, 518 A.2d 1081 (1987)). \u201cThe decision of whether to grant a mistrial is vested in the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal unless there was clear prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Tibbs v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 239, 249, 528 A.2d 510 <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 286, 533 A.2d 1308 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record does not \u201ccompellingly demonstrate sufficient prejudice to warrant granting such a drastic measure.\u201d <em>Leak, </em>84 Md.App. at 358. The comment had no bearing on the case; the condition in the Building that caused Jamika\u2019s and Jamall\u2019s poisonings was <em>peeling, </em>not intact, lead-based paint. The court instructed the jury as follows: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">. Now, in order for the plaintiffs to recover on the theory of negligence, they must prove by a preponderance of the evidence each of the following elements:____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">That the defendants property contained <em>chipping, flaking and/or peeling paint </em>in violation of the Baltimore City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ordinances during their ownership, operation or management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">That the failure to remove or abate the <em>defective </em>paint following the notice proximately caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">Now, a landlord and/or his agent have the duty to keep a dwelling in good repair, safe condition and fit for human habitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">Included within this duty is the obligation to keep all walls, ceilings and woodwork free of any <em>flaking, loose or peeling paint </em>and wallpaper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">Now, the violation of the statute which is causally related to the incident or damages complained of is evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">If you find from the evidence that there was a violation of a statute which is causally related to the accident, you may consider this violation as evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">(Emphasis added). Thus, the jury\u2019s verdict was based solely on its finding that Appellants were negligent with regard to <em>peeling </em>lead-based paint, not merely the presence of lead-based paint. Any prejudice to Appellants resulting from counsel\u2019s comment was, at most, <em>de minimis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Appellants also claim the court committed reversible error when it refused to give a cautionary instruction. Appellants\u2019 counsel waived the issue. <em>See </em>Rule 8-131 (a) (\u201cthe appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it <em>plainly appears by the record </em>to have been raised in or decided by the trial court\u201d). The record shows that Appellants agreed with the court when it stated that its instruction covered Appellants\u2019 proposed cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">\n<em>VII.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">It is undisputed that Appellants never warned Richardson about the dangers of exposure to lead poisoning. Appellants complain, however, that the court erred when it denied their motion for judgment on the basis that Richardson failed to prove negligence. Specifically, they maintain there was insufficient evidence that 1) Appellants had notice of a defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>condition within the premises, and a reasonable opportunity to correct the condition; and, 2) the children suffered brain damage as a result of being exposed to lead poisoning. We disagree and explain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARL\">Rule 2-519(b) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">When a defendant moves for judgment at the close of the evidence offered by the plaintiff [in a jury trial] ... the court shall consider all evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>See also Pahanish v.

He knew of the likelihood of peeling, lead-based paint within the premises, and was also aware of the hazards associated with exposure to lead. Indeed, before assuming management of Richardson\u2019s residence, he was notified of lead-based paint violations at four other rental properties. Further, he knew that lead-based paint was particularly dangerous to children. He explained that \u201cintact\u201d lead based-paint \u2014 as opposed to peeling lead-based paint \u2014 is not as \u201caccessible\u201d to children, and therefore, not as hazardous.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Weinrich, Richwind\u2019s manager in 1986, testified that, although he knew lead poisoning could cause brain damage, he took no action to protect the children. He testified, however, that he did not know children resided with Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Despite his knowledge of the effects of lead poisoning, and the statutory requirements discussed in Section <em>VIII., infra, </em>neither Chodak nor Weinrich warned Richardson about the dangers of lead-based paint, and most important, about peeling, loose lead-based paint. Moreover, before assuming management of the premises, and afterward, Chodak testified that he did not inspect the property to assess the presence of lead-based paint. In January 1986, Richardson informed Chodak that there was \u201cpaint and plaster peeling from walls,\u201d but even then, he failed to warn her that peeling lead-based paint is readily accessible to children, and therefore, dangerous. In September 1986, a health inspector with the Lead Paint Poisoning Prevention Program notified Chodak of forty-two instances of lead paint violations at the Building, six of which constituted peeling paint. He testified that he had no reason to doubt that those violations were present as early as January 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The evidence tending to establish a breach of duty, when viewed in the light most favorable to Brunson, was legally sufficient for \u25a0 submission to the jury. <em>See </em>Rule 2-519(b); <em>Pahanish, </em>69 Md.App. at 353, 517 A.2d 1122. Chodak received notice of lead nuisance violations at other rental properties on four separate occasions and had been a housing inspector in Baltimore City \u2014 he clearly knew of the dangers associated with lead poisoning, and in particular, peeling lead-based paint; Richardson complained of peeling paint and regularly asked Appellants for paint; Chodak was aware of the likelihood of peeling lead-based paint within Richardson\u2019s home. Thus, and in light of the higher degree of care owed to children, we hold that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to deliberate on the issue of whether Appellants had notice of a defective condition. This standard applies here even though Appellants claim they were unaware children resided in the Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Further, Appellants suggest that not only did they not have notice, but they also had no opportunity to correct the condition. The children\u2019s injuries were not discovered until August 1986 and Richardson complained about peeling paint in January 1986. Appellants had considerable time to ameliorate the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Additionally, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to consider the issue of the children\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>Two experts, Doctors Chisolm and Hurwitz, provided critical testimony. Dr. Chisolm, an expert in the diagnosis and treatment of children exposed to lead poisoning, testified that lead can be found in approximately eighty-five percent of the older houses in Baltimore City, and that it poses a significant threat to the safety of children. He testified that young children, who naturally engage in hand-to-mouth activity, put \u201clead dust\u201d or \u201clead chips\u201d in their mouths, which results in \u201clow level lead poisoning.\u201d Children are attracted to lead-based paint, according to Dr. Chisolm, because it tastes sweet. Once the lead is ingested into the digestive system, it disperses throughout the body \u2014 attaching to bone, the central nervous system, and the brain. Of the fifty percent absorbed in a child\u2019s brain, twenty-five percent remains indefinitely. Tragically, the age a child tends to ingest lead, usually one to three years, is the period of the brain\u2019s most rapid development. Dr. Chisolm further testified that \u201cthe only affects [sic] of lead that are known are toxic affects [sic].\u201d Although a child exposed to lead poison initially shows no symptoms, the \u201cmain affect [sic] of [lead poisoning] is learning disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">He further explained that studies indicate that a child who has ingested lead will suffer an average loss of four IQ points for every increment of ten micrograms per deciliter of blood lead above the threshold of ten. This occurs regardless of whether the child suffered other obvious ailments \u2014 for example, being hit on the head or gross prematurity at birth. He further gave the opinion that a child whose average blood lead was thirty micrograms per deciliter during one to three years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of age suffers an IQ loss of approximately fifteen points at four years of age due at least, in part, to lead poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Dr. Chisolm testified that Jamall\u2019s highest blood lead level was fifty-nine micrograms per deciliter. He explained that the level put the potential for injury to Jamall\u2019s health in the \u201chigh risk category.\u201d Consequently, Jamall was immediately hospitalized and was given chelation therapy (drugs used to increase the excretion of lead from the child\u2019s system). Based on the available data and statistics, Dr. Chisolm testified that Jamall \u201cprobably had lost eight to ten [IQ] points.\u201d He added, however, that, considering the mother was a diabetic and an alcoholic, Jamall lost \u201csix to eight [IQ] points as a result of the ingestion of lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Jamika\u2019s blood lead level reading was thirty-six micrograms per deciliter, \u201csignificantly below\u201d her younger brother\u2019s level. Jamika was about two and a half years of age at the time it was discovered that she ingested the lead. The expert concluded that her level was less because she had less hand-to-mouth activity than Jamall. Even so, Dr. Chisolm determined that she suffered a loss of four to six IQ points. To the extent the children\u2019s IQ subsequently increased, Dr. Chisolm replied, \u201cI\u2019d still have to say that [absent the lead] they would have been a little smarter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Dr. Hurwitz testified that both Jamall and Jamika sustained brain damage. He explained that Jamall suffered from \u201cbilateral frontal and prefrontal damage\u201d that was most severe \u201cin the left hemisphere with subcortical involvement.\u201d Simply put, Jamall sustained injury in the area of the brain that controls memory and impulsive body movement. When tested, Jamall was unable to control his body from extraneous movements and activities. This is known as \u201cresponse overflow\u201d \u2014 for example, the brain tells the right hand to engage in certain action and the left hand moves uncontrollably.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">He opined that Jamika suffered damage to the same areas of the brain as Jamall. According to Dr. Hurwitz, Jamika demonstrated an inability to refrain from talking \u2014 which is also an indication of damage to the left side of the brain. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>also demonstrated \u201cresponse overflow;\u201d her hand movements were slow and uncoordinated. Jamika showed signs of poor balance, and had difficulty writing. With respect to both children, he posited that they could still have sustained brain damage even though they performed well in school. He explained that the brain of a young child is still developing. As the children become older--beginning around third and fourth grade when the children grow beyond rudimentary activities \u2014 more complex uses of the brain become necessary, such as comprehension, reading, and writing. Thus, the children\u2019s \u201cproblems are going to come later on, and people are going to want to know why is this child who has this good level of intelligence having so much trouble in school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The evidence was sufficient to be submitted to the jury. Even if the children\u2019s IQ\u2019s increased after their being exposed to lead poisoning, both experts testified that each child suffered brain damage. Dr. Chisolm opined that, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, each child suffered harm to the brain as a result of being exposed to lead. Dr. Hurwitz established that the children sustained injury to the brain and, though they performed well in school at the present time, the complication would arise as the children grow older. The court properly denied defense counsels\u2019 motions for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>VIII.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Appellants next contend that the court committed reversible error when it refused to instruct the jury on contributory negligence and superseding causation. They argue that the fact that Richardson \u201crequested [that the landlord supply her with] paint on numerous occasions,\u201d and that she \u201cfail[ed] to apply the paint or apply it in a reasonable fashion and fail[ed] to adequately supervise her children because of her drinking! ,]\u201d was sufficient evidence to generate an instruction on contributory negligence. Appellants contend that, since they were <em>\u201clead </em>[sic] by the mother to believe that she was keeping the premises painted with the paint Landlord was supplying, any injury sustained by the children was proxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>mately caused by the mother\u2019s intervening and superseding negligence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In <em>Wegad v. Howard Street Jewelers, Inc., </em>326 Md. 409, 414, 605 A.2d 123 (1992), the Court stated that a \u201c \u2018litigant is entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury____\u2019 This \u2018entitlement,\u2019 however, is conditioned upon two requirements: \u2018(1) the [requested] instruction must correctly state the law, and (2) that law must be applicable in light of the evidence before the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(quoting Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 194, 401 A.2d 651 (1979)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u201cThe law contemplates that every person having the capacity to exercise ordinary and reasonable care for his own protection against injury, will do so; it is when he fails to use such care that he is guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Menish v. Polinger Co., </em>277 Md. 553, 558-59, 356 A.2d 233 (1976). Contributory negligence is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMj\">\u201cconduct on the part of the plaintiff which falls below the standard to which he should conform for his own protection, and which is a legally contributing cause co-operating with the negligence of the defendant in bringing about the plaintiffs harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">In measuring contributory negligence, the standard of care to be used as the criterion is that of an ordinarily prudent person under the same or similar circumstances, not that of a very cautious person.... [W]hat an ordinarily prudent and careful person would , do under a given set of circumstances is usually controlled by the instinctive urge of one to protect himself from harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 559, 356 A.2d 233 <em>(quoting Craig v. Greenbelt Consumer Servs., Inc., </em>244 Md. 95, 97, 222 A.2d 836 (1966)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Section 10-910 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1989), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">In an action on behalf of an infant to recover for ... personal injury, ... the negligence of the parent or custodian of the infant may not be imputed to the infant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Accordingly, although the statute does not relieve a parent from all supervision of a child of tender years, \u201cit is only in the somewhat <em>extraordinary </em>situation where the parent\u2019s negligence is such as to constitute an independent and superseding cause of the child\u2019s injuries, that the dormant negligent act of another is discharged.\u201d <em>Caroline v. Reicher, </em>269 Md. 125,130, 304 A.2d 831 (1973) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The court properly refused Appellants\u2019 requests for a contributory negligence and supervening cause jury instruction. Richardson\u2019s actions did not give rise to an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d thereby constituting an \u201cindependent and superseding cause of the child\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>Caroline, </em>269 Md. at 130, 304 A.2d 831. Appellants were obligated to keep the interior and exterior surfaces of the premises free from loose and defective materials, including lead-based paint. Even if Richardson agreed, as shown in her rental agreement, to \u201cdo all inside painting,\u201d that fact did not discharge Appellants of their duty to ensure that the premises were in compliance with the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On three occasions, Richardson asked Appellants to supply her with paint, and they apparently complied with the request. On one occasion, she complained to Chodak that paint and plaster were peeling from the walls. Contrary to Appellants\u2019 false assertion, the record is devoid of any evidence that Richardson did, in fact, paint the premises. Thus, there is no evidence of the condition of the premises after Appellants supplied the paint. Further, the record lacks any indication that Richardson was aware of the dangers of lead paint, and specifically, that Richardson knew to remove the peeling, loose lead-based paint from the surface before applying a fresh coat of paint. In any event, the fact that she complained to Appellants about the peeling paint, and requested the paint in order to correct the condition, tends to establish that Richardson exercised reasonable, ordinary care- \u2014 as opposed to showing indifference to a potentially hazardous situation within her dwelling. <em>See Caroline, </em>269 Md. at 136, 304 A.2d 831. \u201c[Because there was insufficient evidence tending to establish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>independent and superseding negligence of the mother, the instruction\u201d was correctly refused. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\n<em>IX.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Finally, Appellants contend that, because of the alleged errors, <em>swpra, </em>the court abused its discretion when it refused to grant a new trial. Since we affirmed the court\u2019s action, <em>supra, </em>we hold that the court did not err when it refused to grant counsel\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>Cf. Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, Inc., </em>328 Md. 51, 62, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992) (trial court did not abuse its discretion where plaintiff moved for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and improper remarks by defense counsel in closing argument prejudiced plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\n<em>Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Brunson complains that the court erred when it granted Appellants\u2019 motions for judgment as to counts V and VI, wherein she alleged that Appellants violated the Consumer Protection Act. Brunson claims that Appellants\u2019 \u201cunfair trade practice of renting a home with poisonous, peeling lead-based paint was the proximate cause of the infant tenants\u2019 permanent brain damage.\u201d Brunson asserts that, under <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 517 A.2d 328 (1986), she was entitled to damages for Appellants\u2019 deceptive practices, and accordingly, asks this Court to reverse the court\u2019s dismissal and remand the case for an assessment of attorneys fees afforded counsel under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The Act, Annotated Code of Maryland, Commercial Law Article, \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 to -501 (1990 &amp; Supp.1992), \u201cspecifically prohibits any person from engaging in unfair and deceptive procedures in the rental or offer for rental of consumer realty.\u201d <em>Golt, </em>308 Md. at 8, 517 A.2d 328 <em>(citing </em>Md.Com. Law II Code Ann. \u00a7 13-303(1) and (2) (1983)). Section 13-301 contains a listing of what constitutes an unfair or deceptive trade practice. They include, <em>inter alia, </em>any</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">(1) False, falsely disparaging, or misleading oral or written statement, visual description, or <em>other representation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(2) Representation that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">(i) Consumer ... realty ...

As we discussed in Section <em>VII, supra, </em>the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to conclude reasonably that Appellants failed to inform Richardson of the danger of peeling lead-based paint, and consequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ly, failed to disclose the actual condition of the premises. Indeed, not only did they fail to disclose that peeling lead-based paint is hazardous, particularly to children, they endeavored to foist upon Richardson the responsibility of painting the premises and curing their violations without subsequently ensuring the Building\u2019s safety and habitability. Their failure to give notice to Richardson of the likely dangers of peeling lead-based paint was a proximate cause of the children\u2019s brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>Golt, supra, </em>the landlord of a multiple dwelling unit did not have the requisite license or inspection by the housing authorities to rent the premises. 308 Md. at 5, 517 A.2d 328. The landlord argued that the tenants inspected the dwelling before renting, and therefore, the landlord could not have violated the Act. The Court stated, \u201cImplicit in any advertisement and rental of an apartment is the representation that the leasing of the apartment is lawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 517 A.2d 328. To the extent the landlord violated the Baltimore City Code, Art. 13 \u00a7 1101 (1983), which prohibits the operation of any multiple family dwelling without a license, the Court further determined that the landlord\u2019s \u201cadvertisement and rental of the apartment was a \u2018misleading ... statement ... or other representation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (quoting </em>Md.Com.Law II Code Ann. \u00a7 13-301(1) (1983)). The Court found that, since the \u201cmeaning of any statement or representation is determined not only by what is explicitly stated, but also by what is reasonably implied,\u201d leasing the unlicensed dwelling violated \u00a7 13-301(2). <em>Id. </em>The landlord also violated \u00a7 13-301(3) because the \u201clack of proper licensing is a material fact that [the landlord] failed to state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 517 A.2d 328. The Court made clear that an \u201comission is considered material if a significant number of unsophisticated consumers would attach importance to the information in determining a choice of action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Appellants argue that, because Richardson \u201c[was] in a position of superior knowledge of the condition of the premises\u201d being that she had \u201cexclusive possession of the premises,\u201d and that after she requested paint and \u201cmislead [sic] [Appellants] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>to believe that the painting in the premises was being taken care of,\u201d they were not in violation of the Act. They claim that \u201c[njothing in Maryland law supports [Brunson\u2019s] contention that the mere rental of the premises constituted a representation that the premises were in good condition and in compliance with local ordinances.\u201d They suggest that they had no knowledge of the existence of peeling lead-based paint, and thus, could not inform Richardson of its inherent dangers. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The City ordinances required that Appellants protect Richardson from the hazards of peeling lead-based paint. Neither Richardson nor the children were on notice that the peeling paint contained lead. <em>Cfi id. </em>at 11 (\u201cSimply viewing an apartment cannot inform a prospective tenant that the premises are unlicensed. Therefore, at the time [the tenant] signed the lease, he cannot be said to have had knowledge that the premises was not licensed.\u201d). Certainly, a significant number of unsophisticated consumers would attach importance to the presence of peeling lead-based paint in a rental dwelling and to the fact that lead-based paint is poisonous, and accessible to young children, especially if loose. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Consumers, if armed with that knowledge, can make an informed decision whether to rent the unit, or, as in this case, continue to rent the unit. Thus, Appellants\u2019 failure to inform Richardson of the condition tended to mislead Richardson to believe that the Building was free of peeling lead-based paint and therefore habitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We hold that the jury, had it been given the opportunity, could have found that Appellants, by renting premises unfit for human habitation in that it contained loose lead-based paint, engaged in an unfair and deceptive trade practice in violation of \u00a7 13-301 of the Act. Thus, the court erred when it granted Appellants\u2019 motions for judgment as to counts V <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>and VI. Accordingly, we vacate the court\u2019s order and remand the case for a new trial on counts V and VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
