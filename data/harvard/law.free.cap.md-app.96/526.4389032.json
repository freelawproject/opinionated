Allan Qffen, appeals from the decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (1) affirming the comprehensive rezoning plan approved by the County Council for Prince George\u2019s County sitting as the District Council, appellee; and (2) finding that the actions of the County prior to the adoption of the comprehensive rezoning in denying a sewer upgrade permit and other actions of the County in respect to appellant\u2019s commercially-zoned property, pending rezoning, were not illegal, arbitrary or capricious; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>finding that no vested rights in the prior zoning exists. Often presents two questions, which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">1. Whether the actions of the administrative and legislative officials constituted a regulatory \u201ctaking\u201d for which appellant is entitled to compensation.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">2. Whether a zoning estoppel was created by the actions of administrative officials of Prince George\u2019s County that delayed appellant\u2019s ability to procure building permits and begin construction and thus create a vested interest in the prior zoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Appellant acquired the subject property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 1969 and promptly had the property rezoned to commercial in 1970. A fair interpretation of the somewhat confusing contradictory factual statements of the parties indicates that the planning staff of the County<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> objected to this initial rezoning but was overruled by the District Council. This rezoning was granted upon the condition that prior to any development the property and its site plan had to be reviewed by the District Council for final approval. At that point, appellant\u2019s first serious problem began. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC), due to sewage treatment capacity problems, declared a moratorium on development affecting most- of Prince George\u2019s County that lasted for almost ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">When the moratorium was removed, appellant began the process of development by formulating various plans, which ultimately coalesced into plans for a commercial medical campus. Informal representations were made to county officials. Some of the officials publicly, but informally, commented favorably as to the conceptual use of the subject property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Thereafter, appellant undertook the normal preliminary process of planning for the development, <em>ie., </em>architectural and land planning, engineering, legal preparation, marketability control, etc. Plans designed to meet the conditions attached to the 1969/70 rezoning were then formally transmitted to the Council in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Just prior to submitting his plans in 1988, appellant requested, by application to the County\u2019s Department of Environmental Services, that the County upgrade the sewer status of his property from category four to category three. For the purpose of our resolution of the issues, we assume that category three, if obtained, would have enabled appellant to apply for the required permits that would have given him the right to commence construction and <em>perhaps </em>vest an interest in his then existing commercial zoning. Rather than upgrade appellant\u2019s sewer status to category three, or leave it in category four, the County downgraded it to category six. Appellant argues, without challenge by appellee, that this was the first time in the history of the categorizing of sewer classifications that sewer availability was downgraded upon an upgrade request.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Appellant immediately filed suit in state court for a writ of mandamus to require the County to issue a category three designation. Three days before the mandamus hearing, the County requested removal of this manifestly state action to federal court. Upon a motion to remand, which was not opposed by the County, the federal court sometime thereafter remanded the case to the state court. Finally, on the 22nd of August 1991, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">Plaintiffs met the criteria established ... for the approval of Service Area Redesignation Requests. Therefore the denial [of the 1988 request] did not fall within the County\u2019s discretion and was arbitrary and capricious....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">... Most significantly, Plaintiffs\u2019 property was zoned G-0 ... and C-2 ... to allow Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed development. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Additionally, Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed use meets the further stipulations of the 1970 Bowie Master Plan____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In the same opinion, the trial court ordered that the County \u201cshall redesignate Plaintiffs Property from Water and Sewer Service Area Six to Service Area Three.\u201d The order related back to the County\u2019s arbitrary actions in denying the 1988 request and was an immediate order. In complete disregard of the order, the County took the cavalier attitude that, rather than obey or appeal the court order, it would wait until the next scheduled round of sewer reclassifications to reconsider appellant\u2019s sewer upgrade request. During all of these events, the County\u2019s planning staff was energetically working on the comprehensive master plan and new sectional map amendment (SMA) for the area that included appellant\u2019s property. The staff recommended, as it had in 1970 and in 1975, that the property be put into a residential classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The County, of course, was aware of the fact that by the time the next scheduled regulatory sewer and water designation review occurred, it was probable that a proposed SMA would be adopted by the Council and thus freeze any application to develop under the then existing sectional map.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the County finally moved the property into sewer category three, the SMA had been adopted. Thus, the property became subject to the comprehensive rezoning to residential use prohibiting commercial development.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Throughout the period of the mandamus litigation, appellant continued his attempt to obtain site plan approval pursuant to the 1969/70 rezoning conditions. During this process, the planning board staff recommended denial of the site plan because of comments regarding transportation contained in a recently adopted Master Plan of an area encompassing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>subject property. The Planning Board denied the site plan approval based upon the new <em>proposed </em>SMA, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">The Master Plan also proposes residential land use for this property ... the new Sectional Map Amendment will be adopted in early Fall 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">The Detailed Site Plan is in conformance with the applicable conditions of the previously approved Detailed Site Plan ... the previously-approved Conceptual Site Plan ... and the previously-approved Master Plan---- [It] is not in conformance with the most current Master Plan....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Even when a new master plan is adopted, until, and if, comprehensive rezoning pursuant to it occurs, the original zoning controls the uses of the subject property. The transmittal of a SMA to the enacting authority during the rezoning process <em>may </em>freeze applications pending its adoption. It appears that at this point the SMA <em>had not </em>been transmitted in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">As we have stated, by the time category three was granted to appellant in October of 1991, the SMA had been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\n<em>Comprehensive Rezoning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">It is well established, and neither party contests, that the SMA was a comprehensive rezoning, and thus it is entitled to the same presumption of validity as original zoning. <em>Norbeck Village Joint Venture v. Montgomery County Council, </em>254 Md. 59, 66, 254 A.2d 700 (1969). In <em>Norbeck, </em>the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">The broad test of the validity of a comprehensive rezoning is whether it bears a substantial relationship to the public health, comfort, order, safety, convenience, morals and general welfare, and such zoning enjoys a strong presumption of validity and correctness. A property owner has no vested right to the continuance of the zoning status of his or neighboring property, merely the right to rely on the rule that a change will not be made unless it is required for the public good....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>... For an individual property owner to escape the binding impact of a comprehensive rezoning he must show that the plan lacks the necessary relationship to the general public interest and welfare that is presumed or that the effect of the plan is to deprive him of any reasonable use of his property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">254 Md. at 66-67, 254 A.2d 700 (citations omitted). <em>See also Howard County v. Dorsey, </em>292 Md. 351, 363, 438 A.2d 1339 (1982) (\u201cComprehensive zoning or rezoning must be well thought out, the product of careful consideration and extensive study, and based upon considerations concerning the common needs of a particular area.\u201d); <em>Montgomery County v.

District Land Corp., </em>274 Md. 691, 701-02, 337 A.2d 712 (1975), the Court was faced with a similar factual scenario and opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">[W]e turn to the question whether the rezoning bore a substantial relationship to the public health, comfort.... If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>it did, the rezoning enjoys a strong presumption of validity and correctness, <em>Montgomery County Council v.

Indeed it is entitled to the same presumption of correctness as that enjoyed by an original zoning, and persons attacking the correctness of the classification have a heavy burden in overcoming the presumption of its validity, <em>Scull v. Coleman, supra, </em>251 Md. [6] at 10 [246 A.2d 223 (1968)]. <em>Compare Carl M. Freeman Associates, Inc. v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>252 Md. 319, 329, 250 A.2d 250 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><em>See also Mandel and S. Properties, Inc. v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>238 Md. 208, 219, 208 A.2d 710 (1965); <em>Town of Somerset v. County Council, </em>229 Md. 42, 47-48, 181 A.2d 671 (1962). The Court in <em>District Land, </em>quoting C. Ryhne, <em>Municipal Law </em>\u00a7 9-4 (1957), at 229-30, stated: \u201cAs a general rule, the motives, wisdom or propriety of a municipal governing body in passing an ordinance are not subject to judicial inquiry.\u201d 274 Md. at 705, 337 A.2d 712. The Court then opined that \u201c[t]he same principle applies to zoning ordinances, which are presumed to be valid.\u201d 274 Md. at 705, 337 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We shall not further address the presumption of validity issue other than to hold that the presumption of validity has not been rebutted. Appellant\u2019s primary complaint, however, alleges that it was the administrative actions leading up to the comprehensive rezoning which wrongfully interfered with his rights under the pre-existing commercial zoning. He maintains that appellee should be estopped from denying him a permit under the pre-existing zoning. In combination, he asserts that his constitutional rights against a confiscatory taking have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Whether the adoption of the rezoning plan constituted a regulatory taking for which appellant is entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Before reviewing the applicable law, we must first address a preliminary matter raised by appellee. Appellee argues that appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim is premature because he has not exhausted his administrative remedies. Appellee, however, fails to further inform the court of the factual specifics of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">As we have said, this appeal arises from (1) the circuit court\u2019s decision to affirm the District Council\u2019s enactment of a Sectional Map Amendment (SMA) that downzoned appellant\u2019s property, and (2) the trial court\u2019s decision that the County\u2019s actions prior to the rezoning in denying appellant the use of his property under the pre-existing zoning were not improper. It is unclear from appellee\u2019s brief whether it argues that appellant must first file for a rezoning of his property or apply for variances and then appeal the anticipated denial in order to exhaust his administrative remedies. As we view the process undertaken below by the County, it left only this avenue of judicial review available to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Appellee cites <em>Williamson Co. Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank, </em>478 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985), as support for its argument that appellant has not exhausted his administrative remedies. It is true that the <em>Williamson </em>Court stated that certain exhaustion theories were applicable in that case. 473 U.S. at 186-97, 105 S.Ct. at 3116-22. Nevertheless, there are important distinctions between <em>Williamson </em>and the case <em>sub judiee. Williamson </em>was a civil claim filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983 for damages against the Planning Commission, its members, and its staff. The instant case is a comprehensive complaint as to the administrative and legislative actions taken by appellee. No claim for damages remains. Appellee utilized its administrative powers to stymie permitted development until it could use its legislative powers to prohibit development. Appellant attacked that process in the circuit court and further attacks it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Additionally, the <em>Williamson </em>Court opined that the action was not ripe because the property owner there had \u201cnot yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>obtained a final decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property <footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> nor utilized the procedures Tennessee provides for obtaining just compensation....\u201d 473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. at 3116. This holding, however, has virtually no applicability in our case. Appellant in the case <em>sub judice </em>is appealing the District Council\u2019s final decision regarding the application of the rezoning and SMA to his property <em>and </em>its prior activities in denying him the opportunity to vest in the previous zoning. Through this suit, he is raising the taking and just compensation claims in the only available forum provided by Maryland law in these types of zoning cases. Our decision, absent certiorari to a higher court, will exhaust appellant\u2019s remedies and render a final decision on appellee\u2019s legislative activities as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The District Council\u2019s activities throughout the process were, for the most part, primarily administrative in nature. Only the final activity of approving the comprehensive rezoning plan was legislative. Additionally, the trial judge noted that the case was a B Rule appeal and that as finally presented, appellant was seeking \u201creversal of the decision of the ... District Council and ... remand ... with instructions to reconsider its decision with reference to the subject property.\u201d While the defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies may be raised at any time, we note that appellee did not raise this issue at the trial court. Appellee chose, instead, to address appellant\u2019s issues directly, rather than peripherally, by attempting to force appellant to apply for variances, etc., when it was preordained he would not get them.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>If an agency\u2019s pattern of administrative delay and obstruction, conducted for the purpose of forestalling development until legislative activity can prohibit it, were to be approved, property owners would be left with no remedy. The subsequent legislative activity would terminate the administrative remedies available under the pre-existing zoning because the statutes in effect at the time of permit denial would require that the new zoning be applied. A property owner would not be able to obtain judicial review of a future legislative action until its final enactment. When finally enacted, property owners could not attack the legislative action because they would have failed to exhaust administrative remedies under statutes that no longer exist. Whether appellee should be estopped from applying the new ordinance is a matter largely independent of whether there are variances or exceptions available under the new ordinance. One of appellant\u2019s contentions below and on appeal, that appellee should be estopped from applying the new ordinance, necessarily includes all of its provisions. Under the ordinance appellant contends is applicable, he was not required to obtain variances or special exceptions. The use he seeks was permitted. He claims that the County\u2019s actions denied him that to which he had a preexisting right. In the context of whether he now has a right via zoning estoppel to a permit under the old ordinance, the special exception and variance provisions of the new ordinance are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">As we have said, the trial court decided that the County\u2019s actions prior to the rezoning were not improper, but it based its decision <em>solely </em>on the fact that under Maryland\u2019s \u201cvesting\u201d law the new zoning applied. Thus, appellant had to comply with its provisions. The trial court failed to perceive the possible applicability of the zoning estoppel theory. Thus, its decision may not have been based on the appropriate legal theory. As we have said, the trial court found that the actions of the Council were not arbitrary, capricious or illegal, in part, because appellant had not vested under Maryland\u2019s vesting law. In making that determination, the trial court missed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>point. The issue before it was that the County\u2019s actions had improperly stopped appellant from vesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Even had the trial court failed to address the issue, we could, though we would not be required to, consider it.

Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 122, 591 A.2d 507 (1991) (\u201c[W]e have recognized that an appellate court has discretion ... to consider and decide questions not tried and decided in the trial court.\u201d): <em>Crown Oil and Wax Co. v.

The appellee incongruously cites <em>Lucas v.

Appellant quoted in his brief from that article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">Both the <em>Nollan </em>and the <em>First Lutheran </em>Church<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> decisions are true to the underlying purpose of the Just Compensation Clause to ensure a fair distribution of the burdens of governmental activities....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">... The question presented almost always is, Who is going to pay? ... Neither the <em>Nollan </em>nor the <em>First Lu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>theran Church </em>opinion restricts the range of regulatory options.... Severe restrictions on use can still be imposed, and extensive deductions can still be required. The clear intent of both decisions is ... to focus more light on the question of who is to bear the burdens of the costs associated with harsh land use regulation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">The teaching of these two cases is that a guiding principle of land use regulation must be a fair and just distribution of costs among the community as a whole.... [T]he courts will hence forth look more closely to ensure that the results of land use regulation reflect a reasonable accommodation of the individual rights of the owner with public concerns and that justice and fairness have been achieved. The tone of these two decisions clearly suggests that a number of years of profligate regulatory conduct has dissipated the credibility of land use regulators with the United States Supreme Court. The message ... is that unreasonable regulatory conduct which fails to consider individual rights and does not distribute the economic burdens of a land use regulation ... will be called to account....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Roland K. Best, \u201cNew Constitutional Standards for Land Use Regulation: Portents of <em>Nollan </em>and <em>First Lutheran Church, </em>\u201d Chapter Six, <em>Institute on Planning, Zoning, and Eminent Domain </em>(1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We disagree with Professor Best\u2019s interpretations, and we hold that the well-established law on takings and confiscation remains unchanged. We shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The property owner in <em>Nollan, </em>483 U.S. 825, 107 S.Ct. 3141, sought a writ of mandamus to require the issuance of an unconditional rebuilding permit. The Commission had issued the permit with a condition that the land owners grant to it a public easement across their beach front property parallel to the ocean, extending from one public beach to another public beach. The Supreme Court, by a majority, first opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUW\">Had California simply required the Nollans to make an easement across their beachfront available to the public on a permanent basis in order to increase public access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>beach, rather than conditioning their permit to rebuild their house on their agreeing to do so, we have no doubt there would have been a taking. To say that the appropriation of a public easement across a landowner\u2019s premises does not constitute the taking of a property interest but rather (as Justice BRENNAN contends) \u201ca mere restriction on its use\u201d <em>post, </em>at 834,1-07 S.Ct. at 3155, n. 3, is to use words in a manner that deprives them of all their ordinary meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">483 U.S. at 831, 107 S.Ct. at 3145. Later, the Court, after discussing various potential scenarios relating to the Commission\u2019s purposes, then framed the issue before it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">The purpose then becomes, quite simply, the obtaining of an easement to serve some valid governmental purpose, but without payment of compensation. Whatever may be the outer limits of \u201clegitimate state interests\u201d in the takings and land-use context, this is not one of them....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">... That is simply an expression of the Commission\u2019s belief that the public interest will be served by a continuous strip of publicly accessible beach.... The Commission may well be right ... but that does not establish that the Nollans (and other coastal residents) alone can be compelled to contribute to its realization. Rather, California is free to advance its \u201ccomprehensive program,\u201d if it wishes, ... but if it wants an easement across the Nollans\u2019 property, it must pay for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">483 U.S. at 837-41, 107 S.Ct. at 3148-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">As we perceive <em>Nollan, </em>it merely restates the law that if a governmental entity desires to acquire property for itself, it must pay for it. The governmental action in <em>Nollan </em>did not just create a regulatory taking, it actually confiscated property. It was a physical invasion. What the <em>Nollan </em>Court did was to forbid California from acquiring property rights for itself without compensating the property owners. 483 U.S. at 842, 107 S.Ct. at 3151. That has been the law almost since the advent of zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In <em>First English Church, </em>482 U.S. 304, 107 S.Ct. 2378, a flood destroyed a church campground and retreat center along the banks of a California creek. The county adopted an interim ordinance which prohibited the construction or reconstruction of any structures in an area that included the church\u2019s property. The church filed an inverse condemnation case for damages, alleging that the ordinance denied it <em>all use </em>for the temporary period and it was, therefore, a taking. The California Court of Appeals had previously held that a landowner may not recover damages until it is finally determined that the regulation constitutes a \u201ctaking.\u201d 482 U.S. at 306-07, 107 S.Ct. at 2381. Relying on the California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Agins v. Tiburon, </em>24 Cal.3d 266, 157 Cal.Rptr. 372, 376-78, 598 P.2d 25, 29-31 (1979), the California Court of Appeals held that temporary regulatory takings do not require compensation even for the temporary period when all use is prohibited. 482 U.S. at 309-10, 107 S.Ct. at 2383. The United States Supreme Court reversed the <em>Agins </em>rule, and in a majority opinion held that in the factual scenarios previously presented, the \u201cCalifornia courts have decided the compensation question inconsistently with the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d 482 U.S. at 311, 107 S.Ct. at 2383.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">It is important to note that the United States Supreme Court carefully limited its holding to \u201cwhether the Just Compensation Clause requires the government to pay for \u2018temporary\u2019 regulatory takings.\u201d 482 U.S. at 313, 107 S.Ct. at 2885 (footnote omitted). The Court, like the California Court, assumed that <em>all </em>use was taken. The issue was thus limited to whether a denial of <em>any and all uses </em>for a temporary period constituted a taking. The focus was not on the extent of use limitation but, on the period of the prohibition. It was conceded that all use was prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The Court, in noting the thrust of the issue it chose to resolve, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">[A] governmental body may acquiesce in a judicial declaration that one of its ordinances has effected an unconstitutional taking of property; the landowner has no right under the Just Compensation Clause to insist that a \u201ctemporary\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>taking be deemed a permanent taking. But we have not resolved whether abandonment by the government [of the regulations] <em>requires payment </em>of compensation for the period of time during which regulations deny a landowner <em>all use of his land.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>First English Church, </em>482 U.S. at 317-18, 107 S.Ct. at 2387 (emphasis added). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">We <em>merely hold </em>that where the government\u2019s activities have already worked a taking <em>of all use of property, </em>no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the period during which the taking was effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">482 U.S. at 321, 107 S.Ct. at 2389 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">As we perceive the majority opinion in <em>First English Church, </em>it was limited to the requirement that temporary prohibitions of all uses require compensation.

He intended to construct single-family homes on the property. At the time he purchased the lots, there were no regulations establishing a complete prohibition on the construction of homes. Subsequent thereto, South Carolina passed the Beachfront Management Act (Act). The Act prohibited Lucas from constructing any permanent habitable structures on the lots. He initiated suit, alleging that the Act constituted an unconstitutional \u201ctaking of his property without just compensation.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2890. The trial court determined that the Act rendered the lots valueless and was thus an impermissible confiscation.

He then noted, that in seventy years of jurisprudence, the question of \u201ctoo far\u201d had been decided on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> except that the Court had in the process carved out two categories of \u201cregulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>straint.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 112 S.Ct. at 2893. The first category is physical invasion of an owner\u2019s property \u201cno matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose behind it\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 112 S.Ct. at 2893. The second category is where the \u201cregulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 112 S.Ct. at 2893. In a footnote caustically criticizing Justice Blackmun\u2019s dissent, the majority noted, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">[t]he cases say, repeatedly and unmistakably, that \u201c[t]he test to be applied in considering [a] facial [takings] challenge is fairly straightforward.

[a land use regulation] <em>denies an oumer economically viable use of his land.\u201d </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 112 S.Ct. at 2894. He then stated that the Supreme Court had never set forth the justification for the rule because \u201c[p]erhaps it is simply ... that <em>total </em>deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner\u2019s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 112 S.Ct. at 2894 (emphasis added). Interestingly, again in a footnote, during this particular dispute between Justices Scalia and Blackmun, Justice Scalia noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-17\">Justice BLACKMUN describes that rule <em>(which we do not invent but merely apply </em>today)....

The South Carolina Legislature in <em>Lucas </em>attempted to create legislation that would permit the State to <em>deny a landowner all viable and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>economical use of </em>his property. In essence, the South Carolina Legislature\u2019s attempt was based on the creative and unique theory that any economically viable use of coastal property was harmful and noxious and thus regulatorily enjoinable. The United States Supreme Court acknowledged that the \u201charmful or noxious uses\u201d principle was the Court\u2019s early method of ascribing a reason for permitting regulation that incidentally devalued property without requiring compensation under the Takings Clause. \u2014\u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 112 S.Ct. at 2897. After discussing the subsequent evolution of the concept, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[N]oxious-use logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguish regulatory \u201ctakings\u201d \u2014 which require compensation\u2014 from regulatory deprivations that do not require compensation. <em>A fortiori </em>the legislature\u2019s recitation of a noxious-use justification cannot be the basis for departing from our categorical rule that <em>total </em>regulatory takings must be compensated. If it were, departure would virtually always be allowed. The South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s approach would essentially nullify <em>Mahon\u2019s </em>affirmation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power.

City of New York, </em>438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978). That case involved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>application of New York\u2019s Landmark Law to the landowners\u2019 attempt to build a fifty-story tower in the air space over Grand Central Station. The property owners brought suit claiming that the application of the law to their property constituted a taking of their property interests without compensation. Specifically, they contended that the landmark law was different from zoning laws because zoning laws applied generally, whereas the landmark law only applied to specific properties. The Supreme Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">It is, of course, true that the Landmark\u2019s Law has a more severe impact on some landowners than on others, but that in itself does not mean that the law effects a \u201ctaking.\u201d Legislation designed to promote the general welfare commonly burdens some more than others.... Similarly, zoning laws often affect some property owners more severely than others but have not been held to be invalid on that account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">438 U.S. at 134, 98 S.Ct. at 2665. The Court discussed investment-backed expectations by unnecessarily separating it from the traditional \u201ctaking of all viable economic use\u201d concept by stating that it was considering \u201c[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant ... the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations----\u201d 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. at 2659. <em>See also Land Use Control, supra </em>at 170 (footnote omitted). The Court, citing <em>Goldblatt v. Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 594, 82 S.Ct. 987, 990, 8 L.Ed.2d 130 (1962), noted again that interference with investment-backed expectations was a relevant consideration. 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. at 2659. Distinct investment-backed expectations, however, are not mentioned in <em>Goldblatt. </em>The only statement in <em>Goldblatt </em>even remotely similar was that Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[ajlthough a comparison of values before and after is relevant ... it is by no means conclusive____\u201d 369 U.S. at 594, 82 S.Ct. at 990. The <em>Penn Central </em>Court declined to separate the segments of the incidents of ownership to be compared under investment-backed expectation theories but merely noted, again as dicta, that the remainder of the property in any event permitted the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201cto obtain a \u2018reasonable return\u2019 on its investment.\u201d 438 U.S. at 136, 98 S.Ct. at 2665. Justice Rehnquist, now Chief Justice, dissenting, noted that the <em>Penn Central </em>majority was confusing different concepts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">The Court does little to resolve these questions in its opinion. Thus, at one point, the Court implies that the question is whether the restrictions have \u201can unduly harsh impact upon the owner\u2019s use of the property,\u201d ... at another point the question is phrased as whether Penn Central can obtain \u201ca \u2018reasonable return\u2019 on its investment,\u201d ... and, at yet another point, the question becomes whether the landmark is \u201ceconomically viable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">438 U.S. at 149 n. 13, 98 S.Ct. at 2672 n. 13. The Court concluded that, in any event, even if the concept applied, the landowner\u2019s remaining surface operations were sufficient to meet those expectations. 438 U.S. at 124-38, 98 S.Ct. at 2659-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The inclusion of \u201cinvestment-backed expectations\u201d language in traditional \u201ctaking\u201d law was somewhat compounded by the use of its terms in <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979). <em>Kaiser Aetna </em>involved the government\u2019s attempt to require a private marina owner to afford public access because he had opened a channel to navigable waters. At one point, the Court, in its discussion, opined: \u201c[T]he consent [of governmental officials to the dredging] ... can lead to the fruition of a number of <em>expectancies </em>embodied in the concept of <em>\u201cproperty\u201d </em>\u2014 ecpectancies that, if sufficiently important, the Government must condemn and pay for____\u201d 444 U.S. at 179, 100 S.Ct. at 393 (emphasis added). The \u201cexpectancy,\u201d however, the Court referred to in <em>Kaiser Aetna </em>was not related to investment. As the Court held, it was the owner\u2019s expectancy that as one of the incidents of ownership of real property, it had the right to exclude others from the property. The Court held that to interfere with that right to exclude was a physical taking. 444 U.S. at 178-80, 100 S.Ct. at 392-93. Thus, <em>Kaiser Aetna </em>is in no way an \u201cinvestment-backed expectations\u201d holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>In <em>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 434-35, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 3175, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982), the Court held that the conduct there was an actual physical taking, as opposed to a regulation improperly affecting economic use. It noted, however, that \u201ceconomic impact ... especially the degree of interference with investment-backed expectations, is of particular significance.\u201d 458 U.S. at 426, 102 S.Ct. at 3171. Again, however, the Court found an actual physical taking, not an interference with investment rights in the absence of a physical taking. 458 U.S. at 434-35, 102 S.Ct. at 3175.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">There have been several other cases where the Court has intermingled the terms \u201call viable economic use\u201d and \u201cinvestment-backed expectations\u201d or has used them interchangeably. Among those cases is <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n v. DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 493-99, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 1246-49, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1987), where the Court referred to the concepts of \u201ceconomic use\u201d and \u201cinvestment-backed expectations.\u201d The Court declined to find a taking under any theory but mentioned investment-backed expectations as a theory, distinguishing <em>Keystone </em>from <em>Mahon. </em>It noted that in <em>Ma-hon, </em>the entire bundle of mineral rights \u2022 had been extinguished, whereas the petitioners in <em>Keystone </em>were only required to leave less than 2% of their coal in place while at the same time they were permitted to mine virtually all of the coal in their mineral estates. 480 U.S. at 492-502, 107 S.Ct. at 1245-51. In the often-cited case of <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. at 255, 260, 100 S.Ct. at 2138, 2141, 65 L.Ed.2d 106 (1980), the Court decided the case on traditional taking concepts, <em>i.e., </em>whether the governmental action \u201cdenies an owner economically viable use of his land.\u201d The Court, however, mingled the concepts when it suggested that the owners were \u201cfree to pursue their reasonable investment expectations.\u201d 447 U.S. at 262, 100 S.Ct. at 2142. Moreover, the Court further stated that the ordinances which limited development did not prevent appellants from using the land for its best use nor did they \u201cextinguish a fundamental attribute of ownership....\u201d 447 U.S. at 262, 100 S.Ct. at 2142. <em>In United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>States v.

[whether the denial of the permit will] prevent economically viable uses ... or frustrate reasonable investment-backed expectations.\u201d The Court, however, held that the requirement by the Corp of Engineers that the landowner obtain a permit before filling wetlands did not amount to a taking because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">even if the permit is denied, there may be other viable uses available to the owner.

(Emphasis added, brackets in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The Third Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Pace Resources, Inc. v. Shrewsbury Township, </em>808 F.2d 1023, 1031 (3d Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 906, 107 S.Ct. 2482, 96 L.Ed.2d 375 appears to have opined that an \u201cinvestment-backed expectation\u201d theory may be found only when the interference amounts to a complete destruction of property rights. The Court in <em>Pace </em>addressed an issue similar to that in the case at bar where industrial property was downzoned as part of a comprehensive rezoning. During the period leading up to the down-zoning, permits were issued and buildings actually existed on some of the lots in the parcel. When Pace attempted to obtain permits for the remaining industrial lots, however, its applications were rejected because it allegedly had failed to establish water availability. <em>Pace </em>prevailed in state court, but the town continued to refuse to issue the permit notwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ing the court order. In its federal suit, <em>Pace </em>claimed damages in addition to requesting injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In respect to the \u201ctaking\u201d issue Pace alleged that prior to the downzoning, its industrially-zoned property was valued at $495,000. After downzoning to agricultural, however, it was valued at only $52,000; thus, there was sufficient diminution in value to constitute a taking. Pace also argued that the regulation improperly interfered with his \u201creasonable, distinct, investment-backed expectations.\u201d 808 F.2d at 1032. The Third Circuit quickly disposed of the taking claim which was phrased in the language of \u201cinvestment-backed expectations,\u201d noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cthe taking issue ... is resolved by focusing on the uses the regulations permit\u201d and on the residual value of the property---- [T]he Supreme Court has sustained land use regulations that have resulted in large reductions in value, similar to the one allegedly experienced by Pace, where the land retains significant value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">808 F.2d at 1031 (quoting <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 131, 98 S.Ct. at 2662).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Directing its attention to the \u201cinvestment backed-expectations\u201d argument, the <em>Pace </em>Court noted that the issue had first been discussed in <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>a case involving the regulation of mineral rights where the fee estate was still in the hands of others. The regulation in <em>Mahon </em>essentially stopped mineral extraction. The Court in <em>Pace </em>then stated that investment-backed expectations had been discussed, but no taking was found in <em>Penn Central. </em>Quoting <em>Penn Central, </em>the <em>Pace </em>court noted that the Supreme Court had stated that <em>Mahon </em>did not mean one could \u201cestablish a \u2018taking\u2019 simply by showing that [he had] been denied the ability to exploit a property interest....\u201d 808 F.2d at 1032 (brackets in original). The <em>Pace </em>court went on to hold that even if \u201cdistinct, investment-backed expectations are involved, a taking ... occurs only when the regulation \u2018has nearly the same effect as the complete destruction of [the property] rights\u2019 of the owner.\u201d 808 F.2d at 1033 (citing <em>Keystone </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n v. Duncan, </em>771 F.2d 707, 716 (3d Cir.1985)), <em>ajfd sub nom. Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n, </em>480 U.S. 470, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">As we perceive the Third Circuit discussion in <em>Pace </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pennsylvania Coal, </em>the theory of \u201cinvestment-backed expectations\u201d relates in the first instance to an incidental right of property, as compared to a fee simple use or fundamental right of real property. For instance, as in <em>Pennsylvania Coal </em>and the mineral rights cases, a regulation can completely destroy the ability to extract minerals while not affecting any use of the surface of the land. The owner of the mineral right and the owner of the fee estate may be different. There may well be a remaining reasonable use of the fee by its owner but no economically viable use of the mineral right by its owner. Thus, under traditional concepts of \u201cland use\u201d takings, the land could retain economically viable uses even though the ownership in the mineral rights is completely destroyed. It is in this type of situation that the concept of distinct investment-backed expectations does not conflict with the traditional \u201cdenial of economically viable uses\u201d standard. There might also be personal property or other property, such as ideas, etc., that may be encompassed within the embrace of investment-backed expectations in a takings context.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In every case we have reviewed where the taking and \u201cinvestment-backed expectations\u201d concepts have been mingled, the case has been resolved under the traditional takings standard. It is only where the concepts are severed by the disparate ownership of a severable property right, <em>i e., Pennsylvania Coal, </em>where the case has been decided on an investment-backed theory. Even then, when an investment-backed expectation theory may be applicable, the interference must be the equivalent of the \u201ccomplete destruction ... of rights\u201d in order for there to be an unconstitutional taking. Pace, 808 F.2d <em>at </em>1033 (quoting <em>Keystone, </em>771 F.2d at 716).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Professor Washburn in <em>Land Use Control, supra </em>at 170, noted that the concepts of economically viable use and \u201cdistinct, investment-backed expectations\u201d have been, since <em>Pennsylvania Coal, </em>determinative in the bulk of land use regulation takings cases (quoting Michael M. Berger, Happy Birthday Constitution: The Supreme Court Establishes New Ground Rules for Land-Use Planning, 20 Urb.Law 735, 758-59 (1958)). While our review of the cases indicates that the concept of economically viable use has almost always been the determinative factor, we have found no Supreme Court case since <em>Pennsylvania Coal </em>where the concept of \u201cdistinct investment-backed expectations\u201d has been determinative. In most cases, it appears to be incorporated within the concept of viable economical use or merely mentioned as an aside or as dicta. As we see it, the loose use of the term investment-backed expectations has created some confusion in that members of the bar and some treatise writers consider it to have made drastic changes in traditional concepts of taking. For the most part, the United States Supreme Court has not used the concept at all or has used it interchangeably or synonymically with \u201cviable economic use.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We hold, therefore, that there have been no substantive changes in federal and Maryland law permitting the regulation of uses, so long as all economically viable uses are not prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Whether a zoning estoppel was created by the actions of administrative officials of Prince George\u2019s County that delayed appellant\u2019s ability to procure permits and begin construction in order to vest in him an interest in the pre-existing zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Appellant contends that the actions of the administrative officials in refusing to upgrade his sewer classification from category four to three prevented him from obtaining the proper building permit. Without the building permit, appellant claims that there was no possible way for his interest to vest in the pre-existing commercial zoning. Therefore, according to appellant, the administrative officials should be estopped from preventing him from going forward with his commercial zoning plans under the pre-existing zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">A. Vesting Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We shall first discuss the rigidity of the Maryland law in requiring actual construction before vesting occurs. We shall emphasize the stringency of the Maryland vesting rule by describing, at some length, that which occurred in <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v. TKU Associates, </em>281 Md. 1, 3-4, 376 A.2d 505 (1977). In that case, the developer had conceptualized plans to construct a large shopping mall in Montgomery County. The key issues in the case were similar to those in the case at bar. TKU involved two appeals that had been consolidated. The primary issue in one appeal was whether the trial court erred in finding that WSSC improperly withheld a sewer permit needed by TKU to begin construction. The primary issue in the other appeal was whether Montgomery County was estopped from barring TKU\u2019s project \u201cnotwithstanding an intervening downzoning\u201d because of the alleged wrongful withholding of a sewer permit. The withholding was allegedly caused by illegal acts of the county and other governmental agencies \u201cperpetrated prior to enactment of the downzoning resolution.\u201d 281 Md. at 4, 376 A.2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In 1971, at the time the project was conceived, the project was buildable as of right under the zoning code, provided that (1) TKU placed on record a plan of subdivision and the final plat was subject to approval by the planning commission; (2) TKU obtained a sewer hookup permit from WSSC, and (3) TKU obtained a building permit from Montgomery County. The developer expended large sums of money for preparation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>of various plans and studies and for architects, surveyors, and lawyers. Numerous meetings were held with several county agencies wherein the developer fully disclosed its building plans. In 1971, the developer filed a preliminary plan. It received preliminary approval subject to its dedication of public use land and sewer availability. In 1972, prior to commencement of construction, WSSC imposed a sewer moratorium on additional sewer use because of problems associated with the Blue Plains Treatment Plant. While the moratorium was in place, the Planning Commission sought assurances from WSSC that sufficient sewer capacity would be available for the project. The developer modified its plans to provide that the proposed project would not generate any more flows than the existing business. Based on the information furnished by the developer, WSSC informed the Planning Commission that no greater flows were anticipated. In essence, WSSC indicated that as long as the redevelopment was in accordance with the approved plan, hookups would be permitted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Planning Commission approved the final record plat after the developers made the appropriate land dedications. At that time, the developer had spent approximately $500,000. Additionally, it had dedicated property valued at $800,000 to the public. The developer then applied for a building permit which could not be issued until an actual sewer hookup permit was issued by WSSC. The developer applied for the sewer hookup permit on October 25, 1972, and prepared to begin construction within ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">During the period when these events were occurring, the area at issue was under study. Of special interest was its potential for commercial development. An initial recommendation of the Planning Commission was completed in December of 1972 and, although it recommended a rezoning, the rezoning would have continued to permit the contemplated development. Nevertheless, TKU, aware that the issue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>still under study, vigorously pressed for the issuance of the sewer hookup permit through the end of 1972, so that it could obtain the other necessary permits and commence construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">In early 1973, meetings were held between WSSC and the Planning Commission where concerns were raised over the accuracy of WSSC\u2019s determination that no additional flow would result from the development and whether the redevelopment was too intensive, given the ideas that were then being expressed during the ongoing study process. At a February hearing, a representative of a citizens group requested that the Planning Commission promptly downzone the area. If done promptly, TKU would be unable to obtain a building permit and commence construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Various studies of existing and proposed sewage flows were conducted between February and June of 1973. In June of 1973, the Planning Commission recommended a downzoning that would prohibit the planned redevelopment. TKU demanded a hearing before WSSC with respect to its application for a sewer hookup permit. Prior to that hearing, a new sewer moratorium, which prohibited the previously proposed sewer hookup was issued. TKU filed suit against WSSC. During the trial stage, Montgomery County completed a downzoning of the subject property as part of a broad sector downzoning. The downzoning was the subject of the other case consolidated on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Court of Appeals initially opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">We think it plain ... that the WSSC was subject to valid criticism ... from the Council and the Planning Commission, each of whom had legitimate reason to be concerned .... That they voiced their concern ... and urged the WSSC to deny the permit ... is not the equivalent of wrongful governmental pressure brought to bear upon a sister agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">... Nor does the mere fact that the future commercial development ... was under study ... justify an inference of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>wrongful manipulation of the WSSC by either the Council or the Planning Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">281 Md. at 21-22, 376 A.2d 505. The court held that the dedication to the public of the property valued at $800,000 did not create any vested rights. 281 Md. at 23, 376 A.2d 505. The court\u2019s rationale was that there was no evidence that TKU had been guaranteed a permit to redevelop and that no valid promises by appropriate officials had been made to the developer. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">[I]n order to obtain a vested zoning status, there must be construction on the ground; merely to allege large expenditures without actual construction on the site cannot vest zoning rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">281 Md. at 23, 376 A.2d 505 (citations omitted). <em>See also Prince George\u2019s County v.

The permit was denied because of a previous violation of the zoning restrictions involving rentals. No appeal was taken from that decision. Subsequently, Pokoik revised his plans for the addition and applied for another permit. The Mayor informed Pokoik that the building inspector would not take action on the permit. A trial court ordered the inspector to act on the application, but the building inspector denied the permit. An appeal was noted to the zoning board of appeals, and the first hearing was postponed due to the failure of the respondents to appear. In the meantime, the village amended its zoning code resulting in a prohibition of Pokoik\u2019s proposed addition.

Before construction commenced, however, the building department revoked the permit. Faymor appealed, and the board reinstated the permit. Area residents subsequently inundated the area, surrounded it, and denied access to construction crews. Meanwhile, the city did nothing to facilitate access to the construction site. The area residents obtained a temporary injunction stopping the work, but it lapsed when the residents failed to file a bond. Thereafter, actual construction began for one day. The following day the area residents again denied access to the site by surrounding it. Faymor twice obtained court orders against the interference, which were ignored, and he requested the police, traffic, and fire departments to assist him in removing the citizens and their vehicles. His efforts, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>failed.

In 1986, the company applied for a land-use permit that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>allow a convenience store, car wash, and gasoline station on the property. The planning director initially recommended denying the proposed use, but after Whitehead Oil modified its plans the director recommended approval of the use. In the meantime, neighboring property owners filed a petition to downzone the subject and other property \u201cin order that no retail activity (including convenience stores) be allowed____\u201d 451 N.W.2d at 704. The planning commission voted to delay action on Whitehead Oil\u2019s application pending the request for rezoning. Nevertheless, when the council mandated that the commission forward its recommendation on the application, it did so recommending that the permit be approved because it met the requirements of the existing regulation.

The Nebraska Supreme Court rejected this argument, noting that Whitehead Oil had neither commenced construction nor expended a substantial amount of money so as to deprive Lincoln of the right to exercise its police power. 451 N.W.2d at 706. Nevertheless, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">All the same, a zoning authority may not use its powers to reward its friends or punish its enemies; thus, where a zoning authority is guilty of misconduct or bad faith in its dealings with the applicant for a use permit in accordance with the then existing zoning regulation or arbitrarily and unreasonably adopts a new regulation in order to frustrate the applicant\u2019s plans for development rather than to promote the general welfare, the new regulation may not be applied retroactively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">451 N.W.2d at 706-07.

RESOLUTION OF THE ESTOPPEL ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The County\u2019s actions in denying a sewer upgrade have already been determined to have been arbitrary and capricious. There was no appeal of that decision. Its lack of compliance with the court\u2019s order was also improper. Additionally, its downgrade of sewer availability appears to have been an effort by the County to hinder further the ability of appellant to obtain permits to which he was then entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In arriving at our resolution, we are particularly aware that Maryland has adopted the strict test as to vesting, <em>i.e., </em>actual substantial construction. As we perceive that standard, it appears to be sufficiently rigid to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>planning process generally. That rigidity, as we have seen from the cases, can impose heavy burdens on property owners who are unable to progress to actual construction by the date of downzoning even <em>under a normal application of the zoning process. </em>We perceive that extra burdens, such as those alleged in the case at bar, imposed on a property specific basis, are discriminatory; when imposed by officials to take further advantage of the already strict vesting rule, they may be arbitrary and capricious. We believe and hold, therefore, that zoning estoppel is applicable in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">It is now our task to determine whether, under the alleged circumstances of the present case, a trier of fact could find that the County is estopped from applying the provisions of the new comprehensive rezoning to the subject project.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If estopped, the appellant\u2019s development project could proceed as if the requirements of the prior zoning would be applicable to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Appellant goes to great lengths to complain of an alleged conspiracy between different governmental entities and unidentified persons. He alleges certain actions taken by the City of Bowie in opposing his project for purposes of stymieing competition. These matters are not amply supported in the record now before us, and we shall not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">We are most concerned with the County\u2019s actions with regard to the 1988 application for a sewer category upgrade, its actions during that litigation, its failure either to appeal the trial court\u2019s adverse judgment or to comply with it, and its prior and subsequent conduct. Its conduct in that case and its activities during the project review process, especially considering the attitude of the planning staff,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> give us grave concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>as to the propriety of what was done in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In light of the fact that there was no temporary moratorium applicable to the entire master plan (SMA) area or any substantial portion of it, that there was no other procedure that might be construed as affecting an area-wide slow down or stay pending rezoning, and, that the record reveals only that appellee attempted to stop this project pending rezoning, we have difficulty in perceiving that the County\u2019s actions with respect to the sewer downgrade were done to protect the zoning process generally, as opposed to being directed at specific property. Thus, in that respect, its actions might have been discriminatory against the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In the dispute giving rise to the case at bar, a trial court had previously issued its writ of mandamus finding that the County\u2019s refusal in 1988 to issue the sewer upgrade had been arbitrary and capricious. The County did not appeal. Nevertheless, the County refused promptly to issue the permit, apparently cloaking its defiance of the court order by adopting a position that it would reconsider the sewer upgrade at its next regular sewer review. It virtually ignored the trial court\u2019s finding that its <em>previous </em>action was improper and continued a course of arbitrary and capricious, even potentially contemptuous, actions in regard to that permit. It appears clear to us that the County\u2019s purpose in not issuing the upgrade, in delaying and litigating the issue, and then not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>complying with the court order could have been to stall the issuance of the sewer upgrade so that appellant\u2019s property would not qualify for a building permit, thus denying him any opportunity to commence construction and vest his interest in the existing zoning, as he had a right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In denying the sewer permit, Prince George\u2019s County was in large part attempting to do again that which was condemned in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Carusillo, 52 </em>Md.App. 44, 447 A.2d 90 (1982). In <em>Carusillo, </em>the trial court found that the County Council had been arbitrary and capricious in denying the sewer upgrade requested, and thus it issued a writ of mandamus ordering that the County grant the upgrade. 52 Md.App. at 50, 447 A.2d 90. The County appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In rendering our decision, we opined that there was nothing in the statute that granted \u201cthe County any discretion to set up criteria defining each of the six water and sewer areas and then refuse to permit any change when an applicant has met the criteria____\u201d 52 Md.App. at 51, 447 A.2d 90. We then stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">Nothing in Section 387C says the Council or county officials may pick and choose among those who have met the criteria, to grant an upgrade to one and not to the other. Such far-reaching discretion is equivalent to arbitrariness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">... The County is bound by its own criteria and cannot bootstrap its desire to retard or thwart development in a commercially zoned area onto a statute designed to prevent future sewer moratoria.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">52 Md.App. at 51-52, 447 A.2d 90 (footnotes omitted). We upheld the issuance of the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Simply stated, while under certain circumstances it <em>may </em>be appropriate, if properly done, to impose an area-wide temporary moratorium in order to protect the planning process, it is inappropriate to use the process of sewer permits and sewer category upgrades to place properly zoned specific properties in a state of illegal suspension until a master plan and SMA can subsequently be adopted. In the case at bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the suspension began in 1988 and extended two years or more. When the property was rezoned to a classification permitting the commercial use in 1969-70, that rezoning, not the subsequent -wishes of planners, represented the will of the residents of the county as expressed through the actions of their elected representatives in passing the rezoning. The prior rezoning permitting commercial use is the \u201claw of the land\u201d until it is changed by the elected representatives. We note that if the people, as expressed through the actions of their representatives, want a particular zoning or no zoning at all, that is their choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">From the facts contained in the record, a strong inference can be made from the County\u2019s actions with regard to the sewer category upgrade that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to issue a category three permit. The evidence, if believed by the trier of fact, may well support a finding that the County\u2019s sole purpose in denying appellant, for a period of three years or more through its denial of a sewer upgrade permit, any opportunity to commence construction permitted by the existing commercial zoning was to consummate a downzoning that would effectively prohibit the use planned by appellant. This appears especially evident, and may be made virtually undebatable, by the appellee\u2019s contemptuous actions in neither appealing nor obeying the trial court\u2019s order to issue the sewer permit. The record clearly supports an inference that appellee\u2019s delay in compliance -with that order was not a coincidence; it was a calculation designed to delay appellant until the use became prohibited. The County\u2019s need to delay appellant was necessitated by the inherent length of time required to process the (SMA) for the larger geographical area. It would appear that only through the comprehensive rezoning process could the County accomplish a downzoning without the property owner\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We hold, therefore, that especially egregious actions of public officials in stalling the issuance of permits in order to eliminate development by downzoning may create a zoning estoppel as to particular properties. In the case at bar, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>allegations as to appellee\u2019s actions in totality, especially in regard to the petition for a writ of mandamus that kept appellant from acquiring a vested right under existing zoning, if believed by the trier of fact, may estop appellee from applying the downzoning to deny the issuance of a building permit for the subject property. As the trial judge relied exclusively on \u201cvesting\u201d theories and did not determine whether the facts supported a zoning estoppel, we shall remand this case to him for a further hearing, if necessary, and for a finding as to whether the facts, many of which he accepted in his opinion, are sufficient to estop the County from denying the issuance of a permit under the zoning as it was in 1988.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We note that our holding does not invalidate the comprehensive rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">JUDGMENT UPHOLDING COMPREHENSIVE REZONING AFFIRMED; TRIAL COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT OTHERWISE VACATED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\">.

We note, however, that in colonial days it was not unusual for governments regularly to take property without compensation.

As Treanor explains, the constitutional framers of post-colonial days perceived uncompensated takings as feudal redistributions of private property back to the government, <em>i.e., </em>the king. That concept, through escheat statutes and conditions of early grants, persisted in colonial days. The Takings Clause was thus considered to be a liberalization of property rights adverse to the conservative interests of the preconstitutional colonial governments. The right to private property was then perceived to be one of the incidents, privileges and immunities constituting individual rights that should be free from governmental interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Maryland was one of only three states that had a Takings Clause in its first constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 698, n. 15 (citing 3 F.

Professor Washburn included <em>Nollan, </em>483 U.S. 825, 107 S.Ct. 3141, in his discussion of regulatory takings found by the Court. As we perceive <em>Nollan, </em>however, it was a physical taking case. Additionally, <em>First English Church, </em>482 U.S. 304, 107 S.Ct. 2378, is not among the cases in which a regulatory taking was found because a complete taking was stipulated in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">. Under <em>Lucas, </em>the majority reasoned that the only use that could be regulated to the extent that all viable economic use could be denied without compensation, other than the regulation of traditional nuisances, would be property where the title status did not permit the use as of right. An example is the regulation of riparian rights by the Maryland Wetlands Act of 1970, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Board of Public Works v. Larmar Corp., </em>262 Md. 24, 277 A.2d 427 (1971), holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>essentially that such rights generally have as their purpose \"to assure to the riparian owner ... would never be cut off from his access to water.\u201d 262 Md. at 36, 277 A.2d 427. Also, no vested rights to improvements in navigable water exist until they are built, and that in any event the \"waters ... and the land under them are the property of the State.\u201d 262 Md. at 46, 277 A.2d 427. Thus, a reasonable argument can be made, as Maryland law post <em>Lamar </em>so holds, that the State can regulate all use seaward or channelward of mean high water without providing compensation to riparian owners. Maryland\u2019s critical area legislation is not based on the same theory as wetlands legislation, <em>i.e., </em>title. Maryland\u2019s critical area legislation, however, does provide a full array of procedures designed to permit heavily regulated and conditioned uses. ' Additionally, it provides, at least facially, methods to permit property uses \u2014 methods not extant in the South Carolina Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[13]\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">13.

Nevertheless, it chose not to express an opinion with respect to that issue. 254 Md. at 262, 255 A.2d 398. Instead, the Court only commented that if the doctrine were applicable, the facts of that case would not raise an estoppel. 254 Md. at 257, 255 A.2d 398. That Court also had the opportunity to reject the concept in <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v.

There is some conflict between the applicability of the respective theories of vesting and estoppel. <em>See Richmond, </em>254 Md. at 260, 255 A.2d 398. <em>See also Tri-State Generation &amp; Transmission Ass\u2019n v.

We stress that vesting is distinct and separate from zoning estoppel. The doctrine of zoning estoppel prevents the officials from taking particularly egregious actions designed to prevent vesting and then relying on the absence of vesting to thwart the previously permitted plans of the developer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">.

In the conclusion to the planning staff\u2019s 1988 report, the staff clearly displayed its bias against the prior county action in commercially zoning the property. \"From staff's perspective, we would prefer this application [to] go away.

It would be hard to find a clearer statement of the arbitrary and capricious attitude of the staff towards this project and the council\u2019s past zoning decisions in reference to it. It may well be that the staff believed that its actions were justified from a planning point of view and that they were acting in the public good, but as George Bernard Shaw philosophized: \"Hell is paved with good intentions, not with bad ones. All men [and women] mean well.\u201d George B. Shaw, <em>Man and Superman </em>226 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"AYg\">The staff goes on to lament that they \"have no control over these matters.... \u201d They misconstrue their administrative function.

Appellant\u2019s victory in the case <em>sub judice </em>may well be a hollow one. Even if the trial court finds an estoppel, appellant has dismissed or waived any claim for monetary damages. While our decision, and a subsequent favorable finding by the trial court, would enable him to obtain a permit to develop under the previous statute, whatever he develops will be, if it does not comply with the new statute, immediately non-conforming, as our decision does not invalidate the comprehensive rezoning. If he had constructed the center in 1988, it would have become non-conforming upon the 1991 rezoning. Our decision and a subsequent favorable ruling by the trial court would merely place him in that status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
