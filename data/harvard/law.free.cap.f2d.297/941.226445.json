The petition presents nothing new, nothing that was overlooked, and nothing that was not briefed and argued by the parties and fully considered by this court prior to rendering the decision herein. The Commissioner\u2019s Petition for Rehearing is therefore denied both on its merits and for failure to comply with the requirement of our Rule 7 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-5\">\u201cThe petition in each case shall be confined to a <em>brief statement </em>of points supposed to have been overlooked or misapprehended by the court, with proper references to the particular portion of the transcript of the record or original briefs relied upon, and with authorities and suggestions, <em>concisely stated, </em>in support of the points. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">In order, however, to revise certain portions of our prior opinion it is hereby withdrawn and the following opinion is substituted therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">This ease comes to us on appeal by the applicant from the original decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent Office rendered April 8, 1960, In re National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corp., 125 USPQ 197, affirming the decision of the Examiner of Trademarks refusing registration of applicant\u2019s trademark MERITO for rum,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and from a decision on applicant\u2019s petition for rehearing or reconsideration rendered May 9, 1960 which, in effect, adheres to the original decision of April 8, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The board held that the marks MER-ITO for <em>rum </em>and MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9R-ITO for <em>wines </em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>so resemble each other that confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers would be likely, and affirmed the examiner in rejecting, under section 2(d) of the Lanham Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d)], the application for registration of the mark MERITO for <em>rum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">The issue before us on this appeal is whether the examiner and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board properly refused to register the mark MERITO for rum. The board below, in refusing this registration, stated in its decision of May 9, 1960:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-13\">\u201cThe board remains of the opinion that applicant\u2019s mark so resembles the registered trademark as to be likely, when applied to such goods, to cause confusion or mistake of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Applicant asserts that there are such differences in the marks and in the goods as would eliminate likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers, and in addition asserts its right to use the mark MERITO on rum based on agreements with the owner of the reference mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">We shall first consider whether the differences in the marks and in the goods are such that confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers is likely. The marks MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9RITO and MERITO do not look alike, sound alike nor evoke the same psychological responses. Wines and rum are goods whose differences are clearly recognized by the purchasers thereof. These differences are sufficient to raise a doubt as to likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers arising from\u2019the common use of the word MERITO. Under these circumstances, we think the alleged agreements between applicant and the owner of the reference registration are of evidentiary value.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-16\">As was stated in Avon Shoe Co., Inc. v. David Crystal, Inc., 171 F.Supp. 293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>(D.C.S.D.N.Y.1959), affirmed 279 F.2d 607:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">\u201cLikelihood of confusion is a relative concept which can be determined only according to the particular circumstances of each case. Mere comparison of the trademarks side by side is not sufficient. The conditions in the market place, not the courtroom, are the controlling factors. Gort Girls Frocks, Inc. v. Princess Pat Lingerie, Inc., D.C.S.D.N.Y.1947, 73 F.Supp. 364.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-5\"> It is a fact of which we take judicial notice that in the \u201cmarket place\u201d the lawful right to use a mark frequently is based on agreements between users of the marks. Such agreements may, as here, constitute a consent by one party to the use of a mark by the other party. The question then arises as to what effect should be given to such consent. As such, it seems to us that here the agreements should have been treated as the written consent was treated in Ex parte Frostmann &amp; Huffmann, 151 Ms.D. 789, 18 TMR 589 (Comrn\u2019r, 1928), where First Assistant Commissioner Kinnan, prior to the Lanham Act, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-6\">\u201cThis consent must be construed to mean that in the judgment of the registrant confusion in the trade would be quite unlikely or entirely absent. If the goods were identical registration should notwithstanding this consent of the registrant, be denied the applicant, but since the goods are different to some degree at least and since woolen goods are not generally used for the same purpose as the goods upon which the registrant uses its mark, it is believed, as the registrant has given consent to the applicant\u2019s use of the mark upon its particular class of goods, registration should not be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">We also agree with Professor Derenberg\u2019s statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-8\">\u201c * * * where there may exist reasonable doubt in the examiner\u2019s mind because of differences in either the marks or the goods, or both, consent by a prior registrant should, and under recent practice usually will, have an important persuasive effect in determining registrability. In other words, the Patent Office may conclude that if the previous registrant would not consider himself injured by the application [registration], there may be less likelihood that the general public would be confused. Such a liberal attitude toward the acceptance of letters of consent will very often avoid unnecessary contests between two or more parties who honestly believe that simultaneous use of their respective marks never has resulted and probably never will result in likelihood of confusion. * * * \u201d (The Patent Office as Guardian of the Public Interest in Trade-Mark Registration Proceedings, 14 Law and Contemporary Problems 288, 307 (1949), 31 JPOS 647, 676.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">However, before we can consider the legal effect here of the alleged agreements between applicant and the owner of the-reference registration, we are faced with a problem as to what \u201cevidence\u201d is before us as to the existence and content of these agreements which support applicant\u2019s position. The examiner and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board acted on the basis of certain alleged facts which were stated by applicant\u2019s attorney in responses to the examiner\u2019s refusal to grant registration. The Commissioner\u2019s main brief here asserts that the allegations of fact thus made by applicant are \u201cunsupported by affidavits or other competent evidence,\u201d and are therefore \u201cwithout evidentiary support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">The position of the Commissioner asserted for the first time by the solicitor in this court, is that the allegations of fact accepted by the examiner and the board are not competent evidence because they are not contained in affidavits but are merely assertions made over the signature of counsel for applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">While we agree with the solicitor that statements made over the signature of counsel are not evidence of the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>averred, it seems to us that it is the clear intent of sections 1(c) and 41 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051, 1123, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1051, 1123) to vest considerable discretion in the Commissioner in adopting rules which establish the legal effect of signed statements of counsel of the kind which the examiner and the board appear here to have accepted in lieu of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">When counsel for applicant made allegations of fact in signed responses to the Patent Office actions, he certified, under Rule 2.15 of the Trade-Mark Rules of Practice, 15 U.S.C.A.Appendix,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \u201cthere is good ground to support\u201d them. While such statements are not \u201cevidence\u201d of the facts stated, it seems to us that the examiner may either accept such statements and act upon them, or demand evidence of the facts so stated and which are relevant to the issue. A large measure of discretion is properly given the examiner in this respect. Where, as here, no objection was made to the statements of counsel and the examiner acted upon them, it seems to us that such statements have in legal effect become the equivalent of competent evidence. On this basis, we accept, for purposes of resolving the present issue, the following statement of fact set forth in the original opinion of the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-5\">\u201cAccording to the record in this application, in 1939, National Distillers and Chemical Corporation, applicant herein, became the sole distributor in the United States of wines bearing the mark \u2018MARQUES DEL MERITO\u2019. On September 8, 1939, in connection with this exclusive distributorship, the registration in question was assigned to applicant. In June, 1941, applicant adopted and began to use \u2018MERITO\u2019 as a trademark for rum. On November 27, 1946, applicant, in continuance of its distributorship of \u2018MARQUES DEL MERITO\u2019 wines, entered into agreements with companies controlled by the registrant, who supplied the sherry and port wines sold under this mark. Under the terms of these agreements, applicant was appointed sole distributor in the United States, its territories and possessions, of \u2018MARQUES DEL MERITO\u2019 sherry and port wines. In addition, each of the agreements provide [sic] for the supplier to assign to applicant, as sole distributor, all trademarks and labels used upon said goods, together with the good will of the business in connection therewith in applicant\u2019s territory, and any registrations thereof for said territory; for applicant to secure registrations of such trademarks and labels in its own name where they have not been obtained; and for such trademarks, labels and registrations as had been assigned to or were secured by applicant with the supplier\u2019s consent, to be reassigned to the supplier upon termination of the agreement. The agreements further provide that such reassignment shall not apply to the trademark \u2018MERITO\u2019 used by applicant on rum, the supplier consenting to use and registration by applicant of \u2018MERITO\u2019 for rum and waiving all right, title and interest in and to said trademark for such goods. On November 26, 1958, at registrant\u2019s request, applicant reassigned the cited registration to registrant. In this assignment, applicant\u2019s right to use \u2018MERITO\u2019 for rum was reaffirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Applicant has since ceased to be the sole distributor of \u2018MARQUES DEL MERITO\u2019 sherry wines, although it is still the exclusive distributor of \u2018MARQUES DEL MERITO\u2019 port wines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-4\">\u201cThe record further shows that applicant has continuously used \u2018MERITO\u2019 for rum since June, 1941. From June, 1941 to December 31, 1958, applicant sold over a million and a half cases of \u2018MERITO\u2019 rum at a total sales price exceeding forty-three million dollars. During the same period, applicant expended more than a million and a half dollars in advertising and promoting \u2018MERITO\u2019 rum in national publications, newspapers, and the like.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The record here does not contain the actual agreements under which applicant asserts it has the right to use and register MERITO for rum. Appellant\u2019s brief summarizes the apparently accepted fact that the agreements provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKo\">\u201c1. Suppliers [the prior registrant here] admit applicant\u2019s <em>ownership of amd right to use and register </em>the trademark MERITO <em>for rum, </em>and waive all right, title and interest in and to said trademark for rum, provided</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-6\">\u201c(a) that said trademark is used on rum produced in Puerto Rico, the United States or its possessions, or the Philippine Islands; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">\u201c(b) that said rum shall not be exported to, sold or offered for sale in Spain, any Spanish possession, Portugal or any Portuguese possession, or Cuba.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">\u201c2. Suppliers agree <em>never </em>to export to, sell or offer for sale or permit anyone else to export to, sell or offer for sale in the <em>continental United States, or its possessions, or the Philippine Islands, </em>any rum bearing any name consisting wholly or partly of the word \u2018M\u00e9rito.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">The agreements upon which applicant relies to support its right to use and register MERITO for rum are between applicant and the owner of the cited registration. Both must be presumed to be familiar with the trade and the market practices in connection with which the marks are used. The agreements, under which applicant has used MERITO, make this use a concurrent lawful use with the registered mark MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9RITO for wines which, we think, is not likely to cause confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers. We think, therefore, that the agreements by which the prior registrant consented to applicant\u2019s restricted use of MERITO for rum should be accepted as additional evidence of applicant\u2019s right to registration of the mark which it has been and is using thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">The intent of the Lanham Act appears to us to be to permit registrations of a mark under all of the foregoing conditions. As stated in Senate Report No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (May 14, 1946), at page 3, U.S.Code Cong.Service 1946, p. 1274, one purpose of the Act was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKl\">\u201c * * * to simplify registration and to make it stronger and more liberal, to dispense with mere technical prohibitions and arbitrary provisions * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-14\">The Senate Report points out (pages 4, 5, U.S.Code Cong.Service 1946, p. 1276) that the prior trademark statutes \u201chave not kept pace with the commercial development\u201d and that the Lanham Act attempts to \u201cmodernize the trade-mark statutes so that they will conform to legitimate present-day business practice.\u201d See also, 4 Callman Unfair Competition and Trademarks (2d Ed.) p. 2167, and The New Trademark Manual, Robert, 1947, p. 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-16\">Agreements permitting joint and concurrent use of marks have been recognized as valid by the courts. We consider the following decisions to be more persuasive on this issue than we do the arguments to the contrary advanced on behalf of the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-17\">In Chester H. Roth Co., Inc. v. Esquire, Inc., 186 F.2d 11 (C.A.2d 1951), certiorari denied, 341 U.S. 921, 71 S.Ct. 743, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>95 L.Ed. 1354 (1951), the court recognized as valid certain agreements which provided for the joint use and protection as a trademark of the word \u201cEsquire,\u201d the common use of which might otherwise be confusing. The court said, \u201cSuch agreements have a legitimate business purpose and are not contrary to public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">In California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Windsor Beverages, 118 F.2d 149, (C.A.7th 1941) the court considered and held valid an agreement which permitted the joint and concurrent use of the two marks in issue under an agreement by which each party had granted the other the right to employ the mark. The court approved this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\"> Applicant has urged us to apply section 19 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946 in the present ex parte proceeding and has argued in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">\u201cSince the agreements of November 27, 1946 expressly admit applicant\u2019s right to <em>use and register </em>MERITO for rum, they constitute a <em>legal estoppel, </em>that is, an <em>estoppel by contract, </em>in favor of applicant. In addition, applicant\u2019s long and extensive use of MERITO for rum, in reliance upon such argeements, also works an <em>equitable estoppel </em>in favor of applicant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">We think the clear intent of Congress was that section 19 be limited to inter partes proceedings, and this for the very sound reason that the equitable principles of laches, estoppel and acquiescence are based on facts and should not be applied either in favor of or against one not a party to the proceeding. An ex parte proceeding arising from the refusal of the Patent Office to register a trade-mark does not become an inter partes proceeding in the sense of section 19 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1069, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1069), as urged by applicant, merely because the applicant and the Patent Office appear many times in opposing roles.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">The authorities cited for giving no effect to the agreements between the parties are: Skookum Packers Ass\u2019n, v. Pacific Northwest Canning Co., 45 F.2d 912, 18 CCPA 792 (1930), In re Laskin Brothers, Inc., 146 F.2d 308, 32 CCPA 820 (1944), and Schering &amp; Glatz, Inc. v. Sharpe &amp; Dohme, Inc., 146 F.2d 1019, 32 CCPA 827 (1944). In these cases it was held that the parties by their deeds or agreement cannot confer upon the Commissioner of Patents the power to do that which the statute forbids. We do not think these pre-Lanham Act cases are controlling here since the Lanham Act liberalized the prior act and gave the Commissioner authority to register marks used concurrently under such circumstances as we have in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">We think the provisions of the asserted agreements are important circumstances of this case and should have been considered for their bearing upon the issue of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">The 1946 agreements here relied upon by applicant as supporting its asserted right to use and register the mark MERITO for rum contain conditions on this right. If we consider the agreements, to be \u201cconsents\u201d to use the mark MERITO for rum, they are limited or restricted consents. Section 1(a) (1) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051) indicates that such limitations and' restrictions should be stated in an application for registration of marks where they are exceptions to applicant\u2019s claim of exclusive right to use. The present application for registration is not so limited. Since applicant on the present record does not appear to be entitled to a. registration broader than its contractual1 right to use the mark, the present application to register the mark does not appear to comply with section 1(a) (1) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we <em>reverse\u25a0. </em>the decision of the board and <em>remcmd </em>the case for further proceedings consistent, herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b997-14\">MARTIN, Judge, sat but did not participate in decision.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A-S_\">.

I should like to discuss <em>how, </em>as a practical matter, the public interest is protected within the framework of the Lanham Act. This court is as much concerned with protecting the public as is the Patent Office. The problem, however, is how best to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">It seems tolerably clear from the Patent Office brief on its petition that it deems the \u201cpublic\u201d to be potential purchasers of the wares involved, that its \u201cinterest\u201d is to be saved from the hazards of a <em>caveat emptor </em>policy, more particularly confusion or deception as to the source or quality of goods through the <em>use </em>of the same or similar trademarks, and that this is the interest over which it thinks it is standing guard in administering the law, particularly section 2 (d). With all this I can agree insofar as the trademark act as a <em>whole </em>is concerned, but it seems to me that the Patent Office misapprehends its function in enforcing the provisions of the first clause of section 2(d). It is, at times, like a cat watching the wrong rat hole.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">I gather from what the Patent Office petition says, and from its acts in the instant case, that its zeal as \u201cguardian of the public interest\u201d is so exercised as to <em>deny </em>registration if it feels there is, by its independent determination, <em>any </em>likelihood of confusion of any kind as between the mark sought to be registered and the prior registration, without regard to the desires, opinions or agreements of the owner of the prior registration and without taking into account, it seems to me, either the facts of commercial life or the intended operation of the Lanham Act. It seems to do this on the assumption that in so doing it is actually protecting the public from confusion. But is it?</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Both reason and history seem to point to the correctness of the proposition that the only role the Patent Office <em>can </em>play <em>in protecting the public from confusion, </em>through <em>its </em>administration, in part, of the trademark law, is by protecting trademarks. The <em>refusal </em>of registration, <em>except as it is an aspect of protecting existing marks </em>(or the protection of the freedom of the public to use words and symbols in the public domain), does <em>not </em>serve to protect the public from confusion because refusal to register has almost no effect on trademark use, which use always precedes application to register, continues during the prosecution of the application, and usually goes on after registration is finally refused, unless something other than that refusal intervenes to stop such use, I will develop this proposition further.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>First, however, let us clear away one possible source of misunderstanding. Confusion is not caused by registrations in the Patent Office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 2(d) is not directed to confusion <em>from registration. </em>The purchasing public knows no more about trademark <em>registrations </em>than a man walking down the street in a strange city knows about legal title to the land and buildings he passes. There may be an occasional sign giving notice of ownership, just as an occasional trademark owner will call attention to the fact that he owns it, but it is the exception. What the public knows is the wares and the marks they bear and, perhaps subconsciously, its relationship to them. It is not concerned with legal titles to and registrations of marks. In speaking of likelihood of confusion, insofar as- ex parte cases are concerned section 2(d) is dealing with what is usually, in ex parte prosecution, a hypothetical situation, what <em>would be </em>likely, on the assumption the mark sought to be registered is used on the goods named in the application and the reference mark is used on the goods named in the registration, under the presumed market conditions relating to the sale and use of those goods. But hypothetical situations do not confuse the purchasing public. The public is confused only by what is done in the marketplace, by real life activity, use of the mark, its counterfeiting, colorable imitation, copying, and the use of such marks as are likely to be confused with it. The <em>denial </em>of a registration has little or no effect on such activity. Its denial affords, therefore, little or no protection to the purchasing public. On the other hand, the <em>granting </em>of a registration may protect the public from confusion. A good guardian of the public interest must look at both sides of the coin.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">The instant case affords an example. Applicant seeks to register MERITO for rum. The facts assumed to have been proved and accepted in the Patent Office as the basis for decision (so that this case is removed from the category of the hypothetical) show that applicant adopted and started to use MERITO on rum at a time when it was the owner, by assignment, of the reference registration of MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9RITO for wines. That was in June 1941. Applicant has now sold MERITO rum for over 20 years. In the period 1941-1958, it sold one and a half million cases of MERITO rum for more than forty-three million dollars and spent over a million and a half dollars advertising it. MERITO rum (I judicially notice) is today on the shelves of liquor stores in the Nation\u2019s Capital. A few weeks after filing the instant application the reference registration was reassigned to the original registrant so that, under section 2(d), it is now a mark \u201cregistered * <em>* * </em>by another.\u201d On that registration applicant is rejected, notwithstanding complete approval of use and registration by the registrant, the Patent Office insisting that rejection is necessary to protect the public from confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">In this situation what in fact protects the public?</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">The Patent Office, \u201ccarrying out its statutory duty of making its own independent determination,\u201d which is actually the subjective opinion of an examiner, concludes that, beyond question, the use of MERITO on rum concurrently with use by another of MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9RITO on wine is likely to confuse the public. In order to protect the public, as the guardian of its interests, it refuses registration. What happens? Nothing. The sale of MERITO rum continues. If the public is confused \u2014 and there is no evidence to show that it is \u2014 the presumed confusion is merely that it thinks that the same people put out or sponsor MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9RITO wines and MERITO rum. (They did once but they don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>now.) I suspect that the public is indifferent to the situation, as it is when the owner of a product sold under a trademark sells its business to another who continues to sell the same product under the same mark. If there is any \u201cconfusion\u201d in this picture, it certainly is not injuring the public. The only possible injury is to the owner of the MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9RITO mark. The refusal of the registration has not protected the public in any way I can see. The customer who calls for MERITO rum still gets MERITO rum from the original source. He has not been confused, mistaken or deceived as to that. The MERITO mark is serving its proper function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">But suppose, now, that another purvey- or of rum starts to sell MERITO rum, or MERIT-O, or NERITO, or MARETO rum. Is the purchasing public then likely to be confused, or mistaken, or deceived ? Where have the guardianship activities of the Patent Office left it? The longtime and original vendor of MERITO rum would like to enjoin the competitor from copying or colorably imitating the trademark by which its old customers and those recommended by them have been assured of getting rum from the original source. But it has no registration and enjoys no Lanham Act benefits, notwithstanding its twenty years in the field as the sole source of MERITO rum. It can protect itself, and incidentally protect its customers and the \u201cpublic\u201d from getting products they do not want, only by whatever means the common law or state statutes provide, but not through any Lanham Act weapons so carefully withheld from it by the Patent Office as guardian of the interests of that \u201cpublic.\u201d There is not even a record in the Patent Office that the original vendor has any right to this mark MERITO and when sued the pirate claims he was without notice of plaintiff\u2019s mark, challenges plaintiff\u2019s exclusive rights to the mark and compels plaintiff to prove its ownership as well as infringement.\u2019 The confusion arid deception of the public continues while the litigation drags on, the infringing stocks are disposed of, and the infringer becomes judgment-proof, awaiting the next chance to strike and take another free ride on MERITO\u2019s reputation and advertising expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">On the other hand, if the original purveyors of MERITO rum had a Lanham Act principal register registration, as applied for, they would be in a position to crack down promptly on infringers and preliminarily enjoin the sale of spurious MERITO rum, thus <em>protecting the purchasing public from confusion, mistake and deception. </em>The very existence of a registration would tend to inhibit infringement. How else could the Patent Office guard that interest of the public than by affording such protection? Did its denial of registration protect the public? Does anyone expect appellant to' stop selling MERITO rum ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">I have no doubt that courts of equity would protect, eventually, applicant-appellant in its right to exclude others from using MERITO, or any mark likely to be confused therewith, on rum. If I am' right in this, then refusal of the registration produces the anomalous situation of enforceable trademark rights unregistrable under the Lanham Act, one of the situations of the prior law which that act sought to correct. See Alfred Dunhill of London v. Dunhill, 49 CCPA -, 293 F.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">I do not believe it is a correct construction of section 2(d) to say that it is intended to prevent the registration of any mark which, in any conceivable way, might confuse some portion of the public and in that way to protect the public. I am of this view for the reason, illustrated above, that the public is not thereby protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">I believe the primary purpose of section 2(d) is, as an integral part of the act, to protect the owners of prior trademarks. By protecting them, and thus enabling them to protect themselves against infringers, it follows, but as a <em>secondary </em>effect, that the public is protected from confusion caused by the sale of spuriously marked goods. No government could police trademark <em>use </em>so as to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>public from confusion. It must count on the self-interest of trademark owners to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">To show that the purpose of section 2(d) is the direct protection of the public, the solicitor quotes the following from Senate Report 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., U.S.Code Cong.Service 1946, p. 1274, which we, of the majority, are charged with not taking into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayt\">\u201cThe purpose underlying <em>any </em>trade-mark <em>statute </em>is twofold. One is to protect the public so that it may be confident that, in purchasing a product bearing a particular trademark which it favorably knows, it will get the product which it asks for and wants to get. Secondly, where the owner of a trade-mark has spent energy, time, and money in presenting to the public the product, he is protected in his investment from its misappropriation by pirates and cheats. <em>This </em>is the well-established rule of law protecting both the public and the trade-mark owner.\u201d [Emphasis mine.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">What could more aptly apply to the <em>protection </em>of the applicant\u2019s MERITO trademark for rum so as to assure that the public, which favorably knows it, will get it when it asks for it and so that the applicant, who has invested heavily in it will be protected against pirates and cheats ? The significance of that passage would seem to depend on whether you italicize \u201cto protect the public,\u201d as the solicitor did, and forget the rest or whether you visualize more than one possible way of protecting the public. Moreover, the passage does not refer to section 2(d) at all but to the statute \u2014 any trademark statute, in fact \u2014 as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">I quote from the next page of the same report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azeg\">\u201cThis bill * * * has as its object the <em>protection of trade-marks, </em>securing <em>to the owner </em>the good will of his business and protecting the public <em>against spurious and falsely marked goods. </em>The matter has been approached <em>with the view of protecting trade-marks </em>and making infringement and piracy unprofitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-10\"><em>\u201cTo protect trade-marks, therefore, is to protect the public </em>from deceit, to foster fair competition, and to secure to the business community the advantages of reputation and good will by <em>preventing their diversion from those who have created them to those who have not. </em>This is the end to which the bill is directed.\u201d [Emphasis mine.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">I believe the court\u2019s decision in this case will more effectively carry out these objectives and protect the public than would the decision of the Patent Office denying registration. I do not disagree with the thesis that a major objective of the Lanham Act is to protect the public and that in administering that law the Patent Office acts as a guardian of the public\u2019s interests. But I do think there should be a reappraisal of how to go about doing that. I think it would be well to forget some of the generalities uttered in many cases under the Act of 1905 in an earlier time and reconsider what Congress stated, in the Lanham Act itself, are its purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcE\">\u201cThe intent of this Act is to regulate commerce within the control of Congress <em>by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks </em>in such commerce; to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by State, or territorial legislation; <em>to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud and deception </em>in such commerce <em>by the use of reproductions, copies, counterfeits, or color-able imitations </em>of registered marks; and to provide rights and remedies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting trademarks, trade names, and unfair competition entered into between the United States and foreign nations.\u201d Sec. 45 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1127) [Emphasis mine.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Refusal to register MERITO for rum accomplishes none of these objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Referring to the section 45 statement of intent above*quoted, Edward S. Rogers, one of the chief architects of the Lanham Act, said in his introduction to Robert\u2019s, The New Trade-Mark Manual (p. xiv);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">\u201cHere we have a direct statement of a national policy by the Congress. The purpose of the Act is, in brief, to protect trademarks and to repress unfair competition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">He also said (p. xx):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-7\">\u201cThe Lanham Act is the embodiment of the purpose to secure to every business man the advantage which public preference for his goods gives to him and to protect him in the exclusive right to the names and marks which perpetuate the good will which merit earns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">And on page xxi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-9\">\u201cThe situation has another aspect which should not be overlooked. The public has rights, too. <em>A purchaser is entitled to receive what he expects to get </em>and not be misled by <em>deceptive </em>resemblance into purchasing something he does not want.\u201d [Emphasis mine.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Twelve years ago, after two years of experience with the administration of the Lanham Act, Professor Walter Derenberg, participating in the program at Duke University called \u201cTrade-Marks in Transition,\u201d in his paper entitled \u201cThe Patent Office as Guardian of the Public Interest in Trade-Mark Registration Proceedings\u201d (Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 14, No. 2, pages 288-322, reprinted 31 J.P.O.S. 647), dealt in great detail with the very problem which the instant case presents. He dealt separately with \u201cpublic interest\u201d in ex parte and in contested Patent Office proceedings. Speaking of the former, he .refers to the \u201cdifficult problem of proper evaluation and consideration of the public-interest aspects of * * * third party rights\u201d when \u201can application for registration comes into possible conflict with prior-rights of third parties (Section 2(d)),\u201d and of \u201cthe problem of balancing public interest and private rights for the purpose of administering Section 2(d).\u201d He-said (p. 292):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-12\">\u201c * * * it is * * * apparent that the extent to which such public interest should be recognized depends to a very large degree upon the scope of legal protection to which the former owner of the conflicting registration is entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">After going into the problem with great care and scholarly consideration of the background law, his final conclusion as to the proper handling of ex parte cases was this (p. 305; 31 J.P.O.S. at p.. 674):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-14\">\u201cThe conclusion would seem to be inescapable, therefore, that even under the broad confusion test of Section 2(d) of the new Act, applications involving possible confusion as to <em>sponsorship </em>or <em>reputation </em>should not be rejected ex parte on the ground of an ever present parallel interest of the public to be protected from this type of confusion. It. seems that for the purpose of registration proceedings <em>the private interests of the previous registrant are-primarily involved </em>and that <em>the public interest in such situations is not sufficiently predominant to compel the Office to reject </em>the application in its capacity as guardian of the public interest and <em>irrespective of the previous registrant\u2019s own attitude.\u201d </em>[Emphasis mine.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">What we have in the present case is a situation in which the only chance of public \u201cconfusion\u201d is as to a possible common <em>sponsorship </em>of MERITO rum and MARQU\u00c9S DEL M\u00c9RITO wine. I submit that there is no possibility that purchasers (of either the rum or the wine) will be either mistaken or deceived. The purchaser of either will \u201creceive what he expects to get and not be misled by deceptive resemblance into purchasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>^something he does not want,\u201d to use Mr. .Rogers\u2019 words. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">It was Derenberg\u2019s expert conclusion that in such a situation the Patent Office <em>is not required by section 2(d) </em>to reject the application to register, since the interest affected is predominantly private not public, and that consent by the owner \u25a0 of the private interest, the prior registrant, may relieve any concern the Patent Office might have on that score. In the .absence of such a consent, the law still .affords opportunity for opposition and \u25a0 cancellation wherein private interests \u25a0can protect themselves, where the public interest is not clearly involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">It would be trite to say, in this country \u25a0of government of the people by the people, that <em>all </em>law is in the public interest and that every administrative agency in trying to apply the law is acting as a guardian of the public interests. But in speaking of a law enacted <em>to protect trademark \u2022owners, </em>there is considerable risk of error in pursuing a policy under which the administrative agency deems itself to be .guarding the public interest whenever it refuses to register. It properly guards those interests only when such refusal \u25a0truly furthers those interests. They are not furthered by denying registration to \u25a0an established, widely-used trademark, even where the use of that mark may \u25a0cause some confusion in the minds of :Some members of the public, if that confusion is of such a nature that it does not clearly injure the public and injury to the owner of the prior mark is negatived by his consent. The clause \u201cconfusion or mistake or to deceive purchas\u2022ers\u201d must be construed by a rule of reason to include only such as will injure \u2022someone. Otherwise it prevents registration to no purpose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-5\">. The examiner\u2019s letter of September 30, 1959, his final action, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-7\">\u201c * * * it is the duty of the Patent Office to protect the public and guard against confusion <em>through the registration of a mark * </em>* [Emphasis mine.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">The board, in affirming, made no such statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1003-8\">WORLEY, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AuH\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">In denying appellant\u2019s application for registration of \u201cMERITO\u201d the examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-10\">\u201cSection 2(d) of the 1946 act specifically precludes the registration of a mark which so resembles a mark registered in this Office by another, as to be likely, when applied to the goods, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.
