Coles\u2019 Appeal from County Commissioners.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b691-10\">Third Judicial District, Bridgeport,</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AaWe\">April Term, 1907.</p>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b691-11\">Baldwin, C. J., Hamersley, Hall, Prentice and Thayer, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b691-12\">Under the name of an \u201cappeal,\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 2660, as heretofore construed by this court, authorizes a taxpayer aggrieved by the decision of the county commissioners in granting a liquor license, to make an original application to the Superior Court to set aside their action when that is illegal and in excess of their powers. <em>Held </em>that upon such an application the court might make an investigation as to the commissioners\u2019 conduct and set aside their action as illegal, although such illegality did not appear from the case as it was presented to the commissioners.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b692-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>It is legally possible for the Superior Court, upon such an application, to find that the licensee\u2019s place of business is so manifestly unsuitable for the sale of liquor as to justify its conclusion that the commissioners acted illegally in issuing the license.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b692-6\">In the present case the judgment-file recited that the court found the place to be unsuitable and adjudged that the license be revoked. <em>Held, </em>that this form of expressing the judgment sufficiently indicated its substance for the practical purposes of this summary and informal proceeding, although a way more in accord with the legal effect of \u00a7 2660, as settled by former decisions, would be an explicit statement that the commissioners acted illegally and in excess of their powers.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b692-7\">The conduct of the court in such a case, in reaching its conclusion after a lawful hearing, is not reviewable.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b692-8\">Argued April 9th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"As8\">decided May 1st, 1907.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b692-9\">Appeal from a decision of the County Commissioners of Fairfield County granting a liquor license to one James F.

Certainly such conduct should not be imputed to a judge when it does not surely and unmistakably appear in the record; and in this case it does not so appear. On the contrary, the judge indicates that he considered the unsuitability of the place as incident to determining whether the commissioners acted within the limits of their power; and in overruling the appellee\u2019s claim that the court could not, upon the evidence produced, find that the commissioners had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>acted illegally or in, abuse of their power, the judge implies that he did find illegal conduct upon evidence he deemed sufficient to support that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">This finding of the judge, that the commissioners acted in excess of their powers and illegally in issuing a license to sell at a place which was not a suitable one, is the real judgment of the court. There is in this summary and informal proceeding no prescribed way of expressing the finding in a formal order or judgment. The way followed by the trial- judge, of recording his finding that in fact \u201c the place in question is not a suitable one in which to sell spirituous and intoxicating liquors,\u201d and the consequent conclusion of the law that the license is vacated or revoked, indicates the substance of the judgment and for practical purposes is sufficient. In a case like this, however, a way more in accord with the legal effect of \u00a72660 in authorizing under the name of \u201c appeal \u201d this application, as settled by our decisions, would be an explicit statement of the finding that the commissioners acted in excess of their power and illegally in issuing the license, and that the license is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The conduct of the judge in this case after a lawful hearing given the parties, in reaching his conclusion, from all the evidence produced, that the commissioners acted illegally in issuing a license to the appellee to sell liquor at the place mentioned, is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">There is no error in the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
