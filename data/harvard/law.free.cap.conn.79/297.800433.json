Upon the defendant\u2019s objection this evidence was received. In the court\u2019s instructions to the jury the latter were told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the agency relation might be established by parol notwithstanding the statute of frauds. This ruling and these instructions furnish the basis of the appellant\u2019s only complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The situation presented was precisely that, in all pertinent particulars, which was passed upon in <em>Rathbun </em>v. <em>McLay, </em>76 Conn. 308, 56 Atl. 511. It is of course quite immaterial whether the consequence of an agent\u2019s unfaithfulness is, as in the former case, the loss of the principal\u2019s money paid to the agent as the result of the latter\u2019s deception, or, as in the present case, financial injury and loss otherwise resulting from his deceit. The gist of this action, like that of the former, is the breach of the duty incident to the confidential relation of principal and agent and resulting damage to the principal. The principles laid down and conclusions reached in the former case must therefore be controlling in this ease. Our reasons then given for our conclusions need not be here repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
