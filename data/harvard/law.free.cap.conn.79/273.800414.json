The trial court found that whatever the partnership relation, it did not include the ownership and management of such real estate, nor did any settlement between them involve any transactions relating thereto. Held:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-13\">1. That this finding was sufficient to dispose of such defense, and rendered it useless for the court to go further and determine whether any partnership in fact existed, and if so, the nature and scope of it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-15\">2. That the limit of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery was one half of his actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>expenditure, as contended by the defendant, and not the reasonable worth or fair market value of the improvements.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b286-6\">3. That this principle was correctly applied by the trial court, notwithstanding its apparent misapprehension of the import of the defendant's claim.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b286-7\">Submitted on briefs June 7th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APp\">decided July 30th, 1906.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">Action upon an oral agreement to recover one half of the cost of additions and improvements made to buildings owned by the parties in common, brought to and tried by the District Court of Waterbury, <em>Peck, Acting-Judge; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff for |600, and appeal by the defendant.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ADc\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-9\"><em>Charles G.

Clearly the court was under no duty to adjudicate that matter, and it would have served no useful purpose had it done so. It was sufficient for the purposes of the case to have it ascertained that, whatever copartnership relation there might have been, the matters here involved were not connected with it. By the finding of that fact the special defense was effectually disposed cf.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The defendant asked the trial court to rule that \u201c no matter what the additions and improvements claimed to have been made by the plaintiff were reasonably worth, or what was their fair market value, the defendant could not be liable in this action for any more than one half of what the plaintiff actually expended in making the additions and improvements alleged in the complaint.\u201d As to this claim the court, in its finding, says that it held that said proposition had no application to the facts before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We understand the purport of the claim made, to be that the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery must be based upon the plaintiff\u2019s expenditure, and not upon the fair market value of the improvements made, nor upon what they were reasonably worth. So interpreted the proposition was a sound one. It is quite apparent that the court, in making the quoted statement concerning it, misinterpreted the language in which it was couched, since the finding makes it clear beyond question that the court applied precisely the principle for which the defendant contended, and rendered judgment for one half the cost to the plaintiff of his improvements and not for one half their reasonable worth or of their fair market value. The finding states in most explicit terms that the court determined the sums paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the plaintiff on each portion of the work, and rendered judgment for one half of the sums expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">It is argued from the fact that expert evidence was received with respect to some of the improvements, that the damages were not assessed upon the basis of cost to the plaintiff. This evidence, however, which was received without objection, was directed, as the finding states, to the cost and not to anything else. Clearly the defendant was not harmed by the action which the court took, and ought not, therefore, to be awarded a new trial for what is so palpably an inadvertent and mistaken statement in the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
