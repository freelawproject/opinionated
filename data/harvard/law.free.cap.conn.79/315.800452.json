She was thereupon, and in the absence of the jury, examined by the court, and under the court\u2019s direction by counsel for both the State and the accused, as to her qualifications. The court, also, before the conclusion of the examination, sent for and examined the child\u2019s teacher and Sunday-school teacher upon the same subject. The court found that the child understood the nature of an oath, and that she was of sufficient intelligence and understanding to be sworn as a witness, directed that the oath be administered to her, and permitted her to testify to the jury. The accused excepted to this ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">The trial judge was asked to attach to the finding a transcript of all the notes of the official stenographer relative to the proceedings pertaining to the child\u2019s examination and of her testimony. This request he denied, but certified to the correctness of the transcript and ordered that it be filed, and also a copy of the charge to the jury, as part of the record of the cause, but that neither should be printed unless the Supreme Court of Errors should so direct.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-7\"><em>David H. Slade </em>and <em>George C. </em>Morgan, for the appellant (the accused).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-8\"><em>Hadlai A. Hull, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, for the appellee (the State).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b328-9\">Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">But one reason of appeal is assigned, namely, that the court erred in ruling on the preliminary examination cf.the child that she understood the nature of an oath and that she was competent to testify as a witness. The finding shows that this reason is without foundation. <em>Holcomb </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>28 Conn. 177; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>United States, </em>159 U. S. 523, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">On the argument before us another point was pressed, namely, that it appears from the transcript of the stenog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>rapher\u2019s notes that'the court did not pass upon the competency of the child to be a witness before admitting her to testify, but only ruled that it would allow the oath to be administered to her and leave the matter to be disposed of in its charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Although the transcript and the charge have not been printed for use on this appeal, they became, by the action of the trial court, part of the record of the cause in this court, and could be referred to as such for any proper purpose. See Rules of Court, p. 99, \u00a7\u00a7 20-22. Without considering whether there is anything in them inconsistent with the finding, it is enough to say that thejr cannot be of any benefit to the appellant, since the claim of error in question was not made a reason of appeal; contradicts the only reason of appeal which is stated; and no leave has been sought to introduce it by an amendment of the appeal. General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>798,802; </em>Rules of Court, p. 103, \u00a7 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
