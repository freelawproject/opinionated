The Energy Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7384 <em>et seq. </em>(the Act), provides, among other things, for the lump-sum payment to survivors of persons who contracted cancer as a result of exposure to radiation during employment in the United States nuclear weapons program. Survivors may receive benefits under the Act \u201conly if\u2019 there is a 50% or greater probability that the decedent contracted cancer from exposure to radiation during employment in a covered facility. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 73841(9)(B), 7384n(b). To make this determination, the DOL is required to use interactive software that estimates the probability of causation for various types of cancer using certain \u201cdefault settings.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 81.20, 81.21. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the DOL acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to adjust these default settings in light of the decedent\u2019s exceedingly rare form of prostate cancer. Under the deferential standard of review required, because the DOL set forth a rational connection between the relevant factors and its decision to retain the default settings, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment upholding the DOL\u2019s decision. As a result, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">I. STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">Congress enacted The Energy Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act to provide benefits to employees with illnesses caused by exposure to radiation and other toxic substances in the course of their work for the Department of Energy (DOE) or its predecessor agencies, and certain of its contractors and subcontractors. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7384. Under Part B of the Act, employees or their eligible survivors can receive a lump-sum payment of $150,000 for certain illnesses, including cancer, caused by exposure to radiation in the course of employment at Department of Energy facilities. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 73841(9)(A) and (B), 7384s(a)(l). An employee or his or her survivors are entitled to compensation under Part B of the Act \u201cif, and only if, the cancer ... was at least as likely as not related to employment\u201d in a covered facility. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7384n(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">An individual seeks benefits under Part B of the Act by filing a claim with the DOL\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 30.100, 30.101. When a claim is made, the OWCP gathers the employee\u2019s relevant factual and medical information and transfers it to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to perform a radiation dose reconstruction. The dose reconstruction estimates the amount of radiation received by the employee during covered employment using a variety of factors including the employee\u2019s age, gender, employment history, workplace characterization data, and any other information useful for characterizing workplace radiation exposure. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 82.14. The OWCP uses the completed dose reconstruction to determine whether the employee\u2019s cancer is \u201cat least as likely as not related to employment\u201d in a covered facility. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7384n(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The OWCP bases its probability calculation on an interactive-computer-software program specifically designed for adjudication of claims under Part B of the Act, the NIOSH-IREP. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 81.20. The NIOSH-IREP \u201cmodels the dose-response relationship between ionizing radiation and 33 cancers using morbidity data from the ... Japanese atomic bomb survivor cohort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 81.10(a). The program uses these models coupled with NIOSH\u2019s dose reconstruction to calculate the probability that the employee developed cancer due to radiation exposure during employment in a covered facility. The program\u2019s default settings account for uncertainty from several sources, including statistical uncertainty in the various cancer risk models. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 81.11. The program, however, contains a feature entitled \u201cUser Defined Additional Uncertainty\u201d that \u201ccan be adjusted to account for the presence of additional uncertainty and bias correction not presently\u201d accounted for by the program\u2019s default settings. The program\u2019s-manual states that the default settings should only be adjusted \u201cafter sufficient justification accompanied by a written rationale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">After OWCP finishes its probability of causation calculation, it issues a recommended decision on the claim. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 30.305(a). The claimant can file objections within 60 days of the date of the recommended decision. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 30.310(a). Once adjudication of the claim is complete, the Final Adjudication Branch within the OWCP issues the DOL\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Margaret Hayward is the surviving widow of Milton Hayward. Mr. Hayward worked in the DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons program for over fifteen years, during which time he was exposed to ionizing radiation. On February 3, 1997, doctors diagnosed Mr. Hayward with sarcomatoid carcinoma, an exceedingly rare form of prostate cancer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The cancer spread rapidly and he died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Ms. Hayward filed a claim for compensation under Part B of the Act based on her husband\u2019s death. As required by the Act, the OWCP gathered Mr. Hayward\u2019s relevant factual and medical information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>and transferred the claim to NIOSH to perform a radiation dose reconstruction. OWCP then used the dose reconstruction and the NIOSH-IREP program to calculate a 21.41% probability that Mr. Hayward developed cancer from radiation exposure during his employment with the DOE. Based on this figure, the OWCP issued a recommended decision denying Ms. Hayward\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Ms. Hayward objected to the OWCP\u2019s recommended decision and requested a hearing. Although she lodged several objections, she primarily contended that the OWCP significantly underestimated the probability that radiation caused Mr. Hayward\u2019s cancer due to its failure to consider the rarity of sarcomatoid carcinoma and its alleged higher correlation with radiation exposure (as compared to other forms of prostate cancer). At the hearing, Ms. Hayward provided medical literature regarding cancer patients treated with radiation therapy and a letter from Mr. Hayward\u2019s doctor to support these claims. Ms. Hayward contended that this evidence justified adjusting the default settings of the \u201cUser Defined Uncertainty Distribution\u201d within the NIOSH-IREP program.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Following the hearing, the DOL hearing representative sought guidance from a DOL physicist concerning the propriety of adjusting the default settings of the NIOSH-IREP program based on Ms. Hayward\u2019s objections. Nearly a month later, and after consulting with a representative of the developer of the program, the DOL physicist concluded that Ms. Hayward\u2019s objections did not justify altering the program\u2019s default settings. Thereafter, the OWCP\u2019s Final Adjudication Branch issued a final decision denying Ms. Hayward\u2019s survivor claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Ms. Hayward filed an original complaint in the Northern District of Texas, alleging that the DOL acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to adjust the default settings of the NIOSH-IREP program to account for the rarity of Mr. Hayward\u2019s cancer. Subsequently, the Director of the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, acting under his regulatory authority, vacated the OWCP\u2019s final decision and returned Ms. Hayward\u2019s claim to the Final Adjudication Branch for a revised final decision addressing in more detail Ms. Hayward\u2019s objections. The revised final decision more thoroughly addressed Ms. Hayward\u2019s objections by incorporating the findings of the DOL physicist. Ms. Hayward then filed an amended complaint in the Northern District, again arguing that the DOL acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her claim. The DOL moved for summary judgment on this claim, arguing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the administrative record showed that the OWCP considered the relevant factors and issued a final decision rationally related to those factors. The district court granted summary judgment for the DOL. Ms. Hayward appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">This Court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard to review the DOL decision as the district court. <em>Templet v. HydroChem Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2004). Because Part B of the Act does not contain a standard of review and does not require that a formal hearing be held, the district court correctly reviewed the OWCP\u2019s final decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard set forth in section 706(2)(A) of the Administrative Procedures Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The arbitrary and capricious standard is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d and we must afford the agency\u2019s decision \u201ca presumption of regularity.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>Garner, </em>767 F.2d 104, 116 (5th Cir.1985) (citation omitted). We limit our review to whether the agency \u201carticulated a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made,\u201d <em>Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. Wilson N. Jones Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>374 F.3d 362, 367 (5th Cir.2004), and \u201cit is well-settled that an agency\u2019s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 42-43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). Although we must conduct a \u201csearching and careful review\u201d of the administrative record to determine whether the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, we may not substitute our judgment for the agency\u2019s. <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 415-416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). Our mandate is not to \u201cweigh the evidence pro and con but to determine whether the agency decision was based on a consideration of relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Delta Found., Inc. v. United States, </em>303 F.3d 551, 562 (5th Cir. 2002) (internal quotations omitted). Courts will \u201cuphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2518, 2530, 168 L.Ed.2d 467 (2007) (quoting <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974)). In reviewing technical agency decisions such as these, \u201c[w]e must look at the decision not as a chemist, biologist, or statistician that we are qualified neither by training nor experience to be, but as a reviewing court exercising our narrowly defined duty of holding agencies to certain minimal standards of rationality.\u201d <em>Gulf Restoration Network v. United States Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>452 F.3d 362, 368 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">This case presents the very circumstance contemplated by <em>Gulf Restoration. </em>Ms. Hayward asks the court to disregard the agency\u2019s expertise and substitute its own judgment of scientific literature unaccompanied by expert analysis. Ms. Hayward\u2019s sole contention is that the OWCP acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to adjust the default settings of the NIOSH-IREP program to account for the rare nature of her deceased husband\u2019s cancer. She bases this argument on two related grounds. First, she argues that sar-comatoid carcinoma, because of its rarity, cannot be fairly compared to the typical adenocarcinoma, the type of prostate cancer most represented in the dose-risk relationship model used by the NIOSH-IREP program to determine the probability of causation for all types of prostate cancer. Second, she argues that sarcomatoid carcinoma should be treated differently than other forms of prostate cancer because, she contends, it is far more likely to be caused by exposure to radiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Having reviewed the administrative record, we agree that the OWCP did not engage in arbitrary and capricious decision making when it chose to retain the default settings of the NIOSH-IREP program. The OWCP, after consulting with a DOL physicist, issued a final decision that specifically addressed both of Ms. Hayward\u2019s objections. With respect to Ms. Hayward\u2019s objection concerning the rarity of sarcomatoid carcinoma, the OWCP responded that the excess relative risk (ERR) of prostate (or any) cancer is determined by the following formula: ERR/ dose [Cancer risk attributable to radiation exposure] [divided by] [base-link risk (of that cancer to the general population) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>[plus] cancer risk attributable to radiation exposure]. It further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">The prostate cancer morphology (i.e., adenocarcinoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma) does not affect the ERR/dose and the resultant NIOSH-IREP result. Any difference (or rarity) in the type of prostate cancer is already accounted for in the definition of ERR/dose; the incidence rate of each of these prostate cancers is inherently reflected within the \u201cgeneral population\u201d cohort. NIOSH-IREP uses the ERR/does data for \u201cAll Male Genitalia\u201d from the Japanese Atomic Bomb survivors, and therefore, would be inclusive of all types of prostate cancers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Thus, the OWCP specifically considered Ms. Hayward\u2019s objection concerning the rarity of sarcomatoid carcinoma but determined that the dose-risk model that the NIOSH-IREP program uses to calculate the probability of causation for all types of prostate cancer already accounts for this factor. In other words, the general prostate cancer data used by the OWCP, while based primarily on adenocarcinoma (because it is more common), includes cases of sarcomatoid carcinoma as well and thus yields an accurate probability of causation for both types of prostate cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Indeed, the practice of grouping rare cancers in more general cancer categories was specifically intended by HHS \u2014 the agency charged with the task of developing a method of computing causation under the Act. HHS regulations indicate that the failure to group rare cancers with more common cancers would provide the rare cancers with an unfair advantage due to the high level of uncertainty about their dose-risk relationship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Guidelines for Determining Probability of Causation Under the Employees Energy Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000; Final Rule, 67 Fed.Reg. 22296, 22302 (May 2, 2002). To counter this uncertainty, HHS noted that the dose-risk models used by NIOSH would group rarer cancers into more general cancer categories. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in refusing to adjust the default settings of the NIOSH-IREP program to account for the rarity of sarcoma-toid carcinoma, the OWCP operated the program consistent with its intended use.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">With respect to Ms. Hayward\u2019s argument that the NIOSH-IREP program failed to account for the greater probability that radiation exposure caused her husband\u2019s cancer, the OWCP\u2019s final decision responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">\u2022 Radiation is only one of many potentially cancer-causing agents; the carcinogenic effects of radiation cannot be distinguished from any other toxic agent. Further, it is a generally accepted fact that prostate cancer is less radiogenic than many other cancers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">\u2022 There is no evidence that sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate is highly correlated with radiation exposure, nor that this rare form of prostate cancer (sarcomatoid) is more radiogenic than the more general form (adenocarci-noma)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">In its initial decision, the OWCP more fully explained its statement that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that sarcomatoid carcinoma is more radiogenic than adenocarcinoma. The OWCP noted that the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtB\">literature [Ms. Hayward] submitted on the correlation on this point refers to radiation that was received as part of a therapeutic treatment for the [adenocar-cinoma] form of prostate cancer. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>treatment involves a much more focused and localized administration of radiation than would occur in an occupational setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The literature submitted by Ms. Hayward suggests that individuals <em>already suffering </em>from the adenocarcinoma form of prostate cancer are more likely to develop sarcomatoid carcinoma if they undergo <em>radiation therapy </em>as treatment. The OWCP specifically noted, and Ms. Hayward does not contest, that Mr. Hayward was diagnosed with only one primary cancer, sarco-matoid carcinoma. Thus, the OWCP could rationally conclude that this literature is inapplicable to Mr. Hayward\u2019s situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Under our limited scope of review,' the question is not whether sarcomatoid carcinoma is more radiogenic than other forms of prostate cancer, whether Mr. Hayward contracted cancer from radiation exposure during his employment, or even whether the OWCP used the best method to make this determination. Rather, the question is a narrow one: Whether the OWCP considered the relevant factors and provided a reasoned basis for its decision to deny Ms. Hayward\u2019s claim? After reviewing the administrative record, we conclude that the OWCP satisfied this minimum threshold and thus its denial of Ms. Hayward\u2019s survivor claim was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Ms. Hayward also contends that the lack of specific standards for adjusting the User Defined Additional Uncertainty feature of the NIOSH renders any decision of the DOL arbitrary and capricious. Given Ms. Hayward\u2019s failure to establish that Mr. Hayward\u2019s form of cancer warrants an adjustment, this argument is unavailing. <em>See Sierra Club v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, </em>245 F.3d 434, 446 (5th Cir.2001) (deferring to agency to resolve ambiguities). Agencies are not required to proceed by set standards in order to avoid a finding that their actions are arbitrary and capricious. <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (noting that agencies \u201cmust retain power to deal with [ ] problems on a case-by-case basis if the administrative process is to be effective.\u201d). It is sufficient that the DOL considered the relevant factors and provided a reasoned basis for its decision to retain the default settings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Finally, Ms. Hayward asserts that the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purpose of compensating workers that developed diseases while serving in the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Although we do not disagree with Ms. Hayward\u2019s characterization of the Act, its remedial purpose cannot expand the narrow scope of our review under the Administrative Procedures Act. <em>See Norfolk S. Railway Co. v. Sorrell, </em>549 U.S. 158, 127 S.Ct. 799, 808, 166 L.Ed.2d 638 (2007) (noting that a \u201cstatute\u2019s remedial purpose cannot compensate for the lack of statutory basis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The administrative record in this case plainly reveals a rational connection between the relevant facts and the DOL\u2019s decision to deny Ms. Hayward\u2019s Part B claim. Our limited review ends there. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\">.
