HABERSTRO.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b32-5\"><em>N. Y. Supreme Court, Fourth Department, Eighth District</em>;</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AN\">\n<em>Special Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGs\">August, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b32-6\">Exceptions to be Heard at General Term.\u2014Stay op Proceedings.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b32-7\">Under <em>Code Civ. Pro., </em>\u00a7 1000,\u2014regulating exceptions directed to be first heare? at general term, from which section the former provision that judgment is to be there given is omitted,\u2014the order for such hearing should contain an express direction to stay proceedings, if a stay be desired.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b32-8\">A stay for sixty days, to enable the unsuccessful party to make case and exceptions, is not equivalent to a stay until determination of the exceptions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">Motion to amend order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-10\">The action was by Alice Douglas against Joseph L. Haberstro, as sheriff of the county of Erie.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-11\">The trial was concluded December 17, 1880, before Justice Babkee and a jury. The following is an extract from the stenographer\u2019s minutes :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-12\">The court said to the jury : \u201c You are directed by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-13\">the court to render a verdict of $1860.20 in favor of the plaintiff. I think those exceptions ought to be heard at general term in first instance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-14\"><em>Mr. Moot </em>(defendant\u2019s attorney):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-15\">\u201cYour honor will note an exception to your ruling, and your honor will give us sixty days\u2019 stay of proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-16\">The entry in the clerk\u2019s' minutes was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-17\">\u201c Defendant allowed sixty days to make and serve case and exceptions, with stay of proceedings in the meantime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u201c And ordered, that exceptions be heard at general term in first instance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">February 17, 1881, in default of defendant\u2019s so doing, plaintiff entered a formal order, dated December 17, 1880, which read as follows : \u201cOn motion</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">of defendant\u2019s attorney, said defendant is hereby allowed sixty days from date of this order, within which to make and serve case and exceptions, with a stay of proceedings in the meantime, until the expiration of said sixty days. And it is hereby ordered that the exceptions be heard at the general term in the first instance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">On February 19, 1881, plaintiff entered judgment upon her verdict. The exceptions were argued at the general term in June, 1881, and decision thereon reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">Plaintiff issued execution upon her judgment July 22, 1881, and a levy was made thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-9\">This motion was made on affidavits and the record, and- was noticed July 24, 1881.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-10\"><em>Adalbert </em>Moot, defendant\u2019s attorney, for motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-11\"><em>John Campbell Ilubbell, </em>for plaintiff, opposed :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asz\">Cited <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 1000 ; Beattie <em>v. </em>Niagara Savings Bank, 41 <em>How. Pr. </em>137; Cole <em>v. </em>Webster, 17 <em>Hun, </em>507.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-12\">Barker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At\">The defendant\u2019s motion is granted without costs, and the order entered by the clerk is to bo amended, so that it will in terms provide for a stay until decision of exceptions at general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">There can be no fair doubt but that the defendant\u2019s attorneys understood that the effect of the order was to stay all proceedings upon the verdict until the exceptions were heard and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">It was intended by the court that judgment be suspended, and I am unwilling that such intention be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>frustrated by an erroneous entry of the order by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Mr. Hubbell should not have entered a formal order. \u2022 in the form which he did, reciting that it was done on the motion of the defendant\u2019s attorneys. That act was an interference, and the terms of the order are not in strict conformity to the entry in the clerk\u2019s minutes. But Mr. Moot seemed to have acquiesced in the act done by Mr. Hubbell in his name, which mitigates this feature of irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">I am inclined to the opinion that an order sending the exceptions to the general term, there to be heard in the first instance, <em>does not suspend </em>the entry of judgment unless the order, as entered, also provides for the suspension of judgment, upon the verdict. Section 1000 <em>(Code Civ. Pro.) </em>is in the article entitled \u2018\u2018 Exceptions ; case ; and motion for a new trial.\u201d The motion to be made in the general term is for a new trial on the exceptions, and all that the court has power to do is to grant or refuse the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">If the opposing affidavits had contained facts showing that the judgment could not be collected if the motion for a new trial be denied, I should have sought to make an order retaining the lien now secured by the entry of judgment; but it would be contrary to the express understanding on the trial to allow this verdict to be collected before the decision at general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">It was the very object and purpose of the order to have the law of the case settled before further proceedings on the verdict were had.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
