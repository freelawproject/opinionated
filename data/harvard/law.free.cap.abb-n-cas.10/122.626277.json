Vanderpoel, who was one of the trustees, and also a professor, voted for the resolution of which the relator complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The principal question which this application pre- . gents is, was the meeting of the board of trustees legally called and held <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">There can be no dispute but that \u201c The Albany Medical College\u201d <em>(L. </em>1839, c. 26) is a corporation, and also, as its name imports, a college.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">By the statutes of this State (Vol. 1 of Edmonds\u2019 ed., p. 406; vol. 2 of 6th edition, p. 12)it is provided : \u201cThe trustees of <em>every </em>college to which a charter shall, be granted by the State shall be a corporation.\u201d Provision is then made for the meeting of trustees, and it is enacted, \u201cNotice of the time and place of <em>every </em>such meeting shall be given in a newspaper printed in the county where such <em>college </em>is situate, at least six days before the meeting; and every trustee resident in such county shall be previously notified, in writing, of the time and place of such meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">It is argued, however, in behalf of the respondent, that the provision of the statute which has been quoted refers only to \u201cliterary colleges,\u201d and that chapter 15 of Part I of the Revised Statutes, of which it is a part, is not made applicable to \u201cThe Albany Medical College,\u201d but (section 8 of charter) the eighteenth chapter is.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The eighteenth chapter of part one of the Revised Statutes is entitled \u201cOf Incorporations\u201d (1 Edmonds\u2019 ed., p. 135), and did not contain the pages referred to by the counsel for respondent (pages 474, 475 and 476 of vol. 2), which are in the sixth edition. That edition was not a compilation by legislative authority, but its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>compilers have grouped, for convenience of reference, under what they deemed the appropriate parts of the Revised Statutes, such laws as they saw fit. Indeed the whole of article <em>2 </em>of title 11 of chapter 18 of part 1 of the Revised Statutes, entitled, \u201cOf the incorporation of academies and other institutions of learning,\u201d and contained in such sixth edition, is simply chapter 184 of the Laws of 1853, and which had no existence when \u201c The Albany Medical College \u201d was incorporated, and the same is not now, and never was any part of the Revised Statutes proper, and section thirty-four, page 491, of volume two, of the sixth edition (so called) of the Revised Statutes, which the counsel for the college supposes provides for it, is only section eight of the charter (chapter twenty-six of Laws of 1839), arbitrarily inserted as part of the Revised Statutes, to which it does not belong, and of which it forms no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">As \u201cThe Albany Medical College,\u201d besides being a college, was also a corporation, it was eminently proper to subject it to the provisions of the Revised Statutes entitled \u201cOf Incorporations,\u201d as was done by section eight of its charter, \u201c so far as the same are applicable and have not been repealed,\u201d but that fact did not make it any the less liable to these provisions of the general law applicable to \u201c <em>every </em>college,\u201d and to it, therefore, because it is a college.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">There is also a provision in its charter (section six) which declares: \u201cThe college sliall be subject to the visitation of the regents, and shall annually report to them.\u201d A reference to chapter fifteen of the Revised Statutes, which contains the provision hereinbefore quoted (1 Edm. ed. 406, section 33) in regard to the giving of notice of a meeting of the board of trustees of \u201c <em>every </em>college,\u201d will show that article first of that chapter (1 Edm. ed. 402) is entitled \u201cOf the Organization and Powers of the Board of Regents,\u201d and such board of regents is empowered (1 Edm. ed. 404, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>19) to confer the \u201c degree of <em>doctor </em>of medicine,\u201d which degree, when thus bestowed, \u201cshall authorize the person on whom it is conferred to practice physic and surgery in this State.\u201d These facts and the farther one, that the general law, under which medical colleges may now be incorporated (chapter 184 of laws of 1853, and also incorporated in volume 2 of 6th edition of B. S., page 473, &amp;c.), is entitled. \u201cAn act relative to the incor- \u25a0 poration of colleges and academies,\u201d conclusively show that chapter fifteen of the first part of the revised statutes, and article second thereof, do not refer exclusively, as the counsel for the respondent insists, to \u201c literary colleges,\u201d and that consequently the meeting of the trustees, at which Dr. Swinburne\u2019s professorship in the medical college was abolished, was illegal, because notice of such meeting was not published, as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It is argued, however, that there were twenty-one trustees present at the meeting, and as seventeen voted for the resolution abolishing the professorship, the failure properly to call the meeting, and the non-attendance of the others, made mo difference in the result. To this position there are two plain answers: First\u2014It was no' meeting of trustees, as such, unless properly called ; and, second, if the three other trustees had been present we do not know what the result might have been. Their presence, their statements and arguments might possibly have changed the entire conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The fact, too, that there was no legal meeting of the trustees, answers the argument that as Dr. Swinburne was not removed from his professorship, but the professorship was abolished, it could be done by less than a two-third vote. It would, however, be difficult to show the distinction claimed. The truth is, Dr. Swinburne was in fact removed from office, though the trustees did not so style their action. The courts deal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>things, no matter by what names they are disguised, and though the act attempted to be done is called the abolition of the professional chair, its effect being to remove Dr. Swinburne from, office, the provision of the charter requiring a two third vote was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">It is said that for the meeting of trustees at which Dr. Swinburne\u2019s professional chair was created, no notice had been published. If this be claimed as a precedent, it is sufficient to quote the old adage, that \u201ctwo wrongs do not make one right;\u201d if, however, it be argued that Dr. Swinburne was not for that reason legally appointed a professor, the answer is clear that the acceptance of the Dr\u2019s, services for four years as a professor, cured the irregularity of the original appointment, if any there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">There were other points made upon the argument, which I'have not deemed it necessary to discuss. It may be proper, however, to say that the provision of the Revised Statutes (1st ed., p. 410, sec. 50) which declares \u201cno professor or teacher of any incorporated <em>college </em>or academy shall be a trustee of <em>such college </em>or academy\u201d is amended by chapter 132 of the laws of 1876 to read as follows: \u201cNo professor or tutor of <em>any incorporated academy </em>shall be a trustee of such <em>academy.\u201d </em>There was, therefore, no valid objection to Dr. Vanderpoel as a trustee because he was also a professor.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Neither do I deem it necessary to discuss the propriety of the remedy by mandamus. Objections of this character never strike me with favor. If a court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties by any of the modes known to the law, there is no reason why it should not exercise its powers to undo a wrong; but the objections to the remedy in this instance are answered fully by the cases cited by the counsel for the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The mandamus asked for must be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
