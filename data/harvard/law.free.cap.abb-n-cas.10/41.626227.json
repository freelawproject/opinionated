The referee, the purchaser, and all parties supposed there was no such incumbrance. It being subsequently discovered, the purchaser opposed the motion to confirm the sale, and asked that the balance in the referee\u2019s hands be applied to pay this mortgage.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-11\"><em>E.

There is, therefore, no reason why the loss should fall on the owners rather than on the purchaser. They are not to blame any more than she is, nor as much; for she knew the terms and purchased at her own risk. Furthermore, the purchaser does not even now ask to be relieved from her bargain on the ground of a mutual mistake, but she wishes the court to make a new bargain between the parties. This ought not to be done. Therefore the plaintiff\u2019s motion should be granted.-</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
