He must furnish some one who will respond for him in this State. If he cannot, the State does not furnish him the means of pursuing a remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>here. It seems to me inconsistent with this policy, that an irresponsible non-resident should be allowed to sue without even a liability for costs. I am of the opinion that the order allowing plaintiff to sue <em>in forma pauperis </em>should be vacated; but as the action was begun under the order relieving her from costs &amp;c., she should have an election to discontinue without costs. In this motion she cannot be required to give security.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
