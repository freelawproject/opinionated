The trial court sentenced him to state prison for over six years in the two matters. In 2011, defendant entered guilty pleas to possessing methamphetamine and receiving stolen property (case No. 11F5155). The trial court sentenced him to a two-year state prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">In May 2015, defendant filed a petition in propria persona to reduce these felony convictions to misdemeanors (as well as a 1999 conviction for receiving stolen property that is not pertinent to this appeal) pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asked that the trial court \u201cbroadly and liberally\u201d construe section 1170.18 to apply to all of these offenses, even if they did not all \u201cfi[t] squarely into [the] mold set forth in this act.\u201d The petition does not provide any further information about the circumstances underlying the convictions. Defendant noted that he was presently serving an 11-year prison term for a 2014 conviction in a Tuolumne County case for criminal threats, and asserted that drugs or alcohol had fueled all of his crimes, stemming from his bipolar disorder, hyperactivity, and depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The prosecution opposed reduction of the 2003 convictions because they were not eligible offenses. It did not object to reduction of the 2011 methamphetamine conviction, but stated the value of the property at issue in the other 2011 conviction was a vehicle worth more than $950. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>denied relief for the facially ineligible offenses, reduced the methamphetamine conviction to a misdemeanor, and after holding a hearing (at which defendant appeared through counsel) denied relief on the other 2011 conviction because it involved property valued at more than $950. Defendant appealed from the adverse rulings in the three cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Defendant challenges only the ruling denying relief as to his 2003 conviction for unlawfully taking or driving a vehicle (case No. F2825). (A Feb. 2003 notice in the record of case No. F2763 of a violation of probation indicates the vehicle was a 1995 Jeep Wrangler.) Defendant also notes that the trial court failed to issue an amended abstract of judgment for the 2011 convictions (case No. 11F5155), a point the People concede. We shall affirm the order and direct the trial court to issue a corrected abstract of judgment to reflect the reduction of the drug conviction to a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We do not need to add any further facts to the introduction. We therefore proceed to the Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">This is not a novel issue. However, it appears the California Supreme Court will be the only voice on the question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we await its word, we will adhere to our viewpoint that unlawfully taking or driving a vehicle does not come within the ambit of section 1170.18, and allow defendant to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The initiative enacting section 1170.18 prospectively reduced three specific drug possession offenses to misdemeanors (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11350, 11357, 11377), as well as forging or writing bad checks (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 473, 476a), receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496), and petty theft. It accomplished the latter with the addition of section 490.2, which now defines \u201cpetty theft\u201d as involving \u201cmoney, labor, real or personal property\u201d with a value less than $950 \u201c[notwithstanding Section 487\u201d (which had specifically defined \u201c[gjrand theft\u201d on the basis of value or <em>type </em>of property) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u201cor any <em>other </em>provision of law <em>defining grand </em>theft\u201d (\u00a7 490.2, subd. (a), italics added). The initiative additionally amended section 666 (also called \u201cpetty theft with a prior\u201d) to allow wobbler punishment for recidivists who are otherwise disqualified from the reach of the initiative. Finally, it added the new misdemeanor of \u201cshoplifting\u201d (\u00a7 459.5). (See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) Official Title and Summary of Prop. 47, p. 34 (2014 Voter Guide); see also <em>id., </em>text of Prop. 47, \u00a7\u00a7 5-13, pp. 71-73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In section 1170.18, the initiative provided a means of retrospective relief (for defendants who are either serving a sentence or have completed a sentence for a prior conviction) through a petition for resentencing <em>if </em>the prior conviction would have been a misdemeanor \u201chad this [initiative] been in effect at the time of the offense.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a) &amp; (f).) As Vehicle Code section 10851 allowed and <em>continues to allow </em>for sentencing either as a misdemeanor <em>or a felony, </em>a conviction for unlawful taking or driving a vehicle does not come within the plain language of this criterion. This undermines the premise of defendant\u2019s appeal, because it is accordingly illogical to <em>construe </em>one portion of section 1170.18 as including a statute that under the <em>express </em>terms of section 1170.18 is not eligible for retrospective relief. This illogic is further demonstrated in section 666, which lists unlawful taking or driving as a qualifying prior conviction separately from either grand or petty theft, which would be surplusage if the references to theft in section 1170.18 are supposed to be construed as including Vehicle Code section 10851. We therefore do not need to engage in any \u201cconstruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Furthermore, the reasoning underlying defendant\u2019s construction of section 1170.18 is not persuasive. He cites to the general objectives of the framers of the initiative, and the call therein for liberal construction of the statute. (See 2014 Voter Guide, <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 47, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 18, pp. 70, 74.) Arguing that wrongfully taking or driving a vehicle can be a lesser included offense of section 487 (a point we accept arguendo), defendant then contends it would be illogical for the electorate to punish petty theft of a $950 vehicle as a misdemeanor while punishing the unlawful taking or driving of a $950 vehicle as a wobbler.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As we have recently explained, in the face of unambiguous statutory language we cannot rely on an inchoate legislative purpose as a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>departing from the text. <em>(County of Sonoma </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 42, 48 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 911].) This is true <em>even </em>where legislation calls for \u201cliberal construction.\u201d (E.g., <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1505, 1510 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 272] [workers\u2019 compensation law].) The essence of lawmaking is the choice of deciding to what extent a particular objective outweighs any competing values, and a court in the guise of interpretation should not upset this balance where it is spelled out in the text of a statute. <em>(County of Sonoma, </em>at p. 48.) A recent case thus finds that liberal construction is not a basis to include attempted vehicular burglary (\u00a7 459), another offense that section 1170.18 unambiguously omits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Acosta </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 521, 526 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 121] <em>(Acosta).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The plain language of section 1170.18 selected only a few provisions of the Health and Safety Code and the Penal Code as offenses to designate as misdemeanors from the multitude of overlapping crimes. This careful parsing of related items invokes one of those Latin phrases that courts love to brandish: <em>\u201c[E]xpressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is,\u201d </em>under which the inclusion of only certain items in an associated group gives rise to a strong inference of a deliberate legislative choice to exclude any items not mentioned, absent a compelling indication of legislative intent to the contrary. <em>(Strang v. Cabrol </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 720, 725 [209 Cal.Rptr. 347, 691 P.2d 1013]; <em>The Formula Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1455, 1462 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 341] [finding contrary legislative intent]; see 2A Singer &amp; Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction (7th ed. 2014) \u00a7 47:23, pp. 406-413, 423-424 (Sutherland).)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The statute itself does not qualify its enumeration of the statutes with any general language of inclusion (e.g., \u201csuch as\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d), nor can we discern any logical reason for mentioning only these statutes if there was the intent to include others. (See Sutherland, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47:25, pp. 444-445.) Defendant does not identify evidence of any contrary intent under which the drafters nonetheless intended the designated statutes to be merely illustrative. The Attorney General\u2019s summary of the initiative states that it \u201c[Requires misdemeanor sentencefs] instead of felony for the following crimes when amount involved is $950 or less: petty theft, receiving stolen property, and forging [ or] writing bad checks,\u201d with nary a word about unlawful taking/driving of a vehicle <em>or lesser included offenses. </em>(2014 Voter Guide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>supra, </em>Official Title and Summary of Prop. 47, p. 34.) Vehicle Code section 10851 also does not appear anywhere in the exegesis of the Legislative Analyst when it lists the offenses for which sentences would be prospectively reduced (2014 Voter Guide, <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, pp. 35-36), nor in the supporting and opposing arguments <em>(id., </em>argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38; <em>id., </em>argument against Prop. 47, p. 39); the only vehicle-related reference appears in the opposition, which cites a reduction in punishment for <em>carjacking </em>as a basis to vote no <em>(ibid.). </em>Therefore, the legislative history is devoid of a desire to include additional offenses through the vehicle of lesser included or related offenses, and it would be a fraud upon the electorate for a court to extend the reach of the initiative beyond what was expressly represented at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">This leaves defendant\u2019s reliance on section 490.2. It is true the operation of section 490.2 brings a host of unspecified statutes <em>defining grand theft </em>within its ambit prospectively (and thus retrospectively). However, Vehicle Code section 10851 does not appear explicitly in Penal Code section 490.2 (as does \u00a7 487), nor does its text purport to <em>define </em>the taking of a vehicle as grand theft within the catchall language of section 490.2. In addition, the statute embraces taking or driving <em>whether or not </em>there was an intent to steal. <em>(People v. Garza </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 866, 871 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 335, 111 P.3d 310].) <em>Acosta </em>found that section 490.2 did not apply to another statute (attempted vehicular burglary) that did not <em>necessarily </em>involve theft. <em>(Acosta, supra, </em>242 Cal.App.4th at p. 526.) As a result, unlawful taking or driving cannot be swept into the ambit of section 1170.18 by this route.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Finally, even if section 487 operated in the same manner as section 459.5, and permitted a violation of Vehicle Code section 10851 to be reclassified as a misdemeanor violation of section 487 if the unlawful taking of a $950 car underlay the prior conviction, it would still be the burden of defendant to have produced facts establishing this in his petition\u2014assuming that there is some way in which he can establish that his conviction was for a car theft when that was not a necessary element. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rivas-Colon </em>(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 444, 448-450 [193 Cal.Rptr.3d 651]; <em>Sherow, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at pp. 879-880.) Defendant\u2019s petition failed to satisfy this burden despite defendant presumably being aware of what he did. (See <em>Sherow, </em>at p. 880 [proper petition could contain at least declaration from defendant regarding circumstances of offense].) Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying relief on this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Defendant thus resorts to the usually unprofitable claim that this dichotomy in punishment results in a violation of his constitutional right to equal protection under the law. \u201c[N]either the existence of two identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>criminal statutes prescribing different levels of punishments, nor the exercise of a prosecutor\u2019s discretion in charging under one such statute and not the other, violates equal protection principles.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilkinson </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 821, 838 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 420, 94 P.3d 551].) Specifically, the disparity between the former punishment for \u201cgrand theft auto\u201d and unlawful taking or driving is not a basis for finding a violation. (See <em>People v. Romo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 189, 197 [121 Cal.Rptr. 111, 534 P.2d 1015].) Even if we assume the two categories of crimes are situated similarly, there is a rational basis for the distinction in treatment; The electorate was not obligated to extend relief under the initiative to <em>all </em>similar conduct. It could instead move in an incremental way, gauging the effects of this sea change in penal law. Particularly given the insignificant numbers of vehicle thefts at issue in light of vehicle prices at present, the electorate could conclude this would not work an injustice. Finally, the electorate could expect a prosecutor to exercise discretion to charge an unlawful taking or driving of a $950 vehicle as a misdemeanor. <em>(Acosta, supra, </em>242 Cal.App.4th at pp. 527-528.) We therefore reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The order disposing of defendant\u2019s petition is affirmed.
