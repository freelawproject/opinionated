(Artisan), and its owners Margaret L. Kinda and Aaron Kinda (plaintiffs) sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against their landlord Scott Carpenter (defendant). The dispute centered on plaintiffs\u2019 tenancy and defendant\u2019s alleged disruption of their business. Plaintiffs alleged several contract-related causes of action based on their lease. After plaintiffs obtained a temporary restraining order, three consumer reviews criticizing Artisan and Margaret Kinda appeared on the Internet site Yelp.com (Yelp) posted from different online aliases. Plaintiffs suspected defendant was responsible for the reviews and they amended the complaint to allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>defamation of Artisan and Ms. Kinda. Plaintiffs also obtained via subpoena information purporting to identify the Internet subscriber accounts linked to the Yelp reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Defendant moved in limine to exclude the evidence related to the Yelp reviews on hearsay and authenticity grounds. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and later granted a directed verdict for defendant on the defamation cause of action. A jury returned a unanimous defense verdict on the contract causes of action, which included a special verdict that although defendant had breached the lease agreement no damages resulted. The trial court deemed defendant the prevailing party and granted his request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">Plaintiffs contend on appeal that the trial court erred in excluding the Yelp evidence and eliminating their defamation cause of action. Plaintiffs also contend that had the Yelp evidence been admitted, they would have established presumed damages, which would have altered both the jury\u2019s special verdict on the contract-based causes of action and the court\u2019s prevailing party determination for the attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">As we explain in the published portion of this opinion, the exclusion of the Yelp evidence and the resulting disposition of the defamation cause of action was error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude that in light of the erroneous exclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence supporting the defamation cause of action, the determination of the prevailing party and award of attorney\u2019s fees likewise must be reversed. Although we do not agree with plaintiffs that a finding of defamation per se would have necessarily furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>damages for the breach of contract cause of action, neither can we conclude that the outcome on the contract-based causes of action would have remained unaffected by the presentation of evidence on the alleged defamation. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">A. <em>Landlord-tenant Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">After defendant and his company, Monterey Bay Spice Company, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> bought the commercial building housing plaintiffs\u2019 rug cleaning business, a series of disputes developed in which plaintiffs complained that defendant\u2019s behavior interfered with .their business operations and amounted to a campaign of harassment and retaliation. Plaintiffs claimed that defendant\u2019s conduct, which included construction and demolition on an adjoining section of the building, requests to enter and inspect the premises, service of multiple \u201cpay rent or quit\u201d and similar notices, and obstructing a designated parking space, interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 business and breached the implied and express covenants of their lease. Based on defendant\u2019s alleged failure to abate the noisy construction work, on June 1, 2011, Ms. Kinda sought and received a temporary restraining order enjoining defendant\u2019s construction activities exceeding a stated decibel level during business hours. Ms. Kinda later obtained a preliminary injunction related to the noise, and a second preliminary injunction related to defendant\u2019s requests to enter and inspect plaintiffs\u2019 business premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">B. <em>Postings on Yelp</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">Yelp is an Internet website that collects and publishes online consumer reviews of businesses. <em>(Bently Reserve LP </em>v. <em>Papaliolios </em>(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 418, 423 [160 Cal.Rptr.3d 423].) On the day the temporary restraining order issued against defendant, a negative review of Artisan appeared on Yelp, followed by two more negative reviews on the following two days. Each review was attributed to a different online alias.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">The first review, posted on June 1, 2011 by \u201cthomas j\u201d stated that Artisan provided the \u201c[w]orst service I have ever experienced\u201d and described in detail purported delays, a price increase, and a stain that appeared on his carpets after leaving them with Artisan. The next day, a review of Artisan by \u201cSandy Z\u201d warned, \u201cwatch out for the angry Lady that works there\u201d and stated, \u201cI am lucky in that I had a taste of this cantankerous rug hut BEFORE I actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>brought my carpet in for cleaning.\u201d The third review, by \u201cchris s,\u201d criticized Artisan\u2019s service as \u201cunfriendly\u201d and shared that a purported rip in his carpet was \u201cactually made . . . worse\u201d by Artisan\u2019s attempted repair. Ms. Kinda compared the reviews to Artisan\u2019s service records and did not find any jobs or customers that corresponded to the work described in the reviews. Ms. Kinda became suspicious that they were not legitimate after noting the three reviews were posted in the days immediately following issuance of the temporary restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a cause of action for defamation as to Ms. Kinda and Artisan. They alleged that defendant, his company, and Does 1 through 10 \u201ccommenced a campaign of defamation\u201d on or about June 1, 2011, against Ms. Kinda and Artisan \u201cwhereby they pretended to be customers of [p]laintiffs and published false statements online summarizing a fictional and disappointing experience with [plaintiff\u2019s business.\u201d Citing Civil Code section 45a, Ms. Kinda and Artisan alleged that the statements were false and libelous on their face because the reviews subjected them to \u201cridicule and obloquy\u201d and sought to injure their reputation in the fine rug cleaning and care industry by imputing a lack of integrity, professionalism, and competence. Defendant denied the allegations against him and specifically denied any responsibility for the Yelp reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Plaintiffs tried to discover the identity of the person or persons responsible for the Yelp reviews. Plaintiffs subpoenaed Yelp! Inc. for business records and obtained the e-mail addresses and IP addresses<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, associated with the three reviews at issue. The \u201cthomas j\u201d and \u201cSandy Z\u201d posts shared the same IP address, which was associated with an Internet account registered to Comcast Corporation (Comcast). The \u201cchris s\u201d post came from a different IP address associated with an AT&amp;T Internet Services (AT&amp;T) account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Plaintiffs requested from Comcast and AT&amp;T the subscriber information associated with the IP addresses at the time of the June 2011 Yelp posts. AT&amp;T responded with the \u201cIP Assignment Details\u201d for the relevant time frame and IP address, as well as \u201cCustomer Account Details\u201d for an inactive account that had been registered to \u201cScott D. Carpenter\u201d and billed to an address in Santa Cruz, California. The address was the location of defendant\u2019s business offices at the time. Comcast eventually responded that due to its record retention system, it could not verify the IP address information for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>any date before July 27, 2011, but Comcast provided the subscriber information for the IP addresses as of that date. The subscriber listed was Scott Carpenter. The service address for the subscriber account was defendant\u2019s home address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">In connection with this information and possible punitive damages on their defamation claim, plaintiffs sought an order to allow pretrial discovery on defendant\u2019s financial condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge who heard the motion found the IP address evidence to be circumstantial yet compelling. The court referred to the evidence as a \u201cseries of coincidences\u201d whereby \u201cthe negative reviews on Yelp were traced to the defendant\u2019s internet protocol addresses.\u201d The court explained: \u201c[Although the defendant makes an interesting argument that it\u2019s not conclusively shown that Mr. Carpenter himself provided these reviews . . . , the circumstantial evidence in this case and the only reasonable interpretation that this Court comes to is that it is highly likely that the defendant is the one that is responsible for these reviews and it\u2019s not just a coincidence.\u201d The court granted the discovery motion but cautioned that any findings were \u201conly for this motion for discovery\u201d and were not to be viewed as binding on any trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">C. <em>Motions in Limine and Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">A different judge presided over pretrial motions and trial. Defendant moved in limine to exclude evidence of and reference to the Yelp posts on the grounds that the posts were inadmissible hearsay and unauthenticated. After hearing from counsel, the court dispensed with the hearsay argument and focused on what was termed authentication: \u201c[Y]ou have to put on some sort of evidence that ties [the Yelp posts] to the defendant and authenticates it. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] How are you going to tie it to the defendant, please?\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded that the Yelp posts, memorialized as printouts of the online reviews, were \u201cself-authenticating\u201d under Evidence Code section 1552. To tie those reviews to defendant, plaintiffs would offer the subpoenaed records from AT&amp;T and Comcast, authenticated by the respective custodians of records. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argued that by using the subpoenaed records, they could show sufficient circumstantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that defendant posted the reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel disagreed, arguing that the subpoenaed documents \u201cindicate that the users who posted these IDs accessed the internet and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>Yelp website using an IP address that was assigned to Scott Carpenter\u2019s routers, one at his home, one at his business,\u201d but that \u201cthere is absolutely no way of connecting the posts to a specific computer either in his home or his business or to a specific user.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel explained that \u201canyone on any computer within [defendant\u2019s] office would have the exact same IP address, no matter which computer was being used, as well as anybody who was using the computer at Mr. Carpenter\u2019s house at the time, anything posted is going to come back to the exact same IP address. ... So you could have had a dozen employees all on the computer at the same time, one of whom may have posted this, but you can\u2019t identify who it is. Just the same- as you can\u2019t say that somebody sat outside of his house and jumped on his internet connection, because they were unsecured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel urged it was insufficient to have merely the IP address of a router that was assigned to defendant\u2019s address, because \u201c[w]hether that router was at his home at the time, whether or not, you know, a neighbor accessed it, whether or not, you know, somebody else was within distance . . . that\u2019s just what the circumstance[] was here. . . . [I]t does not come close to proving that it was Scott Carpenter himself [who] posted these reviews. And that\u2019s absolutely the first question that has to be answered in order to establish defamation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">The court stated that it would require expert testimony under Evidence Code section 402 before allowing the Yelp evidence at trial and that it would not entertain argument on circumstantial evidence without having its concerns about authenticity addressed. Plaintiffs lodged the deposition testimony of their expert, Ron Herardian, and submitted supplemental briefing on the admissibility of the Yelp evidence. At the evidentiary hearing, the trial court remained skeptical that the evidence could tie the Yelp posts to defendant. The court noted the Comcast records only showed the relevant IP address assigned to Scott D. Carpenter as of July 27, 2011, more than one month after the Yelp reviews posted. The court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that Mr. Herardian\u2019s testimony could show the IP address assigned in late July 2011 was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d the same as that assigned in June 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">The court identified a similar problem with the AT&amp;T records showing Scott D. Carpenter\u2019s name and address in response to the subpoena requesting subscriber information linked to the IP address at issue. Based on the appearance of the AT&amp;T record, which referenced defendant\u2019s name in one place on the document, and dates of service and billing address in another, the court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the expert could interpret the record to show defendant was the subscriber with the IP address in question on the relevant date. The trial court also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that deposition testimony, in which defendant acknowledged that the e-mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>address associated with the AT&amp;T account belonged to defendant\u2019s former employee whose e-mail remained with the company after the employee left, remedied the foundational issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s in limine motion, stating, \u201cI\u2019m keeping out all of these Yelp allegations. I don\u2019t find that you\u2019ve met the foundational requirements for these matters.\u201d It explained its reasoning as to the Comcast and AT&amp;T records: \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow the Comcast records in. The custodian of records certifies them beginning July 27th, 2011, and we have no information before us about anything preceding that time. I do not agree that Mr. Herardian can malee that leap. He certainly can explain things regarding access to routers and IP addresses and things like this, but the foundation still must be laid for the records. It could have been done, you just have the wrong witness, in this Court\u2019s opinion. ... So I\u2019m not going to allow any reference to the Comcast IP address, and therefore those two reviews from that time. [\u00b6] Now, with respect to AT&amp;T, I think there\u2019s the same foundation flaw. Your expert in his testimony said T assumed that the billing address is the same as the service address.\u2019 And I don\u2019t think one can assume such [an] important foundational fact. Looking at the deposition, Mr. Carpenter says, T used to have an employee of this name and she had an email, and she hasn\u2019t worked for me in years, and we have changed our system since then.\u2019 So I don\u2019t see that this deposition contains anything which surmounts the foundational gaps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">After trial began, the court granted defendant\u2019s request for a directed verdict on the defamation cause of action based on a failure of evidence. The remaining causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing were tried to the jury as discussed in greater detail below. The jury unanimously found for defendant on all three contract-based causes of action. On the verdict form for breach of contract, the jury marked that defendant violated the lease (\u201cd[id] something that the contract lease prohibited him from doing\u201d) as to each plaintiff, but found that no harm resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">D. <em>Trial of the Contractual Causes of Action</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAya\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">E. <em>Determination of Prevailing Party and Attorney\u2019s Fees Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">Following the defense verdict and entry of judgment, defendant moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs as the prevailing party under the contract. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>extensive briefing and argument over the course of two hearings, the trial court deemed defendant the prevailing party for all purposes. The court made several adjustments to defendant\u2019s total and denied defendant\u2019s request for a multiplier. The court awarded defendant a total of $219,086.00 in fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Plaintiffs challenge the exclusion of the Yelp evidence on three grounds: (1) the basis for the ruling exceeded the grounds for relief stated in the motion; (2) the trial judge improperly reconsidered the previous ruling allowing financial discovery; and (3) the trial court applied the wrong standard in finding an absence of foundation for the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">A. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Ruling on Grounds Not Stated in Defendant\u2019s Motion in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">Plaintiffs argue the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction when it ruled on defendant\u2019s motion based on grounds that were not stated in the moving papers. A basic tenet of motion practice is that the notice of motion must state the grounds for the order being sought (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1010; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a)), and courts generally may consider only the grounds stated in the notice of motion <em>(Luri v. Greenwald </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1125 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 680] <em>(Luri)). </em>For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>American Surety Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 719, 726 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 422], the appellate court rejected the argument that a surety\u2019s motion to vacate forfeiture of bail bond provided sufficient notice of a request for an extension of the statutory period following forfeiture, because the notice of motion to vacate made no reference to an extension being sought or the grounds for that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">The purpose of the notice requirements \u201cis to cause the moving party to \u2018sufficiently define the issues for the information and attention of the adverse party and the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Luri, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1125, quoting <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>National Dairy Products </em>(1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 490, 493 [272 P.2d 799].) Sometimes this purpose is met notwithstanding deficient notice. For example, it may be sufficient that the supporting papers contain the grounds for the relief sought, even if the notice does not. <em>(Luri, </em>at p. 1125; <em>366-386 Geary St., L.P. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1186, 1200 [268 Cal.Rptr. 678].) It also may be sufficient if the omitted issue, or ground for relief, was raised without objection before the trial court. <em>(Fredrickson v. Superior Court </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 593, 598 [241 P.2d 541] [\u201caccepting petitioner\u2019s claim that the notice of motion was insufficient, the grounds were raised without objection in the trial court at the hearing on the motion\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>Defendant\u2019s motion referenced only hearsay and authenticity as grounds for excluding the Yelp posts. Although the trial court\u2019s inquiry extended beyond those grounds, plaintiffs never objected to the' broadened scope, and they had ample opportunity to respond to the grounds raised by the trial court. Unlike <em>Luri, </em>where by omitting the specific statutory grounds for relief a motion risked depriving the opposing party of the opportunity to provide relevant information in response <em>(Luri, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1125-1126), plaintiffs here fully developed their opposition to file court\u2019s broadened inquiry in their supplemental memorandum and offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">These circumstances also are distinguishable from a ruling on a motion in limine that deprives the nonmoving party of any opportunity to address issues that were raised outside of the notice and motion. <em>(Cf. Blanks v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP </em>(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 336, 376 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 710] [trial court erred in ignoring the grounds presented in the motion in limine and ruling on the ultimate issue of negligence without giving \u201cthe parties an opportunity to address the facts required to assess\u201d that ultimate issue].) We conclude plaintiffs had a fair opportunity to brief and present their evidence in response to the court\u2019s extensive inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">B. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Improperly Reconsider a Prior Court Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Plaintiffs argue.that the trial court\u2019s inquiry into the Yelp evidence improperly functioned as a reconsideration of the issues previously decided by a different judge in plaintiffs\u2019 motion for financial discovery. Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 places strict jurisdictional limits on a litigant\u2019s ability to seek reconsideration of a prior ruling. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1008, subd. (a) [application for reconsideration of prior, interim court order must be made within 10 days of entry of the order and be based \u201cupon new or different facts, circumstances, or law\u201d].) Any application for reconsideration must comply with the provisions of section 1008 in order for the court to consider the request. <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7 1008, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">Plaintiffs rely on two cases. <em>Curtin v. Koskey </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 873 [282 Cal.Rptr. 706] (Curtin) involved a judgment of dismissal for failure to prosecute, which the trial court granted only weeks after another judge in the same court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 request for preferential trial setting. The appellate court reversed, noting that \u201cthe considerations in a motion for preferential trial setting are the same as the considerations in a motion to dismiss,\u201d and depending on the basis for the first judge\u2019s ruling, the motion to dismiss actually should have been styled as a motion for reconsideration of the ruling on preferential trial setting. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 877-878.) The second case, <em>Morite of California v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 485 [23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 666] <em>(Morite), </em>involved a writ proceeding concerning insurance coverage for individuals named as defendants in a related wrongful termination case. One judge stayed the insurance coverage action pending resolution of the related case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 488-489.) At a later status conference, a different judge set for trial certain causes of action in the coverage case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 489.) The appellate court found that the second judge had \u201ccircumvented the jurisdictional limits of section 1008, subdivision (e) by consciously ignoring the stay order which had been entered by a predecessor judge of the same court\u201d and entering an order that \u201cdoes not specifically lift the stay . . . but, by implication, has the same [e]ffect.\u201d <em>(Morite, supra, </em>at p. 492.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">We do not find either case applicable here to the trial court\u2019s treatment of defendant\u2019s in limine motion relative to the earlier discovery ruling. In both <em>Curtin </em>and <em>Morite, </em>the later ruling imposed a course of action in direct conflict with the earlier ruling. In <em>Curtin, </em>the dismissal for failure to prosecute effectively overrode the granting of a preferential trial setting <em>(Curtin, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 877-878); in <em>Morite, </em>the setting of trial conflicted with the earlier stay <em>(Morite, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at p. 492). Plaintiffs fail to explain how the exclusion of the Yelp evidence effectuates a reconsideration, modification, or revocation of a prior order. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1008.) The findings of the judge who granted financial discovery were expressly made \u201conly for this motion for discovery\u201d and carried no binding effect. That judge\u2019s observations about the circumstantial evidence in relation to the defamation cause of action did not limit a later court\u2019s ability to rule on admissibility of the same evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">C. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Excluding the Yelp Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the Yelp evidence deprived them of the opportunity to present their defamation case to the jury, while defendant contends that plaintiffs effectively abandoned the defamation cause of action after the evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Plaintiffs correctly state that if the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine precludes an entire cause of action, the ruling is subject to independent review on appeal as though the court had granted a motion for nonsuit. <em>(Dillingham-Ray Wilson v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1402 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 691] <em>(Dillingham-Ray Wilson);' Amtower </em>v. <em>Photon Dynamics, Inc. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1582, 1595 [71 Cal.Rptr.3d 361] <em>(Amtower).) </em>Under those circumstances, the appellate court \u201creview[s] the court\u2019s order de novo, examining the record in the light most favorable to the party offering the evidence.\u201d <em>(City of Livermore v. Baca </em>(2012) 205 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1460, 1465 [141 Cal.Rptr.3d 271].) That is, \u201call inferences and conflicts in the evidence must be viewed most favorably to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>(Am,tower, </em>at p. 1595.) Any significant error of law that prevented the nonmoving party from offering evidence to establish its case will warrant reversal. <em>(Kelly </em>v. <em>New West Federal Savings </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659, 677 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 803] [error that results in denial of a fair hearing is reversible per se].) A motion for directed verdict, as was granted here, is subject to the same standard of review on appeal as a motion for nonsuit. <em>(County of Kern </em>v. <em>Sparks </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 11, 16 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 551].) Both are \u201c\u201c \u201cin the nature of a demurrer to the evidence, and [are] governed by practically the same rules, and concede^ as true the evidence on behalf of the adverse party, with all fair and reasonable inferences to be deduced therefrom.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Brassinga v. City of Mountain View </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 195, 210 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 660], quoting <em>Estate of Lances </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 397, 400-401 [14 P.2d 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">We are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s argument that exclusion of the Yelp evidence on foundational grounds did not preclude plaintiffs from offering evidence regarding the alleged defamation. The tort of defamation \u201crequires the intentional publication of a false statement of fact that has a natural tendency to injure the plaintiff\u2019s reputation or that causes special damage.\u201d <em>(Burrill </em>v. <em>Nair </em>(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 357, 383 [158 Cal.Rptr.3d 332].) Here, the online reviews were the sole alleged source of defamation. Plaintiffs obtained, via subpoena, the IP addresses associated with the online posts, which information was authenticated by the Yelp! Inc. custodian of records. An IP address standing alone, however, is nothing more than a string of \u201c \u2018four sets of numbers separated by periods.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kleffman, supra, </em>49 CalAth at p. 337, quoting <em>Kremen v. Cohen </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 325 F.3d 1035, 1038.) \u201c \u2018IP addresses function much like Social Security numbers or telephone numbers: each IP address is unique and corresponds to a specific entity connected to the Internet.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kleffman, </em>at p. 337, quoting <em>National A-l, supra, </em>121 F.Supp.2d at p. 159.) But that entity cannot be identified without corresponding information from the Internet Service Provider responsible for assigning the IP address in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">It is this corresponding information, the Comcast and AT&amp;T records pertaining to the IP addresses, which was excluded and without which plaintiffs could not prove defamation. The trial court\u2019s statement following its ruling on the motion confirmed this: \u201cI\u2019m keeping out all of these Yelp allegations. I don\u2019t find that you\u2019ve met the foundational requirements for these matters.\u201d Plaintiffs later asked the trial court to clarify the effect of the in limine ruling, and defendant urged he was entitled to a directed verdict on the defamation cause of action, which the trial court eventually granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>These circumstances are analogous to cases in which the appellate court reviewed the exclusion of evidence on a motion in limine as it would a nonsuit. One such case is <em>R &amp; B Auto Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Farmers Group, Inc. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 327, 332 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 426] <em>(R &amp; B Auto </em>Center), in which a used car dealership sued several insurer defendants after they sold lemon law insurance to the dealership and later denied the coverage. The appellate court found the trial court had made \u201cnumerous erroneous rulings\u201d on motions in limine, the effect of which \u201clargely gutted the dealership\u2019s case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 332-333.) For example, one in limine motion expressly sought to exclude \u201cany evidence pertaining\u201d to an unfair competition cause of action, and another sought to exclude the testimony of witnesses who also had been sold unusable coverage. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 356-358.) The appellate court determined that granting these motions had the effect of \u201cexcluding nearly all of the evidence that would have shown the alleged pattern and practice underlying the unfair competition claim.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 358.) Had the witnesses been allowed to testify, \u201ca trier of fact potentially could find [the defendant] engaged in unfair business practices\u201d such that the trial court could not say, resolving all inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff, that judgment on the unfair competitioii cause of action was required as a matter of law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">Although the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the Yelp evidence on foundational grounds was narrower than the multiple broad motions in limine granted in <em>R &amp; B Auto Center, </em>the result here\u2014a directed verdict on the defamation cause of action\u2014had the same effect. (See <em>R &amp; B Auto Center, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 333 [cautioning against \u201cwholesale disposition\u201d of a case or causes of action through rulings on motions in limine].) Also instructive is <em>Dillingham-Ray Wilson, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.4th at page 1401, in which the trial court ruled in limine to exclude the plaintiff from presenting its total cost claim of millions of dollars to the jury because its evidence on damages was insufficient and based on a theory not recognized in California. Applying independent review, the appellate court disagreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusions and remanded for trial on the excluded damages claims. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1400; see also <em>City of Livermore </em>v. <em>Baca, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.4th 1460 [trial court erred in excluding all evidence of severance damages in eminent domain challenge, requiring reversal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Defendant cites <em>Katiuzhinsky v. Perry </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1288 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 309] <em>(Katiuzhinsky) </em>to argue that an abuse of discretion standard should apply. <em>Katiuzhinsky, </em>however, involved an in limine ruling that erroneously limited the plaintiffs\u2019 damages evidence to certain, discounted medical expenses, rather than allowing the jury to consider all the available evidence of medical expenses. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1295.) As noted in <em>Dillingham-Ray Wilson, </em>abuse of discretion review is appropriate when, like in <em>Katiuzhinsky, </em>\u201can in limine ruling does not preclude an entire claim but instead limits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>evidence that will be offered to prove a claim.\u201d <em>(Dillingham-Ray Wilson, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.4th at p. 1403.) The damages verdict in <em>Katiuzhinsky </em>was based on a partial presentation of the plaintiffs\u2019 medical bills, whereas here no evidence of Ms. Kinda and Artisan\u2019s defamation cause of action reached the jury. (Katiuzhinsky; <em>supra, </em>at p. 1291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">We will independently review the granting of defendant\u2019s motion in limine, viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and determining whether the evidence and inferences were sufficient to support a judgment in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">2. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Analysis of Defendant\u2019s Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">Motions in limine are \u201cdesigned to facilitate the management of a case, generally by deciding difficult evidentiary issues in advance of trial.\u201d <em>(Amtower, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th 1582, 1593.) Their \u201c \u2018 \u201cusual purpose . . . is to preclude the presentation of evidence deemed inadmissible and prejudicial by the moving party.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As we have explained, the use of the in limine process to dispose of a case or cause of action for evidentiary reasons triggers a more rigorous standard of review in which we consider whether the nonmoving party has had a full and fair opportunity to state all the facts in its favor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1595.) All inferences and conflicts in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cNo matter how logical a moving party\u2019s motion may sound, a judge generally should not be weighing the evidence on a motion in limine.\u201d <em>(R &amp; B Auto Center, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th 327, 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">The appellate court in <em>Amtower </em>examined the pitfalls that can result from \u201cus[ing] the in limine process to examine the sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d including the loss of certain procedural protections provided by statutory motions or by trial on the merits. <em>(Amtower, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1593-1594.) The court distinguished this nontraditional, nonstatutory use of in limine motions from traditional in limine motions, noting \u201c[t]he risk of reversal arises when appellate courts are required to review a dispositive ruling on an in limine motion as if it were the product of a motion for nonsuit after opening statement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1594.) Thus, in <em>Amtower, </em>which arose out of the merger of two companies, the court upheld the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for a section 11 federal Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a et seq.) violation on an in limine motion only after concluding, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff \u201ccould not have prevailed under any circumstances.\u201d <em>(Amtower, </em>at p. 1595.) The court reached this conclusion after reviewing the requirements of a section 11 claim and the plaintiff\u2019s concession that he had seen and read key disclosure statements\u2014 facts that \u201cconclusively demonstrate[d] that plaintiff had actual knowledge\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>of material omissions in the defendant\u2019s filing, triggering the one-year statute of limitations. <em>{Amtower, </em>at p. 1596.) Because the plaintiff did not file his complaint until \u201cwell over a year after he admittedly read all the pertinent documents,\u201d the court found that despite the disfavored use of a motion in limine to dispose of an entire cause of action, \u201cthe inescapable conclusion is that the section 11 claim was barred by the statute of limitations as a matter of law. There is no evidence that plaintiff could produce that would change this result. Accordingly, there was no issue for the jury to decide and the trial court properly dismissed the section 11 claim.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1596-1597.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">In contrast, plaintiffs here argue the trial court erred in analyzing the in limine motion by applying all possible inferences <em>against </em>plaintiffs as the nonmoving party, in effect circumventing the procedural protections that should have applied. (See <em>Amtower, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1594.) The issue presented to the trial court was the question of authenticity of the Comcast and AT&amp;T records; the issue ultimately decided by the court was the sufficiency of evidence implicating defendant. The trial court failed to apply the appropriate standard, even as it considered the motion to be dispositive of the defamation cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion argued the Yelp posts, offered as webpage printouts, were \u201cnot authenticated\u201d and plaintiffs had not identified a custodian from Yelp\u2019s records department to authenticate the documents. Plaintiffs responded that the Yelp web posts could be authenticated under Evidence Code section 1552, by which a printed representation of computer-generated information is presumed to be an accurate representation of that information at the time it was printed. Plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof also stated that Ms. Kinda and another individual would testify to having seen the reviews online.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Our Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[authentication is to be determined by the trial court as a preliminary fact [Evid. Code, \u00a7 403, subd. (a)(3)] and is statutorily defined as \u2018the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is\u2019 or \u2018the establishment of such facts by any other means provided by law\u2019 [\u00a7 1400].\u201d <em>(People v. Goldsmith </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th 258, 266 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 637, 326 P.3d 239] <em>(Goldsmith).) </em>\u201cAuthentication is essentially a subset of relevance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 267.) The proof necessary for authentication depends on \u201cthe purpose for which the evidence is being offered\u201d and requires a foundation of \u201csufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find that the writing is what it purports to be.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Critical to our analysis is the general admonition that \u201c \u2018[a]s long as the evidence would support a finding of authenticity, the writing is admissible. The fact conflicting inferences can be drawn regarding authenticity goes to the document\u2019s weight as evidence, not its admissibility.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>Jazayeri v. Mao </em>(2009) 174 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Cal.App.4th 301, 321 [94 Cal.Rptr.3d 198].) Thus, in <em>Goldsmith, </em>the court concluded that the presumptions of authenticity under Evidence Code sections 1552 and 1553 \u201cpartly, but not completely, supply the foundation for admission of\u2019 evidence generated by an automated traffic enforcement system. <em>(Goldsmith, </em>at p. 268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">California courts have applied these authentication principles before and after <em>Goldsmith </em>to evidence from online and social media sources. For example, under Evidence Code section 1552, a printout of a purported gang roster was \u201cpresumed to be an accurate representation of the [w]eb page\u201d that a witness testified to seeing and printing off of the Internet. <em>(People v. Beckley </em>(2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 509, 517 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 362].) But the presumption did not extend to authenticate the <em>content, </em>which the court found required independent evidence of reliability and was inadmissible as evidence of gang membership. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 517-518.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1429 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 628], the court rejected the defendant\u2019s authentication challenge to the prosecution\u2019s introduction of a \u201cMySpace social media Internet page,\u201d which the prosecution\u2019s gang expert had relied on. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1431.) The court reasoned: \u201cAlthough Valdez was free to argue otherwise to the jury, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude from the posting of personal photographs, communications, and other details that the MySpace page belonged to him. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting the page for the jury to determine whether he authored it.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1435.) The court emphasized that \u201cthe proponent\u2019s threshold authentication burden for admissibility is <em>not </em>to establish validity or negate falsity in a categorical fashion, but rather to make a showing on which the trier of fact reasonably could conclude the proffered writing is authentic.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1437.) Similarly in <em>In re K.B. </em>(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 989, 997 [190 Cal.Rptr.3d 287], the court found incriminating photographs from a cell phone, including website screenshots, were sufficiently authenticated, noting the \u201cultimate determination of the authenticity ... is for the trier of fact, who must consider any rebuttal evidence and balance it against the authenticating evidence in order to arrive at a final determination . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>Here, the trial court rejected Evidence Code section 1552 and plaintiffs\u2019 proffer as a basis for authenticating the Yelp reviews, explaining its concern was not whether the Yelp posts could be authenticated under section 1552 as writings that existed on the Internet under an alias, but whether the evidence would be sufficient to prove Ms. Kinda and Artisan\u2019s defamation claim. To this end, the trial court queried: \u201c[B]efore it comes into evidence, you have to give me some connection that you can prove he posted them. If you can\u2019t do that, I\u2019m not going to let it into evidence and we don\u2019t even have to have this discussion. [\u00b6] [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:] Well, it\u2019s an issue of fact, Your Honor, and I think I can show that there\u2019s sufficient connect the dots\u2014I mean what are the odds that somebody decided to drive over to his house, park in front of his house, and as the expert testified\u2014[\u00b6] [THE COURT:] If you don\u2019t choose to call the expert in a 402, then you\u2019re not getting any of this in. [\u00b6] [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:] No, I can bring an expert in. I\u2019m just\u2014{\u00b6] [THE COURT:] Yeah, you\u2019re going to have to. You need to understand that I am concerned about the authenticity of this, if that\u2019s the correct word. You have to tie it back to him. And unless somebody persuades me that there is sufficient evidence that ties it back to him, then it\u2019s not going to come in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">This colloquy illustrates the trial court\u2019s treatment of the motion in limine like a motion for nonsuit, rather than limiting its assessment to the initial question of whether the documents were sufficient for the \u201ctrier of fact to find that the writing is what it purports to be.\u201d <em>(Goldsmith, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th at p. 267.) \u201c \u2018A motion for nonsuit is a procedural device which allows a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s evidence to submit the case to the jury. [Citation.] Because a grant of the motion serves to take a case from the jury\u2019s consideration, courts traditionally have taken a very restrictive view of the circumstances under which nonsuit is proper. The rule is that a trial court may not grant a defendant\u2019s motion for nonsuit if plaintiff\u2019s evidence would support a jury verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Atkinson v. Elk Corp. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 747 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 433], quoting <em>Campbell v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 112, 117-118 [184 Cal.Rptr. 891, 649 P.2d 224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Such use of the in limine proceeding is within the trial court\u2019s \u201c \u2018inherent power to control litigation and conserve judicial resources.\u2019 \u201d <em>(K.C. Multimedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bank of America Technology &amp; Operations, Inc. </em>(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 939, 951 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 247]; see <em>K.C. Multimedia, </em>at p. 952 [citing use of motions in limine as \u201cthe functional equivalent\u201d of dispositive orders at various stages of litigation]; <em>Amtower, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th 1582, 1595 [\u201cIn spite of the obvious drawbacks to the use of in limine motions to dispose of a claim, trial courts do have the inherent power to use. them in this way\u201d].) However, when used to foreclose a cause of action, the court must apply the restrictive standard of a nonsuit, interpreting the evidence most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>favorably to plaintiffs\u2019 case and resolving all presumptions, inferences and doubts in favor of plaintiffs. <em>(Amtower, </em>at p. 1595.) The trial court here took the opposite approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">3. <em>The Trial Court Improperly Resolved Inferences Against Plaintiffs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">The Evidence Code defines an inference as \u201ca deduction of fact that may logically and reasonably be drawn from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established in the action.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (b).) An inference is \u201cnot evidence but rather the result of reasoning from evidence. . . . \u2018It must be such that a rational, well-constructed mind can reasonably draw from it the conclusion that the fact exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fashion 21 </em>v. <em>Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1149 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 493] <em>(Fashion 21), </em>quoting <em>Wigodsky v. Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 51, 55 [75 Cal.Rptr. 419].)  The record reflects several instances in which the trial court resolved doubts about the evidence against plaintiffs and allowed adverse inferences to control its findings as to foundation. This translated into an improper weighing of the evidence, a task that should have been left to the jury as trier of fact. <em>(Goldsmith, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th 258, 267 [conflicting inferences in evidence go to the document\u2019s weight, not its admissibility]; <em>Spolter </em>v. <em>Four-Wheel Brake Service Co. </em>(1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 690, 693 [222 P.2d 307] [which of two conflicting inferences shall reasonably be drawn from the evidence \u201cis entirely a jury question\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">Here, for example, the trial court appears to have disregarded defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s statements at the motion hearing, which effectively conceded that the records subpoenaed from Yelp, Comcast, and AT&amp;T tied the Yelp posts to defendant\u2019s home and business network or routers. Defendant\u2019s counsel at various points stated that \u201c[t]he documents that were subpoenaed indicate that the users who posted these IDs accessed the [I]nternet and the Yelp website using an IP address that was assigned to Scott Carpenter\u2019s routers, one at his home, one at his business\u201d and \u201c[w]hether that router was at his home at the time, whether or not, you know, a neighbor accessed it, whether or not, you know, somebody else was within distance . . . that\u2019s just what the circumstance!] was here. Somebody was able to access his network.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel thus did not dispute the connection between the IP addresses and defendant\u2019s home and business accounts, but only whether Mr. Carpenter himself could be shown to have posted the reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">Later in addressing the temporal gap between the Yelp reviews and the earliest IP address that Comcast could produce, the trial court negatively inferred that because the Comcast record did not extend to the dates of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>postings, plaintiffs could not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reviews were in fact posted from defendant\u2019s Comcast account.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This conclusion ignored the positive inference that should have been drawn for plaintiffs from the fact that as of late July 2011, the Comcast record for the identical IP address provided by Yelp was assigned to defendant\u2019s account. Properly interpreting the evidence favorably to plaintiffs, out of the universe of IP addresses that could have been assigned to defendant by Comcast as of July 27, 2011, the one assigned to his account had been used to post two of the Yelp reviews less than two months earlier. Mr. Herardian\u2019s testimony supported this inference because it explained that a \u201csticky\u201d IP address like that issued by Comcast continues to renew unless some intervening event of several days causes a new IP address to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">The trial court similarly resolved doubts about the AT&amp;T record against plaintiffs and excluded the evidence for lack of foundation. The examination of plaintiffs\u2019 expert reveals the trial court\u2019s inferences regarding the AT&amp;T evidence: \u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:] During the month of June 2011, who was that [IP address] account assigned to, according to this record from AT&amp;T? [\u00b6] [Mr. Herardian:] Scott D. Carpenter. [\u00b6] [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:] Okay. Now, if you look at the top of that record\u2014[\u00b6] [THE COURT:] How do you tell that? [\u00b6] [Mr. Herardian:] His name is right here under \u2018Customer Name.\u2019 [\u00b6] [THE COURT:] Right. And that says \u2018Billing Start Date: April 2001.\u2019 [\u00b6] [Mr. Herardian:] That would be most likely the time at which the service was established. [\u00b6] [THE COURT:] How do you know that this is the record for June 3, 2011? Because someone told you it was; right? [\u00b6] [Mr. Herardian:] For June 3rd, 2011? [\u00b6] [THE COURT:] Yes. [\u00b6] [Mr. Herardian:] It\u2019s my understanding this document was provided in response to a subpoena. [\u00b6] [THE COURT:] Right. [\u00b6] So somebody told you that, that\u2019s the only reason you know that; is that fair? [\u00b6] [Mr. Herardian:] It\u2019s fair to assume that it\u2019s because that was the information asked for in the subpoena, yes. [\u00b6] [THE COURT:] Okay. Somebody told you that. [\u00b6] So he doesn\u2019t know that. Walk me through how you can tell that from this, [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]. [\u00b6] [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:] Because they\u2019re responding to our subpoena and they\u2019re showing us who was assigned that IP address on that date. That\u2019s what we asked them for. And if you look at the top of that page, it shows you that Scott Carpenter was assigned that IP address from February 6th, 2011, to at least August 26th, 2011. [\u00b6] [Defendant\u2019s counsel:] I\u2019m going to object to the characterization that it was assigned. My reading of this document shows that his billing address is listed there. I\u2019m not sure that the document says, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>counsel purports it to say. [\u00b6] [THE COURT:] Yes. [\u00b6] And in this gentleman\u2019s deposition, he said he just assumed that the billing address and the service address were the same, as I recall. Yes. He is just assuming they\u2019re the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The trial court\u2019s scrutiny of whether the AT&amp;T record indicated defendant on the account to which the IP address was assigned is perplexing because, on its face, the AT&amp;T record contains enough information for a jury to reasonably infer defendant was the account holder, and defendant\u2019s counsel had already conceded the AT&amp;T record linked the third Yelp post to defendant\u2019s office router or network. The record itself provides two sets of information: The \u201cIP Assignment Details\u201d show the IP address, provided by Yelp, assigned to the username \u201ceviek@sbcglobal.net\u201d for the date range February 6th, 2011, to August 26th, 2011. The \u201cCustomer Account Details\u201d show Scott D. Carpenter\u2019s name and account information, including billing dates, billing address, and the \u201cMember ID\u201d for the account: \u201ceviek@sbcglobal.net.\u201d The underlying record established the address listed was defendant\u2019s business address and the \u201ceviek\u201d member ID and e-mail address had been assigned to one of defendant\u2019s employees and had remained in effect when the employee left the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel also conceded the connection, albeit in the context of arguing the insufficiency of the evidence: \u201c[A]nyone on any computer within [defendant\u2019s] office would have the exact same IP address, no matter which computer was being used .... So you could have had a dozen employees all on the computer at the same time, one of whom may have posted this, but you can\u2019t identify who it is.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel also made an offer of proof, stating \u201cin case there\u2019s any issue about the fact that these accounts actually belonged to Mr. Carpenter, he acknowledged at his deposition that ... the AT&amp;T account is his account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">In light of these foundational facts, the inference that the billing address and physical location were the same is equally if not more plausible than the inference that they were different. Although not binding on the trier of fact, the rationale for granting the discovery motion earlier in the case, based on the court\u2019s \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of the circumstantial evidence, provides an example of how the issue could be, and in fact was, resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">There is no indication that the trial court found the AT&amp;T record was not authentic or did not respond to the subpoena. The record was, therefore, admissible, and any dubious or conflicting inferences to be drawn would \u201c \u2018go[] to the document\u2019s weight as evidence, not its admissibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Goldsmith, supra, 59 </em>Cal.4th 258, 267.) Given the dispositive effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>motion, the trial court erred by failing to draw these inferences in plaintiffs\u2019 favor in ruling on the motion. (See <em>R &amp;B Auto Center, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.4th at p. 359 [application of presumptions and inferences led to conclusion that trier of fact \u201cpotentially could find that [the defendant] engaged in unfair business practices\u201d]; <em>Dillingham-Ray Wilson, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.4th at p. 1403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">4. <em>The Directed Verdict Was Improper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">Plaintiffs cite <em>Fashion 21, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.4th 1138, for the proposition that the publication element of defamation may be proven with indirect evidence. In <em>Fashion 21, </em>a clothing retailer brought a claim for libel against a group of workers who allegedly distributed defamatory flyers during a demonstration. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1143-1144.) The defendants moved to strike the complaint as a SLAPP suit under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Fashion 21, </em>at p. 1143.) The plaintiff\u2019s evidence to establish publication by one defendant \u201cNarro\u201d was an edited videotape of the demonstration, which showed Narro arriving at the scene of the demonstration with the demonstrators, unloading placards and a banner, and holding a stack of flyers, while passersby held and sometimes read the flyers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1149.) The defendants argued this evidence was insufficient to go to the jury \u201cbecause it would be pure conjecture to say the flyers were distributed by Narro when they just as well could have been distributed by the other person or by persons not even shown on the videotape.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">The appellate court found the circumstantial evidence sufficient for the jury to infer the fact of publication. The court explained: \u201cEven \u2018slight evidence\u2019 in support of the fact to be inferred has been held to be sufficient. It is up to the jury to assess these credibility and judge the weight of the evidence proffered in support of and in opposition to the fact it is asked to infer. [\u00b6] We believe the evidence showing Narro actively participated in the demonstration, had a stack of the green flyers in his possession and these flyers wound up in the hands of those passing by could, but not necessarily would, lead a reasonable trier of fact to infer Narro distributed at least some of the flyers.\u201d <em>(Fashion 21, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.4th at p. 1150, fn. omitted.) The appellate court rejected the notion that a jury is permitted to draw an inference only when the evidence is so strong that the inference must be found as a matter of law. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">We are persuaded by the appellate court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Fashion 21 </em>and apply it here. The sum of indirect evidence contained in the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>provided in plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof regarding the Yelp reviews includes: (1) the date and fact of the issuance of the June 1, 2011 temporary restraining order; (2) the Yelp reviews posted on June 1, June 2, and June 3, 2011; (3) Ms. Kinda\u2019s testimony regarding her efforts to verify the jobs described and determine which customers, if any, posted the reviews; (4) the subpoenas served on Yelp, Comcast, and AT&amp;T, and the responsive records; and (5) Mr. Herardian\u2019s expert testimony regarding IP addresses, their relation to a physical entity (i.e., router or network) through assignment by an Internet Service Provider, the technical attributes of wireless networks, and the requirements to log on to an unsecure network.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">As in <em>Fashion 21, </em>we find that this evidence \u201ccould, but not necessarily would\u201d lead a reasonable trier of fact to infer that defendant posted the Yelp reviews. <em>(Fashion 21, supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1150.) This evidence includes the Yelp, Comcast, and AT&amp;T records, as well as defendant\u2019s anticipated testimony denying responsibility for the Yelp reviews. It is \u201cup to the jury to assess the credibility and judge the weight of the evidence proffered in support of and in opposition to the fact it is asked to infer.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>And it is for the jury, not the trial court, to determine the significance of the gaps in direct evidence, including the temporal gap in the Comcast records, any uncertainty in the physical versus billing addresses for the AT&amp;T records, and the fact that IP addresses connect to a network or router rather than to a specific person or device. Viewing the evidence in the context of a directed verdict\u2014which is to apply the same standard as a nonsuit\u2014and resolving all inferences and doubts in favor of plaintiffs, we cannot say that judgment against Ms. Kinda and Artisan on the defamation cause of action was required as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">In concluding that the trial court erred in its wholesale exclusion of the Yelp evidence and related Comcast and AT&amp;T records, we do not intend to suggest that the trial court should abandon its gatekeeping function to allow or exclude evidence. The admissibility of each component of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, including the scope of Mr. Herardian\u2019s expert testimony, was properly before the court and would have remained subject to the normal course of objections at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">D\u201e E.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAWT\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>III.

Rules of Court, rule 8.256(d)(1)), appellants filed a notice of settlement, indicating the case has settled, with dismissal conditional on the fulfillment of specified terms. The parties have not yet filed a stipulation for dismissal. A valid settlement between the parties renders the appeal moot to the extent that it \u201ceffectively extinguishes the judgment from which the appeal is taken,\u201d ending both the dispute and the possibility of further, effective relief from the court. <em>(Ebensteiner Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Chadmar Group </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1180 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 825].)
