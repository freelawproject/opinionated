Berg to life without the possibility of parole (TWOP) for committing a first degree murder with special circumstances when he was 17 years old. (See Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 190.5, subd. (b) [providing that the penalty for a first degree murder with special circumstances for a person \u201c16 years of age or older and under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the discretion of the court, 25 years to life\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Berg filed a petition for habeas corpus in December 2014, in which he requested that the court vacate his sentence and order a new sentencing hearing on the ground that the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of an TWOP sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(2012) 567 U.S. _ [183 T.Ed.2d 407, 132 S.Ct. 2455] <em>(Miller). </em>In <em>Miller, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cmandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u2018cruel and unusual punishments\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2460]) and stated that the \u201cappropriate occasions\u201d for sentencing juveniles to LWOP are \u201cuncommon.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2469].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">The habeas corpus court ruled that the sentencing court\u2019s statement of reasons for imposing an LWOP sentence was \u201cinconsistent with the evolving Eighth Amendment jurisprudence and the requirements of <em>Miller, supra.\u201d </em>The court granted the petition, vacated Berg\u2019s sentence, and ordered that the matter be set for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">On appeal, in their opening brief, the People contend that the habeas corpus court erred in granting Berg\u2019s petition because <em>Miller </em>does not apply retroactively. However, while this appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court held that <em>Miller </em>announced a substantive rule of constitutional law that must be given retroactive effect. <em>(Montgomery </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(2016) 577 U.S. _ [193 L.Ed.2d 599, 136 S.Ct. 718] <em>(Montgomery).) </em>Accordingly, we reject the People\u2019s argument that <em>Miller </em>does not apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The People also claim that, even assuming <em>Miller </em>applies retroactively, the sentencing court complied with <em>Miller </em>by considering \u201cyouth-oriented factors\u201d before imposing an LWOP sentence. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 421, 324 P.3d 245] (Gutierrez), the California Supreme Court stated, \u201cWe understand <em>Miller </em>to require a sentencing court to admit and consider relevant evidence,\u201d pertaining to five specific categories of evidence relevant to the determination of \u201cwhether a particular defendant is a \u2018 \u201crare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1388.) The <em>Gutierrez </em>court also concluded that an LWOP sentence may be imposed on a juvenile homicide offender only \u201cwhen the sentencing court\u2019s discretion is properly exercised in accordance with Miller.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1379.) While the court carefully considered numerous factors in sentencing Berg, including Berg\u2019s youth, the court did not exercise its discretion in accordance with the principles espoused in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez, </em>which were both decided long after Berg\u2019s sentencing. We therefore reject the People\u2019s contention that the trial court complied with <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Finally, in a supplemental brief, relying on a recent decision of another panel of this court in <em>In re Kirchner </em>(2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1398, 1416 [199 Cal.Rptr.3d 416] <em>(Kirchner), </em>the People contend that Berg\u2019s petition should be denied because section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides an adequate statutory remedy for <em>Miller </em>error. In <em>Montgomery, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[a] State may remedy a <em>Miller </em>violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them,\u201d and cited a Wyoming statute providing that juvenile homicide offenders are eligible for parole in that state after 25 years of imprisonment. <em>(Montgomery, supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Unlike the Wyoming statute cited in <em>Montgomery, </em>section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) does <em>not </em>provide that California juvenile homicide offenders may be considered for parole after some specified period of time. Instead, the statute sets forth a process pursuant to which a select group of defendants sentenced to LWOP for crimes committed as juveniles may file petitions for recall and resentencing, which, if granted, may lead to the imposition of a new sentence containing a period of parole eligibility. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The statute expressly disqualifies certain defendants from obtaining relief pursuant to the statute <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(2)(A)(ii)), requires a defendant to file a petition \u201cdescribing his or her remorse and work towards rehabilitation\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(2)(B)), requires the petition to affirm that one of four qualifying factors is true <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(2)(B)(i)\u2014(iv)), and sets forth a nonexclusive list of eight factors for a trial court to consider in determining whether to grant the petition <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(2)(F)(i)\u2014(viii)). In short, while section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides a statutory procedure by which <em>some </em>defendants serving LWOP sentences for crimes committed as juveniles may obtain resentencing, we disagree with the <em>Kirchner </em>court\u2019s conclusion that the statute provides such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>defendants with \u201call the rights set forth in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery.\u201d (Kirchner, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.) For reasons that we explain in greater detail in part III.C., <em>post, </em>we conclude that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) does not provide an adequate statutory remedy for <em>Miller </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting Berg\u2019s petition and directing that the matter be set for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">A. <em>The commitment offenses</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">At the age of 17, Berg murdered victim Kettie Hancock during a burglary/robbery of a store at which Hancock was the manager. Berg\u2019s girlfriend, who worked at the store, let Berg and an accomplice into the store. Berg stabbed Hancock more than 21 times.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Approximately two weeks prior to the Hancock murder, Berg committed a robbery of a gas station. During the robbery, Berg stabbed the victim, Richard Couch, at least twice, causing Couch to suffer a deep puncture wound to his left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">B. <em>The underlying criminal case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">In October 1996, the People charged Berg with murder (\u00a7 187) (count 1), and alleged the special circumstance that Berg committed the murder in the course of a robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)), and during the commission of a burglary (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)). The People also alleged that Berg personally used a knife during the murder (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)). In addition, the People charged Berg with conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary (\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1)) (count 2), robbery (\u00a7 211) (count 3), and burglary (\u00a7 459) (count 4) and alleged a knife use allegation with respect to each count (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)). Counts 1 through 4 were all related to the Hancock murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">With respect to the incident involving Couch, the People charged Berg with attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a)) (count 5), assault with a deadly weapon and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)) (count 6), and robbery (\u00a7 211) (count 7). The People also alleged numerous weapon and injury enhancements with respect to these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>In May 1997, Berg pled guilty to all charges and allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As discussed in greater detail in part III.B., <em>post, </em>the trial court sentenced Berg to LWOP on the murder conviction. Pursuant to section 654, the court stayed execution of the sentence on the knife enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)) on count 1. The court also stayed execution of the sentences on both the substantive offenses and enhancements on counts 2 through 4 pursuant to section 654. With respect to the attempted murder in count 5 and related enhancements, the court imposed an aggregate term of 11 years to be served concurrently with the LWOP sentence. The court stayed execution of the sentence on count 6 pursuant to section 654 and imposed a seven-year sentence on count 7, to be served concurrently with the LWOP sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">C. <em>Berg\u2019s petition for habeas corpus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In December 2014, Berg filed a petition for habeas corpus and a supporting brief in which he contended that the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of an LWOP sentence for a crime that he committed as a juvenile constituted a violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution under <em>Miller </em>and Gutierrez-<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Berg supported his petition with relevant portions of the record in the underlying criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">After the People filed an informal response and Berg filed a reply, the trial court issued an order to show cause as to why Berg\u2019s sentence should not be vacated and a resentencing hearing held.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The People filed a return and a supporting brief in which they argued that the sentencing court had given \u201cfull consideration to the relevant youth-related factors applicable to [Berg],\u201d and contended that \u201cfurther guidance by <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez </em>decisions would not have altered the court\u2019s sentencing choice.\u201d (Boldface &amp; capitalization omitted.) In the alternative, the People argued that <em>Miller </em>should not be applied retroactively to Berg\u2019s case, which was final at the time <em>Miller </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">After Berg filed a denial and the habeas corpus court held a hearing on the petition, the court issued an order granting the petition. In its order granting the petition, the habeas corpus court concluded that \u201ccurrent Eighth Amendment jurisprudence regarding the imposition of life sentences on juvenile offenders must be applied retroactively to persons serving actual or functional LWOP sentences.\u201d The habeas corpus court further concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the sentencing court\u2019s statement of reasons for imposing an LWOP sentence on Berg did not comport with the requirements of <em>Miller. </em>The court ordered \u201cthat a writ of habeas corpus be issued; that [Berg\u2019s] sentence of LWOP be vacated; and that the matter be set for re-sentencing in the Superior Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The People appeal the trial court\u2019s order granting Berg\u2019s petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">A. <em>The habeas corpus court did not err in concluding that </em>Miller <em>applies retroactively</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">As noted in part L, <em>ante, </em>in their opening brief, the People contend that the trial court erred in granting Berg\u2019s petition because <em>Miller </em>does not apply retroactively to Berg\u2019s case. However, the People concede in their supplemental brief that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court in <em>Montgomery </em>held that <em>Miller </em>is retroactive</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">We agree with the People\u2019s concession. In <em>Montgomery, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that <em>Miller\u2019s </em>\u201cholding is retroactive to juvenile offenders whose convictions and sentences were final when <em>Miller </em>was decided.\u201d (Montgomery, <em>supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at pp. 725, 732-736] [concluding that <em>Miller </em>established a substantive rule of law that must be given retroactive effect under the federal Constitution].)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">Accordingly, the habeas corpus court did not err in concluding that <em>Miller </em>applies retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">B. <em>The habeas corpus court properly concluded that, in sentencing Berg, the trial court did not exercise its discretion in accordance with the juvenile LWOP sentencing requirements later established in </em>Miller</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">The People contend that the sentencing court \u201c[c]omplied with <em>Miller </em>and Gutierrez\u201d because the sentencing court took \u201cinto account <em>Miller-type </em>youth-oriented factors, and decided that LWOP was the appropriate sentence.\u201d The People\u2019s contention raises a question of law. We review questions of law de novo. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1119, 1127 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 729] <em>(Butler).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">1. <em>Governing law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">In <em>Montgomery, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that before a defendant may be sentenced to LWOP for a crime committed as a juvenile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the sentencing court must hold a hearing at which the court considers the principles espoused in <em>Miller </em>concerning youth: \u201cA hearing where \u2018youth and its attendant characteristics\u2019 are considered as sentencing factors is necessary to separate those juveniles who may be sentenced to life without parole from those who may not. <em>[Miller, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2460].] The hearing does not replace but rather gives effect to <em>Miller </em>s substantive holding that life without parole is an excessive sentence for children whose crimes reflect transient immaturity.\u201d (Montgomery, <em>supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 735].)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">In <em>Gutierrez, </em>the California Supreme Court applied <em>Miller </em>in disapproving <em>People </em>v. <em>Guinn </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1130 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 791] <em>(Guinn). </em>In <em>Guinn, </em>the Court of Appeal held that section 190.5, subdivision (b) creates a presumption in favor of life without parole for those sentenced under its provisions. The <em>Gutierrez </em>court summarized its holding and disposition as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">\u201c[W]e hold that section 190.5[, subdivision (b)], properly construed, confers discretion on a trial court to sentence a 16- or 17-year-old juvenile convicted of special circumstance murder to life without parole or to 25 years to life, with no presumption in favor of life without parole. We further hold that <em>Miller </em>requires a trial court, in exercising its sentencing discretion, to consider the \u2018distinctive attributes of youth\u2019 and how those attributes \u2018diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders\u2019 before imposing life without parole on a juvenile offender. <em>(Miller, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2465].) Because the sentencing regime created by section 190.5 [, subdivision (b)] authorizes and indeed requires consideration of the distinctive attributes of youth highlighted in <em>Miller, </em>we find no constitutional infirmity with section 190.5 [, subdivision (b)] once it is understood not to impose a presumption in favor of life without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">\u2018\u201cBecause the two defendants here were sentenced before <em>Miller </em>in accordance with the interpretation of section 190.5 [, subdivision (b)] prevailing at the time (see <em>Guinn, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1142), we remand for resentencing in light of the principles set forth in <em>Miller </em>and this opinion.\u201d <em>(Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1360-1361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">The <em>Gutierrez </em>court further concluded that <em>Miller </em>requires that a court deciding whether to impose an LWOP sentence on a defendant for a crime committed as a juvenile consider the following five types of evidence pertaining to youth: (1) \u201coffender\u2019s \u2018chronological age and its hallmark features\u2014among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1388); (2) \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>evidence or other information in the record regarding \u2018the family and home environment that surrounds [the defendant]\u2014and from which he cannot usually extricate himself\u2014no matter how brutal or dysfunctional\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1388-1389); (3) \u201cany evidence or other information in the record regarding \u2018the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of [the defendant\u2019s] participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1389); (4) \u201cany evidence or other information in the record as to whether the offender \u2018might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth\u2014for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys\u2019 \u201d (ibid.); and (5) \u201cany evidence or other information in the record bearing on \u2018the possibility of rehabilitation\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In <em>People v. Chavez </em>(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 18 [175 Cal.Rptr.3d 334] <em>(Chavez), </em>this court applied <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez </em>and stated that the five aforementioned types of evidence \u201cwhen considered together in a reasoned manner . . . [are a] useful and necessary means by which a sentencing court must determine whether transient immaturity requires some degree of leniency or irreparable corruption must be punished as severely as possible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 33.) Because there was nothing in the record in <em>Chavez </em>that indicated \u201cthat the trial court itself directly considered this ultimate question,\u201d this court remanded the matter for resentencing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 34, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">2. <em>Factual and procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">a. <em>The sentencing court\u2019s statement of reasons for imposing an LWOP sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">At sentencing, the trial court stated that, pursuant to <em>Guinn, </em>Berg\u2019s sentence was \u201cpresumptively] life without possibility of parole.\u201d The court added, \u201cI want to make it clear, however, that in my view, if I had to weigh between the two [sentence alternatives under section 190.5, subdivision (b) (i.e., LWOP or a sentence of 25 years to life)] on an equal basis, the sentence in this case would be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The court also noted that it was required to consider both aggravating and mitigating factors in determining an appropriate sentence. In the course of its discussion of such factors, the court made reference to several types of evidence related to Berg\u2019s youth. For example, the court referred to Berg\u2019s childhood as follows: \u201cThe most important and significant item in mitigation relates to the defendant\u2019s childhood. And here I recognize\u2014I was bowled over by the hellish childhood that this individual had. I have read thousands of probation reports. I have handled juvenile dependency cases. I have seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>many, many sad situations, but this is probably the worst that I have ever seen, short of torture of a child. That was mental torture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">However, the court reasoned that, notwithstanding Berg\u2019s horrendous childhood, he had made a choice to commit the murder, stating: \u201cThe problem with all of this is that the defendant, at some point, began to make his own decisions. He was old enough at the age of 17 years eight months to decide [sic] he had examples of the other way.\u201d The court continued, \u201cHe had ceased being the child. The child was already damaged and gone. The adult made the decision to kill [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In discussing whether to follow a psychologist\u2019s recommendation to impose a sentence other than LWOP, the court stated: \u201cIf I look at this, the protection of society must be uppermost, and I cannot think that we have the means yet, at the state where we are today in history, particularly with the state of our prisons, to say that he could get enough therapy, and enough rehabilitation, to be a safe bet, even when he\u2019s an old man. It seems to me that too much damage has been done to take that risk. [\u00b6] I don\u2019t disagree that that would be wonderful, but I do disagree that we have the means to accomplish it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The court further stated, \u201cI find age as a slightly mitigating factor in this case. [Berg] was young, but old enough to be sent to war in four months, and old enough to make the choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">After a lengthy discussion of aggravating and mitigating factors, the court stated, \u201cSo, I must sentence [Berg] to prison without the possibility of parole. The aggr[a]vants outweigh the mitigants, so I must do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">b. <em>The habeas corpus court\u2019s review of the sentencing court\u2019s statement of reasons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">In its order granting Berg\u2019s petition, the habeas corpus court rejected the People\u2019s contention that the sentencing court had adequately considered the factors associated with youth discussed in <em>Miller. </em>The habeas corpus court reasoned: \u201cThe court finds and concludes that [the sentencing judge\u2019s] decision, though careful and thoughtful in the extreme, did not give consideration to these factors\u2014then unknown and, in this court\u2019s view, largely unforeseeable\u2014when she pronounced judgment. Instead the thrust of the court\u2019s analysis was to consider aggravants and mitigants under [former] rules 421 and 423 of the California Rules of Court. [Citation.] For this reason alone, this court concludes the petition must be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>3. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We acknowledge that the sentencing court\u2019s statements demonstrate that the court did consider Berg\u2019s youth, to some degree, prior to imposing an LWOP sentence. However, <em>\u201cMiller </em>... did more than require a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender\u2019s youth before imposing life without parole; it established that the penological justifications for life without parole collapse in light of \u2018the distinctive attributes of youth.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Montgomery, supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 734].) Therefore, \u201c[e]ven if a court considers a child\u2019s age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for a child whose crime reflects \u2018 \u201cunfortunate yet transient immaturity.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, before an LWOP sentence may be imposed on a juvenile, a sentencing court must hold a hearing at which it considers whether the defendant is \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The record in this case does not reflect that the sentencing court ever considered \u201cthe ultimate question posed by the courts in both <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez </em>. . . : Did th[is] crime[] reflect transient immaturity or irreparable corruption?\u201d <em>(Chavez, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.4th at p. 33.) Rather than considering Berg\u2019s youth in determining whether he was the \u201c \u2018 \u201crare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1388), the sentencing court considered Berg\u2019s youth in the context of determining whether, as the sentencing court stated, the \u201caggr[a]vants outweigh the mitigants.\u201d Thus, it is clear that in imposing an LWOP sentence on Berg, the trial court did not exercise its discretion \u201cin accordance with Miller,\u201d as is required. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1379.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">In addition, given that Berg was sentenced prior to the decisions in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez, </em>the record does not reflect that the sentencing court considered all relevant evidence related to whether the court could lawfully impose an LWOP sentence on Berg. (See <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1389-1390 [outlining five categories of youth-related evidence relevant to the determination of whether to impose an LWOP sentence on a defendant for a crime committed as a juvenile].)

A trial court\u2019s failure to consider such factors constitutes error.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">In <em>Montgomery, </em>the United States Supreme Court held \u201cthat <em>Miller </em>announced a substantive rule of constitutional law,\u201d that must be applied retroactively. <em>(Montgomery, supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 736].) The <em>Montgomery </em>court reversed the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial of an inmate\u2019s application for a supervisory writ seeking collateral review of his LWOP sentence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at pp. 727, 737.) The <em>Montgomery </em>court also clarified that states are not required to \u201crelitigate sentences\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 736]) in order to remedy <em>Miller </em>error, but can simply permit juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">\u201cGiving <em>Miller </em>retroactive effect, moreover, does not require States to relitigate sentences, let alone convictions, in every case where a juvenile offender received mandatory life without parole. A State may remedy a <em>Miller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them. See, <em>e.g., </em>Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-10-301(c) (2013) (juvenile homicide offenders eligible for parole after 25 years). Allowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity\u2014and who have since matured\u2014will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u201cExtending parole eligibility to juvenile offenders does not impose an onerous burden on the States, nor does it disturb the finality of state convictions.

Superior Court </em>(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 409, 433 [164 Cal.Rptr.3d 232].) Thus, we must determine whether section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides an adequate remedy for a defendant, such as Berg, imprisoned under a sentence imposed in violation of <em>Miller </em>and its progeny. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) does not provide an adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">To begin with, to conclude that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides an adequate remedy for those serving sentences imposed in violation of <em>Miller </em>would be inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Montgomery. </em>The <em>Montgomery </em>court indicated that states could remedy a <em>Miller </em>violation by \u201c[e]xtending parole eligibility\u201d to offenders serving LWOP sentences for crimes committed as juveniles. <em>(Montgomery, supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 736].) At no point in the <em>Montgomery </em>court\u2019s opinion did the court suggest that a state could remedy <em>Miller </em>error by permitting a defendant to utilize a statutory procedure that <em>might </em>lead to parole eligibility. The actual remedy authorized in <em>Montgomery, </em>extending parole eligibility, provides an adequate remedy for <em>Miller </em>error because it is the defendant\u2019s ineligibility for parole that is the harm suffered by juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>defendants sentenced to LWOP. In contrast, providing a defendant with the opportunity to file a petition under section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) that may <em>or may not </em>lead to the imposition of a new sentence containing a period of parole clearly does not guarantee such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Given the stringent requirements of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2), if the statute were deemed to provide an adequate remedy for defendants serving a sentence imposed in violation of <em>Miller, </em>it is all but certain that many defendants would be required to continue to serve LWOP sentences without <em>any </em>sentencing court ever having considered whether such defendants were the \u201c \u2018 \u201crare juvenile offender [s] whose crime reflects irreparable corruption,\u201d \u2019 \u201d as is required. <em>(Montgomery, supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 724],)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such a result would be inconsistent with Montgomery\u2019s central tenet, namely, that a retroactive application of <em>Miller </em>is required in light of the \u201cgrave risk\u201d that many inmates serving LWOP sentences from crimes committed as juveniles are \u201cbeing held in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Montgomery, </em>at p._[136 S.Ct. at p. 736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In addition to being inconsistent with <em>Montgomery, </em>concluding that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides an adequate remedy for a <em>Miller </em>violation would also be contrary to Gutierrez. In <em>Gutierrez, </em>the California Supreme Court rejected the People\u2019s argument that the enactment of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) eliminated the possibility that a defendant serving an LWOP sentence under California law for a crime committed as a juvenile, had suffered a <em>Miller </em>violation. <em>(Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1387.) The <em>Gutierrez </em>court reasoned in part: \u201cThe Attorney General contends that section 1170[, subdivision (d)(2)] removes life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders from the ambit of <em>Miller </em>s concerns because the statute provides a meaningful opportunity for such offenders to obtain release. In support of this contention, the Attorney General relies on a \u2018cf.\u2019 citation in <em>Miller </em>to language in <em>Graham </em>[v. <em>Florida </em>(2010) 560 U.S. 48 [176 L.Ed.2d 825, 130 S.Ct. 2011]].[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] (See <em>Miller, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2469] [\u2018Cf. <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S., at _ [130 S.Ct., at p. 2030] (\u201cA State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom,\u201d but must provide \u201csome meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>rehabilitation\u201d).\u2019]; see also <em>Graham, supra, </em>560 U.S. at p. 75 [\u2018It is for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.\u2019].) However, <em>Graham </em>spoke of providing juvenile offenders with a \u2018meaningful opportunity to obtain release\u2019 as a constitutionally required alternative to\u2014not as an after-the-fact corrective <em>for\u2014\u2018making the judgment at the outset </em>that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.\u2019 <em>(Graham, </em>at p. 75, italics added.) Likewise, <em>Miller\u2019s </em>\u2018cf.\u2019 citation to the \u2018meaningful opportunity\u2019 language in <em>Graham </em>occurred in the context of prohibiting \u2018imposition of that harshest prison sentence\u2019 on juveniles under a mandatory scheme. <em>(Miller, </em>at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2469].) Neither <em>Miller </em>nor <em>Graham </em>indicated that an opportunity to recall a sentence of life without parole 15 to 24 years into the future would somehow make more reliable or justifiable the imposition of that sentence and its underlying judgment of the offender\u2019s incorrigibility \u2018at the outset.\u2019 <em>(Graham, </em>at p. _ [130 S.Ct. at p. 75].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Similarly, in <em>People v. Lozano </em>(2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1138 [197 Cal.Rptr. 257] <em>(Lozano), </em>the California Court of Appeal concluded that a prisoner serving an LWOP sentence imposed for a crime committed as a juvenile \u2018\u201cdoes have a remedy under section 1170, subdivision (d)(2), <em>but that remedy is not exclusive, nor is it a substitute for her Eighth Amendment right to a sentencing hearing considering amenability to rehabilitation in the first instance.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">In addition to being inconsistent with case law from the United States Supreme Court, the California Supreme Court, and the California Court of Appeal, concluding that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides an adequate remedy to those serving sentences imposed in violation of <em>Miller </em>raises serious constitutional concerns. Clearly, section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) does not provide an adequate remedy for those defendants serving juvenile LWOP sentences to whom the statute, by its terms, does not apply. Consider a petitioner such as the defendant in <em>Montgomery, </em>whose victim was a deputy sheriff. <em>(Montgomery, supra, </em>577 U.S. at p. _ [136 S.Ct. at p. 725].) A defendant who kills a law enforcement officer is expressly disqualified from bringing a section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) petition. (See \u00a7 1170, subd. (d)(2)(A)(ii).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To conclude that a statutory procedure for which the defendant is expressly disqualified affords an adequate remedy for an Eighth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Amendment violation would violate basic principles of due process. On the other hand, if <em>Kirchner </em>is intended to limit the habeas corpus remedies only for those defendants who are <em>not </em>disqualified from filing a section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) petition, this would raise equal protection concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In any event, section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) does not provide an adequate remedy for <em>Miller </em>error even for those defendants who <em>might </em>ultimately obtain a resentencing pursuant to the statute. There is nothing in <em>Miller </em>or its progeny that suggests that a state may condition a prisoner\u2019s right to receive a lawful sentencing hearing upon the prisoner\u2019s success in a separate collateral proceeding. Thus, as Berg correctly argues in his supplemental brief, \u201cMr. Berg must be granted a resentencing hearing where the five <em>Miller </em>factors [outlined in Gutierrez] are the controlling factors before the sentencing court, not the miscellaneous factors dictated in . . . section 1170, subdivision (d)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">4. <em>We decline to follow </em>Kirchner</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">As noted in part I., <em>ante, </em>in <em>Kirchner, </em>a panel of this court concluded that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) \u201cmeets the requirements of <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>and is therefore an adequate remedy which Kirchner[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] must pursue before resorting to habeas corpus relief.\u201d <em>(Kirchner, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1418-1419.) Kirchner\u2019s conclusion that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides an adequate remedy for <em>Miller </em>error is unpersuasive for the following reasons.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The <em>Kirchner </em>court stated that \u201calthough section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) does <em>not </em>provide an inmate with a parole hearing, <em>it provides him or her with all the rights set forth in Miller and Montgomery.\u201d (Kirchner, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.4th at p. 1416, italics added.) We disagree. As discussed in part III.C.3., <em>ante, </em>section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) affords many defendants sentenced to LWOP in violation of <em>Miller none </em>of the rights set forth in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>either because they are disqualified from obtaining relief under the statute or they do not meet the requirements for obtaining such relief. Further, section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) requires <em>all </em>prisoners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>seeking to obtain resentencing for <em>Miller </em>error under the statute to prevail in a separate collateral proceeding before obtaining <em>any </em>of the rights guaranteed by <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Further, the <em>Kirchner </em>court\u2019s primary reason for concluding that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides an adequate remedy for <em>Miller </em>error appears to be its (mistaken) assumption that only through a section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) proceeding may a court consider a defendant\u2019s postconviction conduct. <em>(Kirchner, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1416-1418.) The <em>Kirchner </em>court reasoned: \u201cThis procedure [outlined in section 1170, subdivision (d)(2)] of course responds to and remedies Justice Scalia\u2019s concerns [expressed in his dissent in <em>Montgomery], </em>which are implicitly recognized by the majority in <em>Montgomery, </em>that, after perhaps decades in prison, a defendant cannot logically or in fairness be returned to the same status as existed on the day of sentencing. ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] Were we to find that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) was not an adequate remedy at law and, thus, not a petitioner\u2019s exclusive remedy,[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] we would permit a petitioner to select whether to take advantage of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) or <em>seek a direct resentencing limited to those factors existing at the time of the original sentencing\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 1417, italics altered.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">This reasoning is unpersuasive because there is nothing in <em>Miller, Gutierrez, </em>or <em>Montgomery </em>that suggests, much less states, that a trial court is <em>precluded </em>from considering evidence of a defendant\u2019s postconviction conduct in conducting a resentencing as a remedy for <em>Miller </em>error. On the contrary, a trial court is <em>required </em>to consider such evidence in determining a defendant\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation upon resentencing. <em>(Lozano, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1137-1138.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Lozano, </em>in response to a defendant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus, the People conceded that the defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing in light of <em>Miller. (Lozano, supra, </em>at pp. 1129-1130.) Upon resentencing, the trial court excluded evidence of Lozano\u2019s postconviction rehabilitation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1137.) The <em>Lozano </em>court concluded that this ruling constituted error, reasoning: \u201cIn light of <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez, </em>we conclude the trial court could not categorically exclude Lozano\u2019s proffered evidence of postconviction rehabilitation. As <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at page 1390, interpreted <em>Miller, </em>\u2018the trial court must consider all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>relevant evidence bearing on the \u201cdistinctive attributes of youth\u201d discussed in <em>Miller </em>and how those attributes \u201cdiminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders.\u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2465].)\u2019 All relevant evidence, in our view, includes what Lozano asserts is 15 years of rehabilitation in prison. Disregard of evidence of rehabilitation, under the circumstances presented here, is inconsistent with the focus required by <em>Miller </em>and Gutierrez.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1137-1138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The <em>Lozano </em>court also specifically rejected the People\u2019s argument that evidence of postconviction conduct could be presented <em>only </em>in a petition for resentencing under section 1170, subdivision (d)(2): \u201cWe reject the Attorney General\u2019s argument that Lozano\u2019s proper forum for introduction of evidence of postconviction rehabilitation is via a petition for resentencing under section 1170, subdivision (d)(2). <em>Gutierrez </em>effectively disposes of this contention in its recognition that amenability to rehabilitation must be considered at sentencing before imposition of an LWOP sentence. <em>(Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1386-1387.)\u201d <em>(Lozano, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.4th at p. 1138.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">There is also nothing in the text of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) that manifests the Legislature\u2019s intent to create a procedure for providing a remedy for <em>Miller </em>error. Rather than providing a mechanism for recalling sentences imposed in <em>violation </em>of <em>Miller, </em>section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) provides a statutory procedure by which defendants whose LWOP sentences were <em>validly </em>imposed may seek to recall such sentences by making the requisite statutory showing. However, the <em>Kirchner </em>court\u2019s holding requiring that the statute be used to remedy <em>Miller </em>error led the court to further conclude that the statute must be applied in a manner that finds no support in the text of the statute. Specifically, the <em>Kirchner </em>court imposed upon the <em>People </em>the burden of proof in a section 1170, subdivision <em>(d)(2)/Miller </em>remedy proceeding. (See <em>Kirchner, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.4th at p. 1418 [\u201ca petition under section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) will meet the requirements of <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>only if, at both the trial court\u2019s review of the sufficiency of the petition (see \u00a7 1170, subd. (d)(2)(E)) and at any hearing ordered thereafter, the <em>People </em>bear the burden, as they would at any initial sentencing under <em>Miller </em>and <em>Gutierrez, </em>of showing that the defendant is one of the rare individuals for whom no possibility of parole should be provided\u201d (italics added)].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>There is no support for the <em>Kirchner </em>court\u2019s reassigning of the burden of proof to the People in the statutory language. On the contrary, section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) clearly places the burden of proof on the <em>defendant. </em>The statute provides that \u2018\u201c[t]he <em>defendant </em>shall file the original petition with the sentencing court\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(2)(B), italics added), requires that the petition contain the <em>\u201cdefendant\u2019s </em>statement\u201d that various qualifying factors are true <em>(ibid., </em>italics added), authorizes the People to file a <em>\u201creply </em>to the petition\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(2)(D), italics added), and mandates that the court shall hold a hearing \u2018\u201c[i]f the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the <em>statements in the petition </em>are true\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(2)(E), italics added). Placing the burden of proof on the defendant is consistent with the statute\u2019s purpose of providing a defendant who is serving a <em>lawfully </em>imposed LWOP sentence with the opportunity to obtain a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Finally, we are not persuaded by the <em>Kirchner </em>court\u2019s assertion that \u201d[o]ur conclusion the remedy provided by section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) meets the requirements of <em>Montgomery, </em>does not conflict with the holding in Gutierrez.\u201d <em>(Kirchner, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.4th at p. 1419.) As the <em>Kirchner </em>court acknowledged, the <em>Gutierrez </em>court explicitly concluded \u2018\u201cthat the possibility that an LWOP sentence would later be recalled and a new sentence imposed under section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) did <em>not </em>cure the defect in the original sentence.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Thus, the <em>Kirchner </em>court\u2019s conclusion that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) <em>does </em>provide an adequate remedy for a <em>Miller </em>violation conflicts with <em>Gutierrez. </em>While the <em>Kirchner </em>court noted that <em>Gutierrez </em>was decided in the context of a direct appeal while Kirchner\u2019s case arose in the context of a collateral proceeding, there is nothing in <em>Gutierrez </em>that suggests that this distinction had any bearing on the court\u2019s decision. Further, given that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Montgomery </em>held that <em>Miller </em>must be given retroactive effect in collateral proceedings, we see no reason why this distinction should have any relevance in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Accordingly, we decline to follow <em>Kirchner </em>and instead conclude that section 1170, subdivision (d)(2) does not provide an adequate remedy for a defendant seeking collateral relief for <em>Miller </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The trial court\u2019s order granting Berg\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-10\">Haller, Acting P.
