We agree with the appellate division\u2019s determination that the order of the trial court denying Gray\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 (the private attorney general statute) is not appealable under Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 1466, subdivision (b)(2), because the order does not affect Gray\u2019s substantial rights. Further, Gray fails to establish that any exceptional circumstances required the appellate division to treat his appeal as a petition for extraordinary relief. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">In the underlying traffic infraction proceeding, Gray was convicted of failing to stop at a red light in violation of Vehicle Code section 21453, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>subdivision (a). Gray\u2019s infraction was captured by an automated camera used for traffic enforcement. Gray challenged his conviction by arguing the city failed to comply with Vehicle Code section 21455.5, subdivision (a), which required the city to publicly announce the installation of the camera and to issue warnings (rather than citations) for the first 30 days following the installation. The Supreme Court issued a published decision adopting Gray\u2019s arguments in part, though it affirmed his conviction. <em>(People v. Gray </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 901 [168 Cal.Rptr.3d 710, 319 P.3d 988].)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Gray subsequently filed a motion in the superior court seeking attorney\u2019s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the private attorney general statute. The trial court denied the motion, citing <em>Fogelson v. Municipal Court </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 858 [175 Cal.Rptr. 64], for the proposition that attorney\u2019s fees are generally not recoverable in a criminal case under the private attorney general statute. Gray appealed the order to the appellate division.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">The appellate division requested supplemental briefing from the parties regarding the appealability of the order denying the fee request under section 1466, subdivision (b)(2), which provides a defendant in an infraction case with the right to appeal \u201cany order made after judgment affecting his or her substantial rights.\u201d (\u00a7 1466, subd. (b)(2).) Gray asserted the order was appealable and suggested in passing that if the appellate division concluded the order was not appealable, it should exercise its discretion to treat his appeal as a petition for writ of mandate. The appellate division concluded the denial of attorney\u2019s fees did not affect Gray\u2019s substantial rights, and therefore the court\u2019s order was not appealable under section 1466, subdivision (b)(2). The appellate division further determined no usual or exceptional circumstances existed which warranted treating Gray\u2019s defective appeal as a petition for writ of mandate. Accordingly, the appellate division dismissed Gray\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Gray filed the instant petition for writ of mandate seeking an order directing the appellate division to instruct the trial court to grant his motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Gray contends the appellate division erred by concluding the court\u2019s order denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees was not appealable under section 1466, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>subdivision (b)(2). In the alternative, Gray contends the appellate division abused its discretion by failing to treat his defective appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">A. <em>The Order Denying the Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees Is Not Appealable Under Penal Code Section 1466, subdivision (b)(2).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Gray contends the order denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees is appeal-able under section 1466, subdivision (b)(2), and that therefore the appellate division erred by dismissing his appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">\u201cThe right to appeal is statutory only, and a party may not appeal a trial court\u2019s judgment, order or ruling unless such is expressly made appeal-able by statute.\u201d <em>(People v. Loper </em>(2015) 60 Cal.4th 1155, 1159 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 715, 343 P.3d 895] <em>(Loper).) </em>An appeal by a defendant in a criminal infraction case is governed by section 1466, subdivision (b), which authorizes, as relevant here, an appeal \u201c[f]rom any order made after judgment affecting his or her substantial rights.\u201d (\u00a7 1466, subd. (b)(2).) Citing two civil cases, Gray asserts that \u201ca request for fees by a defendant necessarily entails the substantial rights of the defendant,\u201d and is therefore appealable. But although the authorities Gray cites for that proposition use the phrase \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d they are inapposite here. (See <em>Save Our Residential Environment </em>v. <em>City of West Hollywood </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1745, 1750-1751 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 308] [considering whether \u201c \u2018substantial rights\u2019 \u201d of the litigants would be affected by the court\u2019s decision in order to evaluate mootness]; <em>Flannery v. Prentice </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 572, 596 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 809, 28 P.3d 860] (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.) [referring to cases holding that \u201cparty,\u201d when used in a statute, does not refer to both the party and his or her attorney where \u201c \u2018the substantial rights of the litigants themselves\u2019 \u201d are implicated].) We also find unpersuasive Gray\u2019s analogy to civil cases holding that postjudgment orders awarding or denying attorney\u2019s fees are appealable. As noted, the right to appeal is statutory and the pertinent civil statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(2)) authorizes an appeal from orders made after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>final judgment, irrespective of whether a party\u2019s substantial rights are affected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid, </em>[authorizing appeal from \u201can order made after a judgment made appealable by paragraph (1),\u201d i.e., after a final judgment].) Finally, we reject the People\u2019s contention that the order denying Gray\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is not appealable because Gray is not entitled to <em>recover </em>attorney\u2019s fees, as this circular argument conflating success on the merits with appealability has been resoundingly rejected by the Supreme Court. (See <em>Teal v. Superior Court </em>(2014) 60 Cal.4th 595, 599-601 [179 Cal.Rptr.3d 365, 336 P.3d 686] <em>(Teal).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Thus unaided by the parties, we consider the meaning of \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d as that term is used in section 1466, subdivision (b)(2), and rely in large part upon cases interpreting the similar provision found in section 1237, subdivision (b), which relates to felony appeals. (See \u00a7 1237, subd. (b) [\u201c[a]n appeal may be taken by the defendant . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . [f]rom any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party\u201d].) Unfortunately for our purposes, neither section 1466 nor section 1237 defines \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d Further, and as the Supreme Court recently observed, \u201c[o]ur cases do not provide a comprehensive interpretation of the term \u2018substantial rights\u2019 \u201d as used in these sections. <em>(Loper, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at p. 1161, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">It is plain that a defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d include personal liberty interests. (See, e.g., <em>Loper, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at p. 1161, fn. 3 [holding defendant\u2019s substantial interest in personal liberty implicated by court\u2019s denial of request for compassionate release from prison due to terminal illness]; <em>Teal, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at p. 601 [holding resentencing provision of \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law creates substantial right affecting personal liberty interest]; <em>People v. Coleman </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 867, 871, fn. 1 [120 Cal.Rptr. 384, 533 P.2d 1024] [holding order revoking probation affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Herrera </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1152 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 531], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Cheek </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 894, 903 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 181, 24 P.3d 1204] [holding defendant\u2019s personal liberty interest implicated by denial of request for outpatient release from commitment to mental health department]; see also <em>People v. Totari </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 876, 886-887 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 76, 50 P.3d 781] [holding denial of motion to vacate conviction appealable under \u00a7 1237, subd. (b), because basis of motion was noncitizen defendant\u2019s substantial right to complete advisement of immigration consequences prior to entry of plea].) In addition, a criminal defendant\u2019s obligation to pay victim restitution for losses caused by the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>subd. (b)(13)(A), (B); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4) has been said to affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 282, 286 [187 Cal.Rptr.3d 919, 349 P.3d 98] [\u201c[t]he court\u2019s order of [victim restitution] was appealable, as it was made after judgment and affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights\u201d]; <em>People v. Jennings </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 42, 49 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 709] [indicating postjudgment order denying defendant\u2019s request to reduce victim restitution obligation was appealable under \u00a7 1237, subd. (b)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>DiMora </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1545, 1550 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 616] [noting defendant\u2019s right to appeal order setting amount of victim restitution].)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">By contrast, courts generally do not find a defendant\u2019s substantial rights are implicated when a postjudgment order merely deprives the defendant of personal property. On this point, <em>People v. Tuttle </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 883 [52 Cal.Rptr. 204] (Tuttle) is instructive. There, the defendant was charged and convicted of forgery. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 884.) At the time of his arrest, police confiscated items of the defendant\u2019s personal property, including $726.56 in cash, cartons of cigarettes, and several bottles of liquor. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The prosecution introduced some of these items as exhibits during the trial; the police retained other items. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Following his conviction, the defendant filed a motion seeking to recover his property. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After the trial court denied the motion, the defendant attempted to appeal that decision. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, noting the defendant\u2019s request for return of the exhibits used at trial did \u201cnot affect any substantial right which was a subject of that action. The proceeding resulting in such an order is entirely separate from the criminal proceeding as such because it does not involve in any manner the charge against defendant or his rights as affected by that charge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 885; see also <em>People v. Gershenhorn </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 122, 125 [37 Cal.Rptr. 176] <em>(Gershenhorn) </em>[noting \u201ca motion for return of property is a separate procedure from the criminal trial\u201d and \u201can order of denial [for return of the defendant\u2019s property] is not among any of the matters for which an appeal is provided by section 1237\u201d]; <em>People v. Hopkins </em>(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 305, 308-309 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 744] [following Gershenhorn]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Beck </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1104 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 44] [confirming general rule stated in <em>Tuttle, </em>but holding order denying return of firearms confiscated under former \u00a7 12028, which required proof firearm was used in the commission of a drug-related offense, was appealable because defendant\u2019s due process rights were at issue].)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">The proceeding that produced the order denying Gray\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, like the proceedings in <em>Tuttle </em>and <em>Gershenhorn, </em>was a separate and distinct proceeding from the prosecution of his traffic infraction. Also, Gray sought to recover property\u2014in this case, money\u2014he claimed was rightfully his, like the defendants in <em>Tuttle </em>and <em>Gershenhorn. </em>And in his motion for attorney\u2019s fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Gray did not challenge any aspect of the criminal prosecution, his conviction, the punishment, or the obligations imposed upon him as a result of his conviction, as occurred in the cases holding that the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were at issue. We therefore agree with the appellate division\u2019s conclusion that the denial of a request for attorney\u2019s fees, like the denial of a defendant\u2019s request to recover other personal property, does not affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights within the meaning of section 1466, subdivision (b)(2). Accordingly, the appellate division properly concluded that the court\u2019s order was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">B. <em>The Appellate Division Was Not Required to Treat Gray\u2019s Defective Appeal as a Petition for Extraordinary Relief.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b996-8\">Edmon, P.

Thus, although Gray presents a colorable argument as to why a defendant in a criminal infraction case might, under some limited circumstances, be entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, we do not address the merits of that contention as it is not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b994-6\"> Similarly, we reject Gray\u2019s argument that his attorney has an independent right to appeal the order denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees, as that argument also relies on inapposite civil cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1159.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
