UESF contended that these members-\u2014all of whom had been provided reasonable assurance of continued employment in the fall of 2011\u2014were improperly denied unemployment benefits during the summer of 2011. The petition was successfully opposed below by the District. In a companion appeal, the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB) challenges a separate ruling in favor of the District invalidating a precedent benefit decision that would have permitted public school employees to receive unemployment benefits during summer months provided certain conditions are met. We affirm the lower court as to both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">I. <em>Background and Administrative Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The parties have stipulated to the following facts. UESF is a union that is the exclusive representative of the District\u2019s certificated employees and classified paraprofessional employees. In the academic year 2010-2011, the District employed UESF member Ary eh B. Bernabei and 10 others as substitute teachers who worked on an on-call or as-needed basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District also employed UESF member Celina R. Calvillo and 14 others as paraprofessional classified employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Paraprofessional classified employees are not paid during summer months unless they are retained for a summer session or perform special tasks, such as custodial services. Each of the 26 employees received a letter during the spring of the 2010-2011 school year advising that they had a reasonable assurance of employment for the following 2011-2012 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">The last date District schools operated during the regular session of the</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">2010-2011 school year was May 27, 2011. The first day of instruction for the</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">2011-2012 school year was August 15, 2011. The District operated a summer school session that began on June 9, 2011, and ended on July 7, 2011, for elementary school students and ended on July 14, 2011, for middle and high school students. The District did not offer any instruction between May 27, 2011, and June 9, 2011, or between July 14, 2011, and August 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">The UESF members described above filed claims for unemployment benefits for the period of time between May 27, 2011, and August 15, 2011. The Employment Development Department (EDD) denied benefits to each named claimant. The claimants appealed to a CUIAB administrative law judge (ALJ) who reversed the EDD and held that each claimant was entitled to benefits covering all the weeks for which they had applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">The CUIAB reversed the ALJ\u2019s decisions as to each of the claimants, either in whole or in part.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The CUIAB held that the entire summer session <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>was a \u201crecess period\u201d as defined in Unemployment Insurance Code<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, section 1253.3, subdivision (b), a provision that restricts public school employees\u2019 eligibility for unemployment benefits if they have been given reasonable assurance of continued employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also held, however, that if an individual claimant'had been employed during the 2010 summer session, he or she had a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of employment during the 2011 summer session. Based on this reasoning, the CUIAB held that unemployment benefits could be paid to such employees for days not worked during the 2011 summer school session, but not for the days when school was not actually in session.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">II. <em>Trial Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">On September 6, 2012, UESF filed a first amended petition for writ of administrative mandamus against the CUIAB as respondent and the District as real party in interest. UESF asserted the 2011 summer school session was an \u201cacademic term\u201d under section 1253.3, contending all 26 claimants were eligible for benefits between May 27, 2011, and August 15, 2011, because the District had not provided reasonable assurance of employment for the 2011 summer session, instead providing such assurance for the 2011-2012 academic year that started August 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">On October 26, 2012, the District filed a cross-complaint seeking declaratory relief against both the CUIAB and UESF. The District asserted the CUIAB erroneously determined that employees who receive notices of reasonable assurance of employment for the next academic year or term are nonetheless eligible for summer unemployment benefits by virtue of either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>having worked during the prior summer school session, or having an availability or expectation of procuring work during the current summer session.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">On December 10, 2013, the CUIAB adopted its decision in <em>Alicia K. Brady v. Ontario Montclair School District </em>(2013) CUIAB Precedent Benefit Decision No. P-B-505 <em>(Brady) </em>as a precedent benefit decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Brady, </em>the CUIAB held that substitute teachers who are \u201cqualified and eligible for work\u201d during a school district\u2019s summer school session are not on recess for purposes of section 1253.3 and are eligible for unemployment benefits. <em>(Brady, supra, </em>CUIAB Precedent Benefit Dec. No. P-B-505, at p. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">On January 31, 2014, the District filed a first amended cross-complaint in response to the <em>Brady </em>decision. In addition to maintaining its challenge to the UESF members\u2019 claims by seeking declaratory relief, the District alleged that <em>Brady </em>was wrongly decided and requested the trial court declare the decision invalid under section 409.2.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">On August 15, 2014, the trial court filed its judgment denying UESF\u2019s petition. The court incorporated its statement of decision into the judgment and made an express finding as follows: \u201cThis Court finds that. . . [section] 1253.3 means that unemployment benefits, so long as an employee has the contract or reasonable assurance required by [section] 1253.3, are \u2018not payable to any individual with respect to any week between\u2019 the end of one academic year and the beginning of the next (1) whether that week (or those weeks) is called \u2018summer recess,\u2019 \u2018summer vacation,\u2019 \u2018summer vacation period,\u2019 \u2018summer school,\u2019 \u2018summer session,\u2019 or anything else, (2) whether that individual is any type of employee of any educational institution ... , be she or he any permanent teacher, any substitute teacher, any non-teacher employee, or any other job classification covered by [section] 1253.3, and (3) whether or not any employee in any job classification covered by [section] 1253.3 is \u2018eligible\u2019 or \u2018qualified\u2019 for work, is \u2018on a list,\u2019 has a \u2018reasonable expectation of work\u2019 during the summer, is \u2018available\u2019 for work during the summer, or worked during the prior summer.\u2019 \u201d After so finding, the court reversed the CUIAB\u2019s decisions and remanded them with instructions to find the claimants not eligible for the unemployment benefits requested. The court also invalidated <em>Brady </em>to the extent it is inconsistent with the court\u2019s decision. That ruling is the subject of the CUIAB\u2019s appeal, which has been consolidated with UESF\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">\u201c \u2018Interpretation and applicability of a statute or ordinance is clearly a question of law.\u2019 [Citation.] It is the duty of an appellate court to make the final determination from the undisputed facts and the applicable principles of law.\u201d <em>(Sutco Construction Co. v. Modesto High School Dist. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1220, 1228 [256 Cal.Rptr. 671].) Here, the facts are undisputed and the issues on appeal center on the interpretation of section 1253.3. We therefore apply the de novo standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">II. <em>The Unemployment Insurance Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">\u201cCalifornia\u2019s unemployment insurance program, as promulgated by the Unemployment Insurance Code, is part of a national system of reserves designed to provide insurance for workers \u2018unemployed through no fault of their own, and to reduce involuntary unemployment and the suffering caused thereby to a minimum.\u2019 [Citation.] Under the Unemployment Insurance Code, the state participates in a cooperative unemployment insurance program with the federal government, codified as the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.\u201d <em>(American Federation of Labor v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1017, 1024 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 920 P.2d 1314].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">As currently codified, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311) (FUTA) requires that a state\u2019s unemployment law must contain a provision similar to 26 United States Code section 3304(a)(6)(A)(i),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which prohibits employees of educational institutions from collecting unemployment benefits between and within academic terms; \u201cThe [FUTA] was substantially amended by Public Law No. 94-566, which was enacted by the Congress in 1976. [Citation.] Public Law No. 94-566 amended section 3309(a)(1) of the [FUTA] to extend eligibility for unemployment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>compensation benefits to certain employees of state and local governments within the several states. [Citation.] It also amended section 3304(a) of the [FUTA] to include the corresponding provisions of state law to be exacted of conforming states upon review by the Secretary of Labor. Subsection (6)(A) of section 3304(a) was thus amended to provide in effect that public school employees might be eligible for benefits \u2018except\u2019 in certain instances involving their unemployment during periods of summer recess at the employing schools. Subparagraph (i) of the amended subsection requires in effect that a conforming state <em>must deny eligibility for summertime benefits to a professional school employee </em>(such as a teacher), at any grade level, if there is \u2018a contract\u2019 providing for his or her reemployment in the fall or \u2018reasonable assurance\u2019 of such reemployment. Subparagraph (ii) of the amended subsection provides in effect that a conforming state <em>may deny eligibility for summertime benefits to a nonprofessional school employee </em>at a subcollegiate grade level ... if there is \u2018reasonable assurance\u2019 (only) of his or her reemployment in the fall.\u201d <em>(Russ </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 834, 843 [178 Cal.Rptr. 421], italics added <em>(Russ).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The California Legislature responded to the 1976 amendment to the FUTA by amending section 1253.3: \u201cIn the 1978 enactment which amended section 1253.3 . . . , the California Legislature expressly declared that it was \u2018necessary to implement Public Law 94-566\u2019 [citation]; i.e., that it was \u2018necessary\u2019 to keep the unemployment compensation program of this state in conformity with the [FUTA] as amended in 1976. Consistent with this purpose, the Legislature amended subdivisions (a) and (b) of the statute to incorporate the successively mandatory provisions of the first paragraph of subparagraph (i) of subsection (6)(A) of section 3304(a) of the amended [FUTA]; [and] amended subdivision (c) of the statute to incorporate an optional provision authorized by subparagraph (ii) of the subsection . . . .\u201d <em>(Russ, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.3d at p. 844.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">III. <em>The Superior Court\u2019s 2005 Decision and Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">Preliminarily, the appealing parties note the trial court did not render its decision in a vacuum. On October 1, 2013, UESF filed a request for the court to take judicial notice of a 2005 superior court ruling, <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>California Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(Super. Ct. S.F. City and County, 2005, No. CPF 05-504939), rendered by now-retired Judge James L. Warren. It appears that the court granted the request for judicial notice because it explicitly declined to give the prior ruling res judicata effect. The 2005 case differs from the instant case in that the claimants in the prior case sought unemployment benefits for the period when summer school was in session only, whereas the claimants in the instant case seek benefits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>would cover the entire period between the conclusion of the regular school term of 2010-2011 and the beginning of the regular school term in 2011-2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">In the 2005 case, Judge Warren considered whether to grant a petition for writ of mandate filed by the District against the CUIAB. The CUIAB had found 10 substitute teachers eligible for unemployment insurance benefits after they were unable to obtain work during the six-week summer school term in 2003. In the course of denying the District\u2019s petition, Judge Warren agreed with the CUIAB that the teachers\u2019 period of unemployment did not occur \u201c \u2018between two successive academic years or terms\u2019 \u201d under section 1253.3, subdivision (b) because \u201cin California, there is no gap between successive academic years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Judge Warren noted the Legislature \u201cdid not define the \u2018academic year\u2019 \u201d in section 1253.3. He then observed, \u201c \u2018Year,\u2019 of course, has a common sense meaning of 365 days. Consistent with this common sense meaning, the Legislature has defined a \u2018school year\u2019 as running from July 1 to June 30 . . . .[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] The Legislature has stated that \u2018academic year\u2019 and school year are synonymous in at least some contexts. . . ,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] By contrast, petitioner has not identified any potentially applicable California legislation that defines \u2018academic year\u2019 as something less than a \u2018year.\u2019 In light of these authorities, considering the underlying purposes of the unemployment insurance code as a whole and \u00a7 1253.3(b) in particular, and giving appropriate deference to the CUIAB\u2019s interpretation, the court holds that the CUIAB\u2019s interpretation of \u2018academic year\u2019 is correct.\u201d Judge Warren found the teachers\u2019 period of unemployment \u201cdid not begin \u2018between two consecutive academic terms,\u2019 \u201d concluding that the District\u2019s six-week summer school session was an \u201cacademic term\u201d for purposes of section 1253.3 because \u201ceducational instruction was provided to students\u201d and \u201cat least some teachers were employed to provide that instruction . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">UESF and the CUIAB contend principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel make Judge Warren\u2019s opinion binding on the District. Although the doctrine of collateral estoppel and the concept of res judicata have distinct meanings (see <em>Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines, Inc. </em>(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 134, 179 [180 Cal.Rptr.3d 173] <em>(Union </em>Pacific)),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> both require a strict identity of the issues being litigated <em>(Union Pacific, </em>at p. 179; <em>Kilroy </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 140, 149 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 109]). We note the issues in the 2005 case and the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>are not precisely identical. In the 2005 case, the question was whether the six-weelc summer session constituted an academic term. In the present case, the eligibility question is broader in that it includes the weeks before and after the summer session.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">UESF also contends Judge Warren\u2019s decision is in line with the legislative public policy of \u201cprotecting the unemployed.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It also faults the court below for failing to account for the temporary status of substitute teachers and temporary employees, who, unlike \u201cregular, permanent and probationary certificated and classified employees,\u201d do not have tenure or contracts guaranteeing their return in the fall semester. We conclude the trial court properly declined to give Judge Warren\u2019s ruling res judicata effect. Notably, the 2005 opinion makes no reference to relevant federal law. Federal law, however, is essential to understanding section 1253.3 because, as noted above, this statute was substantially amended in response to the 1976 FUTA legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">A prior determination is not conclusive where the issue is purely a question of law if injustice would result or if the public interest requires relitigation of the issue. <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. v. State Dept. of Education </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 251, 257 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 545, 825 P.2d 438].) As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201cIn <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 51 [266 Cal.Rptr. 139, 785 P.2d 522], we allowed the state to relitigate the issue of whether extension of the state\u2019s unemployment insurance law to include state and local governments constituted a reimbursable state mandate. We noted that the state was the losing party in the earlier litigation and that it was the only entity legally affected by the earlier judgment. \u2018Thus, strict application of collateral estoppel would foreclose any reexamination of the holding of that case. The state would remain bound, and no other person would have occasion to challenge the precedent.\u2019 [Citation.] We observed, however, that \u2018 \u201cwhen the issue is a question of law rather than of fact, the prior determination is not conclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>either if injustice would result or <em>if the public interest requires that relitigation not be </em>foreclosed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Kopp v. Fair Pol. Practices Com. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 607, 621-622 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 108, 905 P.2d 1248].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Applying this rule to the facts, in <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>supra, 50 Cal.3d 51, the Supreme Court concluded; \u201c[T]he consequences of any error transcend those which would apply to mere private parties. If the result of [the earlier litigation] is wrong but unimpeachable, taxpayers statewide will suffer unjustly the consequences of the state\u2019s continuing obligation to fund [the state mandate]. On the other hand, if the state fails to appropriate the funds to meet this obligation, and [the law extending unemployment insurance requirements to local governments] cannot be enforced [citations], the resulting failure to comply with federal law could cost California employers millions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 64-65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Similarly, here the issue to be relitigated involves public funding. An inaccurate interpretation of section 1253.3 might award unemployment benefits to employees who actually fall within the statute\u2019s exclusion. The potential impact of an erroneous statutory interpretation extends beyond San Francisco. All school districts in this state offering summer school programs are potentially affected. A correct reading of section 1253.3 is therefore critical to prevent the misdirection of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">IV. <em>Interpretation of Section 1253.3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">Consistent with the FUTA, section 1253.3 provides that unemployment benefits are <em>not </em>payable to credentialed public school personnel for any week \u201cwhich begins during the period <em>between two successive academic years or terms </em>... if the individual performs services in the first of the academic years or terms <em>and if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance </em>that the individual will perform services for any educational institution in the second of the academic years or terms.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b), italics added.) The companion provision applicable to nonprofessional employees is essentially identical, stating that unemployment benefits are not payable for any week \u201cwhich commences during a period <em>between two successive academic years or terms </em>if the individual performs the service in the first of the academic years or terms <em>and there is a reasonable assurance </em>that the individual will perform the service in the second of the academic years or terms.\u201d (Id., subd. (c), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">The parties dispute the meaning of \u201cacademic years or terms.\u201d The trial court here concluded that the statutory language unambiguously provides that public school employees who are employed in the spring term, and have received reasonable assurance of reemployment for the following fall term, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>are not eligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits during the intervening summer, regardless of whether their school district offers a summer session. As we discuss below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The principles of statutory interpretation are well settled; \u201cPursuant to established principles, our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided. The words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.] Where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation. [Citation.] Both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) \u201cIf the words of the statute are clear, the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.\u201d <em>(People v.

Since [its members] were not given reasonable assurance of employment in the summer session, the letters that they did receive were not sufficient for the purpose of denying them unemployment benefits during their unemployment in the summer.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> UESF maintains that none of its members were ever on summer vacation, but instead were \u201csimply unemployed and hoping to return to their jobs.\u201d It claims the CUIAB took inconsistent positions in the 26 cases, asserting the CUIAB \u201cshould have acknowledged that the summer session is an academic term for all employees, not merely for employees who had worked in the previous summer session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">The CUIAB took a more nuanced approach, finding that if an individual was not called to work during the summers of 2010 and 2011, the entire 2011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>summer period was a \u201cnormal . . . recess period\u201d as to that individual and they were not entitled to benefits. And even if a claimant had a reasonable expectation of summer work, such as by virtue of having worked during the prior summer, he or she was not eligible for benefits during the weeks between the end of the summer session and the beginning of the fall term, which the CUIAB deemed a \u201crecess period.\u201d However, the CUIAB did allow benefits during summer school sessions for those teachers in whom the District had \u201ccreated an expectation of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Observing neither Congress nor the Legislature makes reference to summer school in the relevant statutes, UESF submits they \u201cneither intended that summer school be considered an academic term nor that summer session was not an academic term.\u201d UESF asserts it is our task to \u201cdetermine how summer session must be treated under the existing statutory structure.\u201d We decline this invitation; \u201cThe role of the courts is not to legislate or to rewrite the law, but to interpret what is before them.\u201d <em>(Fair v. Fountain Valley School Dist. </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 180, 187 [153 Cal.Rptr. 56].) In our view, neither UESF\u2019s nor the CUIAB\u2019s positions are consistent with the language and purpose of section 1253.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">We conclude summer school is not an \u201cacademic term\u201d within the meaning of section 1253.3\u2019s reference to \u201cacademic years or terms.\u201d Both UESF\u2019s and the CUIAB\u2019s interpretations of section 1253.3 are contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. The CUIAB asserts that because \u201cacademic year\u201d is not defined in the statute, it must be given its \u201cordinary and usual meaning.\u201d It is true that while the term \u201cschool year\u201d is defined in the Education Code as a 365-day period (see Ed. Code, \u00a7 37200 [\u201cThe school year begins on the first day of July and ends on the last day of June.\u201d]), there is no corresponding definition of \u201cacademic year.\u201d However, \u201cordinary meaning\u201d in this context is best derived from the Education Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">As the District notes, the Education Code establishes a mandatory period of instruction of no fewer than 175 days. The term \u201cacademic year\u201d is used in a provision relating to the calendaring for year-round schools: \u201cThe teaching sessions and vacation periods established pursuant to Section 37618 shall be established without reference to the school year as defined in Section 37200. The schools and classes shall be conducted for a total of no fewer than 175 days <em>during the academic year.\u201d </em>(Ed. Code, \u00a7 37620, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">As pointed out by amicus curiae the California School Boards Association\u2019s education legal alliance (ELA), the State Department of Education (CDE)\u2014the regulatory body charged with interpreting and enforcing the Education Code\u2014treats the traditional academic calendar to mean the period when school is regularly in session for all students, and does not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>summer or summer school.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Further, during the academic year, the Legislature has provided for compulsory education laws that mandate public schools to provide instruction, and that allow certificated employees to receive credit toward permanent status. (See, e.g., Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 37620, 41420, 48200, 44913.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In contrast, historically, offering summer school has been permissive, attendance voluntary, and permanent employment status has not accrued. (Ed. Code, former \u00a7 37252.) Additionally, as the trial court noted in its statement of decision, when the FUTA was enacted, summer school sessions held between academic years were already a common feature. If Congress had intended to allow for the recovery of benefits during the summer, it could have explicitly so indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">Treating an intervening summer session as an \u201cacademic term\u201d also renders the reasonable assurance language in section 1253.3 meaningless and inoperable. The term \u201cacademic year\u201d cannot reasonably be read to mean \u201ccalendar year\u201d or otherwise include the summer period between mandatory academic terms. As the trial court noted, \u201cIf the \u2018academic year\u2019 truly ran the entire calendar year . . . , a \u2018period between two successive academic years\u2019 could never exist.\u201d Because such a reading would render the phrase \u201cperiod between two successive academic years\u201d meaningless, it is to be disfavored. In sum, we conclude summer sessions are not academic terms and instead fall between academic years or terms under section 1253.3. The trial court thus correctly ruled that none of the claimants here were eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">V. <em>The Majority of Other Jurisdictions Are in Accord</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Other jurisdictions considering virtually identical statutory provisions have reached the same conclusion as we do here. As our courts have recognized, where state unemployment insurance codes mirror the federal law and each other, \u201c \u2018the interpretation placed upon that language by federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>other courts is unusually persuasive . . . \u201d <em>(Board of Education v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 674, 686 [206 Cal.Rptr. 788] <em>(Long Beach).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">In <em>In re Claim of Lintz </em>(N.Y.App.Div. 1982) 89 A.D.2d 1038, 1039 [454 N.Y.S.2d 346] <em>(Lintz), </em>the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division addressed our same issue: \u201cThe [unemployment insurance] board\u2019s holding that because claimant chose to teach two days a week during a five-week summer session she was \u2018not between academic terms\u2019 and, therefore, eligible, is both irrational and unreasonable and thwarts the clear legislative intent. The law was . . . not enacted to supplement the income of a regularly employed teacher who chose to teach a few days during her regular summer vacation while awaiting the commencement of the next academic year for which she had unquestioned assurance of employment.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">The Oregon appellate courts have also concluded the term \u201cacademic year\u201d does not include summer school sessions: \u201cWe conclude that \u2018academic year\u2019 . . . means the traditional fall-through-spring sessions of an educational institution. The fact that claimant worked in the summer of 1981 and hoped to work in the summer of 1982 and the fact that the University operated on a limited basis during summer terms do not preclude this conclusion. That an employe[e] of an educational institution may choose to work during what is traditionally vacation time does not make it a part of the academic year, and an abbreviated summer session can and regularly does co-exist with a traditional academic year. [The unemployment board] correctly determined that claimant\u2019s summer suspension of work constituted ... a period between academic years.\u201d <em>(Friedlander v. Employment Division </em>(1984) 66 Ore.App. 546 [676 P.2d 314, 318].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">Also, in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security </em>(1991) 211 Ill.App.3d 1070 [156 Ill.Dec. 336, 570 N.E.2d 812, 819], the Illinois appellate court held that a college professor\u2019s \u201cemployment or lack of employment during the summer months is irrelevant [in determining eligibility] because the applicable Federal and State statutes [citations] were designed to address the common academic practice of instructors not teaching during the summer months.\u201d More recently, the Hawaii Court of Appeals held: \u201c[A] substitute teacher who teaches during the regular school year is not eligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>unemployment benefits during the summer break even when one or more summer school substitute teaching positions was or were available and unsuccessfully sought.\u201d <em>(Harker v.

No. 21 </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1984) 216 Neb. 191 [342 N.W.2d 665].) The court considered whether two successive six-week summer school sessions were \u201c \u2018regular terms\u2019 \u201d under that state\u2019s unemployment laws, such as to exclude benefits during the 46 weeks falling between those two periods. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 667.) The school district argued that the summer session was a \u201c \u2018regular term\u2019 \u201d and asserted the teacher was disqualified for benefits between those terms because she had a reasonable assurance she would perform services during the following summer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 668.) The court held that the teacher was entitled to benefits because her period of unemployment did not occur between two successive years or terms. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In sum, we concur with the majority of out-of-state jurisdictions that in the context of a traditional school year, the terms \u201cacademic year\u201d and \u201cacademic term\u201d exclude summer sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">VI. Brady <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">It follows that we concur with the trial court\u2019s decision to invalidate <em>Brady, supra, </em>CUIAB Precedent Benefit Decision No. P-B-505. In <em>Brady, </em>the CUIAB held that when a school district deems a claimant qualified and eligible for work during a summer school session, he or she is also eligible for unemployment benefits because the claimant is not on recess during that period. We conclude the trial court properly invalided this aspect of <em>Brady </em>in ruling on the District\u2019s separate action, initiated pursuant to section 409.2. \u201c[E]ven though a court will give great weight to the agency\u2019s view of a statute or regulation, the reviewing court construes the statutes as a matter of law and will reject administrative interpretations where they are contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>statutory intent.\u201d <em>(American Federation of Labor v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 51, 58 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">For example, in <em>Long Beach, supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d 674, the appellate court upheld a superior court ruling invalidating a CUIAB precedent decision under section 409.2. <em>(Long Beach, </em>at p. 682.) In that case, the CUIAB had relied \u201con the tenuous impermanent nature\u201d of a substitute teacher\u2019s employment in finding he did not have reasonable assurance of continued employment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The appellate court observed: \u201cThere is nothing in section 1253.3 which sets as a criteria the tenuous nature of a substitute teacher\u2019s position as a basis for determining the \u2018reasonable assurance\u2019 issue.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 683.) Similarly, in the present case, there is nothing in section 1253.3 suggesting any exceptions to the rule that school employees who receive reasonable assurance of continued employment are not entitled to unemployment benefits between the spring and fall academic terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">The practical effect of the <em>Brady </em>decision would assure that employees who place themselves on an on-call list for summer but who, like permanent staff generally, do not actually work during that summer, will recover unemployment benefits. Both sets of employees are not working, yet under <em>Brady </em>one group is eligible for unemployment benefits while the other is not. Section 1253.3 does not make any exceptions for employees who choose to make themselves available for summer work, and we decline to read such an exception into the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">The CUIAB itself acknowledges that in enacting the FUTA Congress \u201chad envisioned that many public school teachers would be employed from Fall through Spring, and on recess during the summer. Congress did not wish to award these employees a double-payment\u2014one for their usual salary paid throughout the whole year and another for unemployment benefits in the summer.\u201d Yet the CUIAB\u2019s construction of 1253.3 would accomplish just that. Under its rationale, teachers with an expectation of obtaining work during the summer session would be entitled to unemployment benefits if they were not hired (or if they were hired but not retained for the entire summer session). However, those same teachers would not be \u201c \u2018unemployed\u2019 in the sense of being attached to the general labor force which is seeking other employment on a permanent basis\u201d <em>(Long Beach, supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d at p. 690, fn. 7.) As the <em>Long Beach </em>court observed: \u201c \u2018Plainly and simply stated, teachers [including substitute teachers] between academic terms or semesters are not unemployed. They are on vacation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 688.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">The CUIAB also contends that \u201cthe meaning [of academic year], in a particular district, is a question of fact.\u201d In other words, districts that opt to offer summer school can define \u201cacademic year\u201d differently from districts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>do not. We agree with the ELA that the CUIAB\u2019s position \u201cturns statutory construction and the enforcement of laws on their head.\u201d While the application of a law to different factual situations may produce varying results, the meaning of statutory language must exist as a constant. (15) In our view, both Congress and the Legislature intended that all school employees who understand their regular employment will occur during the fall and spring terms are not entitled to benefits during the summer break. That some school districts may offer separate summer employment opportunities to certain of their workers does not alter this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">We are not unsympathetic to the loss of wages incurred during periods of academic hiatus. However, in effect what the claimants in this case are requesting is that the government should provide them with a full year\u2019s income because they have agreed to work and be paid for only 41 weeks of each year. As one court has explained, \u201cThe rationale for this limitation [on benefits] is that school employees can plan for those periods of unemployment and thus are not experiencing the suffering from unanticipated layoffs that the employment-security law was intended to alleviate.\u201d <em>(Baker v. Department of Employment &amp; Training Bd. of Review </em>(R.I. 1994) 637 A.2d 360, 363.) This rationale \u201cpromotes reasonable public policy interests, but if there are other policy concerns that now advise the adoption of a different rule, it is up to the Legislature to craft one.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Davis </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 846, 865 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 835, 352 P.3d 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1062-8\">Margulies, Acting P.
