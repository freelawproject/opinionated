Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced to 86 years in state prison. On appeal, he claims that (1). the convictions are not supported by substantial evidence because the evidence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>trial did not link each act of abuse to a particular one of the specific one-year periods alleged in the second amended information, (2) there is not substantial evidence of force or duress, (3) the trial court prejudicially erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements to the police, (4) the trial court prejudicially erred in admitting expert testimony about child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome (CSAAS), and (5) there are clerical errors in the abstract of judgment and minutes that must be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The Attorney General concedes that the errors in the abstract and minutes must be corrected, and we agree. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that specific charged acts occurred during each of the one-year periods alleged in the information since the information alleged only that the acts occurred \u201con or about\u201d each of those periods. In the unpublished portions of the opinion, we reject the remainder of defendant\u2019s contentions. Consequently, we affirm the judgment and order the abstract and minutes corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In 2012, Jane Doe told her mother that defendant, her father, had sexually abused her, and her mother confronted defendant. Defendant admitted the abuse and told Jane\u2019s mother that \u201che needed help and he didn\u2019t know why he had done it. . . .\u201d The abuse stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">On May 8, 2013, Jane\u2019s mother called 911 after defendant became \u201cvery drunk and he got very aggressive.\u201d A deputy from the San Benito County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to the \u201cdomestic disturbance\u201d call. The deputy spoke with Jane, and she told him that defendant had touched her private parts from the time she was five years old until she was 10 years old. The deputy contacted San Benito County child protective services (CPS). After speaking with Jane, the CPS worker removed her from the home and contacted the Watsonville police, as the touchings had not occurred in San Benito County.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">On May 10, 2013, two Watsonville police officers went to the San Benito County CPS offices and met with defendant there. While they were meeting with defendant, another police officer was interviewing Jane, who had been brought by CPS to the police department in Watsonville. Defendant admitted that he had sexually abused Jane, and Jane provided details of the abuse to the police. Although defendant admitted to just a few incidents of nonforcible abuse and insisted that they occurred in a single one-year period in Chow-chilla, Jane told the police about years of forcible abuse that began in Mexico when she was five years old and continued in Chowchilla and Watsonville until she was 10 years old. Defendant was arrested at the end of his police interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The second amended information charged defendant with 16 counts. Four counts were charged for each one-year period beginning with September 2007 through September 2008 and ending with September 2010 through September 2011. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all 16 counts, and the court committed defendant to state prison for a term of 86 years. Defendant timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Defendant contends that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the 16 counts on which he was convicted. He also contends that there was insufficient evidence of force or duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">1. Jane\u2019s Police Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Jane told the police that defendant had begun touching her vagina when she was five years old and they were living in Mexico.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There were a couple of touchings in Mexico.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the family moved to Chowchilla, defendant continued to abuse her, and there were a lot of incidents of abuse in Chowchilla. While they were in Chowchilla, defendant touched her vagina and showed her his penis. He perpetrated the abuse when her mother was cooking, taking a shower, or washing clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The family moved to Watsonville while Jane was in second grade, and the abuse got worse and continued when she was in third grade and fourth grade. The abuse was frequent in Watsonville; it happened almost every time her mother took a shower. Her mother took a shower every couple of days. Jane estimated that the abuse happened about 200 times in Watsonville when she was in second, third, and fourth grades. Defendant would not only touch her private parts, but he would also grab her hand and \u201cmake\u201d her touch his penis when they were in the car together. Three times he forced her to touch his penis by grabbing her hand and putting it on his penis. It was in Watsonville that he began putting his penis on her vagina. He would pull her pants down, push her onto a bed or the floor, pull his pants down, get on top of her, and put his penis on her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">During these incidents of abuse, defendant would grab Jane\u2019s hands really hard so that she would not move; this hurt her. A couple of times he covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>her mouth so that she could not scream. He also told her not to scream or he would do something to her mother, and he threatened to hurt her mother if she did not permit him to abuse her.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In 2012, when Jane was 10 years old, she told her mother about defendant\u2019s abuse. Jane\u2019s mother confronted defendant, and he admitted the abuse. He stopped abusing Jane.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">2. Jane\u2019s Trial Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Jane was a very reluctant witness at trial. Asked whether defendant had abused her in Mexico, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Jane explained that she thought defendant \u201cis a good dad,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want him to be in jail. . . .\u201d Nevertheless, she confirmed that she had told the truth to the police during her May 2013 interview and during a subsequent interview a couple of months later. Jane intermittently exhibited reluctance to testify about the abuse: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk no more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Jane testified at trial that she came to the United States and moved to Chowchilla when she was six years old. The family subsequently moved to Watsonville. Jane confirmed that defendant had touched her vagina, displayed his penis to her, put his penis on her vagina, and forced her to touch his penis. She recalled one or two incidents in Watsonville where defendant forced her to touch his penis in the car. Jane recounted that the touchings occurred both lying down and standing up. Jane could not remember how many times defendant abused her in Chowchilla. She did remember that the abuse in Chowchilla occurred when her mother was cooking or in the bathroom. Once, she could not remember at what location, defendant touched her chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Although she said she did not remember how many times defendant had touched her, she recalled telling the police that it was about 200 times. However, she testified that she now thought that \u201cit wasn\u2019t that much.\u201d Jane remembered telling the police that the abuse had begun in Mexico when she was five years old, but on cross-examination she said that the event in Mexico was just defendant trying to touch her, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t let him</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Jane confirmed that in Watsonville defendant would \u201cgrab my hands really hard so I couldn\u2019t move\u201d or \u201cget away.\u201d This \u201churt.\u201d Sometimes he would lie on top of her and cover her mouth so that she could not scream. He told her not to tell anyone about the abuse. However, Jane testified that defendant had never told her that he was going to do something to her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">On cross-examination, Jane testified that there were just three instances of abuse in Chowchilla, and defendant did not hold her down or threaten her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>when he abused her in Chowchilla. However, she also testified that he would \u201cgrab my hand\u201d in Chowchilla. She reiterated that he had held her down when he abused her in Watsonville. She also testified on cross-examination that there were at least five instances of abuse in Watsonville. But she testified both that he held her down every time and that he held her down just once or twice and did not threaten her.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">3.Defendant\u2019s Admissions</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">During his police interview, defendant admitted that he had sexually abused Jane five times in Chowchilla and two or three times in Watsonville. In Chowchilla, Jane had touched his erect penis once while her mother was in the shower; twice he had touched her vagina with his hand; and twice he had placed his penis over her vagina. In Watsonville, defendant two or three times put his penis on Jane\u2019s vagina while her mother was in the shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">4.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Our standard of review is well established. \u201c \u2018[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738], quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781].) \u201c[The] appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Reilly </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 421, 425 [90 Cal.Rptr. 417, 475 P.2d 649]; accord, <em>People v. Pensinger </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1210, 1237 [278 Cal.Rptr. 640, 805 P.2d 899].) \u201cEvidence is sufficient to support a conviction only if it is substantial, that is, if it \u2018 \u201creasonably inspires confidence\u201d \u2019 [citation], and is \u2018credible and of solid value.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Raley </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 870, 891 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 678, 830 P.2d 712].)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">5.Time Periods</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Defendant claims that his convictions are not supported by substantial evidence because \u201cit is virtually impossible to determine which of the alleged acts he committed\u201d \u201cduring each one year period.\u201d He asserts that the evidence presented at trial did not satisfy the requirements of <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643] <em>(Jones).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">In <em>Jones, </em>the six counts at issue each charged one event in a different two-month period. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 303.) The victim of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>counts testified that the abuse occurred once or twice a month during the charged periods. <em>(Jones, </em>at p. 301.) The California Supreme Court held that the victim\u2019s generic testimony constituted substantial evidence supporting these six convictions. \u201c[I]n determining the sufficiency of generic testimony, we must focus on factors other than the youth of the victim/witness. Does the victim\u2019s failure to specify precise date, time, place or circumstance render generic testimony insufficient? Clearly not. As many of the cases make clear, the particular details surrounding a child molestation charge are not elements of the offense and are unnecessary to sustain a conviction. [Citations.] [\u00b6] The victim, of course, must describe <em>the kind of act or acts committed </em>with sufficient specificity, both to assure that unlawful conduct indeed has occurred and to differentiate between the various types of proscribed conduct (e.g., lewd conduct, intercourse, oral copulation or sodomy). Moreover, the victim must describe the <em>number of acts </em>committed with sufficient certainty to support each of the counts alleged in the information or indictment (e.g., \u2018twice a month\u2019 or \u2018every time we went camping\u2019). Finally, the victim must be able to describe <em>the general time period </em>in which these acts occurred (e.g., \u2018the summer before my fourth grade,\u2019 or \u2018during each Sunday morning after he came to live with us\u2019), to assure the acts were committed within the applicable limitation period. Additional details regarding the time, place or circumstance of the various assaults may assist in assessing the credibility or substantiality of the victim\u2019s testimony, but are not essential to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>(Jones, </em>at pp. 315-316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The <em>Jones </em>court also separately addressed whether the victim\u2019s generic testimony violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 316.) First, it held that reliance on generic evidence did not violate a defendant\u2019s due process right to notice. \u201cWe conclude that, given the availability of the preliminary hearing, demurrer and pretrial discovery procedures, the prosecution of child molestation charges based on generic testimony does not, of itself, result in a denial of a defendant\u2019s due process right to fair notice of the charges against him.\u201d <em>{Jones, </em>at p. 318.) Second, the court concluded that reliance on generic testimony did not deprive a defendant of his or her due process right to present a defense. <em>(Jones, </em>at pp. 319-320.) Finally, the court held that a defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict was ensured by unanimity instructions. <em>(Jones, </em>at p. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Defendant contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions on the first eight counts because the evidence did not link the acts of abuse to the time periods alleged in the second amended information for those counts. The second amended information, which was the operative pleading at trial, alleged that each set of four counts occurred \u201c[o]n or about or between\u201d a one-year period corresponding to Jane\u2019s ages of six, seven, eight, and nine. The first four counts were alleged to have occurred when Jane was six years old, and the second four counts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>alleged to have occurred when Jane was seven years old. Jane testified at trial that she was born in September 2001. Jane and her mother both testified at trial that the family moved to Chowchilla from Mexico when Jane was six years old. In defendant\u2019s statement to the police, which was admitted into evidence at trial, he told the police that the family moved to Chowchilla when Jane\u2019s younger sister was seven months old. Jane\u2019s mother testified that Jane\u2019s younger sister was born in late July 2007. Hence, they moved to Chowchilla in February or March 2008, when Jane was six and a half years old. Jane testified that she was six or seven years old when they lived in Chowchilla, and her mother testified that the family lived in Chowchilla for \u201c[m]ore than a year and a half.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This evidence established that Jane lived in Chowchilla for all or nearly all of the year when she was seven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The first four counts charged a period that included only approximately the first seven months of the \u201c[m]ore than a year and a half\u2019 that the family lived in Chowchilla. The second four counts charged a period during which the family lived primarily in Chowchilla, but possibly lived in Watsonville toward the end of the period. As a result, the Chowchilla events of abuse were spread over the time periods charged in both the first and second sets of four counts. No evidence was presented by the prosecution distinguishing between events of abuse during the one-year period when Jane was six years old and living in Chowchilla (Sept. 2007 to Sept. 2008) and events of abuse during the one-year period when Jane was seven years old and still living in Chowchilla (after Sept. 2008). The only evidence of the total number of events of abuse that occurred while they lived in Chowchilla was Jane\u2019s statement to the police that there were \u201ca lot\u201d of incidents of abuse in Chowchilla and defendant\u2019s admission that there were five events of abuse in Chowchilla. Neither Jane\u2019s statement nor defendant\u2019s admission distinguished between the two periods of time. Jane also did not give any statements or testimony about the frequency of the abuse in Chowchilla.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Defendant argues that reversal of these eight counts is required due to insufficiency of the evidence because the evidence did not permit a determination of \u201chow many acts occurred during each one year period.\u201d The Attorney General contends that it was not necessary for the prosecution to present evidence that the number of acts charged during a specific one-year time period actually occurred during that one-year time period. She contends that file prosecution was required to show only that all of the acts occurred during the applicable limitations period. In her view, the prosecution\u2019s failure to show that four acts occurred while Jane was six years old and four acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>occurred while Jane was seven years old, as charged in the second amended information, was merely a \u201cvariance between the pleading and the proof\u2019 that defendant forfeited by failing to object on that basis below and that would not in any event establish insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Defendant did not forfeit this contention. He demurred on due process grounds to the first amended information\u2019s use of one-year periods without otherwise distinguishing between the counts. The prosecution responded that it was enough for the information to allege that the offenses occurred during the applicable limitations period. His demurrer was overruled. Defendant also filed a section 995 motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence presented at the preliminary examination to support the first eight counts. He claimed that the evidence was insufficient to show that four counts occurred when Jane was six years old or that four counts occurred when she was seven years old. His motion was denied. Since defendant demurred on this ground and brought a section 995 motion on this ground, we cannot credit the Attorney General\u2019s suggestion that defendant\u2019s contention was not \u201cpreserved\u201d because he failed to bring it up below.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Defendant claims that the evidence is insufficient to support the first eight counts because no evidence linked particular acts of abuse to those specific one-year periods. Such evidence was not required. \u201cThe precise time at which the offense was committed need not be stated in the accusatory pleading, but it may be alleged to have been committed at any time before the finding or filing thereof, except where the time is a material ingredient in the offense.\u201d (\u00a7 955.) \u201cThe law is clear that, when it is charged that an offense was committed \u2018on or about\u2019 a named date, the exact date need not be proved unless the time \u2018is a material ingredient in the offense\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 955), and the evidence is not insufficient merely because it shows that the offense was committed on another date.\u201d <em>(People v. Starkey </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 822, 827 [44 Cal.Rptr. 738]; accord, <em>People v. Peyton </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 642, 660 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 243].) Time was not a \u201cmaterial ingredient\u201d (\u00a7 955) in any of the offenses. And <em>Jones </em>says nothing inconsistent with these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The premise for defendant\u2019s contention is nothing more than a pleading error. The second amended information alleged the counts by reference to one-year periods corresponding to Jane\u2019s age at the time of the events, but the evidence at trial did not distinguish between the acts of abuse by reference to one-year periods or to Jane\u2019s age at the time of the events. The evidence at trial distinguished between the events only by reference to whether they occurred in Chowchilla or in Watsonville. This pleading error did not render the evidence insufficient because the second amended information used \u201con or about\u201d in reference to these one-year periods, making it unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>establish when the offenses actually occurred. The jury was not obligated to match the counts to one-year periods. Indeed, it was instructed that \u201c[t]he People are not required to prove that the crime took place exactly on that day but only that it happened reasonably close to that day.\u201d The jury was also given a proper unanimity instruction that permitted it to convict defendant of all of the charged counts if \u201c[y]ou all agree that the People have proved that the defendant committed all the acts alleged to have occurred during this time period and have proved that the defendant committed at least the number of offenses charged.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The evidence at trial established that there were far more than 16 events of abuse that occurred during the four-year period encompassed by the counts charged in the information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the jury could have concluded that defendant committed all of the acts Jane described, which was far more than 16, and reached a unanimous verdict on that basis, the incongruence between the dates alleged in the second amended information and the evidence produced at trial was immaterial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">6. Force and Duress</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show that he used force or duress to perpetrate the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">\u201c \u2018[D]uress as used in the context of section 288 [means] a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, <em>hardship </em>or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to (1) perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed or, (2) acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Leal </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1004 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 869, 94 P.3d 1071].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>\u201cA defendant uses \u2018force\u2019 if the prohibited act is facilitated by the defendant\u2019s use of physical violence, compulsion or constraint against the victim other than, or in addition to, the physical contact which is inherent in the prohibited act.\u201d <em>(People v. Bolander </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 155, 163 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 365] (cone. opn. of Mihara, J.) <em>(Bolander); </em>accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Soto </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 229, 242 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 245 P.3d 410].) \u201c[A]n act is forcible if force facilitated the act rather than being merely incidental to the act.\u201d <em>(Bolander, </em>at pp. 164-165.) \u201c[A]cts of grabbing, holding and restraining that occur in conjunction with the lewd acts themselves\u201d are sufficient to support a finding that the lewd act was committed by means of force. <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 999, 1005 [101 Cal.Rptr.3d 169].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Defendant used duress by means of threats to facilitate his abuse of Jane. During the earliest acts of abuse in Mexico, when Jane was five years old, defendant \u201cwould always tell me that he was gonna do something to my mom if I didn\u2019t let him do something to me.\u201d This threat made Jane \u201cscared,\u201d and she had dreams about defendant \u201ckilling my mom.\u201d Defendant continued to make similar threats. He warned her not to scream or he would \u201cdo somethin\u2019 to my mom.\u201d Because of these threats, Jane \u201clet him do whatever he wanted to because I was really nervous he was gonna do something to my mom.\u201d Jane\u2019s decision to disclose the abuse came about because she \u201cgot tired of my dad telling me that he was gonna do something to my family.\u201d Defendant also repeatedly used force to perpetrate much of his abuse of Jane. He grabbed her hands so hard that it hurt in order to keep her from moving while he touched her vagina. He forced her to touch his penis by grabbing her hand and placing it on his penis. Defendant was able to place his penis on Jane\u2019s vagina only because he had \u201cpush[ed]\u201d Jane down on the floor and gotten on top of her. Although Jane attempted to push him off of her, she was unsuccessful because he \u201cwouldn\u2019t get up.\u201d Defendant also covered her mouth to keep her from screaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Defendant\u2019s threats to harm Jane\u2019s mother were plainly sufficient to cause a reasonable person to permit acts of abuse that she would not otherwise have permitted. After defendant had repeatedly threatened to harm Jane\u2019s mother, all of his subsequent acts of abuse were facilitated by the duress engendered by these threats. The fact that he also grabbed, held, and restrained Jane during many of the acts of abuse further supported the jury\u2019s verdicts. In light of the many acts that occurred in Watsonville and the jury\u2019s implicit finding that all of the acts alleged occurred, it is irrelevant whether all of the Chowchilla acts were committed by force or duress. Substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings that defendant\u2019s acts of abuse came within the provisions of section 288, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>B.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAlI\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">IV.

[\u00b6] September 28, 2007 and September 27, 2008 = Counts 1-4 [\u00b6] September 28, 2008 and September 27, 2009 = Counts 5-8 [\u00b6] September 28, 2009 and September 27, 2010 = Counts 9-12 [\u00b6] September 28, 2010 and September 27, 2011 = Counts 13-16 [\u00b6] The People have presented evidence of more than one act to prove that the defendant committed these offenses.

This claim fails for the same reason that the claim as to the first eight counts fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-10\">See footnote, ante, page 1013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b855-7\">GROVER, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A5T\">I concur in the judgment but respectfully depart from some of the majority\u2019s reasoning in the published portion of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his 16 convictions for committing a forcible lewd act on a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)) because the second amended information alleged that the acts occurred within specified one-year increments (coinciding with the victim\u2019s birthday), but none of the acts was proven at trial to have actually occurred within any of those periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">I agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation and application of <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643], <em>People </em>v. <em>Peyton </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 642 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 243], and <em>People v. Starkey </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 822 [44 Cal.Rptr. 738], and that the precise date was not a \u201cmaterial ingredient\u201d of the charged offenses. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 955, 288, subd. (b).) However, I do not share the view that defendant\u2019s claim of insufficient evidence is premised on pleading error. I believe the issue is more accurately described as arising from a variance between pleading and proof. As such, the critical question is whether \u201cthe variance was of such a substantial character as to have misled\u201d defendant.in preparing his defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 57, 59 [4 Cal.Rptr. 158, 351 P.2d 326] [\u201cAn accused should be advised of the charge against him in order that he may have a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present his defense.\u201d].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>In arguing insufficiency of the evidence based on a variance between the operative charging document and proof at trial, defendant has shown neither the materiality of specific dates nor inadequate notice of the crimes alleged. I therefore reach the same conclusion as the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 14, 2016, S235830.</p>\n<judges id=\"AKa\">Corrigan, J., did not participate therein.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
