He was sentenced as a second felony offender to concurrent prison terms of 2 to 4 years for each count of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree, one year for each count of reckless endangerment in the second degree, 2 to 4 years for criminal mischief in the second degree, 31/a to 7 years for each count of burglary in the third degree, <em>71h </em>to 15 years for burglary in the second degree and 10 to 20 years for burglary in the first degree. Given the pervasiveness of defendant\u2019s activities and his extensive criminal record, we do not find that the sentence imposed was harsh or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Cardona, P. J., White, Casey, Peters and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
