Petitioner\u2019s assertion that his termination was made in bad faith because based on threats by the victim\u2019s family of a civil suit is unsupported. Nor can bad faith be inferred from petitioner\u2019s claims that petitioner was terminated after the victim\u2019s family complained to respondent Department. We have considered petitioner\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Concur\u2014Murphy, P. J., Rubin, Kupferman, Asch and Nardelli, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
