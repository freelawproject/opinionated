The two cases were consolidated for trial and tried April 30, 1931. A number of questions are raised in appellant\u2019s brief, all of which have been examined and all of which are without merit. Appellant\u2019s guilt is apparent from the record, and no prejudicial error was committed in the trial. The appeals are frivolous and evidently taken merely for delay. The judgments of the trial court are affirmed, and it is directed that mandates issue at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
