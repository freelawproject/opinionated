One of these patents covered a special design of truck for use in creosoting railroad ties, and the other a roller bearing assembly for the axles of such trucks. Neither patented device was used by the Timken Roller Bearing Company. The contention is that the petitioner was compelled to forego the prosecution of actions for infringement because practically all infring-ers (the railroads) were users of Timken bearings and such suits would therefore have antagonized customers and possibly have been detrimental to the business of his employer; that this fact was taken into consideration by his employer in fixing the amount of the annual bonus for each year in question; that the patent situation was thus instrumental in the production of income; and that the patents themselves must therefore be regarded as used in the petitioner\u2019s business as an executive of the Timken Roller Bearing Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">The Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, \u00a7 214(a)(8), permit the deduction of an allowance for exhaustion only \u201cof property used in the trade or business\u201d of the taxpayer. 43 Stat. 253, c. 234, 44 Stat. 9, c. 27, 26 USCA \u00a7 955(a)(8). While there may he' serious doubt whether the petitioner, as a salaried executive, was engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d within the meaning of the act [Cf. Hughes v. Commissioner, 33 F.(2d) 755 (C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>C. A. 10); Refling v. Commissioner, 47 F.(2d) 859 (C. C. A. 8); Ames v. Commissioner, 49 F.(2d) 853 (C. C. A. 8)], we do not consider it necessary to determine this point. It seems obvious to us that, whether he was or was not so engaged, the patents were not \u201cused in\u201d that business. Only that which is directly employed in carrying on a trade or business falls within the statutory definition. To abstain from use cannot be considered as the equivalent of use. To \u201cuse\u201d is an active verb; the position of the petitioner was entirely passive. It is true that his inaction possibly may have redounded to his financial benefit, by placing him in better grace with his employer, or it may have been a condition precedent to the continuance of his employment; but the patents were not a means by which this service to his employer was rendered, and can not be considered, as used in the performance of those duties from which they were entirely distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
