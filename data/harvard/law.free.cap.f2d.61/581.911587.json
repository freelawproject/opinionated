The error assigned is the refusal of the trial .court to direct a verdict in favor of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">There was substantial evidence that at the tima of the trial, and as early as Oeto-ber 7, 1930, the plaintiff was suffering from severe bronchial asthma associated with tremendous difficulty in breathing, particularly on the slightest exercise. Dr. Staub testified, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have any more severe bronchitis and asthma than ho has and be able to walk about\u201d; that walking thirty-five to forty feet from his reception room to the examining room \u201cput his heart to pounding and shortness of breath.\u201d The contention of the appellant is that there is no substantial evidence that this condition began before the policy lapsed on July 31, 1919. The expert witnesses who testified for the plaintiff stated that his condition was a progressive one. Dr. Rush, who examined the plaintiff in 1930 and testified on his behalf, stated, \u201cThe condition I found him in last week is a progressive condition. I do not know when it reached the degree that I found him in last week.\u201d Dr. Staub, who first saw the plaintiff October 7, 1930, seven days before the trial, testified that the condition in which he now finds the plaintiff \u201cwas probably a progressive condition at some stage and then became constant.\u201d Dr. Moran, testifying for the plaintiff, said, \u201cThe condition I now find him in is the result of a progressive condition.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s experts, in answer to hypothetical questions, attributed his asthma and bronchitis to service conditions and to pneumonia, colds, and gassing suffered by the plaintiff while overseas. Dr. John F. Steel, who had specialized in diseases of the heart and lungs, testified for the appellant, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">\u201cI examined Orren Hainer on March 19, 1923, and reached the diagnosis, as the result of the examination, of chronic bronchitis, moderate degree, and no cardiac pathology. From the examination I found no organic disease of the heart, nor did I find any functional disease of the heart. The patient should be able to work continuously so far as bis heart is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-25\">\u201cThe only condition I found was bronchitis, chronic, moderate. By that I mean the bronchitis was not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-26\">\u201cIn my findings I also said there seemed to be a tendency of bronchial asthma, but not sufficient signs present for diagnosis of asthma. I would find these same signs present in a ease of bronchitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-27\">\u201cHe was not, in my opinion, suffering from any impairment, at the lime of the examination, which rendered it impossible for him to follow continuously any substantially gainful occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-28\">\u201cIn giving me bis history at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the examination, the patient stated that he had been a donkey engineer since discharge, and had been at that most of the time since discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s work record shows that he was actually working at a substantially gainful occupation most of the time immediately after his discharge. Plaintiff testified that he worked for the Aberdeen water department after his, discharge from the Army, and the records of the Water department show the dates as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cThe time he worked and the amounts received are:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cFirst half of August \u2014 8 days, $5.75 a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\u201cThe records do not show the exact date he began work.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\u201cSecond half of August \u2014 12 days, 5 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">\u201cFirst half of September \u2014 9 days, 1 hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">\u201cHe received $5.75 a day. When he worked overtime he received in proportion to that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">\u201cLast half of September \u2014 13 days; same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">\u201cFirst half of October \u2014 15 days, 3% hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">\u201cLast half of October \u2014 11 days, 4 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">\u201cFirst half of November \u2014 10 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">\u201cPay raised to $6 a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">\u201cLast half of November \u2014 10 days; same wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-17\">\u201cFirst half of December \u2014 12 days, 7 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-18\">\u201cLast half of December \u2014 3 days, 4 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-19\">\u201cFirst half of January \u2014 13 days, 5 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">\u201cLast half of <em>January </em>\u2014 10 days, 5 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-21\">\u201cFirst half of February \u2014 3 days, 4 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-22\">The plaintiff testified as to this work as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b610-23\">\u201cI went to work on a truck. A short time after, I was put to work inspecting hydrants; worked on hydrants, little odd jobs, pretty near all the rest of my time there. I got along with that work none too good. Several times I was off, two or three times, from my cough. That was in the winter of 1919 and the first of the year 1920. I can\u2019t give the date when I started to work there nor the date when I quit. I know it was th,e first of the month \u2014 ninth or tenth' \u2014 in August, and I worked \u2014 I think it was March I left there, 1920. I worked the fall and winter to March, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-24\">\u201cI continued to sneeze and cough and laid off on that account several times. Mr. Boyd told me I was laying off too often and he would have to let me go. The discharge came at the end of a period of laying off. I had been off sick and reported for work. He told me not to come back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-26\">Plaintiff' next worked for the Lincoln Creek Lumber Company at Centralia from the middle of April, 1920, to the middle of June, 1920, and later for a month and a half. In November, December, 1920, and January, 1921, he worked for the Chehalis Mill Company at Chehalis, Wash., as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-27\">Nov. 1920, 5% days locomotive engineer at $6.00 per day.........$ 33.00</p>\n<p id=\"b610-28\">4% days donkey engineer at $8.00 per day...................... 36.0.0</p>\n<p id=\"b610-30\">Dec., 31% days, locomotive engineer \u25a0 at $6.00 per day............... <em>188.50</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-32\">Jan. 1921, 24 days 5% hours, locomotive engineer at $6.00 per day 148.12</p>\n<p id=\"b610-33\">Total ....... $405.62</p>\n<p id=\"b610-34\">The honorable discharge of plaintiff from the Army recited that \u201cPhysical Condition when discharged, Good,\u201d but the plaintiff apparently did not answer the question therein asked as to his condition of health. The plaintiff emphasizes certain portions of his testimony as supporting his claim that there was substantial evidence that his total disability has existed from the time of his discharge. After stating that he worked for H. H. Morton in March, 1924, to April 15, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get along very good. I have not been free from this trouble since service.\u201d Again in testifying as to his work after November 5, 1929, picking hops and beans:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-35\">\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the dust. They would drag a boat between the rows and that would raise the dust. Particles of dust simply chokes me up, I can\u2019t breathe at ail. I am troubled with that condition all the time. I never have any relief from it. When I do manual labor I have a feeling like going down; I can\u2019t get my breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-36\">\u201cQ. Have you been in that condition since you were discharged from the Army? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-37\">C. G. Olmstead testified that he saw the plaintiff shortly after his discharge; that he was coughing all the time and complained of Ms chest hurting all the time; that they lived together on and off for a year; that the witness .\u201cdidn\u2019t get any sleep nights because he kept coughing all night long. Kept me awake.\u201d A. G. Olmstead, a brother of the last witness, testified as follows: \u201cI saw him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>a couple of months after his return from service. His condition wasn\u2019t very good. He was wheezing and coughing and gasping for breath. I asked Mm what was the matter. He told me a cold and one thing and another. His lungs was all affected; be couldn\u2019t hardly breathe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">There is no substantial evidence to submit to a jury upon the question of the total disability of the plaintiff before July 31, 1919, in view of his work record. He may have worked under difficulties, but there is no sufficient showing that he was unable to do what he did do. The evidence, without substantial conflict, shows that his condition was progressive, and that he did not become totally and permanently disabled until long after bis war risk insurance policy had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
