Harry Schwartzberg.\u201d The clerk issued a writ of scire facias as an independent proceeding entitled \u201cUnited States, Plaintiff, v. Harry Schwartzberg and Frank Palermo, Defendants.\u201d The defendant Palermo filed an answer alleging that he should be discharged from his obligations on the bond given for the appearance of Schwartzberg, for the reason that Schwartz-berg appeared in court pursuant to the terms of the bond and entered a plea of guilty, and that thereafter, and on account thereof, the appellant as bondsman had no further obligation; that no action for the forfeiture of the bond was declared during the November term of court, and therefore the court had no jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture of the bond or render judgment against the appellant at any subsequent term.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">In addition to the answer, appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the nature of a demurrer on the ground that the writ did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and further that the recognizance at the time of the forfeiture had no vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-18\">Harry , Schwartzberg was charged with unlawfully concealing assets of a bankrupt e&amp;&gt; tate in violation of the National Bankruptcy Act of the United States (section 29b, 11 USCA \u00a7 52(b). The appellant, Palermo, was surety upon-the recognizance-of Schwartzberg, the pertinent provisions of which are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-19\">\u201cThe condition of this recognizance is such, that if the said Harry Schwartzberg, principal, shall personally . appear before the District Court of the United States ih and for the Western District of Missouri, on the 24th day of December, 1928, to be be=gun and held at the city of Kansas City at 9:30 o\u2019clock A. M., and from time to tim\u00e9 thereafter, to which this cause may be continued and then and there, answer the charge-of having, on or about the 29th day of February, A. D. 1928, within shid district, in; violation of National Bankruptcy Act of the-United States, unlawfully concealed assets of bankrupt estate, and then and there abide the judgment of the said court, and not depart without leave thereof, then this recognizance to be void, otherwise to remain- in full force and virtue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-20\">The bond was executed on December 18, 1928, and filed December 27, 1928. There was no term commencing December 24, 1928, but the November term was then in existence. On February 19, 1929, during the said November term, Schwartzberg appeared in court waiving arraignment and entered a plea of guilty. Sentence was taken under advisement and deferred from time to time until May 25, 1929, when , defendant Schwartzberg was called and failed to appear for sentence. The court ordered forfeiture of the bond and scire facias, issued.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">The November term had ended before May 25, 1929, and the bond was forfeited during the April, 1929, term, which was the term immediately subsequent far the November term. Certain records of the clerk were incomplete and did not contain - all the proper entries of the orders of continuance which had theretofore been made from time to time. On application of appellee, the court found that the clerk of court had \u201cby mistake and inadvertence omitted from the said record certain entries which should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>have been made or shown by the original minutes of the court and of the clerk.\u201d The clerk was directed by the court to make certain entries nunc pro tune. The only purpose of the order was to correct the record of the court so that it would conform to the facts. No notice of such proceeding was required to be given to the surety. The right of the court to have its records correctly show what occurred cannot be questioned, and w\u00e9 find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that he was prejudiced by this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">There are only two questions to be considered on this appeal. First, Did the plea of guilty on February 19, 1929, end the liability of the surety on this bond? Second, Did the bond have any vitality during the April, 1929, term, when it was forfeited?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The conditions of a bail bond given in United States courts are generally governed by the laws of the state in which the court is located. Section 591, c. 17, title 18, USCA; National Surety Company v. United. States (C. C. A.) 29 F.(2d) 92; United States v. Ewing, 140 U. S. 142, 11 S. Ct. 743, 35 L. Ed. 388. This bond must be construed in light of the language of the following Missouri Revised Statutes 1929:</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cSec. 3486. <em>Bail, When to be Taken. </em>If the offense with which the prisoner is charged be bailable, and the prisoner offer sufficient bail, a recognizance shall be taken for his appearance to answer the charge before the court in which the same is cognizable, on the first day of the next term thereof, and not to depart such court without leave, and thereupon he shall be discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201cSec; 3466. <em>Judgments on -Recognizances Shall Not be Defeated, When. </em>No proceeding upon a recognizance shall be defeated, nor shall judgment thereon be prevented or arrested, on account of any defect of form, omission of recital, condition of undertaking therein, neglect of the justice or \u25a0clerk to note or record the default of any \u00a1principal or surety at the time or term, when :sueh default shall happen, or of any other irregularity, so that it be made to appear -from the whole record or proceeding that rtke defendant was legally in custody, \u25a0 charged with a criminal offense, that he was \u25a0 discharged therefrom by reason of the giving of the recognizance, and that it can be \u00a1ascertained from the recognizance that the \u00a1sureties undertook that the defendant should .appear before a court or magistrate at a term or time specified for trial. (R. S. 1919, \u00a7 3811.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">\u201cSee. 3584. If, without sufficient cause or excuse, the defendant fails to appear for trial or judgment, or upon any other occasion when his presence in court may be lawfully required, according to the condition of his recognizance, the court must direct the fact to be entered upon its minutes, and thereupon the recognizance is forfeited, and the same shall be proceeded upon by scire facias to final judgment and execution thereon, although the defendant may be afterward arrested on the original charge, unless remitted by the court for cause shown.\u201d Mo. St. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3466, 3486, 3584.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The cases bearing upon the liability of bondsmen are legion. Close study must be made of the local statutes and the terms of the bond in order to avoid confusion. The appellant in this case entered into a contract with the government. He became at his own voluntary choice the custodian of the defendant Sehwartzberg, instead of the government; and, in order to make his custody effective, he entered into a pecuniary obligation. Now, then, what did he agree to do? First, that the principal, Harry Sehwartzberg, should appear on December 24, 1928, and from time to time thereafter to which the ease may be continued and an-' swer the charge of unlawfully concealing assets of a bankrupt estate. Second, that the said principal should abide the judgment of the court, third, that the said principal should not depart without leave of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">The surety bound himself under this obligation not only to guarantee the appearance of the principal on the date set forth in the bond and the continuance thereof, but also that he should abide the judgment of the court and should not depart without leave thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">\u201cBail bonds vary somewhat in the form of the condition. Some require the principal to 'appear and answer to the Information and not depart without leave/ Others contain the further proviso that the principal wiR 'abide the judgment and orders of the court/ Where the bond is drawn in the former terms the principal is not required to abide the judgment and sentence of the Court as his appearance before the Court, together with his entering a plea of guilty to the offense charged in the Information, thereby putting himself in the power and control of the Court, satisfied the conditions of the bond. Where the latter terms are used the obligation does not terminate with conviction but the defendant must abide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>judgment thereon and the recognizance is forfeited if he absents himself without being discharged.\u201d 3 Ruling Case Law, \u00a7 46, p. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u201cThere is a legal requirement for the appearance of the accused after conviction where the condition of the bond or recognizance is not to depart without leave of court <em>or to </em>abide the order and judgment of the court, or both, or that accused shall render himself in execution. * * * \u201d 6 Corpus Juris, p. 1036, \u00a7 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The appellant cites the ease of State v. Charles, 207 Mo. 40, 105 S. W. 609, 13 Ann. Cas. 565. In that ease the recognizance provided: \u201cComes the defendant, Roy Charles, as principal, and Frank Ychlo and James A. Charles, as securities, and jointly and severally acknowledge themselves to owe the state of Missouri the sum of one thousand dollars, conditioned that the said Roy \u25a0Charles shall personally be and appear on The first day of the next term, of this court, to be hold at Carrollton, on the third Monday in April next, 1905, to answer and defend The information filed, charging him with embezzlement, and not depart tie court without leave, then this recognizance to he void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The defendant, Roy Charles, appeared on the first day of the April, 1905, term on April 20th, and on that day he waived formal arraignment and entered a plea of guilty. Afterwards, on April 27, 1,905, the prosecuting attorney moved for sentence, and the defendant Charles was duly called and made no appearance and was defaulted, and writ of scire facias was issued. The court held that, upon entering the plea of guilty, the defendant had fully satisfied the conditions of his bond \u201cto answer and defend the information,\u201d and that \u201cappearance of the principal before the court, entering his plea \u25a0of guilty to the offense charged in the information, thereby putting himself under the power and control of the court, substantially met and satisfied the conditions of the bond, which required him to \u2018appear and answer the information.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">It is apparent that the wording of the bond in the instant case clearly differentiates it from the Charles decision. In fact, the \u25a0court in the Charles Case refused to read into the bond the very language that is found in the bond now under consideration. On page 613 of 105 S. W., 207 Mo. 40, in the Charles Case, the court said: \u201cWe are unwilling to say that the conditions of a bond \u201cto answer and defend the information\u2019 should be construed to mean that the principal shall not only answer and defend the information by entering a plea of guilty or standing a trial and having a verdict of guilty returned against him, but that he shall abide the judgment and sentence of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">The appellant in this case was not only required to answer and defend the information, but, in addition, was obligated to abide the judgment of the court and not depart without leave thereof. This significant language is omitted from the bond in the Charles Case. There is no implication in the instant case that, upon entering a plea of guilty, the defendant Sehwartzberg was placed in the custody of the marshal. The contrary appears from the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">A situation somewhat similar to that now presented came before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, in the case of Detroit Fidelity <em>&amp; </em>Surety Company v. United States, 36 F.(2d) 682. There, as here, the bond was conditioned that the principal should abide the order and judgment of the court, and not depart the court without leave. On page 683 of 36 F.(2d) the court uses the following language: \u201cThe phrase \u2018abide by\u2019 means to adhere to; to submit to; to obey; to accept the consequences of. Order of United Commercial Travelers v. Smith (C. C. A. 7) 192 F. 102; Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary. The verb \u2018abide\u2019 may also have <em>the </em>same meaning, if, from the connection in which used, it clearly signifies more than passive waiting. The phrase \u2018abide the order and judgment of the court,\u2019 in the bond, is followed by the phrase \u2018and not depart the court without leave thereof,\u2019 thus, we think, making it clear that the verb \u2018abide\u2019 was used in the broader sense, and as an addition to the phrase which forbade unauthorized departure, though such addition might not have been necessary, to justify the conclusion we reach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">The court in Ewing v. United States (C. C. A.) 240 F. 241, had under consideration the terms of a bond comparable to the present one, and on page 254 of that decision in 240 F., the following statement is made:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">\u201cThe bond was to he void if the principal should make his appearance before the District Court \u2018then and there to answer,\u2019 etc., \u2018and continue in attendance at said term of said court from day to day and term to term until discharged, and abide the decision of the said court in the premises.\u2019 When the accused was convicted by the verdict of the jury, he was, upon the statement of his coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>sel that a motion for a new trial would be filed, and upon his counsel\u2019s request in his presence, instead of being remanded into the custody of the marshal, permitted to go upon his old bond; the court being of opinion that it was a \u2018continuing\u2019 bond. If the court had pronounced sentence, a different question might be presented, or, if the court had ordered the defendant into the custody of the marshal, perhaps the question would not be in legal effect the same as the question under consideration. But in this case the accused was not discharged, nor did he \u2018abide the decision\u2019 of the court, since no .judgment was rendered on the verdict, or upon the motion for a new trial. .</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u201c\"Whether or not, on principles of estoppel, applied also to this phase of the case, the surety .could be held, need not be decided; for, under the teams of the bond as given, the responsibility of the surety was not brought to an end and completed by the conviction itself. \u2022 The Supreme Court of Tennessee (Suggs v. State, 129 Tenn. 498, 500, 167 S. W. 122, 123) discuss the difference between the rights and obligations of the surety after conviction, but before sentence, and after sentence, and say: \u2018Where a bail bond stipulates that the principal is not to depart without leave of the court, the sureties are not exonerated by the mere conviction of the principal. * * * But when a conviction is followed by a pronouncement of sentence, such pronouncement, it has been held, has the legal effect of a direction to the sheriff to hold the convicted defendant in custody, and operates to exonerate the sureties.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u201cA number of eases are cited in support of each of these,, conclusions. No case has been cited, and we have found none, in which, upon a mere conviction, without sentence pronounced thereupon, it has.been held that the custody ,of the accused passed from the surety to -the officer who, under- the law, would take the accused into his custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">A plea'of guilty had been entered by the defendant Sehwartzberg, but no judgment of the court had been entered on that plea. The defendant agreed to await and accept the penalty that the court was to impose as the result of the conviction by a plea of guilty. He appeared in court from time to time thereafter, and consented to the deferment of the sentence. It may be that one of the purposes of bail bonds is\u2019to ipsuye the defendant\u2019s presence for trial, or until a plea of guilty has been entered. Some bonds, are drawn merely to .cover that .contingency; but, unless we desire to ignore the plain, unambiguous language of this bond, it is clear that the appellant agreed to do something more than to merely produce the defendant Sehwartzberg to answer the charges made against him. It is true that bail bonds should be construed with reasonable strictness. A surety should not be required to fulfill any conditions that he did not covenant to perform, but- the court should not close its eyes to the reasonable intendment of the language employed by the contracting parties when the surety agreed to become the custodian of the defendant instead of the government. At least, we should not be confused by any fiction that, upon a plea of guilty being entered, this defendant was lodged in the arms of an awaiting marshal, when the facts are that he was ordered to appear on a subsequent day .and abide the judgment of the court, and not depart without leave thereof. The sureties cannot complain of such a: construction. If the risk is greater in providing bail for one after conviction, the appellant ; must have taken that fact into consideration when he became surety on the bond -in question, and covenanted to perform the conditions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Thg second question raised by the appeal requires reference to sections 3466 and 3584, Revised Statutes of Missouri, and the construction thereof by the Missouri decisions. Appellant strenuously contends that this bond had lost its force and effect before the April, 1929, term; that the surety only agreed that Sehwartzberg should appear and answer the charges\u2019 that were made against him at the November, 1928, term. Consequently, it is appellant\u2019s contention that, when that term expired without a default and forfeiture of the bond, it lost its validity, and the attempted forfeiture at the April, 1929, term was nugatory. Appellant refers us to United States v. Mace (C. C. A.) 281 F. 635, 636. This case came from the District Court of Nebraska. The statute of that state having reference to-bonds is quite similar to the Missouri statute. The \u25a0Nebraska statute (Rev. St. 1913, \u00a7 8957) requires the bond to be conditioned that the accused appear forthwith before the District Court, if then in session, and, if not, on the first day of the next term thereof. It further provides that \u201cno recognizance requiring the accused to appear at the next term of court shall be rendered invalid by the fact that the court is in session.\u201d It will be noted that the Missouri statute does not provide for a forthwith bond, but it has been held that under this statute a forthwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>bond is not void. See State v. Allen, 275 Mo. 391, 204 S. W. 721. With that construction of the Missouri statute, it would appear that a magistrate in Missouri is authorized under the statute to take a forthwith bond, and the authority of a magistrate to take bonds is substantially the same in Missouri as in Nebraska.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The bond in the Maee Case provides as follows: \u201cThe condition of this recognizance is such, that if the said Joseph Chenoweth, principal, shall personally appear before the District Court of the United States in and for the district aforesaid, on the 1st day of the term to be begun and held on the 29th day of July, 1918, at ten o\u2019clock a. m., and from time to time thereafter to which the case may be continued, and then and there answer the eharge of having \u2022* * * and then and there abide the judgment of said court, and not depart without leave thereof, then this recognizance to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The defendant in the Mace Case was required to appear on the first day of the term to be begun or held on July 29, 1918. The bond itself is somewhat ambiguous, because the first day of the term did not begin on July 29, 1918, but at that time the April term of court was in session. No appearance was made by the defendant.Chenoweth during the April, 1918, term, and no forfeiture of his bond was ordered during that period. He was not indicted until September 21, 1918. The new term commenced September 27, 1918. Chenoweth\u2019s first appearance in court to answer tbe charge was on October 22, 1938, during the September term, when he entered a plea of not guilty. On December 19, 1918, the case was called for trial and Chenoweth did not appear and the bond was forfeited. It was held by the court that this bond applied only to the term of court then in session \u2014 the April, 1918, term \u2014 and limited its life to that term. Judge Kenyon, on page 639 of the decision in 281 F., stated: \u201cTaking the language of the bond literally, and in the light of section 382 of the Nebraska Criminal Code herein set forth, the bond can be construed in no other way than to require the appearance of the defendant forthwith at the term of court then in session. If the bond does not mean this under the Nebraska statute it has no meaning. It is to be observed that this term continued for several months after the time of taking this bond, and the defendant Chenoweth was indieted at that term. The provision of the bond that, \u2018and from time to time thereafter to which the ease may be continued, * * * and then and there abide the judgment of said court, and not depart without leave,\u2019 refers to the April term of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">It is highly significant that in the Maee Case there was no appearance by the defendant during the term to which the bond was returnable. The defendant was not called during that term. There were no proceedings during that term in the case against the defendant Chenoweth except the return of the indictment, and- the court made no order with reference to any continuance of the matter from the April to the September term. The surety covenanted to produce the defendant Chenoweth at the April, 1918, term and from time to time thereafter to which the case may be continued. The case was not continued during the April term. This court held that, iri view of the Nebraska statutes and the contract of the parties, the bond bad no life during the subsequent term. In the instant ease, however, the defendant did appear, and by a plea of guilty answer the charge during the term to which the bond was returnable. There can be no question but that the bond had vitality at the time a plea was entered, and at that time the defendant was ordered by the court to appear at the subsequent term in order that judgment might be imposed on the answer that he had made to the charge referred to in the bond. It is difficult to understand why it should be seriously contended that the court had lost jurisdiction to forfeit this bond when it appears that Sehwartzberg failed to do that which the .defendant explicitly covenanted he would do, \u2014 abide the judgment of the court and not depart without leave thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">It must be borne in'mind that each state has by statute provided the conditions of recognizance of bail. The cases from .the various states eonstrue their own statutes, and define the extent of the obligation under the particular practice involved. The conflict in the state decisions and in some of the federal decisions is therefore more apparent than real.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">The Mace Case was concerned with the Nebraska statutes and Nebraska decisions. The difference in the facts, coupled with the remedial statutes of Missouri and the decisions construing the same, prompts us to the conclusions herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The Commissioner had a right under the Missouri statute, as construed by State v. Allen, supra, to' accept either a forthwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>bond or one 'returnable to the next term. This bond merely provided that the defendant was required to appear on December 24, 1928, and from time to time thereafter to which the cause may be continued. It makes no reference to any term of court. It is not limited by its terms to any certain court term. In view of the Missouri statutes, no good reason suggests itself to us why there should be any restrictions read into the bond to limit its vitality to the November term of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The case of St. Louis v. Henning, 235 Mo. 44, 138 S. W. 5, discusses some of the earlier Missouri cases and the effect of section 3466, Revised Statutes of the State of Missouri, on the question of liability of bondsmen. On page 55 of that decision in 235 Mo., 138 S. W. 5, 8, is found the following: \u201cThis section [section 3466] well repays a careful reading. It was a new section in the Revised Statutes of 1879, being section 2077 of that revision. It provides that judgment for forfeiture shall not be prevened on account of any omission of recital or condition, so that it appears from the whole record or proceeding that the defendant was legally in custody, charged with a criminal offense, that he was discharged therefrom by reason of the giving of the recognizance, and that it can be ascertained from the recognizance that the surety undertook that the defendant should appear before a court or magistrate at a term or time specified for trial. * * * That this section made such a recognizance an obligation that the defendant would remain subject to the order of the court until his trial should take place or he should otherwise be finally discharged seems to have been the opinion of this court whenever the question has been presented to it, as is shown by the following cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">An early ease in Missouri decided before the passage of section 3466 \u2014 State v. Mack-ey, 55 Mo. 51 \u2014 refused to sustain a forfeiture of a bond where the defendant entered into a recognizance with one Thompson as surety to appear at the next (September) term of that court for trial, and not depart without leave. The defendant appeared at the September term, and the ease was continued on motion of the prosecuting attorney. At the next subsequent April term, the defendant failed to appear, and his. bond was forfeited and writ of scire facias issued. On page 55 of 55 Mo. the court stated: \u201cIf the defendants appeared at the October term in the year 1868, as required by the bond, and remained in court the whole term, ready to obey the order of the court until the term was adjourned, and no measures were taken by the court to commit the defendant or otherwise secure his appearance at any subsequent term of the court, upon the adjournment of that term of the court, the bond or recognizance would become discharged, and of no further effect and could not be forfeited by the failure of the defendant to appear at some subsequent term of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The Mackey Case was considered in State v. Morgan, 124 Mo. 467, 28 <em>S.W. </em>17, 20. The recognizance in the Morgan Case was conditioned that the defendant should appear in the Supreme Court at the April, 1891, term \u201cto receive judgment in the appeal and in this court if the Supreme Court shall so order, and at such time and place as such court shall direct and that he will render himself in execution and obey every order and judgment which shall be made in the premises.\u201d The recognizance was forfeited December 13, 1892, for failure to appear at that term, and the defense was made that the defendant was only bound 'by this undertaking to appear at the April term. The court, however, sustained the judgment against the bondsmen, and stated: \u201cBut, if there were any doubt in regard to the views herein expressed, there cannot be when section 4380, Rev. St. [1889] [this statute is the same as section 3466], is taken into consideration. * * * This statute was first enacted in 1879, and was therefore not in force at the time the ease of State v. Mackey, supra, was decided, and was evidently enacted to change the law, as therein announced, that eognizors might not escape liability upon mere technicalities, which in no way could possibly injuriously affect their rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The court in the ease of St. Louis v. Hen-ning, supra, after making a digest of several Missouri cases, uses the following language on page 58 of 235 Mo., 138 S. W. 5, 9: \u201cIt is held in all these cases that, when the sureties undertake that the defendant shall appear before a court or magistrate at the term specified for trial, their obligation is that he shall remain in court for all the purposes of his case, and: that a new undertaking is no more necessary than is a new summons to toll the civil defendant into court at each successive term. It is a most reasonable thing to require, and the words of the section call for such a construction. There is no reason why, when one charged with crime passes by his own choice from the custody of the law to the beneficent cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tody of his friends, the new relation ought not to be as broad as the old, or the friends should not, to the extent of their pecuniary undertaking, assume a responsibility as extensive as that of the officer whom they super sede.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOB6\">State v. Allen, supra, referring to section 3466, states: \u201cThis statute is as much a part of that authorizing the giving of bonds or recognizances as if incorporated into the text of the latter. In fact, to accomplish its purpose it should he read into that statute in construing same. Thus read, it eliminates from consideration any contention as to a literal interpretation, and leaves as es-sent\u00edais to determine the sufficiency of the obligation tlio legal custody ox tne accused^ to be ascertained from the entire record, his discharge by reason of the giving of the obligation, and that he thereby agreed and his sureties bound themselves that he would appear before the court for trial at a time or term specified.</p>\n<p id=\"Asq\">The court had authority to continue this case from the November term to the April term It did not lose jurisdiction. Nojudgment had been entered. The bond by its , . , t ,, , <em>-i,i </em>terms anticipated that continuances might be , , \u00ab <em>* </em>.. , T, . granted from time to time. It is common &amp; i experience that, m order to do justice to one , , Tin m\u00ed jt , \u2022 o, who has pleaded guilty, the court is often . -j <em>j f </em>. . required to have investigations made m or- , ^ ... , der that an intelligent disposition may be made of the ease or circumstances may appear winch justify a continuance m the interest of the government as well as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"A8J\">In the case of Mintie v. Biddle (C. C. A.) 15 F.(2d) 931, 932, the court stated: \u201cWe have no doubt that, after a plea of guilty or after conviction of one guilty of a crime, sentence may be deferred at convenience till some day, or any day in the current term. This is so, because the court ordinarily retains jurisdiction over its judgments for the current term in all eases. Nor have we any doubt that sentence may, in furtherance of the administration of justice, be deferred to some day in the next term or even to some definite time in the second succeeding term (Ex parte United States, 242 U. S. 27, 37 S. Ct. 72, 61 L. Ed. 129, L. R. A. 1917E, 1178, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 355), by an order made in the ease (Miner v. United States, 244 F. 422, 157 C. C. A. 48, 3 A. L. R. 995; Ex parte Singer [C. C. A.] 284 F. 60).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"An4\">Schwartzberg was discharged from custody by reason of this recognizance, and the surety, Palermo, covenanted that he would not only appear for trial, hut also for judgment. He failed to appear and abide the judgment of the court, and the surety must respond in the pecuniary obligation of his recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"AYQ\">In accordance with the views herein expressed, the judgment of the lower court must be, and is, affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
