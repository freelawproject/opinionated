In the rear of appellants\u2019 premises is a publie alley extending north from G street toward II street. All property on G street east of that alley as far as First street is zoned second commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-21\">When appellants\u2019 petition was filed, on the south side of G street in square 678, across from appellants\u2019 premises and extending from North Capitol street to First street, was property owned by the federal government and occupied by the Post Office Department for the parking of automobiles and for a garage for the use of the Post Office -Department. The Act of July 3, 1930, e. 859, 46 Stat. 1012^ authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into contracts for the extension, remodeling, and enlargement of the post office building \u201con land already owned by the Government in square 678,\u201d which embraced the area occupied as a garage and for the parking of automobiles. The Act of March 4, 1931, c. 522, 46 Stat. 1552, 1586, appropriated funds for the commencement of the extension to- the post office building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-22\">The entire west side of North Capitol street between G and H streets in square 624, opposite appellants\u2019 premises, is occupied by the Government Printing Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-23\">Section 4 of the Zoning Regulations provides, inter alia: \u201cIn oases where- the establishment of any business under the building regulations requires the consent of property owners within a certain specified area, and within this area there is included <em>public property, </em>the applicant for the establishment of such business shall be required to obtain the written consents of the owners of at least 75 per cent of the area owned by private parties, and, in case these consents do not constitute 75 per cent of <em>the whole of the area of consents required, </em>the inspector of buildings is instructed to- forward the application to the Board of Commissioners, which, after ascertaining the views of any other departments having jurisdiction over the <em>public property, </em>will consider on the merits of the ease whether or not consent will be given for <em>publie property.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-24\">Appellees construed the term \u201cpublie property\u201d as used in the regulation to mean federal or United States government property, and, after ascertaining the views of both the Government Printing Office and the Post Office Department (both properties being in the so-called consent area), \u201crefused to consent on behalf of the public property within the 200-foot radius of the plaintiffs\u2019 (appellants\u2019) property,\u201d and refused to issue a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-25\">Appellants contend that under a proper interpretation of the regulation they ware entitled to a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>The Zoning Act of March 1,1920,41 Stat. 500 (D. C. Code 1929, T. 25, \u00a7 521 et seq.), provided for a Zoning Commission, consisting of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, the officer in eharge of public buildings and grounds of the District, and the Superintendent, of the United States Capitol Building and Grounds. Section 5 of the act (D. C. Code 1929, T. 25, \u00a7 525) authorized and empowered the commission \u201cto make such orders'and adopt such regulations not inconsistent with law as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes and carry into effect the provisions of. this chapter.\u201d Pursuant to that authority, the Zoning Commission adopted and promulgated comprehensive regulations, and in section 22 provided that \u201cthe provisions of these regulations shall be enforced by the Commissioners, of the District of Columbia, and said commissioners are hereby authorized to interpret and apply the same. <em>Appeals from the decision of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia may be taken to the Zoning Commission.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">When, therefore, appellants\u2019 application for a permit was denied, there was available to them an appeal to the Zoning Commission. This appeal was not taken. Where a party has a right to a writ of error or appeal, he may not resort to the extraordinary writ of mandamus or prohibition. Ex parte Tiffany, 252 U. S. 32, 37, 40 S. Ct. 239, 64 L. Ed. 443; Ex parte Riddle, 255 U. S. 450, 41 S. Ct. 370, 65 L. Ed. 725; Stratton v. St. Louis S. W. Ry., 282 U. S. 10, 16, 51 S. Ct. 8, 75 L. Ed. <em>135. </em>Goldsmith v. U. S. Bd. of Tax Appeals, 270 U. S. 117, 46 S. Ct. 215, 70 L. Ed. 494, involved a petition for mandamus to compel the Board of Tax Appeals to admit Goldsmith to practice before it as a certified public accountant. The application had been denied after an ex parte investigation. It was held that he was entitled to demand of the board the right to be heard on the charges against him, but that, not having made such a demand, he was not entitled to the writ. The court said (270 U. S. at page 123, 46 S. Ct. 215, 218, 70 L. Ed. 494): \u201cUntil he had sought a hearing from the board, and been denied it, he could not appeal to the courts for any remedy and certainly not for mandamus to compel enrollment.\u201d So, here; until appellants had exhausted their remedy by way of appeal, they were not in a position to invoke the aid of a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
