The process of producing acetone and butyl alcohol by the inoculation of a cereal composition with the herein described bacteria which are capable unaided of converting sterile fermentable cereals substantially into acetone and butyl alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-38\">The questions of the validity and infringement of the claims in suit are in issue. The defendant says that they are invalid, but that, even if valid, it does not infringe. The argument in support of these defenses was urged in the District Court, and was ably and forcibly presented here, but the careful and comprehensive opinion of the learned District Judge adequately answers these arguments and convinces us that the invention disclosed in the patent created a new and important commercial enterprise, and on his opinion the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
