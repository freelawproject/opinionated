Appellee filed an answer to the petition; whereupon appellant moved for judgment on the pleadings. This motion was overruled, and, appellant electing to stand on the motion, judgment was entered dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">June was an emergency officer in the United States Army during the World War. Within one year from the passage of the Emergency Officers\u2019 Retirement Act (45 Stat. 735, tit. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 581, 582, U. S. C. [38 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 581, 582]), he filed application for retirement under that act. He was found to he suffering from general paralysis,' cerebral type, and on May 19,1929, his name was placed on the emergency officers\u2019 retired list. Thereafter, on September 30, 1930, upon a re-examination of the record, it was found that the general paralysis from which June was suffering resulted from syphilis, and that the disease was \u201cnot shown to have been incurred in line of duty or directly aggravated in line of duty. - * * * \u201d Thereupon appellee caused June\u2019s, name to be removed from the emergency officers\u2019 retired list.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-23\">In his answer appellee states that \u201cthe disability upon which action was taken as the result of the petitioner\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) application for retirement was not the alleged injury to the petitioner\u2019s spine but was general paralysis, cerebral type, which said disability resulted from the disease of syphilis,\u201d which \u201cwas incurred by the petitioner not in the line of duty, but as the result of the petitioner\u2019s own willful misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-24\">In Hines v. United States ex rel. Livingston, 59 App. D. C. 363, 42 F.(2d) 347, the authority of the Veterans\u2019 Bureau \u201cat any time\u201d to review an award made under the provisions of the Emergency Officers\u2019 Retirement Act here involved was carefully considered and sustained. That act, so far as pertinent, provides that emergency officers who during service-in the World War \u201cincurred physical disability in line of duty, and who- have been, or may hereafter, within one year, :be, rated in accordance with law at \u2019 not less than 30 per centum permanent disability by the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau for disability resulting directly from such war service, shall, * * * be placed upon, and thereafter continued on, separate \u2022retired lists, * * * and shall be entitled to the same privileges * * * provided for by law <em>or </em>regulations for officers of the Regular Army, * * * who have been retired for physical disability incurred in line of duty. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-28\">The decision in the Livingston Case is controlling here. The mere fact that Livingston\u2019s name had not been placed on the emergency officers\u2019 retired list does not lessen the pertinency of that decision. The important thing was the finding of the bureau upon which the right to be placed upon the list was based. So long as that finding was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>in force, the placing on the list followed as a matter of course, and was a mere ministerial act.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Moreover, on the record before us, it must be assumed that appellant\u2019s disability was incurred, not in the line of duty, but as the result of his own willful misconduct. Mandamus is awarded, not as a matter of right, but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion; \u201cto compel the performance of a duty which ought to be performed, not to direct an act which will work a public or private mischief or will be within the strict letter of the law but in disregard of its spirit.\u201d Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, 245 U. S. 308, 38 S. Ct. 99, 101, 62 L. Ed. 309; Wilbur v. United States, 60 App. D. C. 11, 15, 46 F.(2d) 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
