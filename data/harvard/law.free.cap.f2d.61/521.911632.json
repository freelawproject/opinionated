Ken-ney,\u201d and the other \u201cCharles D. Kenney, \u2018Wiring Account.\u2019\u201d His signature card at the bank for the fixtures department account read - (\u2018Washington \" Electric' Company, by Charles D. Kenney,\u201d and -the signature card for the other, or \u201cwiring account,\u201d read \u201cCharles- \u2018D.\u2019 Kenney, Wiring Account, by Charles D. Kenney.\u201d- \u201cCharles D. Kenney\u201d in both instances being-ini plaintiff\u2019s handwriting. The bank, required cheeks drawn on these accounts to be signed in' accordance with\",the signature cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">From-1924 until August of-1927, Neal A. Yeager was in plaintiff\u2019s employ, having charge of the books and the banking. During that time he indorsed cheeks payable to the Washington Electric .Company, using a rubber stamp provided by plaintiff on which appeared the words: \u201cWashington Electric Company,-By'- \u2014 In the blank space Yeager wrote his own name. Cheeks aggregating the amount sued for were cashed and the proceeds misappropriated by Yeager.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">Plaintiff testified that he did not give the bank any instructions one way or the other as to who should indorse customers\u2019 cheeks. He was shown a check dated June 27,1924, with the indorsement on the back, \u201cWashington Electric Company,\u201d which was by stamp, and \u201cNeal A. Yeager\u201d in Yeager\u2019s handwriting. Plaintiff admitted that he authorized the in-dorsement \u201cfor the purpose of deposit.\u201d Asked if the words \u201cfor deposit\u201d were on the cheek, plaintiff admitted that they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Question. \u201cAnd you provided him with the stamp on which was printed \u2018Washington Electric Company, by\u2019 and then a blank line?\u201d Answer. \u201cThe Washington Electric Company\u2019s stamp was provided for me to sign my cheeks. At that time they were not printed on- the cheek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">Question. \u201cBut you knew that that stamp was being .'used for this purpose, did you not?\u201d Answer. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-19\">- Question. \u201cYou yourself had used it for that purpose, to indorse checks?\u201d Answer. \u201cI suppose I had. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-20\">Question. \u201cYou knew that Yeager took cheeks?\u201d Answer. \u201cI knew he took cheeks and indorsed them by his name for my account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-21\">Question. \u201cI say, you knew that he took checks from your place-of business after having indorsed them just exactly as this cheek is indorsed which I hold in my 'hand 9\u201d Answer. \u201cYesJ*</p>\n<p id=\"b550-22\">Question.' \u201cAnd'there is nothing on that check about\u2018For deposit\u2019 ?\u201d Answer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-23\">Witness-. further stated that, <em>after he </em>learned in April, 1927, that Yeager-was cash-. ing checks, -he gave the bank instructions by; letter as to indorsement of checks by Yeager. Before that time he had- not given such in-. struetions. The letter - reads as follows: \u201cThis is to notify you that you are not to cash any checks made payable to the Washington Electric Company indorsed by Mr.. Yeager or-anyone else, except myself. Any checks that are indorsed for deposit- only and are deposited to the account with Mr. Yeager\u2019s indorsement are acceptable but are -not to be cashed.\u201d The cheeks in suit were all \u2022 cashed prior to the receipt of this letter by the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-24\">In 1925 knowledge was' brought to plaintiff that Yeager' had been convicted of embezzlement from the. Second National Bank of Washington and that he had been paroled and the money made good. From that time1 on, plaintiff testified that he supervised' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Yeager's work carefully, although he continued to permit Yeager to indorse checks \u201cWashington Electric Company, by Neal A. Yeager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Where one person knowingly permits another to represent him or puts the other in a situation indicating to those who deal with him that he has certain authority, the former is estopped from asserting against those who relied upon such appearance of authority that the agent was not acting within the actual limits of his authority. Crane v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., 48 App. D. C. 54. In the present case express authority was given Yeager to indorse checks, and this authority extended over a considerable period of time. Had plaintiff desired to limit Yeager\u2019s authority, he might, at the outset, have added to the stamp \u201cfor deposit only\u201d or notified the bank of the intended limit of Yeager\u2019s authority. In the absence of such a limitation, the bank was justified in assuming that Yeager had authority to cash the checks, and plaintiff is estopped to deny the existence of such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
