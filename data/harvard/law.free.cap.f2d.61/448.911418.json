Appellant file.d a petition to set aside- the adjudication on the ground that appellee is a hank-ing corporation within the meaning of section 4, Bankruptcy Aet (11 USCA \u00a7 22) and the court therefore was without jurisdiction to adjudicate it bankrupt. Prom an adverse ruling this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">Appellee has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was not allowed by a judge of this court nor presented for allowance within 30 days from the date of the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">Prior to the amendment of the Bankruptcy Aet of May 27, 1926, proceedings such as this were reviewed on petition to superintend and revise, under the provisions of section 24b of the aet. The amendment (section 9, 11 USCA \u00a7 47(b, c) provided that the power of review should be exercised by appeal and in the form and manner of an appeal, to be taken- within 30 days after judgment. The amendment was somewhat .ambiguous. To clarify the practice our rule 39 was adopted. The rule is as follows: \u201cAppeals in eases provided for in Sec. 24 (b). of the- Bankruptcy Aet of 1898,' as amended by the' Act of May 27, 19-26, may be taken, subject to allowance, by filing in the District Court, within the time allowed by law, a-petition for appeal addressed- to this court. Proper, security, as required, may -be taken and citation signed by the District Judge or a Circuit Judge of this Circuit. A record, including the petition for appeal, shall be printed and made up in the form and manner, and be filed in this court on or before the return day, as provided for other appeals! - The record when filed will be submitted to the- court by the clerk 10 days after filing, if the court is in session, or at the next term if the court is in vacation. Within the delay allowed for presentation to the court, any party in interest may file a brief in support of or in opposition to the allowance of the appeal. If the appeal is allowed the case will he set down for hearing in the usual course of the docket. Appeals and orders from judgments'not final in their nature shall not stay other proceedings in the cause except upon the order of the District Judge or a Judge of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">In this ease the- petition for appeal was addressed to the-judge of the District Court and was allowed: by Mm on June 23, 1932, with supersedeas staying the proceedings. As the judgment appealed from was entered on June 21, 1932, the appeal was taken within 30 days. The original record w;as filed with the clerk at New Orleans on July 27, 1932, within 34 days after the appeal was granted. The- rule was complied with in that the petition was filed with the District Court-As the record was filed in tMs court in vacation, the case was submitted at the next term. Onr rule 14(5) provides that the transcript of appeal must be filed in the clerk\u2019s office at New Orleans in not exceeding 30 days from the date of signing the citation. Service of citation was waived as of, June 23d. It appears therefore that appellant failed to comply with the rule by addressing the petition for appeal to this court and in delaying four days in filing the transcript with the clerk. These were irregularities which may he waived as they do not affect the substantial rights of the parties. The appeal is granted. However, we now give notice that we reserve the right to strictly enforce the rule in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">It appears that appellee sought incorporation under the name of. \u201cLiberty Banking &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Real Estate Corporation,\u201d by filing a petition in the superior court of Bibb county, Ga. Among the powers <em>asked </em>for were the right \u25a0to buy, sell, rent, lease, hire, develop, improve, own, control, and manage improved and unimproved real estate; to make contracts for constructing buildings; to buy, sell, and deal in stoeks, bonds, promissory notes, and all kinds of choses in action; to advance or lend money to its stockholders or other persons, and to adopt a system of loans, advances, terms, and payments in installments in like manner, as to its interest charges and computations as may be done by building and-loan associations under the laws of Georgia; to conduct a savings department for its members and other persons with the right to receive deposits not subject to cheek, and to pay interest thereon. After an amendment to the petition eliminating the word \u201cbank\u201d and changing the title to the \u201cLiberty Savings &amp; Real Estate Corporation,\u201d the superior court'granted the prayer of the petition and entered an order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">It is contended by appellant that the business done by appellee was in all respects that of a bank and that it received deposits subject to check as an ordinary bank would do. It is suggested in argument that if appellee was not a bank de jure it was a bank de faeto and the character of the business done would fix its status for the purpose of adjudication in bankruptcy. It is further suggested in argument that if not a bank the corporation was a building and loan association; and that by the amendment to the Bankruptcy Act of February 11, 1932 (11 USCA \u00a7 22), adopted before the adjudication in this case, building and loan associations were excluded from the benefits of the bankruptcy law. This last contention was not relied upon in the District Court and the amendment to the law, apparently, was not brought to the attention of the court. However, as it raises a question of jurisdiction, we must consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u25a0 Under the law of Georgia, Const, art. 3, \u00a7 7, par. 18, charters of banks shall be issued and granted by the Secretary of State. The superior courts have no power to create corporations for banking, but they may ineor-'porate building and loan associations \u201cand other like associations\u201d (the term \u201cother like associations\u201d shall include a corporation organized to do a general savings and loan business). Park\u2019s Ann. Code Ga. \u00a7\u00a7 2823, 2878.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">There is no evidence whatever in the record that would indicate that appellee did the business usually conducted by a building and loan association.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> A dear preponderance of the evidence shows that appellee did no banking business other than receiving savings accounts, for which they issued either pass books or certificates of deposit; that the depositors on the pass books were permitted to draw out portions of the deposit from time to time on checks. This it could not do under its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">It is evident that appellee was organized to do a general, savings and loan business, something less than either a bank or a building and loan association. If it occasionally engaged in banking transactions, those acts were ultra vires and could not operate to make it a bank within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Law; nor was it a building and loan association. The status of a corporation is fixed by its charter. Appellee was entitled to the benefits of the bankruptcy act and the District Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate it bankrupt. Gamble v. Daniel (C. C. A.) 39 F.(2d) 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The record presents no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
