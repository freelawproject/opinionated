HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFN\">The plaintiffs, owners of the barge Lottie, seek to recover from the defendant, an insurance company, for loss of the Lottie, which foundered on September 19, 1928, when at anchor in the Delaware breakwater. The trial court directed a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">The tug T. J. Hooker started from Hampton Roads, on September 16,1928, having in tow plaintiffs\u2019 barges Nahant, Olwine, and Lottie, loaded with coal for New England ports. When the tow was off Atlantic City, the wind shifted to-the northeast and raised such a heavy sea that the tug turned around and headed back into the Delaware breakwater, arriving there at about 7 p. m. on September 18th. During that night the wind increased. During the morning of September 19th, the Lottie began to leak and hoisted signals of distress. She was an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>chored to the southwest of the other barges a,nd farther away from the breakwater so that she was more exposed to the pounding of the waves. Not long after noon on Sep-' tember 19th, she sank just after the tug had taken off her crew. The other two barges rode out the storm successfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Robert B. Wathen, the managing director of the plaintiff, had for some time attempted to insure the Lottie, but was unable to obtain a rate that ho was willing to pay. On the evening of September 18th ho received a message from the owner of the tug T. J. Hooper that she was taking her tow into the breakwater to seek shelter. Upon obtaining this information, be proceeded from Baltimore to New York, and on arriving there directed Ms brokers to place insurance on the Lottie and three other barges (not among those in the tow), provided it could he obtained at a rate of 5 per cent., a rate somewhat lower than, he had been able to obtain. The broker asked him where his boats were, and he replied: \u201cThank God they are safe in port.\u201d The broker offered the risk to Throckmorton, the marine underwriter of the Public Piro Insurance Company, who inquired, \u201cWhere are the boats ! \u201d and was given the answer, \u201cThey are in port.\u201d Throckmorton thereupon said, \u201cI will accept your line at live per cent.,\u201d and issued a binder for a time policy of $14,000 hull insurance covering the Lottie for one year. The three other barges were also* covered at $10,000 each. The insurance was of the hull equipment and machinery \u201cin port and at sea\u201d within the navigation limits of Eastport, Me., and Norfolk, Va.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">At the time the hinder was issued, Throck-morton knew that there was a considerable storm coming up the Atlantic Coast, but was not aware of the whereabouts of the insured vessels. Within about an hour after the binder attached, the Lottie became a total loss, and thereafter this action was brought by her owners to recover the insurance. The following defenses of misrepresentation and concealment by the insured of facts material to the risk were interposed:</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">(1) That the plaintiffs\u2019 broker obtained the insurance upon a representa,tion that the Lottie was \u201csafe in port\u201d when she was in. fact on a voyage from Norfolk to New London and a violent storm was sweeping the Atlantic Coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">(2) That the broker had made this representation in answer to a specific question by the defendant\u2019s marine underwriter regarding the whereabouts of the Lottie.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">(3) That the broker, when applying for the policy, had concealed from the defendant that the Lottie was on a voyage through a storm center.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Wo think that the reply of the plaintiffs\u2019 insurance broker to Throckmorton\u2019s question, \u201cWhere are the boats!\u201d was a misrepresent:^ tion of a material fact. The object of Throckmorton in asking the question was to learn whether they were in a safe place. He testified that \u201cit is very unusual to accept a hull risk in the middle of a voyage.\u201d Pol. 234. The answer,' \u201cThey are in port,\u201d did not give a true account of the situation of the Lottie. At that time the Lottie was, practically speaking, \u201con a voyage,\u201d only interrupted by her temporary asylum behind the Delaware breakwater, and was not in a \u201cport\u201d in any commercial sense. The word \u201cport\u201d to the ordinary person means a place where cargo can be loaded and discharged. As Lord Ilalsbury said in Hunter v. Northern Marine Ins. Co., 13 A. C. at page 723: \u201cIt is a place of safety for the ship and the goods, whilst the goods are being loaded and unloaded. There will never be a port, in the ordinary business sense of the word, unless there is some element of safety in it for the ship and goods. * * * \u201d See,, also, Devalo v. Eight Hundred and Twenty-Three Barrels of Plumbago (D. C.) 20 F. 510, at page 515. We think that the word \u201cport\u201d was used here in the ordinary business sense, and did not include a mere partial shelter in the lee of a breakwar,er inaccessible to any wharf or pier or harbor facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">It is argued that the place whore the Lottie wa,s anchored was a \u201cPort of Refuge.\u201d It is designated on the government chart as \u201cHarbor of Refuge,\u201d and many vessels lay there at the very time when the binder was issued, and, so far as the record shows, rode out the storm in safety. But, whether or not the place was in some limited sense a \u201cport,\u201d it was not one in the commercial sense intended, and was not an adequate place of refuge for the Lottie as events proved. She was a barge having a registered depth of only 13.3 feet. At page 82 of part V of the United States Coast Pilot (4th Ed.) we find this significant warning: \u201cSmall vessels of less than 12 feet draft will find better shelter from easterly and northerly winds if anchored in Delaware Breakwater Harbor which lies a little over 1 mile southwestward from the Harbor of Refuge.\u201d The chart in evidence shows that Delaware Breakwater Harbor is protected by an inner break<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>water1, and is adjacent to the village of Lewes, where there \u00e1re docks (fol. 214), obviously a plaee of much greater safety than the so-called \u201cHarbor of Refuge\u201d and perhaps a real port in the commercial sense. Lewes was five or six miles from the plaee where the Lottie was anchored. Fol. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">We do not suggest nor do we believe that any fraud was intended by plaintiffs or their broker in the application for the policy, but we hold that in stating that the Lottie was \u201cin port\u201d there was a misrepresentation sufficient to avoid the policy. Btesh v. Royal Ins. Co., Ltd., of Liverpool (C. C. A.) 49 F.(2d) 720; King v. Aetna Ins. Co. (C. C. A.) 54 F.(2d), 253; Moses v. Delaware Ins. Co., 17 Fed. Cas. page 891, No. 9872; Carrollton Furniture Mfg. Co. v. American Credit Indem. Co. (C. C. A.) 115 F. 77, at page 79; Kerr v. Union Marine Ins. Co. (C. C. A.) 130 F. 415, at page 417; Snare <em>&amp; </em>Triest Co. v. St. Paul Fire <em>&amp; </em>Marine Ins. Co. (C. C. A.) 258 F. 425, at page 427; Bella S. S. Co. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am. (D.

P. at page 68; Amould on Marine Ins., 11th Ed. \u00a7 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">It is evident from the foregoing that the plaintiffs established no case upon which a verdict could properly have been directed. On the contrary, the motion by the defendant for a direction should have been granted because of the misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial -ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
