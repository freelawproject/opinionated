The issue presented for our consideration is one of law. The question, concretely stated, is whether the gain of $233,82(7.54 in 1928, in addition to the $200,000 cash received as a result of the reorganization, may now be treated as taxable gain for 1925 and 1906 as a-result of the liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The answer to this query involves two questions of law: (1) Whether, under section 202 (e) of the Revenue Aet of 1921, as amended by the Aet of March 4, 1903-, \u00a7 2 (42 Stat. 1560i), an exchange upon a statutory corporate reorganization of shares of stock for shares of stock and money resulted in a closed transaction, so {hat gain realized upon such exchange, other than the money received, could not be taxed upon.a subsequent sale or disposition of the shares of stock received. . (2) Whether the phrase \u201cgain \u00bb * * recognized upon such exchange,\u201d in section 204 (a) (6) of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926,. 26 USCA \u00a7 935 (a) (6), is confined .to gain included in taxable. income, or whether it comprehends also gain in fact accrued but not realized by the \u25a0\u00a1\u00a1\u00e1xpay\u00e9r.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">: The order of the Board in effect answered {he first question' i\u00bf the negative, and as to the second question held that the word \u201cgain\u201d in the phrase referred to is confined to gain included in taxable income. Petitioner, on the other' hand, contends that each ruling of the board is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\u25a0 As explanatory of the term \u201cclosed transaction\u201d .referred {o in the first question, and as.bearing upon its use and interpretation, petitioner in his brief has given a very simple and clear illustration, which in substance We set forth as follows: If a man buys a horse in 193\u00d3 for $100, and sells, him in 1931 for $200, it is quite clear that be has made a profit of $100\u2019 in 19.31; but if be buys a horse in 1930 for $100 and in 1931 trades him for a second horse, the question is not so clear; and if in 1932 he sells'the second horse for $200, there arises a question whether his profit was realized in 1931 or 1932. With relation to such transactions two rules have been adopted. By the first rule the exchange is declared to result immediately in a taxable profit or loss, determined by the difference between the cost of the property given in exchange and the value of the property received in exchange. The exchange is said to close the transaction for tax purposes, and hence the rule applied is called the \u201cclosed rule.\u201d By the second or \u201copen\u201d rule the exchange is declared to result in no tax-, able profit or loss, but the owner is assumed to have acquired the property received in exchange at the, original cost of the property given- in exchange, and when the property received in exchange is subsequently sold the profit or loss is computed on the b\u00e1sis of that assumption. In other words, the transaction is kept open, leaving the taxable profit or loss for determination at the time of the sale or other disposition of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">Wherever the open rule is applied to exchanges, it is obviously necessary that a for-' mu\u00eda be supplied whereby the cost of the property received in exchange may be deter-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> mined.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">Prior to 1918 it seems that Congress, for. the purpose of taxation, had considered all exchanges as closed transactions. This ;was likewise true of the Revenue Aet of 1918/ e.' 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, \u00a7 200, except as to stock received for stock in certain corporate reorganizations, \u25a0 and as to that a statutory formula was provided to' determine the cost basis of the property received ,in exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">The Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42. Stat. 227, 229, \u00a7 202, (c), (d), and (e), provided for a number of exceptions to the general rule that exchanges should be regarded as closed transactions, and in connection with each exception provided a cost,basis for the property received in exchange. '</p>\n<p id=\"b230-16\">. Section 202 (e) of the last-named act contained a cost basis, but was amended. March 4, 1923-,, 42 Stat. 1560, for the purposes of taxation, by eliminating the cost basis and inserting an additional provision for computing fhe resulting gain.. Upon this amendr ment petitioner\u2019s first contention is based, and we set forth the amended section in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the omitted parts of the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>section inelosed in brackets and the new part indicated by italics.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">By virtue of that enactment petitioner contends that his gain in 1923, other than cash received, was deliberately left untaxed and was not taxable in subsequent years, and he bases this contention on the fact that the amended section contains no basis from which the cost of the stock received in exchange can bo determined. We think that petitioner\u2019s contention in this respect is untenable, because such cost basis is provided in section 292 (d) (l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *of said Revenue Act of 1921, and Congress seems to have held the same opinion when it enacted the amendment of 1923, as shown by tho report of the Senate Committee on Finance, S. R. No. 3113, 67th Congress, 4th Session, p. 3, a part of which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The ruling of the Board that the facts herein stated did not constitute a closed transaction is entirely consistent with Regulations 62 of the Treasury Department, art. 1568, as amended January 1, 1923.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *That interpre-lation <em>has </em>been followed consistently by <em>the </em>Board, and its interpretation should not be overruled except for weighty reasons. Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 375, 51 S. Ct. 144, 75 L. Ed. 397; United States v. Cerecedo Hermanos Y Compania, 209 U. S. 337, 28 S. Ct. 532, 52 L. Ed. 821.</p>\n<p id=\"ayr-dedup-0\">Section 204 (a) (6) of the Revenue Act of; 1924, e. 234, 43 Stat. 258, is the same as tho section of the same number of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 2:7, 44 Stat. 14, 15, 2 6 USCA \u00a7 935 (a) (6). So much thereof as-is pertinent to the second question presented is set forth in tho margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">The only controversy raised by this question arises over tho meaning of the word \u201crecognized\u201d in the sentence \u201cthe basis shall be * * * increased in the amount of gain * \u2022 * to tho taxpayer that was1 recognized upon such exchange under the law * * *.\u201d Petitioner contends that the words \u201cgain * * * recognized\u201d mean all gain realized by him at the time of the exchange, whether taxed, or not. According to his calculation in arriving at the amount of profit accruing to him at the time of liquidation, he starts with the cost to him of tho West Virginia stock, $200,000; from this he deducts the amount of- cash received, $200,-000, which leaves nothing; he then adds the total amount of gain which he claims to have actually realized at the timo of the exchange, $433,827.54, and he claims that this amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>should be deducted from the total amount received for his stock, $545,288, which would leave $111,410.46 as his profit upon liquidation, as stated in his 1926 income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We are not in accord with petitioner\u2019s contention in this respect. The statute is clear, and we have no doubt that the words \"gain *, * * recognized upon such exchange under the law\u201d mean gains taxable at that time under the law. At the time of the exchange the law did not even recognize a gain, except as to the cash received; and the fact that, in exchanges of stocks, accuracy of gains and losses cannot be determined or recognized as such until disposition of the stock received in exchange, is the very thing that prompted the remedial legislation now under discussion. If petitioner recognized a gain at the time of the exchange other than the cash which he received, it was merely a paper gain, and was anticipatory rather than realized. What he thought, however, or prophesied, or recognized in his mind is not material.. The question here is: Did the law recognize the gain, other than the cash received? We are convinced that it did not, and the order of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Cases No. 4688, Georgia T. Gann v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and No. 4689, C. W. Sager v.
