These fixtures enhanced the value of the premises for such use. Indeed, tools of this character were necessary and indispensable in the work of a garage. The fact that some hand tools accompanied the lease is a mere minor incident. Under the Pennsylvania authorities, Mickle v. Miles, 31 Pa. 20, and VettePs Appeal, 99 Pa. 52, it is quite clear that the landlord could distrain for rent. The other questions involved have had due consideration. Finding no error in the court\u2019s action, the decree below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
