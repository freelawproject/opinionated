Fogg, in (George), and his mother, Frances K. Fogg (Frances), on the issue of their standing as \u201caggrieved\u201d persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. The Foggs challenged the issuance of a building permit to 81 Spooner Road, LLC (developer) by the building commissioner for the town of Brookline (town or Brookline). The town\u2019s zoning board of appeals (board) determined that the permit should be rescinded. After the issue of standing was eliminated on summary judgment, the matter proceeded to a bench trial on the merits. The judge affirmed the decision of the board. The developer appealed. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgments, both as to standing and the underlying merits, concluding, among other things, that the developer had failed to rebut the Foggs\u2019 presumptive standing as abutters. See <em>81 Spooner Rd., LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brookline, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 233 (2010). We granted the developer\u2019s application for further appellate review. For the reasons that follow, we now affirm the granting of summary judgment to the Foggs on the standing issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts as found by the Land Court judge, supplemented where necessary by undisputed facts in the record. George lives in a single-family home at 91 Spooner Road in Brookline, and Frances lives in a single-family home at 61 Spooner Road. Their properties were located on either side of and abutted the property at 81 Spooner Road (subject property), which had an area of approximately 22,400 square feet. On June 30, 2004, the developer purchased the subject property, on which was located a single-family home. The subject property is situated in an S-10 zoning district. A sketch made by the Land Court showing the properties at issue is attached hereto as an Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In an S-10 zoning district, the town\u2019s zoning bylaw permits single-family homes on lots having a minimum size of 10,000 square feet. Table 5.01 of the zoning bylaw specifies the uses, the minimum lot size, the maximum floor-to-area ratio, the minimum lot width, the maximum building height, the setback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>requirements, and the open space requirements for each zoning district in the town. As pertinent to this case, the floor-to-area ratio limits the size of the building that can be situated on a lot of a particular area. The floor-to-area ratio applicable to an S-10 zoning district is .3, and, at the time the subject property was purchased by the developer, it conformed to this requirement by having a floor-to-area ratio of .17.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On March 9, 2005, the town\u2019s planning board indorsed the developer\u2019s \u201capproval not required\u201d subdivision plan pertaining to the subject property. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P (approval of plan not subject to subdivision control law). The plan divided the subject property into two lots \u2014 81 and 71 Spooner Road. The lot with the existing single-family home at 81 Spooner Road, which became 10,893 square feet after the division, then was sold to Fredrik and Rebecca Velander on March 25, 2005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> George at 91 Spooner Road remained the abutter to this property. The developer retained the newly created lot at 71 Spooner Road, which was 11,648 square feet after the division. On April 8, 2005, the town\u2019s building commissioner issued a permit to the developer, allowing the construction of a two-story, single-family house at 71 Spooner Road. Frances at 61 Spooner Road became the abutter to this property.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">By letter to the town\u2019s building commissioner dated May 16, 2005, the Foggs requested, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the building permit \u201cbe rescinded and that all development on 71 Spooner Road be ordered halted.\u201d Among other concerns, they asserted that, absent the property at 71 Spooner Road, the existing home at 81 Spooner Road exceeded the maximum floor-to-area ratio allowed under the zoning bylaw, rendering the lot at 71 Spooner Road invalid for separate development (known as \u201cinfectious invalidity\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Foggs also claimed that the floor-to-area ratio of the proposed house at 71 Spooner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Road would exceed the maximum ratio allowed under the bylaw. On May 31, 2005, the building commissioner denied the Foggs\u2019 request to rescind the building permit, concluding that both 71 and 81 Spooner Road conformed with the requirements of the zoning bylaw. The Foggs appealed from that decision to the board pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Public hearings were held on September 22 and October 20, 2005. At the outset, the developer asserted that the Foggs did not have standing to challenge the building commissioner\u2019s decision before the board because they were not \u201caggrieved\u201d persons. The board declined to consider the developer\u2019s argument and proceeded with the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">By decision dated November 1, 2005, the board rescinded the building permit issued to the developer. The basis for the board\u2019s decision was its finding that, notwithstanding the developer\u2019s claim that disputed space on the second floor of the 71 Spooner Road house was \u201cnon-habitable attic space,\u201d the developer intended for such space to be habitable. Therefore, the disputed space had to be included in the dwelling\u2019s gross floor area for the purpose of calculating its floor-to-area ratio. Once included in such calculation, the house at 71 Spooner Road, when completed, would exceed the maximum floor-to-area ratio allowed in an S-10 district under the zoning bylaw. The board rejected the Foggs\u2019 contention that, once the subject property was divided into two lots, the existing home at 81 Spooner Road exceeded the maximum allowable floor-to-area ratio because the property at 71 Spooner Road was necessary to maintain 81 Spooner Road\u2019s compliance with the bylaw. The board stated that it had received information from the building commissioner that the Velanders had applied for and been issued a permit to \u201c[rjemove interior finish from the attic.\u201d In the board\u2019s view, removing all interior finish from the third floor \u201cattic\u201d would render that area \u201cnon-habitable space,\u201d and it then could be excluded from the home\u2019s gross floor area. Once this occurred, the house at 81 Spooner Road would be in compliance with the zoning bylaw\u2019s maximum floor-to-area ratio for an S-10 district. The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>cautioned that its decision regarding this issue was based on its assumption that the Velanders actually converted the attic to \u201cnon-habitable space.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In response to the board\u2019s decision, the building commissioner notified the developer\u2019s general contractor that the building permit for 71 Spooner Road was suspended until either new plans were submitted showing that the house conformed to the maximum allowable floor-to-area ratio, or the ensuing appeal from the board\u2019s decision was resolved. The building commissioner ordered the contractor to stop all work at 71 Spooner Road, except any work necessary to make the property safe and secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In November, 2005, the developer and the Foggs each filed a complaint in the Land Court, seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The focus of the developer\u2019s complaint against the board and the Foggs was its contention that the board erred in rescinding the building permit based on its finding that the 71 Spooner Road house, when completed, would exceed the maximum floor-to-area ratio allowed in an S-10 district under the zoning bylaw.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The developer also reiterated its assertion that the Foggs did not have standing as \u201caggrieved\u201d persons to challenge the issuance of the building permit before the board. In their complaint against the board and the developer, the Foggs took issue with the board\u2019s rejection of their argument as to the \u201cinfectious invalidity\u201d of 71 Spooner Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">On February 22, 2006, the developer filed separate motions for summary judgment with respect to its own complaint and that of the Foggs. The basis for each motion was the developer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>contention that the Foggs were not \u201caggrieved\u201d persons within the meaning of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, and, therefore, lacked standing to appeal from the issuance of the building permit before the board. In support of its position, the developer relied on its own memoranda of law and on portions of the Foggs\u2019 deposition testimony. The Foggs filed an opposition and a cross motion for summary judgment with respect to both complaints, requesting entry of an order pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (d), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), that they had standing to appeal from the building commissioner\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In support of their position, the Foggs presented their own deposition testimony, several photographs, a site plan of the area, and a section of a legal treatise concerning the regulation of density in urban areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">On April 13, 2007, the judge denied the developer\u2019s motions for summary judgment, granted the Foggs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and eliminated the issue of standing from a trial on the merits of the parties\u2019 complaints seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s decision. He found that Frances, as an abutter to the property at 71 Spooner Road, was entitled to a presumption of standing as a \u201cparty in interest.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He stated that while the evidentiary record before the court was \u201cthin,\u201d the issue was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>whether the Foggs had presented enough evidence, but, rather, whether the developer had presented sufficient evidence to rebut their presumption of standing. The judge concluded that the developer had not. He stated that the developer did not present any evidence beyond pointing out deficiencies in the Foggs\u2019 claims of aggrievement. In his view, this was insufficient to rebut the Foggs\u2019 presumption of standing. Finally, the judge stated that, even if the developer was successful in rebutting the presumption, the Foggs still would have standing based on one of their substantive claims of aggrievement \u2014 that the proposed house at 71 Spooner Road would cause a diminution in their property values \u2014 where the claim related to a cognizable interest protected by the zoning bylaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The cases proceeded to trial on December 4 and 5, 2007. After the resolution of various posttrial motions that are not relevant here, separate judgments entered in favor of the Foggs on April 27, 2009, affirming the decision of the board. With respect to the developer\u2019s action, the judge agreed with the board that the disputed space on the second floor of the proposed house at 71 Spooner Road was habitable space, designed as part of a complete two-story dwelling, and was not an \u201cattic\u201d within the meaning of the zoning bylaw. As such, the judge continued, the disputed space had to be included in the home\u2019s gross floor area. Once included, the house exceeded the maximum allowable floor-to-area ratio for an S-10 zoning district. Accordingly, the judge concluded that the board properly rescinded the building permit issued to the developer for 71 Spooner Road. With respect to the Foggs\u2019 action, the judge stated that the house at 81 Spooner Road, when considered on its own without the 71 Spooner Road lot, exceeded the maximum allowable floor-to-area ratio for an S-10 zoning district and was rendered nonconforming. Consequently, the lot at 71 Spooner Road also was rendered nonconforming as a result of \u201cinfectious invalidity.\u201d See note 6, <em>supra. </em>The judge concluded that the board properly determined that a building permit could be issued to 71 Spooner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Road if all interior finish from the third floor \u201cattic\u201d of the house at 81 Spooner Road was removed, thereby bringing that house into compliance with the zoning bylaw.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The developer contends that the Land Court judge erred in concluding that the Foggs were \u201caggrieved\u201d persons with standing to challenge the building commissioner\u2019s decision to issue a building permit for 71 Spooner Road. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We review de novo the judge\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to the Foggs on the issue of standing. See <em>Marhefka </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Sutton, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 517 (2011). Because a judge does not engage in fact finding when ruling on cross motions for summary judgment, we do not give deference to the judge\u2019s decision. See <em>Albahari </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brewster, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 248 (2010). Contrast <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 720, 722 (1996) (Marashlian) (after contested evidentiary hearing, appellate court will not overturn judge\u2019s findings on standing unless clearly erroneous). \u201c[Wjhere both parties have moved for summary judgment, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment [entered].\u201d <em>Albahari </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brewster, supra </em>at 248 n.4. Cf. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Quincy Food Serv. Employees Ass\u2019n &amp; Hosp., Library &amp; Pub. Employees Union, </em>407 Mass. 601, 603 (1990) (when court grants summary judgment for non-moving party, we view record in light most favorable to summary judgment loser). A party seeking summary judgment may satisfy its burden of demonstrating the absence of triable issues, see <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 16-17 (1989), by showing that the party opposing the motion will not be able to prove an essential element of its case. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). See also <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 32 (2006) <em>(Standerwick).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Under the Zoning Act, G.

See <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 131 (1992) (status as \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d is jurisdictional prerequisite to maintaining action under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See generally M. Bobrowski, Massachusetts Land Use and Planning Law \u00a7 11.03[A], at 343-353 (3d ed. 2011). A \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d is one who \u201csuffers some infringement of his legal rights.\u201d <em>Marashlian, supra </em>at 721, citing <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 430 (1949). Of particular importance, the right or interest asserted by a plaintiff claiming aggrievement must be one that the Zoning Act is intended to protect, either explicitly or implicitly. See <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Chatham, </em>459 Mass. 115, 120 (2011) <em>(Kenner); Standerwick, supra </em>at 27-28. See also <em>Marhefka </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Sutton, supra </em>at 518-519, and cases cited. We do not define aggrievement narrowly, see <em>Marashlian, supra, </em>but we have stated that \u201c[a]ggrievement requires a showing of more than minimal or slightly appreciable harm.\u201d <em>Kenner, supra </em>at 121, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Abutters are entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are \u201caggrieved\u201d persons under the Zoning Act and, therefore, have standing to challenge a decision of a zoning board of appeals.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11 (presumption of standing conferred on \u201cparties in interest,\u201d who include \u201cabutters\u201d). See also <em>Marashlian, supra; Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Ass\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 106, 111 (1995); <em>Marotta </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Revere, </em>336 Mass. 199, 204 (1957). However, an adverse party can challenge an abutter\u2019s presumption of standing by offering evidence \u201cwarranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact.\u201d <em>Marinelli </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, </em>440 Mass. 255, 258 (2003). See <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, supra </em>(presumption rebutted when defendant \u201cchallenges a plaintiff\u2019s status as an aggrieved person <em>and offers evidence supporting his or her challenge\u201d </em>[emphasis in original]). See also <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 34. The presumption of aggrievement conferred on abutters does not shift the burden of proof on standing. See <em>id. </em>at 34-35 &amp; n.20. The plaintiff always bears the burden of proving aggrievement necessary to confer standing; an abutter\u2019s presumption of standing simply places on the adverse party the initial burden of going forward with evidence. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">If a defendant offers enough evidence to warrant a finding contrary to the presumed fact, the presumption of aggrievement is rebutted, and the plaintiff must prove standing by putting forth credible evidence to substantiate the allegations. See <em>Kenner, supra </em>at 118; <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>A.L. Prime Energy Consultants, </em>451 Mass. 539, 543 &amp; n.11 (2008); <em>Marashlian, supra. </em>This requires that the plaintiff \u201cestablish \u2014 by direct facts and not by speculative personal opinion \u2014 that his injury is special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.\u201d <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 33, quoting <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, supra </em>at 132. See <em>Kenner, supra </em>at 118, 120. At that juncture, the jurisdictional issue of standing will be decided on the basis of all the evidence, with no benefit to the plaintiff from the presumption of aggrievement. See <em>id. </em>at 118. See also <em>Marashlian, supra; Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, supra </em>at 131. \u201cStanding essentially becomes a question of fact for the judge.\u201d <em>Kenner, supra </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In contrast, when a defendant fails to offer evidence warranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact, the presumption of aggrievement is not rebutted, the abutter is deemed to have standing, and the case proceeds on the merits. See <em>Marinelli </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, supra </em>(where evidence insufficient to rebut presumption of aggrievement, plaintiff has standing to appeal from determination by board of appeals); <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Ass\u2019n, supra </em>(where no evidence presented to rebut presumption of standing, plaintiffs entitled to rely entirely on presumed status as aggrieved parties, and court has jurisdiction to review decision of board of appeals); <em>Valcourt </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Swansea, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 128 (1999) (where defendant fails to meet burden of producing evidence to rebut presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>standing, presumption remains operative and abutters are \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d within meaning of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476 (1986); <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Sancta Maria Hosp., 5 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 624, 629-631 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The crux of the present dispute is what evidence a defendant must produce, in the context of summary judgment, to rebut successfully the presumption of standing. First, and perhaps most simply, a defendant can rebut the presumption by showing that, as a matter of law, the claims of aggrievement raised by an abutter, either in the complaint or during discovery, are not interests that the Zoning Act is intended to protect. See <em>Kenner, supra </em>at 120, and cases cited (concerns about visual impact of proposed structure on abutting property generally insufficient to confer standing because not within scope of interests protected by G. L. c. 40A). See also <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 30-31 (preservation of real estate value of property abutting affordable housing development does not constitute cognizable basis for standing to challenge issuance of comprehensive permit where G. L. c. 40B not intended to protect such interest). An abutter can have no reasonable expectation of proving a legally cognizable injury where the Zoning Act and related zoning ordinances or bylaws do not offer protection from the alleged harm in the first instance. In such circumstances, the defendant will have rebutted the plaintiff\u2019s presumption of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Second, where an abutter <em>has </em>alleged harm to an interest protected by the zoning laws, a defendant can rebut the presumption of standing by coming forward with credible affirmative evidence that refutes the presumption. The evidence must \u201cwarrant!] a finding contrary to the presumed fact\u201d of aggrievement. <em>Marinelli </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, supra. </em>For example, the defendant may present affidavits of experts establishing that an abutter\u2019s allegations of harm are unfounded or de minimis. See <em>Kenner, supra </em>at 119-120. See also <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 23-24, 35.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such evidence, if believed, would contradict the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>presumed fact of aggrievement and, thus, rebut the plaintiff\u2019s presumption of standing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We acknowledged in <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 35, that, in the summary judgment context, \u201ca defendant is not <em>required </em>to present affirmative evidence that refutes a plaintiff\u2019s basis for standing\u201d (emphasis added). Rather, \u201c[i]t is enough that the moving party \u2018demonstrate!], by reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), [365 Mass. 824 (1974),] unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving\u2019 a legally cognizable injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 554 (1999). To rebut the presumption of standing in <em>Standerwick, </em>the developer presented the plaintiffs\u2019 own responses to discovery in which they conceded that they had no evidence to support various allegations of aggrievement. See <em>Standerwick, supra </em>at 24, 35-36. Where such admissions were made, the developer was entitled to rely on them as evidence to show that the plaintiffs had no factual basis for their claims of harm and, therefore, had no reasonable expectation of proving that they were \u201caggrieved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-37. We cautioned that \u201c[i]t is not sufficient for a defendant simply to file a motion for summary judgment, or to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. See <em>Valcourt </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Swansea, supra </em>(defendants\u2019 answer to abutters\u2019 complaint and memoranda of law opposing abutters\u2019 motions for summary judgment did not constitute evidence supporting challenge to presumptive standing). However, where a plaintiff acknowledges during discovery a lack of substantive evidence to establish a legally cognizable injury, a defendant may rely on those admissions to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s presumption of standing, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>presenting independent evidence that would warrant a finding of no aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Here, the Foggs enjoyed a presumption of standing to challenge the issuance of the building permit to the developer. The developer\u2019s strategy to rebut such presumption was not to present any affirmative evidence but, rather, to rely on its own legal arguments and on portions of the Foggs\u2019 deposition testimony. As to his allegations of aggrievement, George testified that he was damaged \u201cfinancially and esthetically\u201d by the configuration of 71 Spooner Road. He stated that \u201c[t]he house is crowded in and not [in] keeping with the other houses on the street and stands out in not a positive way . . . .\u201d George also testified that the house at 71 Spooner Road \u201cshuts off a view\u201d he had to his mother\u2019s property such that he could no longer keep track of entering and exiting vehicles. He acknowledged that he had not gotten \u201cany professional opinion\u201d as to how the value of his own house might be affected by the new construction. With regard to 71 Spooner Road, Frances testified that \u201c[i]t\u2019s too big a house on too small a lot. It\u2019s against the law.\u201d She also stated that it \u201cspoils [her] view\u201d and \u201ccauses traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Although not versed in the terminology of zoning law, the Foggs\u2019 testimony clearly indicates that one of their allegations of aggrievement<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was that construction of the house at 71 Spooner Road violated the density provisions of the zoning bylaw.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Foggs presented several photographs and a site plan of the area showing the 71 Spooner Road house in relation to their own properties. Simply put, they identified a legally cognizable injury. See <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeal of Boston, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 8, 11-12 (2009), <em>S.C., </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 394 (2012) (variances granted to defendant further exacerbated density problems that zoning code was meant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>address and, consequently, conferred standing on abutter as aggrieved person); <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 296 (2008) (where zoning bylaw designed to prevent congestion and overcrowding of land, abutter has cognizable legal interest in stopping further construction in overly dense zoning district). The developer\u2019s mere reliance on the Foggs\u2019 deposition testimony did not constitute evidence \u201cwarranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact\u201d of aggrievement. <em>Marinelli </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, supra. </em>Unlike in <em>Standerwick, </em>the developer did not show, through such deposition testimony, that the Foggs had no factual basis for their claim of harm, namely, the overcrowding of the 71 Spooner Road lot that negatively affected the density of the neighborhood. As we have stated, the initial burden of producing evidence was on the developer, not the Foggs, because they were presumed to be aggrieved. We conclude that the developer failed to rebut the Foggs\u2019 presumption of standing. Accordingly, because the Foggs were deemed to have standing, the judge properly eliminated that issue from the ensuing trial on the merits of the parties\u2019 complaints seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to rescind the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decision and order of the Land Court judge granting summary judgment to the Foggs on the issue of standing is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Given that the issue of standing was the only one raised by the developer in its brief before this court, the underlying merits of the case are not before us.

The Foggs\u2019 motion to intervene in the case pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 24, 365 Mass. 769 (1974), was denied. Ultimately, this court upheld the validity of the bylaw. <em>81 Spooner Rd.

The judge stated that it was unclear from the record whether George\u2019s property satisfied the 300-feet requirement, but, in any event, it was irrelevant whether he qualified as a party in interest. Only one of the parties in a zoning appeal must be an \u201caggrieved\u201d person under G. L. c. 40A to establish standing to challenge a zoning decision.
