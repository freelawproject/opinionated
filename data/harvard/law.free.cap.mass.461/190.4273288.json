Utils. (No. 1), ante </em>166 (2011) <em>(Alliance III),</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided today. The question is whether the Department of Public Utilities (department) committed error in denying the third motion filed by the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. (Alliance), to reopen the administrative record in the proceeding that we reviewed in <em>Alliance III, supra. </em>We remand the matter to the single justice to enter an order affirming the department\u2019s order denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On May 10, 2010, Massachusetts Electric Company and Nantucket Electric Company, each doing business as National Grid (collectively, National Grid), pursuant to \u00a7 83 of the Green Communities Act, St. 2008, c. 169, \u00a7 83 (\u00a7 83), filed with the department its petition for review and approval of the power purchase agreements (PPAs, or contracts) between National Grid and Cape Wind Associates, EEC (Cape Wind). On June 9, the department issued its order in D.P.U. 10-58 (2010) (D.P.U. 10-58), suspending the geographic limitation provision contained in the first paragraph of \u00a7 83. See <em>Alliance III, supra </em>at 170-171.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The evidentiary record in National Grid, D.P.U. 10-54 (2010) (D.P.U. 10-54), closed on October 1, 2010. On October 8 and 29,2010, the Alliance filed two separate motions in that proceeding to reopen the record and admit additional evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 22, 2010, the department issued its decision and final order in D.P.U. 10-54, approving the first of the two proposed PPAs between National Grid and Cape Wind, referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>as PPA-1. On the same date, the department issued a separate order denying the Alliance\u2019s two motions to reopen the record. On December 10, 2010, the Alliance and other parties that had intervened in D.P.U. 10-54 filed their appeals from the department\u2019s decision and order in that proceeding. See <em>Alliance III, supra </em>at 171. The Alliance did not appeal from the department\u2019s denial of its two motions to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On March 3, 2011, the Alliance filed a third motion to reopen the record in D.P.U. 10-54 to admit additional evidence. This motion, the subject of the present appeal, sought to introduce unredacted copies of documents filed with the department by NSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR) in connection with its petitions for approval of PPAs between it and three renewable energy developers (NSTAR filings or NSTAR PPAs).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The NSTAR PPAs were solicited and negotiated in connection with the revised REP process that no longer contained the geographic limitation provision requirements (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>The Alliance argued that the NSTAR filings were \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the determination whether PPA-1 was cost effective and in the public interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">On May 9, 2011, the department denied the Alliance\u2019s third motion to reopen. The department concluded in its decision that the Alliance had failed to demonstrate \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d or \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen the record, as required by the department\u2019s regulations, 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11(7) and (8) (2008). On May 12, the Alliance filed its petition of appeal in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. A single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>As indicated, the single issue raised here is whether the department properly denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Alliance\u2019s third motion to reopen the record in D.P.U. 10-54. The parties differ on the appropriate standard of review. The Alliance argues that this case is one of constitutional dimension because its motion to reopen sought to introduce evidence relevant to the claim advanced in D.P.U. 10-54 that in approving PPA-1, the department violated the commerce clause of the United States Constitution; the presence of this constitutional issue, the argument continues, obligates this court to conduct an independent review of law and fact. The department contends that the independent review standard applies only where there is a claim that rates set by the department are confiscatory, and because no claim of unconstitutional confiscation was raised by any party in D.P.U. 10-54, the appropriate standard of review is one of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We need not resolve this dispute over the standard of review, because the Alliance\u2019s motion to reopen the record in fact did not concern the commerce clause claim raised by the Alliance and other interveners in D.P.U. 10-54. As discussed in <em>Alliance III, </em>the interveners\u2019 commerce clause argument in D.P.U. 10-54 focused on the department\u2019s approval of National Grid\u2019s contract, PPA-1, that had been negotiated and executed while \u00a7 83\u2019s allegedly unconstitutionally geographic limitation provision was still operative and casting its shadow over the negotiation process. See <em>Alliance III, supra </em>at 172-173. In its motion to reopen, however, the Alliance never claimed that the information contained in the NSTAR filings touched on National Grid\u2019s negotiation of the contract with Cape Wind or the department\u2019s approval of that negotiation. Rather, the contention advanced was that the NSTAR filings related to the cost effectiveness of PPA-1. The issue whether PPA-1 is \u201ccost effective\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 83 simply does not implicate any constitutional interest or right that the Alliance is entitled to assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Accordingly, we apply the more deferential standard of review that generally applies to procedural decisions by agencies on whether to reopen an administrative record. See, e.g., <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 420 (2001) (\u201cwe accord agencies broad discretion in deciding whether to [reopen a record and hearing to present additional evidence], and an agency\u2019s refusal to reopen is not disturbed absent an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>abuse of that discretion\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In doing so, we look to see whether the record shows that the department examined the merits of reopening and properly concluded that reopening was not warranted. See <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>448 Mass. 45, 50 n.6 (2006) <em>(Alliance I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">b. <em>Decision not to reopen. </em>The department\u2019s regulations on the filing of documents subsequent to a hearing and reopening require the applicant to make a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11(7),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (8).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In determining whether there is \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen the record, the department considers whether \u201cthe proponent has previously unknown or undisclosed information, regarding a material issue, that would likely have a significant impact on the decision already rendered.\u201d Machise v\u00ed. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., D.P.U. 87-AD-12-B, at 4 (1990), citing Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., D.P.U. 85-207-A (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In denying the Alliance\u2019s motion, the department explained that when a party seeks to reopen the record after the agency has issued its final decision, the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard should be, and is, more difficult to meet than when the request to reopen comes before the agency\u2019s final decision and order. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>reasoned that the discretion to reopen a closed proceeding should be exercised sparingly in order to preserve the \u201cresolving force\u201d of final administrative decisions, citing <em>Stowe </em>v. Bologna, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 616 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>415 Mass. 20 (1993) (\u201cthe power [to reopen an administrative proceeding] must be sparingly used if administrative decisions are to have resolving force on which persons can rely\u201d). The mere availability of additional evidence is insufficient; instead, the moving party must demonstrate \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d that warrant reopening, so as to preserve finality. See <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 433 (1997) (\u201cagencies have inherent power to reopen their concluded proceedings in compelling situations as justice may require\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Turning to the substance of the Alliance\u2019s motion, the department stated that the NSTAR filings \u201cwould not likely have a significant impact\u201d on its decision in D.RU. 10-54. Specifically, the department found that the record in D.RU. 10-54 contained \u201cconcrete evidence on the pricing of other available renewable energy projects,\u201d and therefore that the NSTAR filings would be \u201ccumulative at best\u201d on the issue of cost effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Nothing about the reasons cited by the department constitute an abuse of discretion. See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envt\u2019l Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>387 Mass. 372, 385 (1982), and cases cited (\u201cWhen the issues and facts have been argued at length in adjudicatory hearings, and when the agency has made a reasoned record describing why rehearing was denied, we give great deference to the decision denying rehearing\u201d). We agree with the department that finality of administrative decisions is a significant concern \u2014 significant to the parties, to the agency, and to the public served by the agency. See <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 616. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 637 (1997) (in criminal context, in accommodating needs of community and procedural rights of defendant in criminal case, \u201conce the regular procedures have run their course the presumption tilts heavily toward finality\u201d). Accordingly, the department stood on firm ground in requiring demonstration of a compelling reason to reopen a hearing after the agency\u2019s final decision had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The department permissibly could determine as well that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>evidence proffered by the Alliance was cumulative of what the record in D.P.U. 10-54 already contained. See <em>Sudbury </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>351 Mass. 214, 219-220 (1966) (\u201cthe department has a wide discretion in ruling on evidence [and] may exclude unduly repetitious evidence\u201d). The Alliance argues that the NSTAR filings contain \u201cpreviously unknown or undisclosed\u201d information relating to the price disparities between Cape Wind and other, including out-of-State, renewable energy resources. This information, according to the Alliance, would have a significant impact on the department\u2019s decision to approve PPA-1 in D.P.U. 10-54, because information demonstrating there is an adequate supply of alternative renewable energy sources at prices well below that of Cape Wind directly cuts against the department\u2019s finding that Cape Wind is cost effective. The record in D.P.U. 10-54, however, already did include evidence relating to the pricing of other available renewable energy resources located both outside and within the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The department did not abuse its broad discretion in declining to reopen a closed record in a completed pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ceeding in order to accept more information on the same points.

Utils., </em>406 Mass. 217, 227 (1989), a case similarly raising a question whether the department committed error in not reopening a concluded administrative hearing. We stated: \u201cIn general, administrative agencies have broad discretion over procedural aspects of matters before them. The decision whether to reopen hearings is one such procedural matter on which we have accorded agencies a great deal of flexibility. In this case, this principle is additionally embodied in the department\u2019s regulation governing the reopening of hearings. . . . Therefore, we will not disturb the department\u2019s decision not to reopen hearings without the demonstration of error of law or abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Title 220 Code Mass.

Nevertheless, that record is before this court in <em>Alliance III, supra, </em>and we have reviewed it in that context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The Alliance asserts that apart from addressing the issue of actual cost, the proffered evidence from the NSTAR filings would have shown that the department, in determining that the contract was cost effective, had erroneously and seriously overstated the value of the unquantified benefits (e.g., size, capacity factor, location, and stage of development) associated with PPA-1. Specifically, the Alliance argues that in comparison with the NSTAR contracts, PPA-1 offered relatively weak unquantified benefits to National Grid\u2019s ratepayers. Our ability to consider this argument is essentially precluded by the fact that the NSTAR filings are not part of the department\u2019s certified record in this case. In reviewing the department\u2019s decision, we are confined to the administrative record certified by the agency. See G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (\u201cNo evidence beyond that contained in the record shall be introduced before the court. . .\u201d). Cf. <em>Pentucket Manor Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>394 Mass. 233, 234 n.3 (1985) (review of administrative decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, generally confined to agency record). The Alliance\u2019s inclusion of the three NSTAR filings in its record appendix on appeal does not suffice to place them in the record. To the extent the Alliance describes in its brief the unquantified benefits associated with the NSTAR contracts, the description is fairly conclusory and does not persuade us that the department erred in determining that the information contained in the NSTAR filings would be cumulative. Even a brief review of the record in D.P.U. 10-54 reveals exhibits and testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>that address issues such as capacity factor, location, and related transmission costs in connection with renewable energy projects in the New England and New York areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
