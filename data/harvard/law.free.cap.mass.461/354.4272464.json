L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (c), and as a subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As proof that the substance was cocaine, the Commonwealth introduced a certificate of drug analysis (certificate) and the testimony of a police detective who stated that a field test he had conducted was positive. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>appeal, the defendant claimed that, pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532, 2542 (2009) (Melendez-Diaz), the admission of a certificate without the testimony of the chemical analyst violated his right to confrontation. The Appeals Court affirmed his conviction, holding that the field test and other circumstances rendered the admission of the certificate harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 189, 192 (2010). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review and paired this case for argument with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Billings, post </em>362 (2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we conclude that, in the specific circumstances of this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was not so overwhelming as to nullify the effect of the erroneously admitted certificate, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><em>Facts. </em>At trial, Detective Robert John Morrissey, Jr., of the Brockton police department testified for the Commonwealth as follows. He had been working in \u201claw enforcement\u201d in Brockton for twelve years and, in January, 2005, was \u201cin the narcotics unit\u201d where he had just begun an undercover investigation of drug dealing at a multifamily apartment building. There was no other testimony concerning his experience and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Over the course of two nights, Morrissey had made three drug purchases at the apartment building, involving two apartments. The defendant was not present at any of these transactions. Morrissey returned on the third night \u201c[ljooking to purchase some cocaine.\u201d After he knocked on the door to one apartment, the defendant appeared in the doorway to an apartment which was across the hall, and asked what the detective needed. Morrissey told him that he was looking for \u201ctwo for thirty,\u201d which, Morrissey testified, meant \u201ctwo twenty dollar rocks for thirty dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendant responded by asking questions designed to determine whether Morrissey was a police officer. In response to a question concerning whom he knew in the \u201carea,\u201d Morrissey gave the names of individuals from whom he had purchased drugs on the previous two nights. Apparently satisfied, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ant reached into his pocket and removed a clear plastic bag. Morrissey stated that the bag had \u201cabout forty smaller plastic bags with rock in there.\u201d The defendant handed Morrissey two small bags of \u201cwhite rock.\u201d Once the transaction was complete, at Morrissey\u2019s request, the defendant provided a telephone number so that Morrissey could make future purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Morrissey returned to the police station where he conducted a field test on the substance. He testified that the \u201cresults . . . were positive\u201d and that he then \u201cturned [the substance] in for further testing.\u201d There was no further testimony about the field test. Concerning the substances themselves, at trial, the Commonwealth asked Morrissey only whether he recognized \u201ca cellophane bag with some writing on the outside.\u201d Morrissey\u2019s only response was to state that it was the \u201ctwo plastic bags that I purchased from [the defendant]\u201d and stated that they were the bags that were sent for testing. The two bags were admitted in evidence, accompanied by a certificate attesting to their containing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The defendant did not testify; his defense was mistaken identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>In order to prove distribution of cocaine, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance distributed was, in fact, cocaine. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 361 (2010). The Commonwealth does not contest that the introduction of the certificate identifying the substance as cocaine, without the testimony of the chemical analyst, violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra. </em>Where a certificate is admitted in evidence in violation of the Constitution, our review presumes that a reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction is required unless the Commonwealth makes an affirmative showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluellen, </em>456 Mass. 517, 526 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 360. \u201cThe \u2018essential question\u2019 in analyzing harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt is \u2018whether the error had, or might have had, an effect on the [fact finder] and whether the error contributed to or might have contributed to the [findings of guilty].\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perrot, </em>407 Mass. 539, 549 (1990). \u201cThe standard of harmlessness beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>able doubt is a stringent one . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 361, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 872 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Proof that a substance is a particular drug \u201cmay be made by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987). However, the Commonwealth must show that other properly admitted evidence of guilt was \u201cso powerful as to \u2018nullify any effect\u2019 \u201d that the improperly admitted evidence \u201cmight have had\u201d on the fact finder or the findings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 362, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>455 Mass. 676, 704 n.44 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We give little weight to a defendant\u2019s decision not to challenge the certificate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra </em>at 355, 367-368. In addition, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving every element of its case cannot be transferred to the defendant because of his counsel\u2019s choice of defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367-368, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>398 Mass. 264, 269 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Here, the Commonwealth asserts that there was ample circumstantial evidence to overcome the prejudice caused by the introduction of the certificate. Relying on the factors established by this court for assessing whether an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, supra </em>at 701,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Commonwealth asserts that the certificate was cumulative of its other evidence, i.e., Morrissey\u2019s testimony which the Commonwealth characterizes as \u201cexpert,\u201d the field test he conducted, and the defendant\u2019s behavior. It also argues that the admission of the certificate bore no relation to the defense of mistaken identity; that the judge made no reference to the certificate during the trial and neither party made reference to it in closing argument (neither side presented an opening statement). In support of its argument, the Commonwealth asserts that this case is controlled by our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 829-832 (2009) (admission of certificate of drug analysis harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>less beyond reasonable doubt where there was expert testimony and field tests were conducted on cocaine).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra </em>at 811, 831, we recited the following facts in our determination that the admission of certificates of drug analysis was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt: the defendant had been the subject of an investigation for more than one year; there were controlled drug purchases by \u201cmultiple confidential informants\u201d as well as by an undercover police officer to whom the defendant identified the substance he sold as \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine; an officer with twenty-five years\u2019 experience in narcotics investigations field tested the substances after each purchase and each time it tested positive for cocaine; a second officer, who had approximately seventeen years\u2019 experience in narcotics investigations and had investigated \u201chigh hundreds\u201d of cocaine distribution cases, found cocaine in the defendant\u2019s vehicle and conducted a field test on it with positive results; and a third officer with over thirteen years\u2019 experience conducting drug searches with a narcotics detection canine not only testified that the substance in the vehicle appeared to him to be cocaine, but the canine had been used to find the cocaine in the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 811, 831. The facts in the <em>Connolly </em>case are distinguishable from the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">As an initial matter, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that, like the <em>Connolly </em>case, Morrissey was an \u201cexpert\u201d in the identification of cocaine and, therefore, his opinion was substantial circumstantial evidence as to the nature of the substance. At trial, Morrissey only stated that he had been in law enforcement for twelve years and was in the narcotics unit at the time of the investigation. He was not asked about his specific training in the identification of cocaine; indeed, he was not asked about any specific training or experience in narcotics investigation. He gave no objective criteria on which he based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>statement that the substance was \u201crock,\u201d which we assume to be \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine, although there was no testimony to that effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>460 Mass. 564, 577 (2011) (admission of certificate of drug analysis identifying marijuana not harmless beyond reasonable doubt where neither investigating officer nor drug distribution expert identified substance based on training and experience).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Here, the only evidence regarding the chemical composition of the substance, other than the certificate, was Morrissey\u2019s cursory testimony that the substance had tested \u201cpositive\u201d (although he did not even state what it tested positive for) after which it was sent \u201cfor further testing.\u201d The Commonwealth did not present any evidence concerning what kind of field test kit Morrissey used or whether Morrissey was trained in its proper use. Indeed, Morrissey\u2019s testimony reasonably could be understood either as a statement that he relied on the laboratory test to identify the substance or as a recitation of the protocol the Brockton police had in place because they were not confident that the results of a field test were accurate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to establish Morrissey\u2019s expertise or to offer any details about the field test that he conducted reveals the extent to which it was relying on the certificate to prove that the substance was cocaine, an understandable decision during a trial that occurred prior to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Melendez-Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The Commonwealth next points to the defendant\u2019s behavior as further circumstantial evidence that would help nullify the effects of the certificate, claiming: that the defendant recognized that \u201crock\u201d was slang for \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine and understood the meaning of Morrissey\u2019s \u201cstreet\u201d jargon when he requested \u201ctwo for thirty\u201d; the defendant had a bag filled with forty smaller bags of white substance in his pocket; he questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Morrissey as a \u201csecurity measureQ\u201d; and he gave Morrissey his telephone number. The Commonwealth further argues that the defendant\u2019s agreement to sell the \u201crocks\u201d to Morrissey was a \u201csubstantive admission\u201d that the substance was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We conclude that this evidence leads to the conclusion that the defendant took part in what appeared to be a drug <em>transaction </em>but does not go to whether the substance was, in fact, cocaine. Indeed, the defendant may have taken these measures even if the substance was not cocaine, because he could have been charged with selling a counterfeit narcotic. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32G. There also was no evidence introduced that the telephone number the defendant gave Morrissey was genuine, which is particularly relevant where the defendant offered a telephone number only after Morrissey requested it. There was no testimony that the defendant made any admission about the chemical composition of the substance and there was no stipulation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fluellen, 456 Mass. 517, 526-527 (2010) (although premise of defense involved admission that substance was cocaine, admission of certificate not harmless beyond reasonable doubt); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Muniz, </em>456 Mass. 166, 173-174 n.7 (2010) (absent stipulation, whether substance was cocaine essential element of crime that Commonwealth must prove beyond reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Commonwealth also argues that the certificate had no relationship to the defense of mistaken identity. Although a factor in determining whether the admission of the certificate was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the nature of the defense was not consequential in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 367-368 (2010), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>398 Mass. 264, 269 (1986) (Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving every element of case cannot be transferred to defendant because of counsel\u2019s choice of defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Here, the evidence of the chemical content of the substance was not so powerful as to nullify <em>any </em>effect of the erroneously admitted certificate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nelson, supra </em>(contrasting issue of sufficiency of evidence with issue whether certificate harmless beyond reasonable doubt). There was no admission, no testimony concerning Morrissey\u2019s expertise in any aspect of narcotics investigation or identification, cursory testimony concerning the result of the field test that was sent for \u201cfurther testing,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s behavior indicated only that a drug transaction appeared to have taken place; therefore, we cannot say that admission of the certificate was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluellen, supra </em>at 527 (where certificates \u201cformed a tainted \u2018core\u2019 of evidence from which the rest of the Commonwealth\u2019s case radiated\u201d admission not harmless beyond reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment is reversed, the findings set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-15\">He was found not guilty of a drug offense in a school zone.
