L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the Commonwealth violated his right to confront the witnesses against him when it introduced evidence from laboratory drug tests through the testimony of a substitute analyst rather than through the analyst who performed the tests. He contends further that the trial judge erred in admitting certain hearsay statements. Finally, he argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. Although much of the challenged testimony was erroneously admitted, this testimony did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice; nor was the defendant denied the effective assistance of counsel. We therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The following are the facts the jury could have found; we reserve certain details for later discussion. On March 2, 1994, Pittsfield police officers stopped a car driven by the defendant. The car was leased in the names of two other men, one of whom, the front seat passenger, was sixteen years old. Officers searched the vehicle and found three large plastic bags that contained a substance resembling \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. The police also seized a pager and two \u201cwalkie-talkies\u201d from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The defendant and his passenger were then arrested and given Miranda warnings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the presence of another Pittsfield police officer, Detective Terrence Donnelly asked the defendant whether the police had found all the cocaine in the vehicle. The defendant told Donnelly, \u201cI think that there [were] only the three bags.\u201d Donnelly recorded this statement in a near contemporaneous report, which was reviewed by the other officer, Sergeant Glen Decker.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The same evening, Donnelly \u201cfield tested\u201d the substance in the seized bags and weighed the substance and bags on a scale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>apparently in Decker\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The test indicated that the substance was cocaine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The seized bags were sent to the Department of Public Health drug laboratory (laboratory), where samples of their contents were weighed and tested by Paul Jaszek, who was then a senior chemist, or supervisor, at the laboratory. Jaszek\u2019s analysis proceeded in two parts. First, Jaszek verified the net weight of the substance by subtracting the estimated weight of the plastic bags, based on a sample of them, from the gross weight of the bags and the substance combined. He recorded this net weight as 19.90 grams. Next, Jaszek confirmed that the seized substance was in fact cocaine. He did this by running samples of the substance through a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. The chromatograph generated a printout of the \u201cretention times\u201d of each compound in the sample. The mass spectrometer generated a printout of the \u201cfragmentation pattern\u201d of the sample. Both sets of results were consistent with the expected results for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Trial was scheduled for July 7, 1994. However, the defendant defaulted, remaining a fugitive until February, 2010. In the interim, Jaszek retired and Donnelly passed away. Donnelly\u2019s reports, Jaszek\u2019s notes and test results, and the machine data generated by Jaszek\u2019s tests were preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">At the May, 2010, trial, the laboratory\u2019s then senior chemist, James Hanchett, testified in the retired Jaszek\u2019s place. Hanchett had been a drug analyst for over thirty years, the majority of those as Jaszek\u2019s colleague. Jaszek had trained Hanchett and for some period of time had been Hanchett\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Hanchett\u2019s testimony covered (1) the procedure Jaszek followed in weighing and analyzing the contents of the bags; (2) the conclusions that Jaszek drew from this analysis; and (3) the conclusions that Hanchett \u201cwould have made\u201d in Jaszek\u2019s position. Because Hanchett did not retest or reweigh the seized substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>himself, his testimony was based on information contained in Jaszek\u2019s notes and reports as well as the machine printouts generated by Jaszek\u2019s analysis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Hanchett testified that he had reviewed each of these documents, the prosecutor asked him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAgain, in reviewing that data, can you form an independent opinion that the substance[] that went through the machine after reviewing the data was Class B, cocaine?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">A.: \u201cYes, I would have made the same decision as [Jaszek] made calling it cocaine . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Hanchett stated also that he agreed with Jaszek\u2019s method of weighing the seized substance, and that he too would have concluded the substance weighed 19.90 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s other main witness was Decker, who testified to the events of the night of the defendant\u2019s arrest, sixteen years prior to trial. Decker stated that he could not recall the details of the conversation he witnessed between Donnelly and the defendant. He was then allowed to read a redacted version of Donnelly\u2019s report to the jury. The report, however, did more than summarize the conversation Decker had forgotten. It recited the full details of the stop, search, booking, and arrest, details that Decker was able to testify to without assistance from Donnelly\u2019s report. Subsequently, the defendant entered a redacted copy of Donnelly\u2019s report into evidence. Defense counsel believed that the report tended to show that the defendant\u2019s passenger was the true owner of the drugs, consistent with the defendant\u2019s theory at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>We consider first the standard of review applicable to the defendant\u2019s two claims of error: violation of his confrontation clause rights through Hanchett\u2019s testimony and improper admission of hearsay testimony through Decker\u2019s use of recorded recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">While trial counsel objected to Hanchett\u2019s testimony, it was on the basis of lack of foundation and was not targeted at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>propriety of such testimony under the confrontation clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the claim was not preserved. As to the hearsay claim, with one exception, see note 16, <em>infra, </em>the defendant did not object to the admission of the statements in police reports that he now contends are hearsay. Thus, this claim also was not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Accordingly, we review only for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, that is, to determine \u201cif the evidence and the case as a whole . . . [leave] us with a serious doubt that the defendant's] guilt [has] been fairly adjudicated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 356 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 646-647 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">b. <em>Substitute analyst\u2019s testimony on the identity of the cocaine. </em>The defendant\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that Hanchett\u2019s testimony as to the weight and composition of the cocaine seized from the vehicle violated the defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705, 2713 (2011) (Bullcoming). The Commonwealth does not dispute that Hanchett\u2019s testimony on direct examination as to Jaszek\u2019s conclusions and the raw data generated by Jaszek violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 786 (2010) <em>(Barbosa). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>However, the Commonwealth maintains that, consistent with <em>Barbosa, </em>the confrontation clause did not prevent Hanchett from testifying as to his independent opinion on the weight and composition of the cocaine. By contrast, the defendant maintains that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bullcoming </em>precludes such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">i. <em>Validity of </em>Barbosa <em>in light of </em>Bullcoming. The Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, requires that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The confrontation clause \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused \u2014 in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 . . . \u2018Testimony,\u2019 in turn, is typically \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51 (2004), quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009) (Melendez-Diaz), the United States Supreme Court addressed whether the conclusions of forensic scientists constitute testimonial statements. The Court determined that certificates verifying the conclusions of such tests \u201care incontrovertibly a \u2018solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2532, quoting <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra. </em>Thus, the Court held, such certificates cannot be admitted in evidence without providing defendants with an opportunity to confront the forensic scientists who author them.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Nevertheless, it was \u201cnot plain . . . whether <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>which involved the admission into evidence of affidavits containing testimonial hearsay, would necessarily require the government to call [an analyst] to testify [where] her report [is] not admitted into evidence,\u201d but is instead relied on as the basis for the independent opinion of a second analyst. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pablo, </em>625 F.3d 1285, 1295 (10th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In light of this uncertainty, our cases since <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>have distinguished between a substitute analyst\u2019s testimony as to independent opinions based on data generated by a nontestifying analyst, and a substitute analyst\u2019s testimony as to the testing analyst\u2019s reports and conclusions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Barbosa, supra, </em>we concluded that a substitute deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analyst should not have been allowed to read into evidence the results of DNA testing where the relevant tests were performed by an absent colleague. We concluded also that it was error to allow the analyst to testify as to the conclusions her absent colleague drew from that data. <em>Id. </em>However, we held that the substitute analyst could testify as to her own conclusions derived from the data generated by the original analyst\u2019s tests. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 390-391 (2008) (independent opinion of substitute medical examiner).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The defendant suggests that <em>Barbosa </em>is called into question by <em>Bullcoming, supra, </em>the most recent decision of the United States Supreme Court to address the admissibility of forensic evidence under the confrontation clause. Yet, unlike <em>Barbosa </em>and unlike the instant case, <em>Bullcoming </em>is not a case \u201cin which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Bullcoming, supra </em>at 2722 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part). In <em>Bullcoming, </em>the analyst who had performed a blood alcohol test on the defendant\u2019s blood sample was placed on unpaid leave shortly before trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Over objection, the State admitted the testing analyst\u2019s report as a business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>record through a testifying analyst. <em>Id. </em>at 2712. The Court observed that the substitute analyst did not purport to offer any \u201c \u2018independent opinion\u2019 concerning Bullcoming\u2019s [blood alcohol concentration]\u201d on which the substitute could be cross-examined. <em>Id. </em>at 2716. Rather, the evidence against the accused was limited to the testing analyst\u2019s \u201ccertification,\u201d which was directly introduced in evidence. <em>Id. </em>The Court remanded the case for a determination whether the admission of the report was harmless error. <em>Id. </em>at 2719 &amp; n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The testimony offered by the prosecutor in <em>Bullcoming </em>would have been equally improper under long-standing Massachusetts law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 392-393, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, </em>434 Mass. 839, 857 (2001) (\u201cWe adhere to our position that an expert witness may not, on direct examination, present the specifics of hearsay information on which she has relied in reaching her opinion\u201d). Thus, in <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 786, while we permitted the substitute analyst\u2019s independent opinion testimony, we specified that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was . . . violated by [substitute] testimony . . . which informed the jury that [the testing analyst] also shared [the substitute\u2019s] opinion.\u201d This, essentially, was a different way of stating the central holding of <em>Bullcoming: </em>that a substitute analyst cannot testify to, or otherwise introduce, the original analyst\u2019s reports and conclusions on direct examination. Because <em>Barbosa </em>is in accord with this holding, the defendant errs in maintaining that <em>Bullcoming </em>prevents its continued application.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendant argues that the opinion testimony of a substitute analyst cannot fairly be characterized as \u201cindependent,\u201d because the accuracy of any such opinion depends entirely on the accuracy of the testing analyst\u2019s procedure. See <em>Derr </em>v. <em>State, </em>422 Md. 211 (2011). He contends that this dependence prevents meaningful cross-examination of the substitute analyst, who cannot speak to the accuracy of the testing process and procedures actually employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">A substitute analyst who offers an independent opinion can, however, be cross-examined meaningfully in at least two ways. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>First, such an analyst is subject to cross-examination on the general risk of error in forensic testing, whether introduced through carelessness, incompetence, or fraud. See <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2536-2537 (discussing such risks); National Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 37 (2009) (noting risk that \u201cscientific evidence [could] carr[y] a false sense of significance\u201d). Here, for example, among other possible sources of error, the defendant questioned Hanchett on the risk that the testing analyst might have tested the wrong vial, the general level of training of analysts at the laboratory, and the quality of the equipment used.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Second, a substitute analyst, basing an independent opinion on data generated by a prior analyst, can be cross-examined on many of the specific risks that could lead to an erroneous conclusion concerning the identity and weight of a substance at issue in a particular case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Bullcoming, supra </em>at 2715 (noting testifying analyst who did not offer independent opinion could not be cross-examined as to \u201cthe particular test and testing process . . . employed,\u201d with which he had no familiarity). An expert witness offering an independent opinion, however, can permissibly rely on data only to the extent that this data is \u201creasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions.\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 527-528 (1986), quoting Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 703. Reasonable reliance, in turn, implies that the expert will have ascertained that the data on which he or she relies are adequate and appropriate to the task and were prepared in conformity with accepted professional \u2014 here scientific \u2014 practices and procedures. See <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 791 (\u201ca conclusory opinion alone may not be a permissible basis on which an expert may rest an opinion\u201d). See also <em>Palandjian </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>446 Mass. 100, 107-108 (2006) (\u201ceven if the methodology employed by an expert is generally reliable, ... the trial judge, acting as gatekeeper, [must] determine whether the conclusions . . . have a reliable factual basis\u201d); <em>Wing </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>359 Mass. 286, 290 (1971) (testimony based on hearsay study admissible where expert had \u201cverified\u201d study and was thus not offering opinion \u201cof another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">A substitute analyst may accordingly be cross-examined on the data on which that analyst purports to have relied reasonably, the basis on which he or she concluded that such data were adequate and appropriate to the task, and the basis for concluding that the data had been prepared in conformity with relevant accepted professional standards, inquiries that implicate the manner in which the testing analyst performed his or her work.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See generally <em>In re </em>A.B., 999 A.2d 36, 43 (D.C. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Indeed, cases since <em>Barbosa </em>illustrate meaningful use of cross-examination of a substitute expert analyst offering independent opinion testimony not just on the general risks of error inherent in forensic testing, but also on the strength of the particular evidence against a defendant. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. 207, 239 (2010) (\u201cDefense counsel made extensive use of the data prepared by [original DNA analyst]\u201d to buttress \u201ctheory that a third party committed the murder\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 343 (2011) (\u201cdefense counsel engaged in a detailed cross-examination of [substitute analyst], eventually placing significant weight on [that analyst\u2019s] testimony in his closing argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Cross-examination of a substitute analyst with an independent opinion will not, of course, address every risk of bias or error in the forensic testing forming the basis of that opinion. Cf. <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2537 (cross-examination may cause \u201cthe analyst who provides false results . . . , under oath in open court, [to] reconsider his false testimony\u201d). However, the Constitution has not yet been construed to require the testimony of every person who might conceivably have compromised the reliability of the evidence introduced against a defendant. See <em>id. </em>at 2532 n.1 (\u201cnot . . . everyone who laid hands on the evidence must be called\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Of necessity, the adequacy of a defendant\u2019s opportunity for meaningful cross-examination of a particular expert witness can be ascertained only on a case-specific basis. As a general proposition, however, and consistent with <em>Barbosa, </em>we discern no reason to conclude either that cross-examination of a substitute analyst offering an independent opinion cannot be meaningful or that the opinion offered cannot fairly be characterized as independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">ii. <em>Applicability of </em>Barbosa. The defendant argues that <em>Barbosa </em>should not be extended from DNA testing to the drug composition testing performed by Jaszek. He argues that forensic drug test results are so straightforward that the substitute analyst conducts no \u201cmeaningful analysis\u201d but instead serves as a mere conduit for conclusions compelled by raw data generated by the first analyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The defendant provides no support for his assertion that the results of drug composition tests require less independent interpretation than the results of DNA tests.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is nothing in the appellate record as to the content of the notes, test results, machine generated data, or reports reviewed by Hanchett, and the defendant makes no argument concerning how these might differ from the counterpart material reviewed by a DNA analyst.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant has not shown any reason that <em>Barbosa </em>should be distinguished in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We note also that Hanchett had a \u201cpersonal, albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.\u201d <em>Bullcoming, supra </em>at 2722 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part). As a senior chemist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>with over thirty years\u2019 experience at the laboratory, Hanchett was intimately familiar with its policies and procedures. Further, while Hanchett was not Jaszek\u2019s supervisor or otherwise responsible for reviewing Jaszek\u2019s work, compare <em>Pendergrass </em>v. <em>State, </em>913 N.E.2d 703, 708 (Ind. 2009), Hanchett had a long working relationship with Jaszek, which terminated only at Jaszek\u2019s retirement. Accordingly, Hanchett was likely familiar with Jaszek\u2019s reputation for veracity and diligence. Compare <em>Bullcoming, supra </em>at 2715 (noting substitute analyst \u201chad no knowledge . . . whether incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty accounted for [testing analyst\u2019s] removal from his work station\u201d). Compare also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>442 Mass. 185, 198 (2004) (discussing scope of permissible reputation evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Hanchett\u2019s testimony reflects that he was not merely describing Jaszek\u2019s tests and results to the jury but also stating his independent view on the import of those results. Certainly, many of the questions that the prosecutor posed to Hanchett were improper, even though they did not elicit objection at trial. The prosecutor inquired extensively as to the testing procedures that Jaszek used or likely would have employed and failed to target with sufficient precision Hanchett\u2019s independent opinion on the identity of the sample. Instead, Hanchett was allowed broad leeway to opine on what \u201cPaul [Jaszek] tested\u201d and the \u201cdecision^] . . . Paul made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Nevertheless, the prosecutor did repeatedly ask Hanchett whether he \u201cwork[ed] through the numbers\u201d himself, whether he \u201cform[ed] an independent opinion\u201d as to the composition of the tested sample, and whether, \u201cbased on [his] observations and reading, . . . each of those six individual pieces that were sampled were all positive for . . . cocaine.\u201d These questions required Hanchett to do more than merely reiterate Jaszek\u2019s conclusions. Thus, on more than one occasion, the substitute analyst was asked for, and provided, his independent, expert opinion. There was no confrontation clause error in the admission of this portion of Hanchett\u2019s testimony. See <em>Barbosa, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\"><em>c. Substitute analyst testimony on the weight of the cocaine. </em>While Hanchett could testify permissibly to his independent opinion on the identity of the seized substance as cocaine, his opinion on the weight of the substance was admitted in error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Where the conclusion to be drawn from given data is obvious to a layperson, expert testimony does not assist the trier of fact, and opinion evidence is therefore improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Little, 453 Mass. 766, 768 (2009). As discussed, <em>supra, </em>Jaszek\u2019s recorded observations of weight were inadmissible through Hanchett on direct examination. See <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 786. Hanchett\u2019s testimony did not augment these otherwise inadmissible data by expertise. Rather, he performed simple arithmetic well within the jury\u2019s grasp. See <em>Bullcoming, supra </em>at 2714. Accordingly, it was error to allow Hanchett to testify to the weight of the drugs and to opine that this weight was almost six grams over the statutory limit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">d. <em>Recorded recollection. </em>The Commonwealth concedes that large portions of the two police reports read into evidence by Decker were admitted improperly as Decker\u2019s recorded recollection. Admission of evidence under the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule \u201cis only proper \u2018if . . . the witness has no revivadle recollection of the subject.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>449 Mass. 343, 366 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>427 Mass. 541, 543 (1998). Yet, Decker testified only that he had forgotten details of the defendant\u2019s conversations with Donnelly; he did not assert that he lacked a revivadle recollection of other aspects of the case also discussed in the reports. Accordingly, the reports\u2019 descriptions of the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s arrest, the search of the vehicle the defendant was driving, the fruits of that search, the booking process, and the false name provided by the defendant at booking each constituted inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">e. <em>Substantial risk of miscarriage of justice. </em>As previously noted, all but one of the defendant\u2019s errors were raised for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant is entitled to relief only \u201cif we have a serious doubt whether the result of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>might have been different had the error[s] not been made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>439 Mass. 340, 345 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 174 (1999). \u201cErrors of this magnitude are extraordinary events and relief is seldom granted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 297 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">This was not a case where the evidence was \u201climited to the word of the police,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 276 (2003), but one in which the properly admitted evidence of guilt was overwhelming. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>455 Mass. 676, 704 n.44 (2010). As to the identity of the seized substance as cocaine, the jury were aware of Hanchett\u2019s properly admitted independent opinion on the identity of the seized substance, as well as Decker\u2019s unchallenged testimony as to the police field testing. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 364 (2010) (admission of certificate of drug analysis was prejudicial error where no field testing was conducted and Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses explicitly relied on accuracy of certificate). As to the weight of the cocaine, Decker testified from his personal knowledge that the police officers themselves weighed the cocaine, estimating its weight at twenty grams.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As to the defendant\u2019s constructive possession of the cocaine, the properly admitted portions of the Donnelly report contained statements by the defendant suggesting that he was aware of the presence of cocaine in the vehicle. These statements were \u201cfurther supported] \u201d by evidence of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt: the defendant\u2019s prior default and his use of at least two aliases in interactions with the police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>783 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Further, \u201c[tjhe admission of cumulative evidence does not commonly\u201d call a guilty verdict into question. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bart B., </em>424 Mass. 911, 915 (1997), and cases cited. The reports relied on by Decker as recorded recollections were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>cumulative of Decker\u2019s testimony from his direct recollection. Similarly, Hanchett\u2019s testimony as to the weight of the sample was cumulative of Decker\u2019s testimony on weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Finally, as we have observed in other contexts, any prejudice resulting from the erroneous admission of evidence can be \u201climited by defense counsel\u2019s . . . use\u201d of that evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>456 Mass. 52, 62 (2010). Here, the defendant was able to use Jaszek\u2019s absence at trial to cast doubt on the results of the laboratory testing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, the defendant relied on the more detailed of the two reports to argue that the police had no evidence suggesting that the drugs were owned by the defendant rather than his passenger.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the improperly admitted testimony assisted the defendant in challenging aspects of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We therefore conclude that those portions of testimony by Hanchett and Decker that were admitted in error did not give rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">f. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>\u201c[T]he preferred method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 810 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alamides, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 344 (1994). \u201c[A]n ineffective assistance of counsel challenge made on the trial record alone is the weakest form of such a challenge because it is bereft of any explanation by trial counsel for his actions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peloquin, </em>437 Mass. 204, 210 n.5 (2002). For such a claim to be successful, counsel\u2019s inadequate performance must \u201cappear[] indisputably on the trial record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, supra </em>at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">As noted, the defendant\u2019s theory at trial was not that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>substance seized by the police was something other than cocaine, but that the seized drugs belonged to the passenger of the vehicle the defendant was driving. Because of this strategy, trial counsel did not seriously contest the weight and identity of the drugs. Instead, counsel directed the jury\u2019s attention to evidence supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s position that cocaine was found in a car the defendant was driving, to argue that nothing in that evidence conclusively demonstrated that the drugs belonged to the defendant rather than his passenger. On appeal, the defendant contends that this strategy was manifestly unreasonable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u201cA defendant is not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel simply because defense counsel\u2019s reasonable strategic choices fail to produce a verdict of not guilty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>406 Mass. 135, 139 (1989). However, counsel\u2019s strategic judgment cannot have been \u201cmanifestly unreasonable when made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCava, </em>438 Mass. 708, 713 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 822 (1998). A strategic judgment is likely unreasonable if trial counsel\u2019s strategy deprived the defendant of \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>432 Mass. 704, 719 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). But \u201c[njeither ineffectiveness nor a likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arise from counsel making the best he can out of the circumstances of the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hung Tan Vo, 427 </em>Mass. 464, 471 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Albeit before the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Bullcoming, </em>it was clear at the time of trial that Hanchett\u2019s testimony as to Jaszek\u2019s reports and conclusions was inadmissible under Massachusetts law. See <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 786. Nevertheless, even if the defendant had objected to this testimony, the Commonwealth would have been permitted to present Hanchett\u2019s independent opinion testimony, corroborated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>results of the field testing conducted by Decker and his partners. See <em>id. </em>In light of this admissible evidence, it was not unreasonable for counsel to conclude that a jury would have been more likely to believe that the drugs did not belong to the defendant than that the substance was not in fact cocaine. In sum, the trial record does not indisputably show that trial counsel\u2019s strategic choice was manifestly unreasonable when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\">An indictment charging a violation of the controlled substances laws within a school zone was nol prossed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-10\"><em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966), requires that a suspect \u201cbe warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed,\u201d prior to custodial interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Although Detective Terrence Donnelly performed the field test, the Commonwealth stated at trial that Sergeant Glen Decker had a personal recollection of the test; the defendant does not contest this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The test involved breaking an ampule of chemicals that react in the presence of cocaine into a test tube containing a sample of the seized substance.

Although counsel made reference to some of the concerns underlying the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent confrontation clause jurisprudence, he made no explicit reference to the confrontation clause, or the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, either in making his objection or at any other point during trial. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>66 Mass.

Further, counsel did not renew his objection after the prosecutor had asked Hanchett standard foundation questions. Thus, the judge and the Commonwealth would reasonably have inferred that the defendant\u2019s objection was what it purported to be: an objection to foundation alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Analogously, art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides that a criminal defendant \u201cshall have a right to . . . meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d In this respect, \u201cthe protection provided by art. 12 is coextensive with the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeOliveira, </em>447 Mass. 56, 57 n.1 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Several other State and Federal appellate courts have drawn an analogous distinction.
