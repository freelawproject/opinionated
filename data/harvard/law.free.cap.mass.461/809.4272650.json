L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (rc);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and unlawful possession of ammunition without a firearm identification (FID) card, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The indictments charging unlawful possession of a <em>firearm and </em>unlawful possession of ammunition further alleged that the defendant previously had been convicted of three violent crimes or serious drug offenses, thus subjecting him to enhanced sentencing as an armed career criminal under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G (c). One of the three alleged predicate offenses was simple assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. At a jury-waived subsequent offender trial, the judge found that the defendant had committed each of the three predicate offenses, and found him guilty of the subsequent offender portions of the indictments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to sentencing, the judge dismissed the indictment charging unlawful possession of ammunition without an FID card as duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The defendant appeals from his convictions of possession of a firearm and possession of a loaded firearm. We transferred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>case to this court on our own motion, and paired it for argument with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, ante </em>787 (2012) <em>(Gouse). </em>Relying on the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>130 S. Ct. 3020 (2010) <em>(McDonald), </em>and <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570 (2008) <em>(Heller), </em>the defendant argues that (1) the Commonwealth should bear the burden of proving that he did not possess a license to carry a firearm as an element of the crimes of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of a loaded firearm; and (2) G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>and <em>(n), </em>unduly restricts the right to keep and bear arms for the purposes of self-defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the reasons expressed in <em>Gouse, supra </em>at 799-808, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument and affirm his firearm convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The defendant also appeals from his conviction under the sentencing enhancement provision of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G (c), on the ground that the evidence presented in support of one of his three prior convictions, assault and battery, failed to establish that he had committed a \u201cviolent crime\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. Adopting the reasoning of the Appeals Court in its recent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 8 (2011) <em>(Colon), </em>we agree with the defendant. Consequently, we vacate the judgment of conviction under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G (c), as an armed career criminal based on three predicate offense convictions, and we remand the case for the entry of judgment and resentencing under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G <em>(b), </em>based on two predicate offense convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the limited facts relevant to our inquiry. On June 25, 2009, Detective Thomas Kakley and Sergeant Kevin Devine of the Springfield police department were driving in an unmarked cruiser in the area of Ruth Elizabeth Park in Springfield. Kakley recognized the defendant, who he knew had several outstanding motor vehicle warrants, speaking to the driver of a vehicle parked on Hickory Street, which borders the park. Kakley got out of the cruiser and attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>apprehend the defendant. The defendant resisted. A struggle ensued, which Devine then joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The officers ultimately subdued the defendant and placed him in handcuffs. In the defendant\u2019s pocket, Devine found a six-shot revolver, which was loaded with four rounds of ammunition, a plastic bag containing thirty-five tablets (later determined to be methylenedioxy methamphetamine, also known as \u201cMOMA\u201d or \u201cEcstasy\u201d) and $137. The officers also found a bag of marijuana on the ground near where the scuffle had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">At trial, the Commonwealth did not present evidence in its case-in-chief that the defendant lacked a license to carry the firearm found on his person or an FID card permitting him to possess ammunition. As a result, the defendant moved for, and was denied, required findings of not guilty on the firearms and ammunition charges at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The defendant then testified in his own defense. He denied possessing the gun, the ammunition, and the drugs; on cross-examination, he testified that he did not possess either an FID card or a license to carry a firearm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">After the jury returned their verdicts, the defendant waived a jury trial on the subsequent offender portions of the firearm and ammunition charges. For each of the three predicate offenses listed in the indictments \u2014 possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and simple assault and battery \u2014 the Commonwealth called the arresting officer to testify and submitted a certified copy of the relevant conviction or corresponding docket. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>With regard to the assault and battery conviction, the Commonwealth called Officer John Carolan, who testified that he had arrested the defendant on September 4, 2004. Carolan provided no substantive information about the crime, other than describing it as \u201c[a]ssault and battery domestic and intimidation of a witness.\u201d The Commonwealth then introduced a certified copy of a docket from the Springfield Division of the District Court Department that indicated that the defendant had pleaded guilty to a single charge of assault and battery on August 25, 2005.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">2. <em>Convictions under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 </em>(a) <em>and </em>(n). The defendant contends that our ruling in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 406 (1977), that the \u201c[a]bsence of a license is not \u2018an element of the crime\u2019 \u201d of unlawful possession of a firearm, and that the \u201cholding of a valid license\u201d is an affirmative defense to that charge, conflicts with an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, as defined in <em>Heller, supra, </em>and <em>McDonald, supra. </em>He further contends that, in light of those Second Amendment decisions, a \u201cpresumption of unlawfulness\u201d based on the mere carrying of a firearm is no longer sustainable, and the Commonwealth must carry the affirmative burden of proving the absence of a license as an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We have today rejected the essential core of the defendant\u2019s argument in <em>Gouse, supra </em>at 801-808, concluding that \u201c[njothing in the <em>McDonald </em>and <em>Heller </em>decisions has altered or abrogated our jurisprudence regarding the elements of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm or the allocation of the burdens of production and proof with respect to the affirmative defense of licensure.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loadholt, </em>460 Mass. 723, 727 (2011). Our reasoning in that case applies with equal force here. The holding of a license remains an affirmative defense to the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm, whether loaded or not, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) and <em>(n),</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Gouse, </em>supra; and the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>absence only if and when the defendant presents some evidence of licensure. <em>Id. </em>Here, the defendant presented no such evidence and his motion for required findings of not guilty was properly denied.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">3. <em>Assault and battery as a \u201cviolent crime\u201d under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. </em>The defendant argues that a certified conviction of assault and battery does not suffice to prove that he committed a \u201cviolent crime,\u201d absent additional evidence demonstrating that the crime of which he was convicted \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force\u201d or \u201cpresents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. We are in accord with the recent decision in <em>Colon, supra </em>at 12-22, on this precise point. We summarize the essential points of the Appeals Court\u2019s analysis, providing additional commentary when appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10G <em>(a)-(c) </em>(\u00a7 10G), imposes enhanced sentencing on a person who, having previously been convicted of at least one \u201cviolent crime\u201d or serious drug offense, is convicted of possession of a firearm or ammunition. For purposes of \u00a7 10G, a \u201cviolent crime\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">\u201c[A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>exceeding one year . . . that: (i) has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force or a deadly weapon against the person of another; (ii) is burglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; (iii) involves the use of explosives; or (iv) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G <em>(e). </em>The definition of a violent crime under \u00a7 10G \u201ctherefore has three components: (1) the \u2018physical force\u2019 or \u2018force\u2019 clause; (2) the enumerated crimes provisions; and (3) the residual clause.\u201d <em>Colon, supra </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Section lOG\u2019s language \u201clargely replicates\u201d the language of the Federal armed career criminal act (Federal ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2006). <em>Colon, supra </em>at 12-14. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 223 (2009). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, ante </em>616, 626 n.10 (2012). In particular, the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d in \u00a7 10G is almost identical to the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the Federal ACCA. See <em>Colon, supra </em>at 13. We therefore \u201cconsider the Federal courts\u2019 construction of the Federal statute highly persuasive in interpreting [\u00a7 10G].\u201d <em>Colon, supra </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Under the Federal ACCA, sentencing judges use a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense. <em>Colon, supra </em>at 15, citing <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990). \u201cThis approach \u2018generally requires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colon, supra, </em>quoting <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>Massachusetts courts have previously applied the categorical approach when interpreting the \u201cserious drug offense\u201d prong of \u00a7 10G, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, supra </em>at 224-225, and cases cited, and when determining whether a defendant has allegedly committed an offense that subjects him to pretrial detention for dangerousness, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>453 Mass. 707, 711-716 (2009). We agree that \u201cthis straightforward categorical approach also applies to [\u00a7 10G] jury trials when the statutory definition of the prior offense unambiguously qualifies that offense as a predicate conviction.\u201d <em>Colon, supra </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The categorical approach does not always produce a conclusive determination whether the defendant has been convicted of a \u201cviolent crime.\u201d The defendant may have been convicted under a broad statute that encompasses multiple crimes, not all of which are \u201cviolent crimes.\u201d In this \u201cnarrow range of cases,\u201d Federal judges utilize a \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d consulting extrinsic evidence to determine the material elements that formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 16, quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 1265, 1273 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The procedure for conducting this additional inquiry is different under Massachusetts law and Federal law. <em>Colon, supra </em>at 14-15, 16. Under Federal law, the sentencing judge determines whether the defendant has been convicted of sentence-enhancing predicate felonies. See, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>The judge\u2019s inquiry is confined to the trial records of the predicate felonies \u2014 including \u201ccharging documents, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial, and jury instructions and verdict forms.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant facing sentence enhancement based on prior convictions is entitled to a jury trial. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A. At this subsequent offender trial, the \u201ctrial judge may admit any evidence that would have been admissible at the original trial of the alleged predicate offense.\u201d <em>Colon, supra </em>at 16 n.8.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the same standard of proof applies as in a regular trial, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, this evidence must suffice to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime for which he was convicted was a violent crime. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We emphasize that, at the subsequent offender trial, \u201cthe Commonwealth need not retry the prior conviction . . . ; the Commonwealth need only prove <em>which statutory or common-law definition </em>was the basis of the prior conviction\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Id. </em>at 16 n.8. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has concisely explained the objective of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>reviewing a prior conviction under the modified categorical approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">\u201cIt would be appropriate for the sentencing court to look to the conduct in respect to which the defendant was charged and pled guilty, <em>not </em>because the court may properly be interested (in this context) in the violent or non-violent nature of that particular conduct, but because that conduct may indicate that the defendant and government both believed that the genetically violent crime . . . rather than the genetically non-violent crime . . . was at issue\u201d (emphasis original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>964 F.2d 1234, 1236 (1st Cir. 1992), overruled on other grounds, <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 13 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Under the modified categorical approach, a certified record of conviction referencing a particular statute may prove that the defendant committed a violent crime only when all crimes encompassed within that statute are violent crimes. The <em>Colon </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">\u201cIf a certified record of conviction identifies a statutory or common-law term which could refer to multiple crimes with different material elements, then the certified record permits any rational factfinder to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was convicted of a \u2018violent crime\u2019 only if <em>all </em>crimes defined by that statutory or common-law term are \u2018violent crimes.\u2019 See <em>[Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>630 F.3d [252,] 256-257 [(1st Cir. 2011)]. See also <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. [13], 15-17, 24-26 [(2005)]. If the statutory or common-law crime encompasses several offenses at least one of which is <em>not </em>a \u2018violent crime,\u2019 then a rational factfinder would require some additional evidence that the conviction at issue was of one of the offenses included in that term that <em>is </em>a \u2018violent crime\u2019 in order to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was previously convicted of a \u2018violent crime.\u2019 See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra. </em>Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holloway, [supra] </em>at 259-260.\u201d (Emphases in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-9\"><em>Colon, supra </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>We now apply these principles to assault and battery, again tracking the analysis in <em>Colon. </em>The statutory crime of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, encompasses three common-law crimes: harmful battery, reckless battery, and offensive battery.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 482 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 194-195 (2008). Harmful battery is \u201c[a]ny touching \u2018with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 620 (1948). Reckless battery is a \u201cwilful, wanton and reckless act which results in personal injury to another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 274 (1983). Offensive battery occurs when \u201cthe defendant, without justification or excuse, intentionally touched the victim, and . . . the touching, however slight, occurred without the victim\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 476 (2008). \u201cThe affront to the victim\u2019s personal integrity is what makes the touching offensive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The <em>Colon </em>court analyzed whether all three crimes of assault and battery are predicate \u201cviolent crimes\u201d under \u00a7 10G. <em>Colon, supra </em>at 18. In so doing, it reviewed the three clauses encompassed in the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121: the enumerated crimes clause, the force clause, and the residual clause. <em>Id. </em>at 18-22. See <em>id. </em>at 12. Assault and battery is not among the list of enumerated crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The \u201cforce clause\u201d defines a \u201cviolent crime\u201d as one that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. Drawing from United States Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Federal ACCA, the <em>Colon </em>court concluded that the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d means \u201cviolent or substantial force capable of causing pain or injury.\u201d <em>Colon, supra, </em>citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 1265, 1271 (2010). Harmful battery and reckless battery do have as an element the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d sufficient to implicate the sentencing enhancement. Offensive battery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>however, which can be committed through such de minimis touchings as tickling and spitting, does not. <em>Colon, supra </em>at 19-20, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 359-360 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The \u201cresidual clause\u201d qualifies an offense as a \u201cviolent crime\u201d if it \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. Again drawing guidance from Federal precedent, the <em>Colon </em>court concluded that \u201c[ojffensive battery does not, in the ordinary case, involve conduct with the requisite risk.\u201d <em>Colon, supra, </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In sum, of the three crimes of assault and battery codified in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, harmful battery and reckless battery are \u201cviolent crimes,\u201d but offensive battery is not. <em>Colon, supra </em>at 17-18. Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, supra </em>(\u201cMassachusetts \u2018assault and battery\u2019 statute covers two separate crimes \u2014 one involving actual [or potential] physical harm and the other involving a \u2018nonconsensual\u2019 but unharmful touching\u201d). Accordingly, a certified conviction of assault and battery is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant committed a \u201cviolent crime\u201d for the purpose of sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 10G.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">In the present case, the only evidence offered in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>with the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of assault and battery was a certified conviction from the Springfield Division of the District Court Department and the testimony of arresting Officer John Carolan to the effect that the defendant was charged with \u201c[assault and battery domestic and intimidation of a witness.\u201d As the Commonwealth concedes, this minimal additional evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was based on harmful or reckless battery. The Commonwealth thus sufficiently proved only that the defendant had committed two predicate offenses under \u00a7 10G. See <em>Colon, supra </em>at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the defendant\u2019s firearm convictions under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) and <em>(n). </em>On the subsequent offender portion of the indictment, we set aside so much of the judgment of conviction as pertains to the predicate offense of assault and battery, and remand the case for the entry of judgment and resentencing under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G <em>(b), </em>based on two predicate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\">General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>generally prohibits the possession of a firearm outside one\u2019s home or business without a license to carry it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\">General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(n), </em>generally prohibits the possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(that is, outside one\u2019s home or business without a license to carry it), which is loaded with ammunition.

Given the dismissal of the indictment as duplicative of the defendant\u2019s conviction of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, we do not reach this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The defendant had been charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute (marijuana), under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C <em>(by, </em>the judge, however, granted the defendant\u2019s request for a required finding of not guilty as to this charge at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Before the case went to the jury, the defendant requested a jury instruction that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove as an element . . . that Defendant did not have the license described in Chapter 140.\u201d The judge denied this request, and instructed the jury: \u201c[Tjhere\u2019s no evidence in the case that the defendant had a license to carry a firearm. For that reason, the issue of license is not relevant to your deliberations, therefore, you should put that issue out of your mind.\u201d With regard to the charge of possessing ammunition, the judge instructed the jury: \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence in the case that the defendant had an FID card and, therefore, the issue of FID card is not relevant to your deliberations and you should put that issue out of your mind as well.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The Commonwealth also offered the testimony of Officer Lee Prentice of the Springfield police department, who confirmed that the fingerprints taken during the booking procedure after a September 4, 2004, arrest for \u201c[ajssault and battery domestic and intimidation of a witness\u201d belonged to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The elements of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (\u00ab), are essentially identical to the elements of unlawful possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>of a firearm under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>except the Commonwealth must prove that the firearm was loaded with ammunition. We do not address here whether the Commonwealth must also prove that the defendant knew that the firearm he possessed was loaded. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>in) </em>(whoever violates statute prohibiting unlawful carrying of firearm \u201cby means of a loaded firearm . . . shall be further punished\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, ante </em>44, 52-53 (2011) (\u201cTo convict the defendant of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm that was loaded with ammunition and met the legal requirements of a firearm as defined by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The defendant also asserts a facial challenge to G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, summarily arguing that the statute is overly broad and unduly restrictive of an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms. His concise statement of this argument, however, \u201ccannot be said to rise to the level of acceptable appellate argument under Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 376 Mass. 921 (1975).\u201d <em>Adoption of Kimberly, </em>414 Mass. 526, 536-537 (1993). Accordingly, we decline to address it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 194 n.1 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Like the defendant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, ante </em>787 (2012), Eberhart was indicted for and convicted of possessing a firearm in a public area (not in his home or business, nor in defense of the same), and the charges against him did not infringe on his right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution as that right has been explicated by the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\">This flexibility alleviates the concern, raised under the Federal system, that it will often be impossible to prove the nature of a predicate felony from this limited range of documents. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 1265, 1277-1278 (2010) (Alito, J., dissenting); <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 21-23 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\">More precisely, \u201c[ujnder the common law there are two theories of assault and battery: intentional battery and reckless battery.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass. 526, 529 (2010). Offensive battery is a form of intentional battery. See <em>id..; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 482-483 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Our opinion also accords in most respects with the most recent treatment of the Massachusetts assault and battery statute under the Federal armed career criminal act. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>630 F.3d 252 (1st Cir. 2011). The <em>Holloway </em>court concluded that a generic charging document alleging that the defendant \u201cdid assault and beat\u201d the victim, G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79, is insufficient to prove that the defendant committed a violent felony. <em>Id. </em>at 260. It reasoned that at least one of the three crimes of assault and battery \u2014 offensive battery \u2014\u25a0 is not a violent felony under the force clause, <em>id. </em>at 259-260; and that at least one of the three crimes of assault and battery \u2022\u2014 reckless battery \u2014 is not a violent felony under the residual clause. <em>Id. </em>at 260-262.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The <em>Holloway </em>court thus concluded that reckless battery was not a violent crime only under the residual clause. We conclude that reckless battery is a violent crime under the force clause, an issue not addressed by the <em>Holloway </em>opinion. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>644 F.3d 12, 20 &amp; n.10 (1st Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1538 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">We further note that the <em>Holloway </em>court\u2019s conclusion with respect to reckless battery accorded with then-binding instruction from the United States Supreme Court that the residual clause is limited to an offense that \u201ctypically involve[s] purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holloway, supra </em>at 260, quoting <em>Begay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 144-145 (2008). Last year, however, the Supreme Court retreated from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>characterization of the residual clause. <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>131 S. Ct. 2267, 2270, 2277 (2011) (holding that vehicular flight from police officer after order to stop is violent felony under residual clause). The Court iterated that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018purposeful, violent, and aggressive\u2019 has no precise textual link to the residual clause, which requires that an ACCA predicate \u2018otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2275, quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2006). The Court applied only the statutory language, finding that \u201crisk levels provide a categorical and manageable standard that suffices to resolve the case before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2275-2276. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>792 F. Supp. 2d 104, 107 (D. Mass. 2011) (speculating in dicta whether <em>Sykes </em>\u201cmarks a shift in the standard\u201d for application of residual clause to assault and battery).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
