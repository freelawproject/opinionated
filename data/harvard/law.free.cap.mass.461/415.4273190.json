L. c. 258E, inserted by St. 2010, c. 23<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (act or c. 258E), that directed Robert O\u2019Brien (O\u2019Brien) not to abuse or harass Alan Borowski (Borowski), to stay fifty yards away from Borowski, and to remain away from Borowski\u2019s residence. O\u2019Brien filed a petition to vacate and dismiss the order under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, before a single justice of this court, who reserved and reported the case for decision by the full court. O\u2019Brien argues that c. 258E is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it regulates protected speech, and unconstitutional as applied to him because the conduct complained of was protected speech.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that c. 258E is not unconstitutionally overbroad under our interpretation of the statute. Because we vacate the now-expired harassment prevention order on other grounds, we do not reach the question whether the application of the statute in his case was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\"><em>Background. </em>Borowski is a police officer with the Northampton police department, who knew O\u2019Brien before he became a police officer thirteen years ago. He had \u201ccharged [O\u2019Brien] with a crime\u201d in 2006, and knew O\u2019Brien to be \u201ca fighter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">On the evening of May 15, 2010, Borowski entered a bar with his girl friend, saw O\u2019Brien inside, and decided immediately to leave. After Borowski left the bar, O\u2019Brien followed him out of the bar, yelled Borowski\u2019s name, and when Borowski turned to look at him, raised both of his middle fingers in the air and said, \u201c[F]uck you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>On the afternoon of August 8, 2010, Borowski was at his home moving his truck from the driveway when he saw O\u2019Brien in the front passenger seat of a truck traveling past his house. As the truck drove past the house, O\u2019Brien put his hand outside the window and again \u201cflipped [him] off\u201d with his middle finger. After Borowski got out of his truck, the truck O\u2019Brien was traveling in stopped in the middle of the street approximately seventy-five yards from Borowski\u2019s house, remained there for several seconds, and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Approximately ninety minutes later, Borowski was standing on his deck when he heard a horn sound in front of his house. He saw O\u2019Brien lean forward in the passenger seat of the truck and again extend his middle finger in the air; the driver then drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Borowski applied for a harassment prevention order on August 23, 2010, and a temporary order issued. A hearing was conducted on September 3, 2010; Borowski was the lone witness. After the hearing, the judge extended the order until September 2, 2011. On September 30, 2010, O\u2019Brien filed the instant petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, for relief from the harassment prevention order. In reserving and reporting the case to the full court, the single justice urged the court to consider, apart from the constitutional issues, \u201cwhether the case is moot, and if so, whether it nonetheless should be decided; and whether the use of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, shall continue as the avenue of review of an order entered pursuant to G. L. c. 258E.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>We first address the procedural questions raised by the single justice. The harassment prevention order expired on September 2, 2011, and Borowski did not move to extend the order, so the case is now moot. Even though there is no longer a live dispute among the parties, we shall reach the merits of this case because it is fully briefed and raises issues of public importance regarding the constitutionality of a recently enacted statute that will likely arise again but, if we dismiss on grounds of mootness, evade review. See <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 670 (1993), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">As to the proper avenue of review, the parties agree that, because the act does not expressly provide any other means to appeal from a harassment prevention order, the only alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>presently available is to seek relief from a single justice of this court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and then, if necessary, from the full court on appeal. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>421 Mass. 1002 (1995); <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Boston Mun. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>413 Mass. 1009 (1992). In <em>Zullo </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>423 Mass. 679, 681 (1996), we recognized that G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, had provided the only avenue to appeal from a restraining order issued by a District Court judge under G. L. c. 209A. But we concluded that \u201c[ujniformity of treatment of litigants and the development of a consistent body of law\u201d would be better accomplished if the appeal from all c. 209A orders were directed to the Appeals Court, and so ordered. <em>Id. </em>at 682, quoting <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Jarvenpaa, </em>404 Mass. 177, 181 (1989). For similar reasons, we reach the same conclusion here with respect to harassment prevention orders under c. 258E. For example, where someone alleges abuse from a former spouse and the spouse\u2019s current partner, and seeks an order against the former under c. 209A and against the latter under c. 258E, it would not serve the interests of justice for an appeal from the c. 209A order to be heard in the Appeals Court and an appeal from the c. 258E order to be heard by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. After the date of the rescript in this case, all litigants seeking judicial review of such orders are directed to the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>Before we turn to the constitutional questions raised by O\u2019Brien, we consider first how the act fits within the over-all statutory framework protecting victims of abuse and harassment. General Laws c. 209A, inserted by St. 1978, c. 447, \u00a7 2, enables a person \u201csuffering from abuse from an adult or minor family or household member\u201d to obtain a protective order directing the defendant, among other things, to refrain from the abuse. G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3. \u201cAbuse\u201d is defined as \u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members: (a) attempting to cause or causing physical harm; <em>(b) </em>placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm; (c) causing another to engage involuntarily in sexual relations by force, threat or duress.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. The violation of an abuse prevention order is a crime, punishable by a fine or imprisonment in a house of correction. G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>A person who is abused by someone other than a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d does not qualify for a protective order under c. 209A and could obtain a restraining order only by seeking injunctive relief in the Superior Court under Mass. R. Civ. P. 65, 365 Mass. 832 (1974). Violation of such a restraining order may constitute a contempt of court, but is not a crime. Mass. R. Civ. P. 65.3, as appearing in 386 Mass. 1244 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Chapter 258E was enacted in 2010 to allow individuals to obtain civil restraining orders against persons who are not family or household members, and to make the violation of those orders punishable as a crime. See An Act Relative to Harassment Prevention Orders, Formal House Session January 28, 2010 (statements of Representatives O\u2019Flaherty, Atkins, Jones, Swan). But while a protective order under c. 209A requires a finding of \u201cabuse,\u201d a protective order under c. 258E requires a finding of \u201charassment,\u201d defined in G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 1, as \u201c[three] or more acts of willful and malicious conduct aimed at a specific person committed with the intent to cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property and that does in fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The definition of \u201c[h]arassment\u201d in c. 258E, \u00a7 1, evolved from the criminal harassment statute enacted in 2000, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A, inserted by St. 2000, c. 164, which makes it a crime to \u201cwillfully and maliciously engageQ in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person, which seriously alarms that person and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Both civil and criminal harassment require proof of three or more acts of wilful and malicious conduct aimed at a specific person. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 89 (2005) <em>(Welch) </em>(\u201cphrase \u2018pattern of conduct or series of acts\u2019 [in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A,] requires the Commonwealth to prove three or more incidents of harassment\u201d). But the definitions of civil and criminal harassment differ in three respects. First, there are two layers of intent required to prove civil harassment under c. 258E: the acts of harassment must be wilful and \u201c[m]alicious,\u201d the latter defined as \u201ccharacterized by cruelty, hostility or revenge,\u201d and they must be committed with \u201cthe intent to cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property.\u201d G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 1. Only the first layer of intent is required for criminal harassment under c. 265, \u00a7 43A. Second, the multiple acts of civil harassment must \u201cin fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property,\u201d while the multiple acts of criminal harassment must \u201cseriously alarm[]\u201d the targeted victim. Third, criminal harassment requires proof that the pattern of harassment \u201cwould cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress,\u201d but civil harassment has no comparable reasonable person element.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">2. <em>Constitutionality of G. L. c. 258E. </em>In <em>Welch, </em>we considered the constitutionality of the criminal harassment statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A, and concluded that, while the harassing conduct punishable under the statute may include harassing speech, the statute passed constitutional muster because it was carefully crafted by the Legislature to apply \u201csolely to constitutionally unprotected speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. We recognized that we had \u201cnarrowly construed statutory language in the past to avoid constitutional problems,\u201d but we declined \u201cto narrow the statute by engrafting onto it a savings clause or other limiting construction at this time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99-100 &amp; n.16. We added that \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>would have no hesitation in reading into the statute such a narrowing construction to ensure its application only to speech that is accorded no constitutional protection\u201d if the Commonwealth were to attempt to prosecute a person for speech that is constitutionally protected. <em>Id. </em>at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Having concluded in <em>Welch </em>that the criminal harassment statute is not constitutionally overbroad, the issue we confront here is whether the differences in the definition of civil harassment so significantly broaden the scope of potentially prohibited speech as to render the civil harassment statute constitutionally over-broad. Before we embark on that analysis, we explore first the overbreadth doctrine and the relevant categories of unprotected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">a. <em>Overbreadth. </em>We recently noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201cThe overbreadth doctrine allows an individual whose speech may be constitutionally regulated to argue that a law is unconstitutional because it infringes on the speech of others. See <em>[Trustees of the State Univ. of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>492 U.S. 469, 482-483 (1989)]. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>130 S. Ct. 1577, 1591-1592 (2010). Overbreadth has thus been described as an exception to the general principle that litigants only have standing to assert their own rights and not the rights of others; in the free speech context, such challenges have been permitted in order \u2018to prevent [a] statute from chilling the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the court.\u2019 <em>Secretary of State of Md. </em>v. <em>Joseph H. Munson Co., </em>467 U.S. 947, 957, 958 (1984). See <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>405 U.S. 438, 445 n.5 (1972). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has recognized the overbreadth doctrine as \u2018strong medicine\u2019 and has limited its application to instances where a law \u2018prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 292, 293 (2008), quoting <em>Los Angeles Police Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>United Reporting Publ. Corp., </em>528 U.S. 32, 39 (1999). Substantial overbreadth demands a \u2018realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court.\u2019 <em>City Council of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Taxpayers for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 800-802 (1984) (declining to entertain overbreadth claim where such danger not shown). Further, the overbreadth must be \u2018substantial, not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 292.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><em>Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>460 Mass. 647, 676-677 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In determining whether a statute is facially overbroad, we look not only to the language of the statute but to any limiting construction we have grafted on that language in interpreting the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 585 (1975). And we have not hesitated to construe statutory language narrowly to avoid constitutional overbreadth, especially where we discern a legislative intent that the statute prohibit only constitutionally unprotected speech. See <em>Welch, supra </em>at 99, 100 n.16; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 538 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">b. <em>Classes of unprotected speech. </em>While most speech is protected from government regulation by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, there are \u201ccertain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech\u201d that are not protected because they are \u201cno essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth\u201d that whatever meager benefit that may be derived from them is \u201cclearly outweighed\u201d by the dangers they pose. <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571, 572 (1942). See <em>Shackelford </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>948 F.2d 935, 938 (5th Cir. 1991), quoting L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 12-8, at 836-837 (2d ed. 1988) (\u201cIt is not plausible to uphold the right to use words as projectiles where no exchange of views is involved\u201d). Among these well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech are \u201cfighting words\u201d and \u201ctrue threats.\u201d See <em>Welch, supra </em>at 94-95 (First Amendment allows restrictions on speech that are \u201cfighting words\u201d or \u201ctrue threats\u201d). See also <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Women\u2019s Health Ctr., Inc., </em>512 U.S. 753, 774 (1994) (\u201cAbsent evidence that the protesters\u2019 speech is independently proscribable [i.e., \u2018fighting words\u2019 or threats], or is so infused with violence as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>be indistinguishable from a threat of physical harm, . . . this provision cannot stand\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">i. <em>Fighting words. </em>The \u201cfighting words\u201d exception to the First Amendment is limited to words that are likely to provoke a fight: face-to-face personal insults that are so personally abusive that they are plainly likely to provoke a violent reaction and cause a breach of the peace. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 20 (1971) (fighting words are \u201cpersonally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction\u201d); <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, supra </em>at 572 (fighting words are words whose \u201cvery utterance . . . tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 591. Fighting words thus have two components: they must be a direct personal insult addressed to a person, and they must be inherently likely to provoke violence. As such, the fighting words exception is \u201can extremely narrow one.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>332 F.3d 199, 212 (3d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">ii. <em>True threats. </em>In <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Black, </em>538 U.S. 343 (2003) <em>(Black), </em>the Supreme Court defined true threats:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201c \u2018True threats\u2019 encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. . . . The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats \u2018protects] individuals from the fear of violence\u2019 and \u2018from the disruption that fear engenders,\u2019 in addition to protecting people \u2018from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 359-360, quoting <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. 377, 388 (1992). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cassel, </em>408 F.3d 622, 633 (9th Cir. 2005) <em>(Black </em>Court\u2019s definition of \u201ctrue threat\u201d binding on lower courts). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 183 (1995) (\u201cFirst Amendment does not protect conduct that threatens another\u201d). \u201cThe term \u2018true threat\u2019 has been adopted to help distinguish between words that literally threaten but have an expressive purpose such as political hyperbole, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>words that are intended to place the target of the threat in fear, whether the threat is veiled or explicit.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 236 (2001) <em>(Chou).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">A true threat does not require \u201can explicit statement of an intention to harm the victim as long as circumstances support the victim\u2019s fearful or apprehensive response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fulmer, </em>108 F.3d 1486, 1492 (1st Cir. 1997) (\u201cuse of ambiguous language does not preclude a statement from being a threat\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Malik, </em>16 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 968 (1994) (\u201cabsence of explicitly threatening language does not preclude the finding of a threat\u201d). Nor need a true threat threaten imminent harm; sexually explicit or aggressive language \u201cdirected at and received by an identified victim may be threatening, notwithstanding the lack of evidence that the threat will be immediately followed by actual violence or the use of physical force.\u201d <em>Chou, supra </em>at 235. See <em>Black, supra </em>at 359-360 (defining true threats without imminence requirement); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist., </em>306 F.3d 616, 622 (8th Cir. 2002) (\u201cserious expression of an intent to cause a present or future harm\u201d is true threat).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">For example, in <em>Chou, supra </em>at 230-231, the defendant produced flyers with the word \u201cMISSING\u201d printed in large type across the top, beneath which was a photograph of a former girl friend who had broken up with him and offensive sexual remarks about her, and he then hung the flyers in several places in her high school. He was convicted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, <em>id. </em>at 230, which criminally punishes \u201cpersons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex.\u201d We concluded that the defendant\u2019s criminal conviction for this communication did not violate the First Amendment because it was a true threat that \u201chad no expressive purpose but was, instead, intended to \u2018get back\u2019 at the victim by placing her in fear that she might suffer some sexual harm or wind up among the \u2018missing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237. We recognized that \u201c[sexually explicit language, when directed at particular individuals in settings in which such communications are inappropriate and likely to cause severe distress, may be inherently threatening.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In <em>Black, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Virginia law that prohibited the burning of a cross with intent to intimidate, concluding that, in view of the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s \u201clong and pernicious history\u201d of using the burning of a cross \u201cas a signal of impending violence,\u201d it constituted a true threat, unprotected by the First Amendment, when committed with an intent to intimidate. <em>Black, supra </em>at 363.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[ijntimidation in the constitutionally prescribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. Taken together, <em>Chou </em>and <em>Black </em>demonstrate that the \u201ctrue threat\u201d doctrine applies not only to direct threats of imminent physical harm, but to words or actions that \u2014 taking into account the context in which they arise \u2014 cause the victim to fear such harm now or in the future and evince intent on the part of the speaker or actor to cause such fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">c. <em>Construction of G. L. c. 258E. </em>We conclude that the Legislature crafted the civil harassment act, G. L. c. 258E, with the intent that the definition of harassment exclude constitutionally protected speech, and we interpret G. L. c. 258E to effectuate that legislative intent. See <em>Welch, supra </em>at 99 (finding that Legislature took similar care in crafting criminal harassment act, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A). Because the definition of \u201ccivil harassment\u201d is substantially broader than the definition of \u201cfighting words,\u201d we discern no legislative intent to confine the meaning of harassment to fighting words, but we do discern an intent to confine the meaning of harassment to either fighting words or \u201ctrae threats.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Looking carefully at the elements set forth in the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of civil harassment, we conclude that, with one exception, the Legislature accomplished that intent through its crafting of G. L. c. 258E. To establish harassment, a complainant must prove that the defendant, motivated by cruelty, hostility, or revenge, wilfully committed three or more acts aimed at a specific person, each with the intent to cause that person to experience fear or intimidation, or to cause abuse or damage to property, which, considered together, did in fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property. G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The intent requirements in the act plainly satisfy the \u201ctrue threat\u201d requirement that the speaker subjectively intend to communicate a threat. See <em>Black, supra </em>at 360; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cassel, supra. </em>See also <em>Shackelford </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>948 F.2d 935, 937, 940 (5th Cir. 1991) (specific intent requirement in statute punishing making of telephone call \u201cwith intent to terrify, intimidate, or harass, and threaten to inflict injury or physical harm\u201d limited punishable speech only to \u201ca class of \u2018true threats,\u2019 and not social or political advocacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The requirement that the pattern of harassment in fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property satisfies the \u201ctrue threat\u201d requirement that the threat be regarded as a serious expression of intent and not mere hyperbole. See <em>Black, supra </em>at 359; <em>Chou, supra </em>at 236-237.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Where the acts are aimed at a specific person, an intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>cause \u201cabuse\u201d is certainly consistent with a true threat, because abuse is defined in the act as \u201cattempting to cause or causing physical harm to another or placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm.\u201d G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 1. An intent to cause property damage is also consistent with a true threat because, as with intent to cause abuse, it constitutes an intent to commit a criminal act. So, too, is an intent to intimidate, which the Supreme Court specifically concluded was punishable when coupled with an intimidating communication. See <em>Black, supra </em>at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">An intent to cause fear, however, is less certain to be consistent with a true threat unless we narrow what it is that must be feared. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted, there are types of threats that may \u201ccontain ideas or advocacy, such as a \u2018threat\u2019 to picket an organization if it does not yield to a demand to take some social or political action.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Velasquez, </em>772 F.2d 1348, 1357 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1021 (1986). Such a threat may cause a fear of economic loss, of unfavorable publicity, or of defeat at the ballot box, but such fears cannot be enough to make the threat a \u201ctrue threat\u201d that may be prohibited as civil harassment under the First Amendment and art. 16. There is nothing in the language of the act or in its legislative history to suggest that the Legislature intended \u201cfear\u201d to mean more than fear of physical harm or property damage, and such a limiting interpretation would effectuate the legislative intent to confine the prohibited speech in the act to constitutionally unprotected speech. Therefore, we narrow the meaning of \u201cfear\u201d under the act to fear of physical harm or fear of physical damage to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">O\u2019Brien contends that, even with this interpretation of \u201cfear,\u201d the civil harassment act is still constitutionally overbroad because, in contrast with the criminal harassment act, it does not require that the pattern of harassment would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress. The legislative history of c. 258E suggests that the Legislature intended to omit this reasonable person element, because it, along with other language from the criminal harassment act, was included in the initial version of the bill, but this element was removed from later versions and from the bill ultimately enacted. Compare 2009 Senate Doc. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>1611, An Act relative to sexual assault and stalking restraining orders (filed Jan. 14, 2009), with 2009 Senate Doc. No. 2185, An Act to prevent harassment at \u00a7 1 (filed Oct. 26, 2009); 2009 Senate Doc. No. 2212, An Act relative to harassment prevention orders at \u00a7 1 (filed Nov. 17, 2009); and c. 258E, \u00a7 1. In its place, the Legislature inserted the requirements that the defendant intend to cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property, and that the pattern of harassment actually cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property. We conclude that these requirements adequately ensure that protected speech will not be found to be civil harassment in violation of c. 258E.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">There is no appreciable amount of protected speech where the speaker both intends to cause intimidation, abuse, damage to property, or fear of physical harm or property damage, and does in fact cause one of these alternatives. A reasonable person standard may have been necessary to uphold the constitutionality of the criminal harassment act, which otherwise required only that the knowing and malicious pattern of conduct \u201cseriously alarm\u201d the person harassed, see <em>Welch, supra </em>at 97, but the additional requirements in the civil harassment act more carefully limit the scope of prohibited speech to constitutionally unprotected \u201ctrue threats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Therefore, we conclude that, with our interpretation of the meaning of \u201cfear\u201d in G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 1, the civil harassment act is not constitutionally overbroad because it does not prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech, either in an absolute sense or in relation to the statute\u2019s legitimate sweep. See <em>Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>460 Mass. 647, 676-677 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">3. <em>Application of G. L. c. 258E to O\u2019Brien\u2019s conduct. </em>We now turn to O\u2019Brien\u2019s claim that the act was unconstitutionally applied to him because the finding of harassment was based on his raising of his middle finger, which is constitutionally protected speech. We recognize that the raising of the middle finger as a form of insult has a long, if not illustrious, history dating back to ancient Greece. See Robbins, Digitus Impudicus: The Middle Finger and the Law, 41 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1403, 1413 (2008).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Like its verbal counterpart, when it is used to express contempt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>anger, or protest, it is a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Sandul </em>v. <em>Larion, </em>119 F.3d 1250, 1255 (6th Cir. 1997) (passenger yelling \u201cfuck you\u201d and extending middle finger while passing group of protestors entitled to First Amendment protection); <em>Duran </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>904 F.2d 1372, 1374, 1378 (9th Cir. 1990) (\u201cobscene gesture\u201d and profanities directed to police, while \u201c[i]narticulate and crude,\u201d \u201crepresented an expression of disapproval toward a police officer\u201d that \u201cfell squarely within the protective umbrella of the First Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">But, in certain limited circumstances, when accompanied by other less expressive and more threatening conduct, raising the middle finger may constitute fighting words or a true threat. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Poocha, </em>259 F.3d 1077, 1082 (9th Cir. 2001) (clenching fists and yelling \u201cfuck you\u201d to police officer not fighting words), and <em>Cook </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Wyandotte County, </em>966 F. Supp. 1049, 1051, 1052 (D. Kan. 1997) (raising middle finger at police officer parked in patrol car not fighting words), with <em>Gower </em>v. <em>Vercler, </em>377 F.3d 661, 664, 670 (7th Cir. 2004) (repeatedly yelling \u201cfuck you\u201d and insults, and attempting to humiliate, constitutes fighting words where parties had brandished weapons at each other previous night), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Groves, </em>219 Neb. 382, 384, 386 (1985) (calling police officer \u201cmotherfucker\u201d and challenging him to make arrest alone after learning that officer had called for assistance were fighting words).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Borowski does not contend that O\u2019Brien\u2019s use of his middle finger constituted fighting words that incited him to violence. Rather, he argues that, when viewed in context, where Borowski had earlier arrested O\u2019Brien and knew O\u2019Brien to be a \u201cfighter,\u201d and where O\u2019Brien followed Borowski out of a bar to raise both middle fingers in the first alleged act of harassment and later raised his middle finger as he drove past Borowski\u2019s home in the second and third alleged acts of harassment, O\u2019Brien\u2019s raising of his middle finger reflected a threat of physical harm and therefore is not protected by the First Amendment or art. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">We need not reach the issue whether there was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>evidence for the judge to conclude that the totality of O\u2019Brien\u2019s conduct, including the raising of the middle finger, met the standard for civil harassment because there is another issue that, if the case were not moot, would require a remand for further factual findings. We noted earlier that, under the act, the plaintiff must prove at least three wilful and malicious acts of harassment directed to a specific person, <em>each </em>committed with the intent to cause intimidation, abuse, damage to property, or fear of physical injury or property damage. Because the judge did not make any factual findings, orally or in writing, we cannot know whether the judge made this finding as to each of the three alleged acts of harassment, and the evidence is not so strong as to permit us to infer such a finding, especially with respect to the first act committed outside the bar. In such circumstances, we would generally remand the case to the judge for further factual findings, but such a remand makes no sense where the case is moot, the harassment prevention order having expired. Because we cannot affirm the order of harassment without further findings, and because the case is now moot, the order of harassment must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We interpret the word \u201cfear\u201d in G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 1, to mean fear of physical harm or fear of physical damage to property. With that narrowed construction, we conclude that the civil harassment act, G. L. c. 258E, is not constitutionally overbroad because it limits the scope of prohibited speech to constitutionally unprotected \u201ctrue threats\u201d and \u201cfighting words.\u201d Because the case is moot as a consequence of the expiration of the harassment prevention order and because further findings from the judge would be needed to affirm the finding of civil harassment, we remand the case to the county court and direct the single justice to vacate the order of harassment. We also order that, after the date of the rescript in this case, all litigants seeking judicial review of harassment prevention orders under G. L. c. 258E are directed to the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\">General Laws c. 258E, inserted by St. 2010, c. 23, became effective on May 10, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\">G\u2019Brien also claims on appeal that the harassment prevention order against him constituted a prior restraint on speech. O\u2019Brien, however, did not make this claim before the District Court judge or the single justice, and therefore we will not consider it on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Century Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43. Because a \u201ctrue threat\u201d need not produce an imminent fear of harm, we erred in concluding that \u201ctrue threats\u201d analysis did not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>to criminal harassment. <em>Welch, supra. </em>Having unnecessarily excluded \u201ctrue threats\u201d from our constitutional analysis, we similarly erred in concluding that the criminal harassment statute was limited in its reach to \u201cfighting words\u201d rather than both \u201cfighting words\u201d and \u201ctrue threats.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 98-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b446-12\">We interpret G. L. c. 258E, \u00a7 1, to require proof that the defendant had the requisite intent in committing each of the three required acts of wilful and malicious conduct. A plaintiff seeking protection through a civil harassment order must show that the defendant engaged in at least three wilful and malicious acts, and that for each act the defendant intended to cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property. But, in determining whether these three acts did \u201cin fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property,\u201d the fact finder must look to the cumulative pattern of harassment, and need not find that each act in fact caused fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property. General Laws c. 258E, \u00a7 1, defines harassment as \u201c[three] or more acts of willful and malicious conduct. . . <em>that does </em>in fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property\u201d (emphasis added). The use of the singular \u201cdoes\u201d rather than the plural \u201cdo\u201d indicates that it is the entire course of harassment, rather than each individual act, that must cause fear or intimidation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The gesture\u2019s history in this country dates back to at least 1886, when its first recorded appearance \u201coccurred in a professional baseball team photograph, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>where a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters gave the middle finger while posing for a joint team picture with the New York Giants.\u201d Robbins, Digitus Impudicus: The Middle Finger and the Law, 41 U.C.
