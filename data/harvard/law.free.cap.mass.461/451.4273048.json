L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, or whether the order must be reviewed in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that neither statute applies, but that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>plaintiff may nonetheless obtain review before a single justice under the certiorari statute, G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><em>Background. </em>On August 10, 1992, the board issued a statement of allegations against the plaintiff, Mindy Hoffer, alleging that her ability to practice medicine had become impaired by \u201cmental instability.\u201d See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5. On the same day, the board allowed a motion for summary suspension and issued an order temporarily suspending Hoffer\u2019s license to practice medicine. Although Hoffer contested this order, the order was upheld following a hearing before the chief administrative magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Hoffer decided subsequently to pursue a negotiated resolution with the board rather than to proceed to a final disciplinary hearing. Hoffer was represented by counsel when, on March 6, 1996, she stipulated to the substance of the board\u2019s allegations and to the continued suspension of her license. Pursuant to the stipulation, the suspension would be \u201cstayed\u201d on Hoffer\u2019s compliance with certain conditions, essentially requiring that she seek psychiatric treatment and submit to monitoring by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">On March 14, 2001, Hoffer entered into a \u201cprobation agreement\u201d with the board permitting her to return to the practice of medicine, subject to conditions similar to those listed in the 1996 agreement. The probation agreement required that Hoffer\u2019s compliance with these conditions be monitored by Physician Health Services (PHS), a private organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Three years later, in February, 2004, PHS notified the board that Hoffer had ceased treatment with her psychiatrist, in violation of the probation agreement. In response to this violation, the board informed Hoffer that it would consider \u201cwhether to immediately suspend [Hoffer\u2019s] license to practice medicine, or to impose any lesser sanction.\u201d On March 3, 2004, the board \u201cvacated the stay\u201d on the suspension of Hoffer\u2019s license. Per this order, Hoffer had \u201cthe right to petition the board for a [further] stay of suspension\u201d but \u201cthe board retained] the discretion to deny the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Hoffer did not challenge the March, 2004, order until Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ary, 2005, when she filed an action for damages against the board in the Superior Court. The board successfully opposed this complaint as untimely, and also as seeking the functional equivalent of review under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a statute outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the Superior Court. In September, 2005, Hoffer filed a second petition for review of the board\u2019s 2004 order, this time in the county court. The single justice denied review as untimely, and Hoffer appealed to the full court. That appeal was stayed pending further proceedings before the board, but subsequently was dismissed as moot. <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>457 Mass. 1004 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">During the period that Hoffer\u2019s appeal from the 2005 decision of the single justice was stayed, she filed two petitions with the board requesting that she be allowed to resume the practice of medicine. The first such petition was filed on June 21, 2007, and was deferred pending Hoffer\u2019s completion of a psychiatric evaluation and the receipt of certain documentation from PHS. The second such petition, filed in March, 2009, was denied by the board in an order issued on September 16, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is the denial of this petition that Hoffer challenged before the single justice and that is the subject of this reservation and report. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We are asked to determine the means by which Hoffer may seek judicial review of the board\u2019s most recent decision pertaining to her medical license, i.e., the denial of her March, 2009, petition to reinstate her license.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">a. <em>Administrative Procedure Act. </em>The Massachusetts Administrative Procedure Act permits any person aggrieved by a \u201cfinal decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding\u201d to seek judicial review of that decision. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (\u00a7 14). \u201cProceedings for judicial review of an agency decision [under \u00a7 14] shall be instituted in the [S]uperior [C]ourt.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1). Although \u00a7 14 establishes the default method for review of an agency adjudication, there are nonetheless circumstances in which \u00a7 14 will not avail a party aggrieved by an agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>As relevant here, a plaintiff may rely on \u00a7 14 only where the challenged agency action is the result of an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. An \u201c[ajdjudicatory proceeding,\u201d in turn, is \u201ca proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specifically named persons are required by constitutional right or by any provision of the General Laws to be determined after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1. We are aware of no statute that would have required the board to grant Hoffer a hearing on her petition for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Further, Hoffer did not have a constitutional right to a hearing on her petition for the reinstatement of her license to practice medicine. In reaching this conclusion, we need not determine whether Hoffer had a constitutional liberty or property interest in her suspended license to practice medicine. We need determine only whether, by the terms of the board\u2019s 2004 order,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> any expectation Hoffer had in the restoration of her medical license to active status was sufficiently certain to constitute \u201ca legitimate claim of entitlement.\u201d See <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against deprivations of interests in \u201clife, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cProcedural due process protections,\u201d such as the right to a hearing, \u201care only triggered when a liberty or property interest is at issue.\u201d <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>431 Mass. 1, 7 (2000). The mere \u201cexpectancy]\u201d or hope of a future benefit is neither sufficiently certain nor sufficiently material to constitute a property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Spath </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>728 F.2d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 1984), citing <em>Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, supra. </em>Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ingly, the government\u2019s decision to deny a person a future benefit that \u201cis discretionary... or is conditioned on. . . complex or subjective criteria\u201d will not normally implicate procedural due process. See <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Paicos, </em>66 F. Supp. 2d 138, 165 (D. Mass. 1999); <em>Roslindale Motor Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>405 Mass. 79, 83 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Here, by the terms of the 2004 order, Hoffer could petition the board for \u201ca stay of suspension,\u201d but the board \u201cretain[ed] the discretion to deny the petition or to accept the petition under such terms and conditions as the Board may order.\u201d The 2004 order itself included no limitations on the board\u2019s discretion. In this respect, the language of the 2004 order tracked the text of 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.05(3)(b) (1995) as it pertains to the reinstatement of revoked medical licenses, which is also entrusted to the \u201c[b]card\u2019s discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In exercising this discretion, the board is required to determine whether reinstatement \u201cwould advance the public interest.\u201d 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.05(4) (1995). This inquiry requires the exercise of the board\u2019s professional expertise and judgment in \u201cweighing and balancing a wide range of considerations peculiar to the petitioner in light of the public interest.\u201d <em>Haran </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>398 Mass. 571, 579 (1986). See <em>Sugar-man </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>422 Mass. 338, 347-348 (1996) (noting that appropriate nature and term of sanction is matter of board expertise). Such discretion stands in contrast to the largely ministerial function performed by those agencies that administer benefits in which applicants have been found to have a property interest. Compare <em>Madera </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Communities &amp; Dev., </em>418 Mass. 452, 460 (1994) (finding property interest in housing benefit required to be \u201callocated essentially on a first-come, first-served basis\u201d), with <em>Roslindale Motor Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>(no entitlement to license to sell used motor vehicles). See <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Paicos, supra </em>(distinguishing discretionary licensing from benefits granted under \u201ceasily judged criteria\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In light of the discretionary nature of the board\u2019s determination, we cannot conclude that Hoffer had a sufficiently certain expectancy in the reinstatement of her medical license that the denial of her petition constituted a deprivation of a constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ally protected property interest. Accordingly, Hoffer did not have a constitutional right to a hearing on her petition for reinstatement. Because Hoffer had neither a statutory nor a constitutional right to a hearing on her petition for reinstatement, the board\u2019s order was not the result of an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding.\u201d Therefore, Hoffer may not rely on G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, to obtain review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">b. <em>Professional licensing act. </em>Hoffer\u2019s reliance on G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, to obtain such review is also misplaced. That statute provides that this court, \u201cupon petition of a person whose certificate, registration, license or authority has been suspended, revoked or cancelled, may enter a decree revising or reversing the decision of the board.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64. Here, the challenged 2004 order did not \u201csuspend[], revoke[] or cancel!]\u201d Hoffer\u2019s license to practice medicine. Hoffer\u2019s license had already been suspended, and the order issued by the board is therefore more analogous to an order denying reinstatement of a revoked license than an order suspending, revoking, or canceling a license. See Part a, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, the board\u2019s action does not implicate the plain and unambiguous language of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64. See, e.g., Schiff vs. Board of Registration in Med., No. SJ-2004-0269 (Oct. 4, 2004); Il Kim vs. Board of Registration in Med., No. SJ-95-0428 (May 5, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">c. <em>Certiorari. </em>Our conclusion does not mean, however, that Hoffer is without a judicial remedy. The certiorari statute provides an avenue for aggrieved parties to \u201ccorrect errors in [quasi judicial administrative] proceedings . . . which ... are not otherwise reviewable by motion or by appeal.\u201d G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff relying on the certiorari statute must sufficiently allege \u201c(1) a judicial or quasi judicial proceeding, (2) from which there is no other reasonably adequate remedy, and (3) a substantial injury or injustice arising from the proceeding under review.\u201d <em>Indeck </em>v. <em>Clients\u2019 Sec. Bd., </em>450 Mass. 379, 385 (2008) <em>(Indeck), </em>and cases cited. We conclude that Hoffer\u2019s claim meets this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We first consider whether the agency proceeding on Hoffer\u2019s petition was quasi judicial. We have classified the exercise of an agency\u2019s discretion to award benefits into two broad categories: quasi judicial proceedings on the one hand, and purely administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>live actions on the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the latter category are actions that are legislative or \u201cpolitical in nature,\u201d <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Hazardous Waste Facility Site Safety Council, </em>392 Mass. 107, 117 (1984), and decisions that are purely administrative. See, e.g., <em>Reidy </em>v. <em>Acting Director of Civil Serv., </em>354 Mass. 760 (1968) (civil service hiring and appointment).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In classifying an agency proceeding as quasi judicial, we have looked to the form of the proceeding reasonably employed by the agency, and the extent to which that proceeding resembles judicial action. See <em>School Comm. of Hudson </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>448 Mass. 565, 576 (2007) <em>(School Comm. of Hudson), </em>and cases cited. Here, the proceeding did not involve \u201cunsworn statements by interested persons advocating or disapproving [a] proposed new policy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Pronghorn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Peabody, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 73 (1982) (Pronghorn). Rather, it required adversary presentation of opposing pleadings \u201cfollowed by the adoption of formal findings of fact.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Hudson, supra, </em>quoting <em>Pronghorn, supra. </em>Further, although the proceeding was not \u201cpreceded by specific charges,\u201d it did relate to an individualized course of discipline. <em>School Comm. of Hudson, supra. </em>Accordingly, regardless whether Hoffer would have been entitled to an adjudicatory hearing on her petition for reinstatement, the procedures adopted by the board in dealing with the petition qualify as quasi judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Hoffer\u2019s claim also meets the second prong of the <em>Indeck </em>test, in that no other reasonably available remedy is open to her. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>neither G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, nor G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, provides an alternate remedy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Finally, we treat the wrongful withholding of Hoffer\u2019s reinstatement to her chosen profession as sufficient injury under the third prong of the <em>Indeck </em>test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Indeck, supra </em>at 386 (plaintiff unable to show justiciable injury where agency statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>entitled to reject claim for reasons \u201cunrelated to the merits of any particular claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that Hoffer may seek review of the board\u2019s decision denying her petition for reinstatement of her license to practice medicine by filing an action seeking a writ of certiorari. See G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We answer the first reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d We answer the second reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d This matter is remanded to the county court for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-13\">A single justice reserved and reported two questions to the full court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">\u201c(1) Is the board\u2019s decision dated September 16, 2009, denying Hoffer\u2019s petition to stay the suspension of her license to practice medicine, reviewable by the single justice under G.
