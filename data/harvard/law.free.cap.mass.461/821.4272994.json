L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a); </em>possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h); </em>and possession of a loaded firearm, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(n).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendants appealed, and we granted their applications for direct appellate review. They challenge, among other issues, the sufficiency of the evidence that they possessed the firearm, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>they contend that, even if they did, the unlicensed carrying of the firearm was not a crime because the firearm was manufactured before 1900. We conclude that the evidence that the defendants jointly and knowingly possessed the loaded firearm is sufficient as a matter of law. But we also conclude that the judge erred in denying the defendants the opportunity to offer the affirmative defense that the firearm was manufactured before 1900 and therefore could be lawfully possessed without a license to carry, and that this error may have materially influenced the firearm and ammunition convictions. We, therefore, reverse the judgments of conviction on the firearm charges and the ammunition charge as to each defendant, and we remand the cases to the Boston Municipal Court for a new trial on these charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\"><em>Background. </em>Because the defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, we describe in detail the evidence at trial viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 173-175 (1992). On February 21, 2009, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Officer Dennis Medina and Sergeant James Tarantino of the Boston police department, along with State Trooper William Cameron, were finishing their patrol shift in an unmarked police cruiser in the Dorchester section of Boston when they saw a vehicle fail to stop at a red traffic light. The officers approached the vehicle in their cmiser and turned on the cruiser\u2019s police lights and siren to make a traffic stop. The vehicle promptly came to a stop on the side of the road, and the cruiser stopped behind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Once Trooper Cameron and Sergeant Tarantino stepped out of the cruiser, the vehicle raced away, the tires \u201cscreeching.\u201d The officers returned to their cmiser and gave chase. Driving at a high rate of speed, the vehicle made a right turn onto Vinson Street, going up onto the curb and nearly striking a building at the intersection. Vinson Street is a one-way street and the vehicle was moving in the wrong direction. The vehicle did not stop or slow at the intersection, and it continued on to a street named Wellesley Park. Without slowing, the vehicle then took a wide left turn onto Melville Avenue. As the vehicle turned, the cmiser was a few \u201ccar lengths\u201d behind, and the pursuing police officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>lost sight of the vehicle for \u201c[n]o more than a couple of seconds.\u201d On Melville Avenue the vehicle slowed as it approached the intersection with Dorchester Avenue, made a right turn on Dorchester Avenue that was more controlled than its previous turn, and finally stopped a \u201ccouple of blocks\u201d from the intersection with Melville Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Trooper Cameron left the cruiser, removed the driver (Burton-Brown) from the vehicle, put him on the ground, and handcuffed him. Cameron told Burton-Brown that he was under arrest \u201cbecause he ran from us.\u201d Burton-Brown explained that he had \u201can open case\u201d and fled because he was scared. When the trooper said he was under arrest just for motor vehicle violations, Burton-Brown\u2019s demeanor changed: \u201cHe became cocky, kind of like laughing at me . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The other officers removed the front seat passenger (Jefferson) and the back seat passenger<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the vehicle and handcuffed them. The front passenger\u2019s side window of the vehicle was \u201call the way down.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other police officers were called to retrace the path of the chase to search for any items thrown from the vehicle. Approximately ten minutes later, a police team searching with flashlights located a firearm and what appeared to be \u201cbroken pieces of plastic,\u201d later identified to be part of the firearm\u2019s handle, \u201cscattered about\u201d in the middle of a paved walkway leading to the front steps of a house on Melville Avenue, near the comer of Wellesley Park where the defendants\u2019 vehicle had earlier made the wide turn while being chased. Although the police had not seen anything being thrown from the vehicle, the location of the firearm was consistent with its having been thrown from the open front passenger\u2019s side window when the police lost sight of the vehicle as it turned left onto Melville Avenue. While retracing the path of the vehicle, the police noticed no other pedestrians or other potential source of the firearm. The firearm was in plain view on the walkway, a few feet from the sidewalk. A resident of the house had not seen any firearm around her house or street in the twenty years she lived there.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>The firearm on the walkway was a Harrington &amp; Richardson .32 caliber five-shot revolver, loaded with three rounds. Forensic testing yielded no recoverable fingerprints on the revolver. Two of the three rounds in the firearm were \u201cstruck but not fired,\u201d meaning the primer had been struck but the projectile had not discharged from the casing. Detective Martin Lydon of the Boston police department, a firearm and toolmark examiner with the department\u2019s firearm analysis unit, tested the operability of the firearm on June 23, 2010. Before he test fired it, Lydon opened the firearm\u2019s cylinder to make sure it was safe and that the parts were there. When he did that, three pieces fell out: a firing pin, a firing pin spring, and a \u201cbushing that holds it in.\u201d Lydon put the firing pin and spring back into the revolver, then used a small pair of pliers that anyone could purchase to put the bushing in \u201cand twist it about\u201d with a three-quarter turn to secure it, a procedure that \u201ctook about a minute.\u201d He then loaded the revolver with two rounds of \u201cstock ammunition\u201d and pulled the trigger, intending to fire both rounds into a water tank. The firearm did not discharge on the first two pulls of the trigger, but he \u201ccontinued pulling the trigger, and the next time the two rounds came around, each one was discharged.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendants moved for required findings of not guilty at the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s case under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), and renewed their motions under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), after the jury\u2019s verdicts. On appeal, the defendants contend that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that they were in knowing possession of the loaded revolver that was found on Melville Avenue, or that the revolver met the definition of a firearm under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, which requires proof that \u201ca shot or bullet can be discharged\u201d from the revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In evaluating the sufficiency of evidence, we ask whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 361 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">While we recognize the issue to be close, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants jointly and knowingly possessed the loaded revolver. While no recoverable fingerprints were found on the revolver and no one saw anyone throw the firearm from the vehicle during the chase, a jury reasonably could have inferred from the location of the firearm in the middle of the walkway that it had only recently landed there, because it was in such plain view that it would not have remained there for long without being reported or removed. The jury reasonably could have inferred from the broken pieces of the handle found near the revolver that the firearm had hit the ground with enough force for the handle to break into pieces, and that such force was consistent with it being thrown from a moving vehicle. The location of the revolver was also consistent with where it would have landed had it been thrown from the open front passenger\u2019s side window of the vehicle at the moment when the police briefly lost sight of it as Burton-Brown made a wide left turn onto Melville Avenue. Because the police officers who retraced the path of the defendants\u2019 flight saw no pedestrians or any other apparent source of the weapon, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the firearm had been thrown from the defendants\u2019 vehicle during the brief moment in the chase when the vehicle could not be seen from the police cruiser. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 150, 154 (2008) (defendants were \u201conly persons in the immediate vicinity\u201d of firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">This circumstantial evidence must be considered with other evidence that reasonably permitted the inference that the defendants had thrown some type of contraband from the vehicle during the chase. A rational jury could infer that Burton-Brown sped away for a reason when the police first left their cruiser to approach the vehicle, and that the reason was to throw away contraband that Burton-Brown feared the police would find during a stop. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>408 Mass. 454, 461 (1990) (\u201cActions and statements that indicate a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, together with other evidence, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>sufficient to prove his guilt\u201d). By initially stopping and racing away only after the police had left the cruiser, Burton-Brown ensured a head start that would provide some separation between the vehicles, and gave the defendants the opportunity to throw the contraband from the vehicle without being seen by the police in the cruiser. If the purpose was to throw contraband from the vehicle without being seen, the time to have done it would have been immediately after the vehicle turned onto another street. Burton-Brown was driving so fast that it would have been difficult for him to throw the contraband out of the window, so it was reasonable to infer that the front seat passenger, whose window was found \u201call the way down\u201d on that \u201ctypical February night,\u201d was the person who threw the contraband. The vehicle slowed after turning onto Melville Avenue and came to a stop on Dorchester Avenue, which permits the inference that the contraband had been thrown from the vehicle as it entered Melville Avenue, but that Burton-Brown wanted the inevitable police stop to occur a significant distance away from where the contraband had been discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Burton-Brown\u2019s conduct during the traffic stop reasonably suggests that he had discarded contraband during the chase. A reasonable jury could find incredible his explanation that he fled the police because he had \u201can open case,\u201d and could infer that he lied to the police to mask the true reason for his flight. His apparent relief at learning that his arrest was only for motor vehicle violations suggests that he feared something worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">This evidence, viewed as a totality in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, would permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Burton-Brown knew that he had a firearm in the vehicle and that Jefferson threw it from the front right passenger window as the vehicle made the turn onto Melville Avenue. It would also permit a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Burton-Brown and Jefferson knowingly had joint actual or constructive possession or control of the firearm in the vehicle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sann Than, </em>442 Mass. 748, 751 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sespedes, </em>442 Mass. 95, 99 (2004) (\u201c \u2018Constructive possession\u2019 requires proof that the defendant had \u2018knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control\u2019 \u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>416 Mass. 279, 284 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yazbeck, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 769, 775 (1992) (\u201cPossession \u2018may be constructive rather than actual; it may be joint and not exclusive; and it may be proved by circumstantial evidence\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We also conclude that the evidence is sufficient as a matter of law to support the jury\u2019s finding that the revolver was a firearm as defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, based on Detective Lydon\u2019s expert testimony that, after a relatively slight repair with a pair of small pliers, he fired two rounds from the revolver. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>326 Mass. 218, 220 (1950) (\u201cWhile it may be conceded that a weapon designed for firing projectiles may be so defective or damaged that it has lost its initial character as a firearm, . . . this character is not lost when a relatively slight repair, replacement, or adjustment will make it an effective weapon\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prevost, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402-403 (1998) (gun meets statutory definition of firearm where it is capable of firing after replacing broken firing pin with new one).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Therefore, the evidence at trial was sufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction of carrying a firearm without a license, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a); </em>possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>Qi)\\ </em>and possession of a loaded firearm, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (n).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">2. <em>\u201cAntique\u201d firearm. </em>The defendants claim that the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>judge erred in denying their joint motion to dismiss the counts alleging carrying a firearm without a license and possession of a loaded firearm. In that motion, the defendants argued that their firearms expert, Gregory Danas, had determined from the serial number of the revolver that it was manufactured \u201cbefore 1899,\u201d and therefore it was an \u201cantique\u201d that was not a \u201cfirearm\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Immediately before trial, the prosecutor filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence offered to show that the firearm was an antique, claiming that whether it was an antique was not material to any potential defense in the case. After the judge declared that a firearm manufactured in 1896 is not an antique under the firearm laws, the defendants argued that the date of manufacture of the firearm would assist the jury in evaluating the qualifications and training of the expert witnesses. The judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, ruling that the word \u201cantique\u201d was not admissible to describe the firearm, but declared that testimony relating to the age and serial number of the firearm was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">At trial, Detective Lydon testified that he did not know when the firearm was manufactured. Danas, the defendants\u2019 firearm expert, testified, based on the serial number, that the firearm was manufactured in 1896 and was classified a \u201ccollectible gun.\u201d When Jefferson\u2019s attorney asked Danas if possession of collectible firearms required a license, the judge sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">A firearm manufactured before 1900 is a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the definition of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, which defines a \u201c[fjirearm\u201d as \u201ca pistol, revolver or other weapon of any description, loaded or unloaded, from which a shot or bullet can be discharged and of which the length of the barrel or barrels is less than 16 inches or 18 inches in the case of a shotgun as originally manufactured.\u201d However, \u00a7 121 also provides that the \u201cprovisions of [\u00a7\u00a7] 122 to 129D, inclusive, and [\u00a7\u00a7] 131, 131A, 131B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>and 13 IE shall not apply to . . . any firearm, rifle or shotgun manufactured in or prior to the year 1899.\u201d Because G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, governs licenses to carry firearms, and because \u00a7 131 does not apply to firearms manufactured before 1900, a person does not need a license to carry a firearm made before 1900. The carrying of such an antique firearm, therefore, is exempted by \u00a7 131 from the prohibition in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a), against carrying a firearm without a license. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(\u201cWhoever, except as provided or exempted by statute, knowingly has [a firearm] in his possession . . . or . . . under his control in a vehicle\u201d without license to carry firearms issued under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, is guilty of crime). As a result, a defendant may not be convicted under \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>of carrying a firearm manufactured before 1900 without a license to carry because the defendant is permitted to carry such an antique firearm without a license to carry.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In allowing the motion in limine, the judge relied on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bibby, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 158, 163 (2002) <em>(Bibby), </em>where the Appeals Court found no error in a judge\u2019s refusal to allow a defendant to argue to the jury that he would not be in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>if the firearm he carried was manufactured before 1900. The <em>Bibby </em>court held that the argument that a firearm manufactured before 1900 falls outside the scope of \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>\u201cis contrary to the legislative purpose of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a), and the clear and unambiguous language of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121.\u201d <em>Bibby, supra. </em>The Appeals Court correctly recognized that the purpose of \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>is \u201cto control the carrying of firearms so as to \u2018protect the public from the potential danger incident to . . . [their] unlawful possession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 911 (1976). But the court failed to recognize that the Legislature also had a valid purpose in exempting firearms manufactured before 1900 from the statute governing the issuance of a license to carry, namely to allow individuals to carry antique firearms to Revolutionary War and Civil War reenactments without requiring them first to obtain a license to carry. By invoking \u201cthe clear and unambiguous language of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121,\u201d <em>id., the Bibby </em>court appeared to be under the misimpression that \u00a7 121 did not exempt firearms manufactured before 1900 from the licensing requirement in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>The <em>Bibby </em>court cited in support of its holding an opinion issued by the Attorney General on August 7, 1975, in response to an inquiry from the Commissioner of Public Safety made in anticipation of nonresidents coming to Massachusetts with flintlock or longarm rifles to participate in the Bicentennial Celebration. See <em>Bibby, supra </em>at 164 &amp; n.5, citing Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 95-96 (1975). The Attorney General in his opinion declared that the license exemptions in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, for firearms manufactured before 1899 \u201callows antique firearms, rifles, or shotguns to be kept at home or in one\u2019s place of business without any special permit, license or card being required,\u201d but did not exempt such firearms from the prohibition against the <em>carrying </em>of firearms in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, <em>supra </em>at 96. When that opinion was written in 1975, however, the statutory exemption in \u00a7 121 did not include G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, which governs the issuance of licenses to carry. Not until 1990 did the Legislature revise \u00a7 121 to add \u00a7 131 to the list of statutes that \u201cshall not apply\u201d to the older firearms discussed in the Attorney General\u2019s 1975 opinion. St. 1990, c. 511, \u00a7 1. With that amendment, the reasoning of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion now supports the conclusion that firearms manufactured before 1900 may be carried lawfully without a license to carry.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Because of the judge\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine, the defendants were denied the opportunity to raise this affirmative defense before the jury and argue that, if the Commonwealth failed to prove that the firearm was manufactured after 1899, the defendants should be found not guilty of the offenses predicated on the unlawful carrying of a firearm. The judge\u2019s ruling also meant that the Commonwealth was not required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>rebut this affirmative defense to prevail at trial and, therefore, did not need either to present evidence regarding the manufacturing date of the firearm or to challenge the expert\u2019s testimony that the firearm was manufactured in 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Rule 14 (b) (3) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004), requires defendants to provide pretrial notice that they intend to rely on a defense of exemption. The defendants here failed to provide clear notice before trial of their defense that, because the firearm was manufactured before 1900, it was exempt from the licensing requirement and may lawfully be carried without a license. Had they done so, the Commonwealth would have had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm was not manufactured before 1900 once the defendants met their burden of production through the testimony of their firearm expert that the revolver was manufactured in 1896. Moreover, the defendants here confused the issue by arguing to the motion and trial judges that a firearm manufactured \u201cbefore 1899\u201d was not a \u201cfirearm\u201d under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, an argument the judges properly rejected. In these circumstances, it would not be fair to order a judgment of acquittal on the firearm charges where the Commonwealth offered no evidence that the firearm was manufactured after 1899. Nor would it be fair to conclude that the defendants waived this defense where they provided the judge and the Commonwealth with notice in advance of trial of evidence that the firearm was manufactured before 1900 but failed properly to characterize their defense as one of exemption. We conclude that the only fair result here is to reverse the convictions of carrying a firearm without a license and the unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, and remand for a new trial to give the defendants the opportunity to offer evidence of their affirmative defense and the Commonwealth the opportunity to offer evidence in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">While firearms manufactured before 1900 are exempt from the licensing requirement in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, a defendant may still be convicted of the unlawful possession of ammunition loaded in a firearm manufactured before 1900 if the defendant does not have a firearm identification card and the ammunition does not fall under some exemption. See, e.g., G. L. c. 269, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>\u00a7 10 <em>(h) </em>(crime to possess ammunition without firearm identification card); G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (listing exemptions including \u201cso-called black powder rifles, shotguns, and ammunition therefor\u201d). Therefore, a defendant in possession of a loaded firearm manufactured before 1900 may not be guilty of the unlawful carrying of a loaded firearm, but may still be guilty of the unlawful possession of ammunition. However, we recognize that denying the jury the opportunity to consider the \u201cantique firearm\u201d affirmative defense as to the firearm charges may also have materially influenced their verdicts on the charges of unlawful possession of the ammunition in the firearm. Where, as here, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that the defendants knowingly possessed the ammunition was not strong but was sufficient as a matter of law, and where acquittals on the firearm charges based on the age of the firearm may have materially affected the jury\u2019s verdicts as to the ammunition charges, we conclude that a new trial on the ammunition charge is also necessary to avert a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>459 Mass. 442, 456 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). We, therefore, also reverse that conviction as to each defendant and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">In the future, where a defendant charged with the unlawful carrying of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 10 (a) possesses evidence that the firearm was manufactured before 1900, the defendant shall provide the Commonwealth with pretrial notice of the affirmative defense of exemption as required by rule 14 (b) (3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 214 (2005) (statutory exemption \u201cis an affirmative defense\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 407 (1977) (treating firearm licensing exclusion as affirmative defense). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>443 Mass. 171, 178-179 (2005), quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.12(3)(c) (1985) (\u201caffirmative defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>[is] one that \u2018involves a matter of . . . justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence\u2019 \u201d). Once a defendant gives proper notice to the Commonwealth, the defendant bears the burden of producing evidence of the affirmative defense that the firearm was manufactured before 1900. If such evidence is presented, the burden rests on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm was manufactured after 1899. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eberhart, ante </em>809, 813 (2012) (once defendant raises affirmative defense and produces evidence that he had valid license to carry, Commonwealth bears burden of proving he had no valid license); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>459 Mass. 572, 582 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1739 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 226, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1079 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">3. <em>Remaining defense claims. </em>Because we are reversing the firearms and ammunition convictions and remanding for a new trial, we briefly address the remaining defense claims where they may bar a new trial or may recur at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">a. <em>Constitutional challenges. </em>The defendants claim that the Massachusetts statutes governing the licensing of firearms are facially unconstitutional, violate their right to equal protection of law, and impermissibly impinge on their right \u201cto keep and bear arms\u201d under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>130 S. Ct. 3020 (2010) <em>(McDonald), </em>and <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570 (2008) <em>(Heller). </em>We rejected similar challenges in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eberhart, supra </em>at 813-814 (right to bear arms), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, ante </em>787, 799-808 (2012) <em>(Gouse) </em>(same), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loadholt, </em>460 Mass. 723, 724-727 (2011) (facial challenge to licensing scheme), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, supra </em>at 583-586 (right to bear arms; equal protection), and decline to revisit these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Burton-Brown additionally challenges on due process grounds G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7, which requires a defendant in a firearms case whose defense is that he had a license to carry or a firearm identification card to \u201cprove the same.\u201d The defendant claims that the statute \u201cimpermissibly shifts the burden upon the defendant to prove his innocence.\u201d We addressed and rejected this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>argument in <em>Gouse, supra </em>at 801-808, noting that G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7, only \u201cimpose[s] the burden of production on the defendant, maintaining the ultimate burden of disproving a properly raised affirmative defense on the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. As we noted in <em>Gouse, </em>\u201c[t]here is no constitutional deficit in this allocation of the burdens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>508 U.S. 333, 341 (1993) (\u201cStates must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to every element of the offense charged, but . . . they may place on defendants the burden of proving affirmative defenses\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 351 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (defendant \u201chad only the burden of production and not the burden of persuasion; once he produced sufficient evidence for the issue to go to the jury, the State was required to prove the absence of his defense beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). \u201cNothing in the <em>McDonald </em>and <em>Heller </em>decisions has altered or abrogated our jurisprudence regarding the elements of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm or the allocation of the burdens of production and proof with respect to the affirmative defense of licensure.\u201d <em>Gouse, supra </em>at 801, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loadholt, supra </em>at 726-727.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">b. <em>The judge\u2019s preliminary instructions of law. </em>The defendants claim that the judge erred by preliminarily instructing the jury as to the elements of the crimes charged before the opening statement without also instructing them on the definitions of a firearm, ammunition, and reasonable doubt; on the meaning of possession and knowledge under the law; and on their obligation to consider the evidence separately against each defendant. Where, as here, the judge correctly instructed the jury as to the elements of the crime and informed the jury that they would receive further instructions on the law at the conclusion of the case, the judge committed no error by saving the remaining instructions for the close of trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>438 Mass. 779, 786 (2003) (preliminary instructions \u201cwill be considered along with the judge\u2019s final instructions in deciding whether the instructions were correct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">c. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendants contend that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper because he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">\u201cI submit to you that a handle isn\u2019t going to shatter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>unless there\u2019s some serious force when it hits the ground .... Is it unreasonable to think when the firearm gets thrown, there might be some pieces that get loose? Is it unreasonable to think when the firearm gets thrown, the handle is going to break off into several pieces? I suggest to you the answer to both of those questions is no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The defendants assert that, because no expert testified as to the amount of force that would be needed to break the handle of the firearm or affect its firing mechanism, these statements were unsupported by the evidence and suggested that the prosecutor had personal knowledge regarding the evidence that was not before the jury. Because the defendants did not object at trial, we review the alleged error for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasguez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 355-356 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">We conclude that the argument was not improper and posed no risk of a miscarriage of justice. The prosecutor\u2019s argument \u201cwas grounded in common sense, not expertise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siny Van Tran, </em>460 Mass. 535, 555-556 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>431 Mass. 609, 613 (2000). The prosecutor did not need expert testimony to invite the jury to infer that an old firearm might be damaged and a handle might break into pieces if thrown from a speeding vehicle onto a paved walkway. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merry, </em>453 Mass. 653, 667 n.15 (2009) (\u201chere the jury were equipped to draw their own conclusions\u201d). Nor did the prosecutor suggest that he relied on special knowledge not before the jury in making this assertion. Contrast <em>id. </em>at 666 (prosecutor\u2019s closing argument that \u201cwe know ... a person having a seizure does not sit up\u201d improper as drawing \u201cfrom facts not in evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The defendants\u2019 convictions of carrying a firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, and possession of a loaded firearm are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the cases are remanded for a new trial on these charges. Burton-Brown\u2019s unappealed convictions of negligent operation of a motor vehicle and failure to stop for the police stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-13\">Leslie Burton-Brown was also convicted of negligent operation of a motor vehicle, in violation of G.

The expended round from that test firing was admitted in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">To be convicted of unlawful possession of ammunition, the defendant must know that he possessed ammunition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, ante </em>44, 53 (2011); Instruction 7.620 of the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (2009). Where, as here, the firearm was a revolver located in a vehicle, a rational jury could infer that those who possessed the firearm knew that it was loaded with ammunition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elysee, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 833, 846-848 (2010). However, where, as here, the possession of ammunition charge is based solely on the ammunition found within the firearm, the defendants\u2019 convictions of unlawful possession of ammunition and unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, if they were both to be affirmed, would be duplicative, and separate sentences for each crime would violate the double jeopardy clause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 54. We do not address here whether, to be convicted of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, a defendant must know that the firearm he possessed was loaded. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (w) (whoever violates statute prohibiting unlawful carrying of firearm \u201cby means of a loaded firearm . . . shall be further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>punished\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 52-53 (\u201cTo convict the defendant of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm that was loaded with ammunition and met the legal requirements of a firearm as defined by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\">When the Attorney General offered his opinion in 1975, the relevant exemption in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as appearing in St. 1969, c. 799, \u00a7 1, applied to firearms manufactured before 1899.
