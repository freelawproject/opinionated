The employee received workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, for his temporary and total incapacity for work from December 15, 1980, to May 2, 1988. In 1989, he found employment in Connecticut with Wholesale Auto Supply, where he worked initially as a driver and later as \u201ccounter person.\u201d After working in pain for many years and after a knuckle of his right index finger was replaced with an artificial joint, he underwent a medical procedure on July 1, 2003, to relieve his severe pain, which left him with unremitting \u201cstabbing, stinging, burning pain in his right hand and arm.\u201d In December, 2003, the employee applied for total and permanent disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, as of July 1, 2003. He also claimed under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51, that, when he was injured in 1980, he was of \u201csuch age and experience . . . that, under natural conditions, in the open labor market, his wage would be expected to increase,\u201d and that he was entitled to have this fact considered in determining the average weekly wage used in the calculation of benefits. In addition, he claimed under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B, that he was entitled to receive compensation at the rate in effect on July 1, 2003, because he was permanently disabled from a subsequent injury that was a recurrence of his 1980 injury after having returned to work for a period of at least two months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation insurer cross-claimed for recoupment of $34,169.73 in temporary disability benefits paid to the employee from 1985 to 1988 in excess of the statutory cap of $45,000 then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">On June 12, 2007, an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) concluded that the employee has been totally and permanently incapacitated as of July 1, 2003, and awarded him total and permanent incapacity benefits under \u00a7 34A. He also found under \u00a7 51 that, \u201cif not for the horrific industrial injury,\u201d his wages on the open market \u201cwould be expected to have increased considerably.\u201d The administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>judge concluded under \u00a7 35B that the amount of compensation should be determined at the rate in effect on July 1, 2003, because the injury to the employee\u2019s hand caused by the industrial injury in 1980 had worsened after he had been employed at the automotive supply store and left him totally disabled as of that date. The administrative judge ordered the insurer to pay the employee total and permanent disability benefits from July 1, 2003, based on an average weekly wage of $900, at a weekly compensation rate of $600, which would be subject to normal cost-of-living adjustments from that date through the operation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B. He also determined that the insurer was not entitled to any recoupment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The insurer appealed from this decision to the department\u2019s reviewing board (board), which affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s finding of permanent and total incapacity under \u00a7 34A but reversed his determination of average weekly wages and the resulting rate of weekly compensation. In particular, the board ruled that the employee did not meet the prerequisites to adjust upward his applicable weekly wage under \u00a7 51, because there was no evidence \u201cthat the employee\u2019s wages would have increased due to the acquisition of any particular skill anticipated at the time of his injury,\u201d or \u201cof any time frame within which such increase reasonably might be expected.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the administrative judge\u2019s finding that the employee was entitled to an increase in applicable wages under \u00a7 51 was not \u201canchored in the evidence,\u201d the board declared the finding to be arbitrary and capricious. The board also concluded that, because the employee\u2019s recurrence of disability occurred while he was employed in Connecticut, his out-of-State wages could not be used under \u00a7 35B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>as the average weekly wage from which to calculate benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board concluded that his total and permanent disability benefits must be based on the average weekly wage he earned when he was initially injured on December 12, 1980 ($309.65), which, at the applicable two-thirds compensation rate, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, would yield a weekly benefit amount of $206.43, plus cost-of-living adjustments under \u00a7 34B. The board also vacated as arbitrary the administrative judge\u2019s denial of recoupment because it did not rest on any subsidiary findings, and reserved the insurer\u2019s right to renew its claim for recoupment through a separate complaint filed with the department or in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The Appeals Court affirmed \u201cthe board\u2019s reversal of the award of \u00a7 51 and \u00a7 35B benefits because the claimant had not acquired skills, undertaken training, or introduced other evidence predictive of a rising wage pattern or potentiality as of the time of his injury and because his final earnings arose from employment outside the Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d <em>Wadsworth\u2019s Case, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 110 (2010). The Appeals Court also affirmed the board\u2019s decision to vacate the denial of recoupment but ordered any consideration of recoupment \u201cto proceed under the equitable standard of laches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We granted the employee\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We affirm in part and reverse in part the board\u2019s decision. In short, we conclude that the board was not arbitrary or capricious in deciding that there was insufficient evidence to find that the employee was entitled under \u00a7 51 to compensation based on an amount greater than his average weekly wage. But we conclude that the board erred in finding that the employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>compensation should be based on the average weekly wage he earned when injured in 1980 rather than, under \u00a7 35B, the out-of-State average weekly wage he earned when that injury recurred in 2003. We recognize that, in reaching this finding, the board (and the Appeals Court) relied on what they understood to be controlling precedent in <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, </em>429 Mass. 280, 285 (1999), that out-of-State wages may not be used to calculate workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We limit the holding in that case to out-of-State wages earned after suffering latent injuries (such as from exposure to asbestos) that do not result in eligibility for incapacity benefits for at least five years under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35C. We also affirm the board\u2019s decision to vacate the denial of recoupment for the insurer\u2019s overpayment of temporary total disability benefits between 1985 and 1988, but we note that, should the insurer decide to renew its claim for recoupment in a separate complaint filed with the department under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, or in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D, its claim may prevail only if recoupment is equitable in the circumstances, including but not limited to the equitable defense of laches.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>We review a board\u2019s decision regarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the usual standard for appeal from a final decision of an administrative agency set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), except that we do not review whether the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2). <em>Sikorski\u2019s Case, </em>455 Mass. 477, 479-480 (2009). In the context of this case, we may reverse or modify the board\u2019s decision where it is based on an error of law, or is arbitrary or capricious. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(c), (g). </em>Because the board may reverse the decision of an administrative judge only where it is \u201cbeyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to law,\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, where the board reverses an administrative judge based on a finding of fact, we must determine whether the board was arbitrary or capricious in concluding that the administrative judge was arbitrary or capricious. \u201cThe board, as the agency charged with administering the workers\u2019 compensation law, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>entitled to substantial deference in its reasonable interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Sikorski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 480. See <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We address three questions on appeal. First, was the board\u2019s decision that the evidence at the hearing did not support a finding that the employee was entitled to a wage enhancement under \u00a7 51 arbitrary or capricious? Second, was the employee entitled under \u00a7 35B to compensation at the rate in effect at the time of his subsequent injury in 2003 based on his out-of-State wages? Third, was the board\u2019s remand on the issue of recoupment arbitrary or capricious and, if not, what standard should govern in determining whether recoupment is equitable? We address each question in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">1. <em>Wage enhancement under \u00a7 51. </em>With certain exceptions, workers\u2019 compensation \u201cis awarded for impairment of earning capacity and not for injury as such.\u201d <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 436 (1938). Stated differently, workers\u2019 compensation benefits generally do not compensate an injury but, rather, compensate for the loss of earning capacity during the period of disablement or incapacity that results from the injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Section 51 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\u201cWhenever an employee is injured under circumstances entitling him to compensation, if it be established that the injured employee was of such age and experience when injured that, under natural conditions, in the open labor market, his wage would be expected to increase, that fact may be considered in determining his weekly wage. A determination of an employee\u2019s benefits under this section shall not be limited to the circumstances of the employee\u2019s particular employer or industry at the time of injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 78.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In enacting \u00a7 51, the Legislature recognized that, depending on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>employee\u2019s age and experience, the average weekly wage he received when injured may not be a fair measure of the impairment of the earning capacity that he would likely have achieved had he not been injured. See <em>Sliski\u2019s </em>Case, 424 Mass. 126, 135 (1997) (\u201c\u00a7 51 benefits attempt to compensate young workers for the economic opportunities they would have had if their careers had not been interrupted so early\u201d); L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 18.5, at 25 (3d ed. 2003 &amp; Supp. 2011) (Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall) (\u201cLimiting average weekly wage to the employment at the time of injury may be an unfair and unrealistic basis for measuring loss of earning capacity resulting from an injury\u201d). Through the mechanism furnished by \u00a7 51, where an injured employee has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that, but for his work-related injury, he would have earned a higher wage in the open labor market than he was earning at the time of injury, the employee is entitled to compensation based on the higher wages he would be expected to earn when he would have expected to earn them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 132, quoting <em>Louis </em>v. <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 311, 323 (1994) (Fischel, J., dissenting) (\u00a751 measures \u201clost wage increases by looking to \u2018the total industrial capacity deficit, not simply the previously injured worker\u2019s residual capacity\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In evaluating whether an injured employee has furnished sufficient evidence to prove that he \u201cwas of such age and experience when injured that, under natural conditions, in the open labor market, his wage would be expected to increase,\u201d we set various parameters. First, we agree with the Appeals Court that \u00a7 51 \u201cplainly speaks to the employee\u2019s vocational profile \u2018when injured,\u2019 \u201d so the employee\u2019s post-injury training and activities may not be used in determining an employee\u2019s eligibility for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>\u00a7 51 wage enhancement. <em>Wadsworth\u2019s Case, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 105 (2010). See <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 135 (focusing on \u201cemployee\u2019s abilities and prospects at the time of injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Second, the employee must demonstrate that he was on a path before his injury that, for a person of his age and experience under natural conditions, likely would have led to a wage increase in the open labor market based on the acquisition or development of skills, education, or work experience, or from anticipated job progression such as the transition from an apprentice to a journeyman to a master. See <em>id. </em>An anticipated wage increase to offset a reduction in purchasing power arising from inflation is not enough to support a wage enhancement under \u00a7 51; the employee must demonstrate that his earning capacity would likely have increased beyond the rate of inflation. See <em>id. </em>at 134-135 (noting that inflationary changes are compensated under \u00a7 34B).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Third, where an employee seeks to rely on preinjury employment aspirations, the employee must demonstrate tangible steps taken before injury toward achieving those aspirations. See, e.g., <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Briggs Landscape Constr. Co., </em>24 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 259, 262 (2010), <em>S.C., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 1110 (2011) (\u201cpreliminary steps . . . [or] mere intention to attempt to enter [a] line of work cannot support [a] claim under \u00a7 51\u201d); <em>Bruenell </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>23 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 133, 136 (2009) (\u201crank speculation\u201d regarding future skill acquisition not sufficient); <em>Klimek </em>v. <em>Wilbraham Toyota Volkswagen, </em>17 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 527, 530-532 (2003). Where an employee asserts as the basis for his \u00a7 51 wage enhancement claim that he had sought or planned to seek higher-paid employment, the employee must demonstrate with objective evidence that he likely would have achieved such employment but for his injury. See, e.g., <em>Ellis v. Briggs Landscape Constr. Co., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Here, the employee began work at the age of fourteen as a farmhand, milking cows, plowing fields, and repairing farm equipment. He attended high school for four years but did not graduate. In high school, he took trade courses, including mechanics, automotive shop, drafting, woodworking, and welding. While in high school, he worked as a short-order cook and did some roofing and siding work. He enlisted in the Navy but was honorably discharged because of a medical condition. After leaving the Navy, he returned to work as a short-order cook before getting a job at New England Concrete doing spot welding. When he was not welding on the job, he worked as a laborer performing other tasks, such as mixing cement and operating a metal rolling machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Before he was injured, he had taken no steps to obtain his high school graduate equivalency degree (GED) or special training in welding, either on- or off-the-job. He \u201chad dreams of working on a big building welding,\u201d but he had taken no tangible steps before his injury to realize that dream. After the injury, the employee obtained his GED and enrolled in a two-year vocational training program to become a machinist, where he completed the classroom portion of the training but could not perform the practical training because of the physical limitations of his right hand arising from his work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The board correctly concluded that the administrative judge erred by relying in part on the employee\u2019s postinjury education and training in finding that he was acquiring the skills needed to make him eligible for wage enhancement under \u00a7 51. We also agree with the board\u2019s determination that there was insufficient evidence to support the administrative judge\u2019s finding that the employee\u2019s wages \u201cwould be expected to have increased considerably based upon skill and knowledge and experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>acquisition if not for the horrific industrial injury.\u201d The administrative judge found that the employee had the \u201crequisite aptitude, interest, knowledge, motivation and ability to develop valuable skills in a variety of vocational endeavors.\u201d But this finding demonstrated only that the employee had the potential for wage growth at the time of his injury. An employee\u2019s potential for wage growth is not enough to support a \u00a7 51 finding; the employee must prove that he was on a path to realize that potential and likely would have done so within a foreseeable time frame but for the interruption due to his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The evidence here, even viewed generously, did not demonstrate that the employee was on a path toward a wage increase at the time of his injury. The employee performed various welding tasks, for which he received no special training, and when he was not welding, he performed various tasks as a laborer, for which he also received no special training. Prior to his injury, he was not an apprentice, advancing his education, or pursuing further job training, and there was no evidence that his wage could be expected to increase at a rate greater than the rate of inflation based on additional skills, education, experience, or job progression. Nor was he receiving a particularly low wage; at the time of his injury in December, 1980, although the employee was only twenty-two years old, he was earning $309.65 per week, which was twenty-six per cent above the Statewide weekly wage of $245.48 per week for all workers in 1980. See Department of Industrial Accidents Circular Letter No. 339 at Table I (rev. Oct. 4, 2011), reprinted in Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, <em>supra </em>at Appendix M, at 626. For these reasons, we conclude that the board was not arbitrary or capricious, or relying on an error of law, when it concluded that the employee was not entitled to a wage enhancement under \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">2. <em>Compensation under \u00a7 35B. </em>General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 35B, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cAn employee who has been receiving compensation under this chapter and who has returned to work for a period of not less than two months shall, if he is subsequently injured and receives compensation, be paid such compensation at the rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury whether or not such subsequent injury is determined to be a recurrence of the former injury; pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>vided, that if compensation for the old injury was paid in a lump sum, he shall not receive compensation unless the subsequent claim is determined to be a new injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Before \u00a7 35B was enacted in 1970 (see St. 1970, c. 667, \u00a7 1), an employee who had suffered a compensable injury but returned to work and again became unable to work because of a recurrence of the earlier injury received workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on the wages he earned at the time of the earlier injury, not the wages he earned when he again became unable to work. See <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 460 (1982). Under \u00a7 35B, where an employee had an earlier compensable injury but later returned to work for at least two months, and during his new period of employment is \u201csubsequently injured\u201d due to a recurrence of the former injury, the employee is paid compensation at the rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 460-462.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The administrative judge concluded that \u00a7 35B applied to the employee\u2019s case, finding that his medical condition arising from the 1980 injury worsened to leave him totally disabled as of July 1, 2003, when he was earning $586 per week with an employer in Connecticut. The board did not challenge the judge\u2019s finding that the employee in 2003 suffered a recurrence of the 1980 injury, but concluded that the wages the employee earned in 2003 could not be used to establish his average weekly wage for calculation of his benefits because the wages were earned out of State. As a result, the board concluded that the employee\u2019s weekly benefit must be based on his average weekly wage ($309.65) at the time of the 1980 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The board rested this conclusion on our opinion in <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, </em>429 Mass. 280, 286 (1999), where we held that only employment by Massachusetts employers should count in the calculation of benefit awards under a different section of the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35C. There, the employee was exposed to asbestos while working for a Massachusetts employer in 1955, left that job in 1959, and went to work for another Massachusetts employer until 1986, when he moved to Florida and became self-employed. <em>Id. </em>at 281. The employee, while still living in Florida, was forced to retire in 1991 because of mesothelioma he had contracted from his exposure in the 1950s to asbestos, and he died one year later. <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 35C, where five or more years elapse between the date of injury and the disabling effect of that injury that renders the employee eligible for benefits arising from his incapacity for work, \u201cthe applicable benefits shall be those in effect on the first date of eligibility for benefits,\u201d not the date of injury. We held that the employee was entitled to compensation from the insurer of his 1955 employer measured by his average weekly wage in 1986, when he last worked for another Massachusetts employer, and not by his average weekly wage in 1991 when he was disabled while self-employed in Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 283-286.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We determined in <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 283-284, that we could not discern from the plain meaning of the language of \u00a7 35C whether out-of-State self-employment wages should count in the calculation of compensation. After deciding that the text of the statute did not compel a conclusion, we discerned \u201ca legislative conception that such excess \u00a7 35C awards are a responsibility of all covered Massachusetts employers in common, and that therefore only employment by covered employers should count in the calculation of such awards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cCompensation to the employee measured by earnings outside the Massachusetts workers\u2019 compensation system constitutes a liability for which neither the employer nor any other Massachusetts employer has provided. It may be said that this happens whenever an employee receives a higher award than that measured by the last wage the employee earned from the employer for whom he worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>at the time he sustained the injury. That would not be a valid objection. The later Massachusetts employer paying that higher wage would presumably have paid premiums based on that higher wage. Although that later employer would not be liable for the higher award, its participation in the general system may be supposed, at least roughly, to work out in the long run when it must pay higher compensation for subsequent earnings of its employees earned elsewhere in the system. Self-employment, out-of-State employment, and other excluded employment are not within the system and thus this long-run equilibration cannot take place.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 285. We need not in this case revisit our holding in <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, supra, </em>with respect to \u00a7 35C benefits, because \u00a7 35C does not apply to this employee\u2019s injuries. We need only determine whether to apply the reasoning of that case to exclude out-of-State wages to calculate benefits under \u00a7 35B. We will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u201c[I]t is established that the [workers\u2019] compensation act is to be construed broadly, rather than narrowly, in the light of its purpose and, so far as reasonably may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 746 (1945). \u201c[T]he \u2018beneficent design\u2019 that the workers\u2019 compensation scheme seeks to accomplish is \u2018wage replacement\u2019 for injured employees, . . . which is to be calculated on the basis of the injured employee\u2019s earning capacity.\u201d <em>Sellers\u2019s Case, </em>452 Mass. 804, 810 (2008), quoting <em>McDonough\u2019s Case, </em>448 Mass. 79, 83 (2006). The enactment of \u00a7 35B reflects a legislative determination that, where a previously injured employee has returned to work for at least two months and suffers a subsequent injury that again incapacitates him from work, his earning capacity is best measured by the wages he was earning at the time of his subsequent injury at his new employment rather than at the time of his initial injury at his prior employment. See <em>Don Francisco\u2019s Case, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 460 (1982) (prior to enactment of \u00a7 35B, \u201cthe compensation bore no relationship to the wages being earned on the date the employee again became unable to work,\u201d which was \u201cinconsistent with the purpose of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act\u201d). As a measure of earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>capacity, it matters not whether the wages are earned in Massachusetts or outside Massachusetts. \u201cThe words of \u00a7 35B are plain and unambiguous. \u2018An employee . . . shall ... be paid such compensation at the rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury.\u2019 These words are mandatory, not precatory.\u201d <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>Case, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499 (1998), quoting G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Our holding in <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 283-286, was premised on the expectation that an employee\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of eligibility for incapacity benefits, which for \u00a7 35C to apply must be at least five years after the date of injury, was \u201clikely to be considerably higher\u201d than his average weekly wage at the time of injury because of \u201cthe accrual of seniority, and the effect of inflation.\u201d Our concern was that providing compensation based on out-of-State wages may constitute a \u201cliability for which neither the employer nor any other Massachusetts employer has provided.\u201d <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 285. The risk of this unfunded insurance liability is likely to be less under \u00a7 35B than \u00a7 35C. An employee may be eligible for benefits under \u00a7 35C if the employee had never before been incapacitated from work, but an employee may be eligible for benefits under \u00a7 35B only if the employee previously had a work-related injury that led to an incapacity mandating compensation. Employees incapacitated by a prior work-related injury, once they regain their capacity to perform work, often must accept lower-paid employment because of limitations arising from their prior injury. See, e.g., Boden, Economic Consequences of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses: Lost Earnings and Benefit Adequacy, 36 Am. J. Indus. Med. 487, 501 (1999) (quantifying \u201clost earnings\u201d of various types of injured workers in Wisconsin and showing that even workers in \u201ctemporary disability groups suffer [wage] losses that continue well after\u201d returning to work \u201ceven if they fully recover from the effects of the injury\u201d); Executive Summary, Findings and Recommendations on California\u2019s Permanent Partial Disability System, Institute of Civil Justice of the RAND Corporation at 8 (1997) (\u201cEven after five years, [permanent partial disability] claimants who have returned to work earn 20 percent less than comparable uninjured workers\u201d). Cf. <em>Louis\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>136, 138-142 (1997) (partial disability payments received by employee following work-related injury should be included in calculation of employee\u2019s average weekly wage where employee suffers subsequent injury in course of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The risk of a substantial unfunded liability is also limited by the difference between the \u201c[mjaximum weekly compensation rate,\u201d which places a cap on workers\u2019 compensation base payments of \u201cone hundred per cent of the average weekly wage in the commonwealth,\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (10), and the \u201c[mjinimum weekly compensation rate,\u201d which places a floor on base payments of \u201ctwenty per cent of the average weekly wage in the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (11). For an injury that recurs in March, 2012, for example, this sets a cap of $1,135.82 per week, or $59,062.64 per year, and a floor of $227.16 per week, or $11,812.32 per year, for workers\u2019 compensation base payments. See Department of Industrial Accidents Circular Letter No. 339 at Table III (rev. Oct. 4, 2011), reprinted in Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, <em>supra </em>at Appendix M, at 627. The worst case of an increase in liability, that is, the increased liability in the scenario where the employee before initial injury earns the minimum wage in Massachusetts, and then after initial injury moves out of State and earns many times that original amount when subsequently injured, is the difference between the upper and lower bounds, or $47,250.32 per year. Given this relatively modest maximum liability, which the original insurer already bears where the employee is subsequently injured in Massachusetts from a recurrence of an earlier workplace injury, we do not believe that today\u2019s decision will place a significant burden on insurers or act to increase unfairly workers\u2019 compensation premiums.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">We therefore reverse the board\u2019s determination that the employee is not eligible for \u00a7 35B benefits because his subsequent injury occurred while he was employed outside Massachusetts. The employee is entitled to the calculation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>benefits under \u00a7 35B based on the average weekly wage he received from his Connecticut employer at the time of his subsequent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">3. <em>Recoupment. </em>The insurer pursued recoupment of $34,169.73 for the overpayment of benefits during the period of 1985 to 1988.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The administrative judge denied the recoupment claim, but the board vacated the denial because it was without explanation or subsidiary findings, and permitted the insurer to renew its claim for recoupment in a separate complaint. We conclude that the board was not arbitrary or capricious in vacating the denial of recoupment based on the absence of any explanation or findings by the administrative judge in support of the denial. But we note, as did the Appeals Court, that, if the insurer were to press its claim for recoupment, a judge would need carefully to consider whether recoupment was in accord with equitable principles. See <em>Wadsworth\u2019s Case, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 109-110 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Where an insurer has made overpayments of workers\u2019 compensation benefits other than pursuant to a conference order,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> recoupment, as the board noted, is subject to equitable principles. In deciding whether recoupment would be equitable, a judge must consider \u201ccompeting interests, such as the employee\u2019s culpability, the employer\u2019s negligence, the employee\u2019s ability to repay and the hardship if any, that the employee may suffer, and the amount of the overpayment.\u201d Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 16.24 n.23. <em>Giancola </em>v. <em>Price Chopper, </em>25 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 109, 110 n.4 (2011). Here, where the insurer allowed so many years to elapse between the time of overpayment and the claim for recoupment, a judge must also consider the equitable defense of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201cLaches is an equitable defense consisting of unreasonable delay in instituting an action which results in some injury or prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Yetman </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 707 (1979). \u201cLaches is not mere delay, . . . but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>delay that works disadvantage to another.\u201d <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>445 Mass. 502, 517 (2005), quoting <em>Calkins </em>v. <em>Wire Hardware Co., </em>267 Mass. 52, 69 (1929). \u201cThe operation of laches generally is a question of fact for the judge, and a judge\u2019s finding as to laches will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, supra. </em>Where an insurer\u2019s delay is unreasonable, and where an employee in repaying these funds would suffer substantial prejudice that could have been avoided had the insurer promptly asserted its rights, an insurer equitably is not entitled to recoupment. See <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Garfield, </em>327 Mass. 529, 534 (1951) (plaintiffs barred by laches from asserting claim twenty-seven years after accrual where delay was \u201cinordinate\u201d and \u201cclearly prejudicial to the defendants\u201d); <em>Randon </em>v. <em>Edstrom, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 798-799 (1974) (plaintiff barred by laches from challenging conveyance twenty-two years later where no excuse for delay and substantial prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the board\u2019s conclusion that the employee has established a total and permanent incapacity and is entitled to \u00a7 34A benefits from the insurer, and that the employee is not entitled to the calculation of benefits under \u00a7 51. We reverse the board\u2019s conclusion that the employee is not entitled to the calculation of \u00a7 34A benefits under \u00a7 35B, and we remand to the board for the recalculation of benefits in accordance with this decision. We affirm the board\u2019s vacating of the denial of recoupment and its allowance of the insurer to renew its claim for recoupment in a separate complaint, subject to equitable principles. Because the employee has prevailed on his claim for the recalculation of \u00a7 34A benefits under \u00a7 35B, we order the insurer to pay the employee\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses resulting from the appeal from the board decision pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A, and <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Scott Wadsworth (employee) also applied for medical benefits under G.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, and reserved his claim for the doubling of benefits for the \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d of his employer under G.

These benefit awards, and the reservation of the doubling of benefits claim, are not challenged on appeal. He also ordered the insurer to pay the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $13,000, as well as deposition, stenographic, and \u201cnecessary\u201d expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) also concluded that the judge erred in relying on training and classroom work the employee undertook after the 1980 injury in granting the rate enhancement under \u00a7 51, where the analysis should be limited to the employee\u2019s vocational profile at the time of the injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The board implicitly suggested that, if the employee had been employed in Massachusetts in 2003 when his disability recurred, his 2003 wages could have been used to calculate his compensation rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The board also found that the insurer was entitled to recoup the difference between the weekly compensation it had paid the employee as ordered by the administrative judge and the weekly compensation ordered by the board, and could reduce the employee\u2019s adjusted \u00a7 34A benefit by not more than thirty per cent per week until the entire overpayment had been recouped. The board also ordered the insurer to pay the employee\u2019s counsel a fee of $1,495.34, based on the employee\u2019s having prevailed on the issue of his entitlement to permanent and total incapacity benefits under \u00a7 34A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the Workers\u2019 Injury Law &amp; Advocacy Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">GeneraI Laws c. 152, \u00a7 36, which provides payment for certain specific injuries, and for which the employee here was awarded benefits, is an exception to this general rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The revision of G.

G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51. Statute 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 78, expressly overruled this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gagnon\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 334, 338 (1917), that \u201cthe circumstances to which weight can be given must be confined to the particular employer and kind of industry in which the injury was received.\u201d See L.Y.

As a result, where an employee is in school, is likely to graduate, and is injured in part-time employment, an administrative judge may consider when setting average weekly wage projections under \u00a7 51 any noninflationary wage increase anticipated on graduation, even if from a different job or industry. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51. To inform this calculation, an administrative judge is permitted to consider evidence of wages that the employee would likely have earned \u201cin the open labor market\u201d with the \u201cage and experience\u201d that the employee would have possessed at the time of graduation, had the employee not been injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">If an employee is unable to work because of a new injury rather than a recurrence of a prior injury, the employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits are also determined based on the rate in effect at the time of the new injury, but the insurer responsible for paying the benefits is the insurer at the time of the new injury. See <em>Sliski\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 126, 131 (1997), quoting <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 436-437 (1938).
