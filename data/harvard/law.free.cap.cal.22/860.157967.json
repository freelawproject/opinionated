In so doing, it operates to impose the burden of proof on the party, if any, who claims that the defendant is mentally incompetent, and fixes the weight thereof at preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">The question that we shall address is whether Penal Code section 1372 does the same for a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence. The answer that we shall give is affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">On September 29, 1995, as the evidence admitted at his subsequent trial in this action would establish, Juancho Lopez Rells, who had a history of major mental illness, parked his automobile in a lot at the Lakewood Center Mall in the City of Lakewood in Los Angeles County. He entered the J.C. Penney Company department store, having in his possession blank checks for a personal checking account at Wells Fargo Bank that had been closed more than eight months earlier. Over the next hour, while on the premises, he would conduct himself appropriately and in a manner that was generally calm and relaxed but at times somewhat fidgety. Proceeding to the jewelry department, he selected a watch priced at over $600 from among a number shown to him by Sandra Estrada, a saleswoman. To make the purchase, he handed her a completed check. Calling the security office, Estrada sought approval. Attempting verification, David Thome, a security agent, received information that Rells\u2019s account was not current, and passed it along to Estrada. Estrada said that there was a problem with the check; Rells responded with disbelief, blaming his\u2014nonexistent\u2014wife for the situation. Thome came to the jewelry department. Attempting verification for a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>time, he again received the same information. Returning to his office, and attempting verification for a third time, he apparently yet again received the same information. He then notified, among others, die Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Going back to the -jewelry department, he asked whether Rells would accompany him to a package pickup area where, he said, he would try to provide assistance, and Rells replied affirmatively. About halfway to their destination, Thome turned, and saw Rells walking away from him at a moderate pace, neither fast nor slow, toward an exit. Rells left the store. Thome followed. By now, sheriff\u2019s deputies had arrived at the scene in a marked patrol vehicle. Rells entered his automobile and started its engine. Thome pointed him out. The deputies approached with lights on and siren blaring. Refusing to stop, Rells fled onto and over city streets at high speed, swerving across lanes, bouncing off curbs, and running red lights. The deputies pursued. Entering an intersection at over 70 miles per hour, Rells smashed into a vehicle carrying Linda Nhieu, Kevin Nhieu, her husband, and Brian Nhieu, their two-year-old son, and in so doing killed all three. He was then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On behalf of the People of the State of California, the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles presented an information to the superior court thereof, charging Rells with the murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)) of Linda, Kevin, and Brian Nhieu, and the burglary <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 459) of the J.C. Penney Company. Rells entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The superior court issued an order for a trial of Rells\u2019s mental competence pursuant to Penal Code section 1369, and thereby effectively suspended all proceedings in the criminal prosecution until the question should be determined. It had appointed four psychiatrists to subject him to examination. Trial was to the court after the People and Rells each waived a jury. Rells introduced evidence, and argued, in favor of mental incompetence, through the opinion of apparently three of the four psychiatrists, and the People introduced evidence, and argued, to the contrary, through the opinion of apparently only one. Effectively referring to the presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise, the court found Rells mentally incompetent. It suspended all the proceedings in the criminal prosecution until he should become mentally competent. It committed him to Patton State Hospital for evaluation and treatment. Subsequently, pursuant to Penal Code section 1372, the hospital\u2019s acting medical director, having determined that Rells had regained mental competence, filed a certificate of restoration thereto. At a hearing pursuant to the same provision, Rells and the People submitted the question on the certificate of restoration to mental competence itself and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>on an accompanying report. Without referring to any presumption bearing on a defendant\u2019s mental competence, the court found Rells to have recovered mental competence. It thereupon reinstated the proceedings in the criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Trial as to guilt or innocence and sanity or insanity was to the superior court after the People and Rells each waived a jury. As to guilt or innocence, the People presented evidence and Rells did not. The court found him guilty of the murder of Linda, Kevin, and Brian Nhieu, in the first degree, based on a theory of felony-murder burglary, and also found him guilty of the burglary of the J.C. Penney Company in the second degree. As to sanity or insanity, both Rells and the People presented evidence, Rells calling three psychiatrists who opined that he was, or may have been, insane, and the People calling one psychiatrist who opined that he was not. The court found him sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The superior court rendered judgment against Rells accordingly. It sentenced him to three terms of imprisonment for 25 years to life, one each for the first degree murder of Linda, Kevin, and Brian Nhieu, each of which it effectively ordered to run concurrent to each of the others; it also sentenced him to a single, lower, term of imprisonment for 16 months for the second degree burglary of the J.C. Penney Company, which it ordered stayed temporarily pending completion of the other terms and permanently thereafter; it thereby sentenced him to a total term of imprisonment for 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">After Rells filed a notice of appeal in the superior court, an appeal was docketed in the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District, and was later assigned to Division Three thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Several years prior to the occurrence of the events that gave rise to this action, Division Seven of the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District had handed down its decision in <em>People v. Mixon </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1471 [275 Cal.Rptr. 817] (hereafter sometimes <em>Mixon). </em>With one member dissenting on the point, a majority held to this effect: For a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence, Penal Code section 1372 establishes a presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise. (See <em>People v. Mixon, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1475, 1478-1485; but see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1490-1497 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).) In so doing, it operates to impose the burden of proof on the party, if any, who claims that the defendant is mentally incompetent, and fixes the weight thereof at preponderance of the evidence. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 1475, 1478-1485; but see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1490-1497 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>On appeal, Rells claimed, inter alia, that the superior court erred in its conduct of the hearing on his recovery of mental competence under Penal Code section 1372. He argued that the court had presumably conducted the hearing in conformity with the holding of the <em>Mixon </em>majority, including imposing on him the burden of proof of his own mental incompetence, and that the holding was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">By a judgment announced in a unanimous decision not certified for publication, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the superior court after modifying it in part not pertinent here. Concluding, evidently on independent review, that the holding of the <em>Mixon </em>majority was sound, the Court of Appeal rejected Rells\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Rells filed a petition for review. We granted his application. By specification, we limited the question on review, in substance, to the proper conduct of a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence under Penal Code section 1372, including, impliedly, any presumption bearing on mental competence and, expressly, any burden of proof related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">The law that governs inquiry into the mental competence of a defendant in a criminal prosecution consists of a statutory scheme that is codified in chapter 6 of title 10 of part 2 of the Penal Code, commencing with section 1367 thereof. Among the provisions applicable to this cause are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Penal Code section 1367 declares, in pertinent part, that a defendant \u201ccannot be tried or adjudged to punishment while\u201d he \u201cis mentally incompetent,\u201d that is to say, while, \u201cas a result of mental disorder or development disability,\u201d he is \u201cunable to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1367, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Penal Code section 1368 provides, inter alia, that, \u201c[i]f, during the pendency of an action and prior to judgment, a doubt arises in the mind of the judge as to the mental competence of the defendant, he . . . shall state that doubt in the record and inquire of the attorney for the defendant whether, in the opinion of the attorney, the defendant is mentally competent. . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1368, subd. (a).) \u201cIf counsel informs the court that he . . . believes the defendant is or may be mentally incompetent, the court shall order that the question of the defendant\u2019s mental competence is to be determined\u201d at a trial, as subsequently specified. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1368, subd. (b).) But, even \u201c[i]f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>counsel informs the court that he . . . believes the defendant is mentally competent, the court may nevertheless order\u201d such a trial. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Generally, \u201cwhen an order\u201d of this sort \u201chas been issued, all proceedings in the criminal prosecution shall be suspended until the question of the . . . mental competence of the defendant has been determined.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1368, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Penal Code section 1369 sets forth the procedures for the trial in which the question of the mental competence of the defendant is to be determined. It provides that such a trial may be \u201cby court or jury\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1369), and that, if by jury, it must be decided by unanimous verdict <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1369, subd. (f)). It also provides for the appointment by the court of one or more experts to examine the defendant <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1369, subd. (a)), the introduction of evidence by the defendant and the People <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1369, subds. (b), (c) &amp; (d)), and the presentation of argument by each thereafter <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1369, subd. (e)). It states that \u201c[i]t shall be presumed that the defendant is mentally competent unless it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally incompetent.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1369, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Penal Code section 1370 provides that, \u201c[i]f the defendant is found mentally competent,\u201d the criminal prosecution \u201cshall resume.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(1)(A).) But, \u201c[i]f the defendant is found mentally incompetent,\u201d the criminal prosecution \u201cshall\u201d remain \u201csuspended until\u201d he \u201cbecomes mentally competent.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(1)(B).) \u201cIn the meantime, the court shall order ... the mentally incompetent defendant\u201d to be committed as specified, including to a state hospital, for evaluation and treatment. (I<em>d., </em>\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(1)(B)(i).) At specified intervals after such commitment, a specified mental health official, including the medical director of a state hospital, \u201cshall make a written report to the court,\u201d among others, \u201cconcerning the defendant\u2019s progress toward recovery of mental competence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(1).) If the defendant has been committed for 18 months and remains so, he \u201cshall be returned to . . . court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(2).) Once there, the court must hold a retrial of the defendant\u2019s mental competence \u201cpursuant to the procedures set forth in\u201d Penal Code section 1369 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(2)), which include the presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Penal Code section 1372 provides that, \u201c[i]f \u2019 the specified mental health official \u201cdetermines that the defendant has regained mental competence,\u201d he \u201cshall . . . fil[e] a certificate of restoration\u201d thereto. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1372, subd. (a)(1).) It also provides that the defendant must then be \u201creturned to . . . court\u201d \u201cfor further proceedings.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1372, subd. (a)(2).) It further provides that the \u201ccourt shall notify\u201d one of certain specified mental health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>officials, \u201cas appropriate, of the date of any hearing on the defendant\u2019s [mental] competence and whether or not the defendant was found by the court to have recovered [mental] competence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1372, subd. (c).) It does not, however, set forth procedures for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence identical to those for a trial of his mental competence in the first place. Indeed, it does not set forth any such procedures whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Thus, for a trial of a defendant\u2019s mental competence, Penal Code section 1369 establishes, expressly, a presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise. In so doing, it operates to impose the burden of proof on the party, if any, who claims that the defendant is mentally incompetent\u2014 usually, the defendant himself (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1369, subd. (b)(1)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but sometimes the People (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1369, subds. (a) &amp; (b)(2))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014and fixes the weight of the burden of proof at preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">But, for a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence, Penal Code section 1372, unlike Penal Code section 1369, does not establish, expressly, a presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise. We believe, however, that it does so impliedly. The presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise is applicable at a trial of the defendant\u2019s mental competence, <em>in spite of the fact that it may run counter to any doubt expressed by the court and supported by the opinion of his own counsel. </em>This presumption is applicable as well at a retrial of the defendant\u2019s mental competence, which is mandatory when the defendant has been committed for 18 months and remains so without a certificate of restoration to mental competence filed by a specified mental health official, <em>in spite of the fact that it is inconsistent with his apparent </em>non <em>recovery of mental competence. </em>Therefore, in our view, this presumption should be understood to be applicable at a hearing on the defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence, <em>where it conforms in fact with the certificate of restoration filed by the specified mental health official. </em>As stated, whereas Penal Code section 1369 sets forth procedures for a trial of a defendant\u2019s mental competence, Penal Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>1372 does not do so for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence. With respect at least to the presumption in question, Penal Code section 1372 allows its gap to be filled by Penal Code section 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">In accord with our conclusion is that of the <em>Mixon </em>majority. Their reasoning is largely consistent with ours, and calls for no further comment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Contrary to our conclusion is that of the <em>Mixon </em>dissenter. His reasoning, however, fails to persuade. He maintains that, when a defendant has been found to be mentally incompetent after a trial of his mental competence, he should be presumed to continue to be so at a subsequent hearing on his recovery thereof. Perhaps, if circumstances had not changed. But they have, as a matter of necessity. To trigger a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence, a specified mental health official must have filed a certificate of restoration thereto. Contrary to the implication of the <em>Mixon </em>dissenter, in this regard the official is not an expert witness and the certificate is not testimonial opinion. The official\u2019s filing of the certificate has legal force and effect in and of itself. It causes the defendant to be returned to court for further proceedings. It does so separately and independently of any role that either official or certificate may subsequently play. At such a hearing, as we have concluded, there is a presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise\u2014a presumption that, in terms, affects the burden of proof (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 605), which it imposes on the party, if any, who claims that the defendant is mentally incompetent (see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 606). The <em>Mixon </em>dissenter also maintains that general principles of law, as reflected in, among other things, Evidence Code section 500,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> advise in favor of imposing the burden of proof at a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence on the People, and that the law of other jurisdictions is in accord. But the specific statutory scheme with which we are here concerned, which comprises the law of <em>this </em>jurisdiction, simply does not impose any burden of proof on any party as such. Rather, as we have concluded, it establishes a presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise, and thereby operates to impose the burden of proof on the party, if any, who claims that he is mentally incompetent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Arguing against our conclusion, Rells relies, in part, on the reasoning of the <em>Mixon </em>dissenter. We have found that reasoning, however, to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Rells relies, in other part, on certain \u201crules of construction.\u201d <em>(People v. Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1139 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306].)  One such \u201crule\u201d is that a statutory scheme like the one before us \u201cshould be construed to avoid serious constitutional questions,\u201d here, he asserts, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>(People v. Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1139.)  Another such \u201crule\u201d is that a \u201c\u2018defendant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d as to the meaning of such a scheme. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1139, 1145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The \u201crule\u201d entitling a defendant to the benefit of a reasonable doubt about the meaning of a statutory scheme does not aid Rells. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1139.) For a doubt to be \u201creasonable\u201d for present purposes it must be \u201crealistic.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1145.)  We have no such doubt about the applicability, at a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence, of the presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Neither does the \u201crule\u201d about avoiding serious constitutional questions aid Rells. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1139.)  By its own terms, it operates only when any such \u201cconstitutional questions\u201d are \u201cserious\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>in the sense of \u201cgrave and doubtful\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1146, italics omitted),  Here, notwithstanding Rells\u2019s assertion, no \u201cconstitutional questions\u201d of this sort are raised under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>(People v. Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1139.) The reason is this: The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause in fact permits the presumption that the defendant is mentally competent unless he is proved by a preponderance of the evidence to be otherwise. <em>(Cooper v. Oklahoma </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 348, 355 [116 S.Ct. 1373, 1377, 134 L.Ed.2d 498]; <em>Medina </em>v. <em>California </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 437, 442-453 [112 S.Ct. 2572, 2575-2582, 120 L.Ed.2d 353].) That is certainly true of a trial of a defendant\u2019s mental competence, at which the presumption unobjectionably \u201caffect[s] [mental] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>competency determinations only in a narrow class of cases where the evidence is in equipoise . . . <em>(Medina </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 449 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2579]; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 452-453 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 2580-2582]; see also <em>Cooper v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 363 [116 S.Ct. at p. 1381].) That is also true, to our mind, of a hearing on a defendant\u2019s recovery of mental competence, at which the presumption has the same effect. The fact that a hearing presupposes an earlier finding by the court or a jury of mental incompetence is balanced by the fact that the hearing itself is triggered by the later filing by a specified mental health official of a certificate of restoration to mental competence. (Cf. <em>Cooper v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 365 [116 S.Ct. at p. 1382] [presuming that \u201cit is unusual for even the most artful malingerer to feign [mental] incompetence successfully for a period of time while under professional care\u201d].) Although we recognize that a presumption that fixes the weight of the burden of proof, at a trial, at clear and convincing evidence is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause <em>(Cooper v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>517 U.S. at pp. 354-369 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 1376-1384]), we do not believe that a presumption that fixes the burden\u2019s weight, at a hearing, at preponderance of the evidence is similar. A different presumption may prove \u201cmore favorable\u201d to a defendant. <em>(Medina v. California, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 451 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2580].) But it is not required by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause for that reason. <em>(Medina </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 451 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2580].)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">We turn to the decision of the Court of Appeal, which affirmed the judgment of the superior court, as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">After consideration, we are of the opinion that the Court of Appeal was right to reject Rells\u2019s claim that the superior court erred in presumably conducting the hearing on his recovery of mental competence under Penal Code section 1372 in conformity with the holding of the <em>Mixon </em>majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">At the threshold, the Court of Appeal was right to subject the holding of the <em>Mixon </em>majority, as it evidently did, to independent review.  The holding amounted to the resolution of a pure question of law. The resolution of such a question is examined de novo. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 182 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">On the merits, the Court of Appeal was right to conclude that the holding of the <em>Mixon </em>majority was sound. The holding, as we have explained, is in accord with our own conclusion in the premises. Rells complains, specifically, of the superior court\u2019s presumed imposition on him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the burden of proof of his own mental incompetence. By submitting the question of his recovery of mental competence on the certificate of restoration to mental competence filed by the acting medical director of Patton State Hospital and the accompanying report, he must be understood <em>either </em>to have claimed that he was mentally incompetent, in which case the burden of proof properly rested on his shoulders, <em>or </em>to have claimed that he was mentally competent, in which case the burden of proof did not come into play at all.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In neither case does error appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that we must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">George, C. J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">On May 24, 2000, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-7\"><em> People </em>v. <em>Bye </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 569, 573 [172 Cal.Rptr. 186].

(See <em>ante, </em>at p. 868, fn. 3.) That provision, it is true, does not prohibit the shifting of the burden based on \u201cfactors\u201d including the \u201cknowledge of the parties concerning the particular fact\u201d implicated therein, the \u201cavailability of the evidence to the parties,\u201d the \u201cmost desirable result in terms of public policy in the absence of proof of the particular fact,\u201d and the \u201cprobability of the existence or nonexistence of the fact\u201d (Recommendation Proposing an Evidence Code (Jan. 1965) 7 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1965) p. 89). To our mind, and contrary to the view expressed by the <em>Mixon </em>dissenter, such factors do not compel the shifting of the burden here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The People have not contended that, by submitting the question of his recovery of mental competence as he did, Rells failed to preserve his claim of error.
