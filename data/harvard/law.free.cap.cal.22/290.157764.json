We conclude there is no conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Defendant broke into his former girlfriend\u2019s residence, stabbed her new boyfriend, and battered her. He was charged with felony assault (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)), burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (a)), misdemeanor battery (\u00a7\u00a7 242, 243, subd. (e)), and misdemeanor vandalism (\u00a7 594, subd. (b)(4)). The information alleged he personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon (\u00a7\u00a7 667, 1192.7, subd. (c)) in the commission of the felony assault, and entered the residence with intent to commit felony assault. After the information was filed, defendant wrote threatening letters to his former girlfriend and her new boyfriend. A felony complaint was then filed accusing him of attempting to dissuade a witness (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Defendant entered no contest pleas to the five substantive counts and admitted the personal use allegation in exchange for an agreed term of four years in state prison. Defendant\u2019s appointed trial counsel appeared at the change of plea hearing and concurred in defendant\u2019s decision to accept the plea bargain, but did not appear at the sentencing hearing. Instead, another deputy public defender made a special appearance on his behalf at the sentencing hearing and made no objection to the sentence imposed\u2014a four-year prison term for the burglary count, concurrent three-year terms for the felony assault and dissuading counts, and concurrent jail terms for the misdemeanor counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>On appeal, defendant claimed the trial court\u2019s failure to stay the three-year term imposed for the assault count violated section 654 because the burglary and the assault were committed pursuant to a single intent and objective. In a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed in conjunction with the appeal, defendant contended trial counsel were ineffective insofar as they failed to preserve the section 654 issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Holding rule 412(b) invalid to the extent that it permits trial courts to violate section 654 in the absence of an implicit or explicit waiver by the defendant, the Court of Appeal modified the judgment to reflect the concurrent term imposed for the felony assault count was stayed pursuant to section 654. As modified the judgment was affirmed. The petition for writ of habeas corpus was dismissed as moot. We granted review to consider the validity of rule 412(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Section 654 precludes multiple punishments for a single act or indivisible course of conduct. <em>(People v. Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 885 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552].) In this case, as the Court of Appeal noted, \u201cthe record indisputably establishes that the two offenses were committed with a single intent and objective. The admitted charging allegations stated that the burglarious entry was perpetrated with the intent to commit the felony assault.\u201d  Under section 654, therefore, the concurrent three-year sentence for the assault count should have been stayed. <em>(People v. Radii </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 702, 713 [142 Cal.Rptr. 233].) The People assert, however, rule 412(b) precludes defendant from challenging his sentence on this ground because, \u201c[b]y agreeing to a specified prison term personally and by counsel, a defendant who is sentenced to that term or a shorter one abandons any claim that a component of the sentence violates section 654\u2019s prohibition of double punishment, unless that claim is asserted at the time the agreement is recited on the record.\u201d (Rule 412(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">To improve the administration of justice, the Judicial Council is authorized to \u201cadopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure,\u201d provided the rules are \u201cnot. . . inconsistent with statute.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 950, 960 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 883 P.2d 974]; <em>In re Robin M. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 337, 346 [146 Cal.Rptr. 352, 579 P.2d 1].) Defendant contends rule 412(b) is invalid because it is inconsistent with section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Section 654, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.\u201d Ordinarily, a section 654 claim is not waived by failing to object below. \u201c[T]he waiver doctrine does not apply to questions involving the applicability of section 654. Errors in the applicability of section 654 are corrected on appeal regardless of whether the point was raised by objection in the trial court or assigned as error on appeal.\u201d <em>(People v. Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 549-550, fn. 3 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].) This is an exception'to the general rule that only those claims properly raised and preserved by the parties are reviewable on appeal. This exception is not required by the language of section 654, but rather by case law holding that a court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and imposes an unauthorized sentence when it fails to stay execution of a sentence under section 654. (See <em>People v. Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354, fn. 17 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040].)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The rule that defendants may challenge an unauthorized sentence on appeal even if they failed to object below is itself subject to an exception: Where the defendants have pleaded guilty in return for a <em>specified </em>sentence, appellate courts will not find error even though the trial court acted in excess of jurisdiction in reaching that figure, so long as the trial court did not lack <em>fundamental </em>jurisdiction. The rationale behind this policy is that defendants who have received the benefit of their bargain should not be allowed to trifle with the courts by attempting to better the bargain through the appellate process. <em>(People v. Couch </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1053, 1056-1057 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 220]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 114, 122-123 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 490]; see <em>In re Griffin </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 343, 347-348 [62 Cal.Rptr. 1, 431 P.2d 625].)  While failure to object is not an implicit waiver of section 654 rights, acceptance of the plea bargain here was. \u201cWhen a defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s sentence violates rules which would have required the imposition of a more lenient sentence, yet the defendant avoided a potentially harsher sentence by entering into the plea bargain, it may be implied that the defendant waived any rights under such rules by choosing to accept the plea bargain.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Couch, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1057.) Rule 412(b) and section 654 are, therefore, not in conflict. In adopting the rule, the Judicial Council merely codified one of the applications of the case law rule that defendants are estopped from complaining of sentences to which they agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Defendant next contends rule 412(b) does not apply here because he did not agree to a concurrent term for felony assault: \u201c[Defendant was never told that a concurrent term for his assault with a deadly weapon conviction was a term of the plea bargain. Thus, defendant did not waive the application of section 654 as to that count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>This contention lacks merit as well. Rule 412(b) sets out the conditions under which a defendant who is sentenced to an agreed-upon prison term is deemed to have abandoned a section 654 claim. Those conditions are satisfied here. Again, rule 412(b) provides: \u201cBy agreeing to a specified prison term personally and by counsel, a defendant who is sentenced to that term or a shorter one abandons any claim that a component of the sentence violates section 654\u2019s prohibition of double punishment, unless that claim is asserted at the time the agreement is recited on the record.\u201d Defendant did \u201cagree[] to a specified prison term personally and through counsel.\u201d At the change of plea hearing, the deputy district attorney informed the court that defendant would plead no contest to the five substantive counts and admit the personal use allegation. He added, \u201cthe Court has indicated a four-year prison [sentence],, top/bottom.\u201d The court asked defendant whether any promises had been made to him, and defendant replied that the only promise was \u201cthat I would receive no more than four years.\u201d Defendant then entered the indicated pleas, and defense counsel concurred in them. Defendant was \u201csentenced to that term or a shorter one.\u201d He was sentenced to a four-year prison term for the burglary count. He did not raise a section 654 objection to any possible concurrent terms \u201cat the time the agreement [was] recited on the record,\u201d namely, at the change of plea hearing. Therefore, he abandoned \u201cany claim that a component of the sentence violates section 654\u2019s prohibition of double punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Had defendant been truly surprised at the time of sentencing to find that concurrent terms were being imposed, his remedy would have been to attempt to withdraw his plea on the grounds of violation of the plea bargain. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1013 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 902, 819 P.2d 861].) He did not do so, however. In a declaration attached to the petition for writ of habeas corpus, the attorney who represented defendant at the change of plea hearing stated he had intended to make a section 654 objection at the sentencing hearing. As it turned out, though, defendant was represented by a different deputy public defender at the sentencing hearing, and that attorney did not make a section 654 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Anticipating that he might be deemed to have abandoned his section 654 claim because of counsel\u2019s failure to raise it at the change of plea hearing, defendant contends he thereby received ineffective assistance of counsel. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show: (1) counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>(People v. Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1211 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354].) As the People point out, defendant\u2019s assault conviction could be used under the three strikes law even if it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>been stayed under section 654. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 24, 26 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 294, 954 P.2d 557].) Defendant concedes the People\u2019s \u201cpredicate point regarding the strikes law is correct.\u201d However, he contends \u201ctheir conclusion is wrong.\u201d \u201c[I]t is the <em>general </em>rule that a count stayed under section 654 may not later be used against the defendant for any punitive purpose,\u201d he asserts. Defendant makes no attempt, though, to explain what prejudice, specifically, he fears from the failure to stay the assault conviction. (Indeed, at oral argument defendant\u2019s counsel conceded there is no prejudice under current law.) Accordingly, he fails to shoulder the burden a habeas corpus petitioner alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must carry\u2014showing a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s error the result would have been different. (See <em>In re Fields </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1063, 1078 [275 Cal.Rptr. 384, 800 P.2d 862].) No prejudice having been shown, we need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. (See <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 697 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d 674]; <em>In re Jackson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 578, 604 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 835 P.2d 371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed insofar as it modified the trial court\u2019s judgment to reflect that the concurrent term imposed for the felony assault count was stayed pursuant to section 654. In all other respects, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">George, C. J., Baxter, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\">All further rule references are to the California Rules of Court; all further section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b341-8\">KENNARD, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A6q\">Defendant broke into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home and attacked both her and her new boyfriend. After his arrest, he wrote threatening letters to the victims. He entered a plea of no contest to charges of burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, and three other offenses not pertinent here, with the understanding that he would be sentenced to four years in total. The plea bargain said nothing about the count or counts forming the basis for the four-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">As relevant here, the trial court imposed a four-year prison sentence for the burglary and a concurrent three-year term for assault with a deadly weapon. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court should have stayed the assault sentence under Penal Code section 654 (hereafter section 654), which bars multiple punishment for crimes \u201c \u2018incident to one objective.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Latimer </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1203, 1208 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 144, 858 P.2d 611].) The Court of Appeal agreed, rejecting the Attorney General\u2019s assertion that rule 412(b) of the California Rules of Court (hereafter rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>412(b)) barred defendant from raising the section 654 issue. Today, the majority reverses the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment, which I would uphold.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Rule 412(b) provides: \u201cBy agreeing to a specified prison term personally and by counsel, a defendant who is sentenced to that term or a shorter one abandons any claim that a component of the sentence violates section 654\u2019s prohibition of double punishment, unless that claim is asserted at the time the agreement is recited on the record.\u201d The accompanying comment by the Judicial Council\u2019s Advisory Committee explains that the rule \u201cis based on the fact that a defendant who, with the advice of counsel, expresses agreement to a specified prison term normally is <em>acknowledging that the term is appropriate for his or her total course of conduct.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Advisory Com. com., 23 pt. 2 West's Ann. Codes, Rules (1996 ed.) foll. rule 412(b), p. 8, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Rule 412(b) is inapplicable here. Defendant is not trying to reduce his sentence below the four-year prison term specified in the plea bargain, nor does he challenge the propriety of that sentence. He merely seeks to correct the trial court\u2019s error in not staying the three-year sentence for the assault with a deadly weapon. As defendant points out, that charge arose out of the same course of conduct as the burglary charge and therefore should have been stayed under section 654. The majority concedes (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 294-295) that a sentence in violation of section 654 is an \u201c \u2018unauthorized\u2019 sentence\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354, fn. 17 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040]) that generally may be corrected on appeal without an objection by the defendant in the trial court <em>(People v. Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 549-550, fn. 3 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63]).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Relying on rule 412(b), however, the majority holds that defendant\u2019s plea bargain was an \u201cimplicit waiver\u201d of the section 654 issue. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 295.) I disagree. \u201c[A] waiver is \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a <em>known </em>right or privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Panizzon </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 68, 85 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 913 P.2d 1061]; see also <em>Cowan v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 367, 371 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 458, 926 P.2d 438].) Here, there was nothing in the terms of defendant\u2019s plea bargain that could be read as a waiver, express or implied, of his right to challenge the trial court\u2019s violation of section 654. That violation occurred at sentencing, four weeks <em>after </em>defendant\u2019s plea of no contest to the charges. When defendant entered his plea he had no reason to anticipate the trial court\u2019s failure to stay the three-year sentence for the assault with a deadly weapon, as required under section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>According to the majority: \u201cHad defendant been truly surprised at the time of sentencing to find that concurrent terms were being imposed, his remedy would have been to attempt to withdraw his plea on the grounds of violation of the plea bargain.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 296.) As I noted earlier, defendant and the prosecutor agreed to a total sentence of four years, and that is what the trial court imposed. At no time during the appellate process has defendant contended that the court violated the plea bargain. Nor would such a challenge have been proper. As the comment to rule 412(b) states, by agreeing to a certain sentence under a plea bargain, a defendant acknowledges \u201cthat the term is appropriate for his or her total course of conduct.\u201d (Advisory Com. com., 23 pt. 2 West's Ann. Codes, Rules, <em>supra, </em>foll. rule 412(b), at p. 8.) Here, defendant challenges only the trial court\u2019s improper imposition of a three-year concurrent sentence for the assault with a deadly weapon, a matter on which the plea agreement was silent. Had the agreement specified a stay of the assault sentence, defendant could and, to prevent application of the waiver doctrine, should have moved to withdraw his plea of no contest when instead of staying the assault sentence the trial court ordered it to be served concurrently. Because the plea bargain said nothing about the matter, defendant\u2019s proper remedy was to raise the issue on appeal, as he has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">For the reasons given above, I conclude that rule 412(b) does not apply in this case. Therefore, defendant has properly raised the section 654 issue on appeal. As I have explained, the trial court erred in not staying the three-year sentence for the assault with a deadly weapon, as required under section 654. (Staying that sentence would not affect the total of four years\u2019 imprisonment under the plea bargain.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Mosk, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied April 12, 2000. Mosk, J., Kennard, J., and Werdegar, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
