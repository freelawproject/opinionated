The restitution fine under section 1202.4 is mandatory unless the sentencing court, in the words of the statute, \u201cfinds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and- states those reasons on the record.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b).) In cases in which the court imposes a restitution fine, imposition of a parole revocation fine is also mandatory. (\u00a7 1202.45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">At times, sentencing courts have failed to discharge the duty imposed by these statutes, omitting the fines from judgments of conviction without making the required finding on the record. In several such cases, the People have sought to have the omission supplied while the case was on appeal, asking the Court of Appeal to amend the trial court\u2019s judgment to add the fines. The fate of these requests has not been uniform, with appellate courts variously granting and denying them. In some cases, the Court of Appeal has rejected the People\u2019s request on the ground the statutory obligation is one imposed on the trial court and is not the responsibility of the appellate court. In others, including the one before us here, the appellate court has taken the opposite tack. These courts reason that remanding the case to the trial court to add the fines is uneconomical, and hold the Courts of Appeal possess jurisdiction to amend the judgment by incorporating them. That is what the Court of Appeal did here, amending the judgment to add restitution fines of $200, the minimum permitted by the statutes. (See \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Neither of these differing views is without merit. However, recent precedents of this court lead us to conclude the waiver doctrine bars the People from obtaining the relief they seek on appeal. Our most recent opinion applying the waiver doctrine to a sentencing issue is <em>People v. Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040], There, \u201c[f]aced squarely with the issue for the first time,\u201d we held the doctrine \u201cshould apply to claims involving the trial court\u2019s failure to properly make or articulate its discretionary sentencing choices.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 353.) The opinion in <em>Scott </em>relied in turn on <em>People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 228 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 520, 851 P.2d 802], another sentencing case. In <em>Welch, </em>we enforced \u201c[traditional objection and waiver principles\u201d against a defendant who sought for the first time on appeal to litigate the reasonableness of the conditions of probation imposed by the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 236.) We reasoned that waiver principles \u201cencourage development of the record and a proper exercise of discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the trial court,\u201d as well as helping to \u201cdiscourage . . . invalid probation conditions and reduce the number of costly appeals brought on that basis.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 236, 235; cf. <em>People v. Walker </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1013 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 902, 819 P.2d 861].)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Both <em>Scott </em>and <em>Welch </em>involved criminal <em>defendants </em>who sought correction of alleged sentencing errors on appeal after having failed to object in the trial court; here, of course, the party seeking to have the sentence modified on appeal is the People, acting through the Attorney General. We see no material difference in that circumstance, however. Animating the result in <em>Scott </em>was the following \u201cpractical and straightforward\u201d reasoning: \u201cAlthough the court is required to impose sentence in a lawful manner, counsel is charged with understanding, advocating, and clarifying permissible sentencing choices at the hearing. <em>Routine defects in the court\u2019s statement of reasons are easily prevented and corrected if called to the court\u2019s attention. </em>As in other waiver cases, we hope to reduce the number of errors committed in the first instance and preserve the judicial resources otherwise used to correct them.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 353, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The same rationale applies in this case. The trial court here failed to state on the record its reasons for not imposing the restitution fines; the <em>Scott </em>trial court failed to state on the record its reasons for making a discretionary sentencing choice, a finding required by section 1170. In <em>Scott, </em>we held the defendant\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s omission had been waived by the failure to make it at the time of sentencing. Here, we conclude the People\u2019s failure to object leads to the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">George, C.
