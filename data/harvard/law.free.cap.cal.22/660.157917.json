(Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2227.) A physician whom the MBC has disciplined in this way may obtain judicial review of the MBC\u2019s order by commencing an administrative mandate proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) The superior court has original jurisdiction of these administrative mandate proceedings. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 10.) For this limited category of actions, the Legislature has provided that the Court of Appeal shall review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the superior court\u2019s decision, not by direct appeal, but \u201cpursuant to a petition for an extraordinary writ.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2337; hereafter section 2337.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">We granted review in this case to decide whether section 2337\u2014making a writ petition the method for obtaining appellate review of superior court decisions in these physician licensing matters\u2014violates the clause of the California Constitution stating that, except when a judgment of death has been pronounced, \u201ccourts of appeal have appellate jurisdiction when superior courts have original jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11.) Consistent with our resolution of a similar question in <em>Powers v. City of Richmond </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 85 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 893 P.2d 1160] (hereafter <em>Powers), </em>we hold that section 2337 does not violate this appellate jurisdiction clause of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The MBC\u2019s Division of Medical Quality separately charged Dr. Nelson F. Leone, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Shashi D. Ganti, an ophthalmologist, with professional misconduct. For each physician, a hearing before an administrative law judge resulted in a recommendation of license revocation. The MBC adopted each of these recommendations and ordered the physicians\u2019 licenses revoked. Each physician sought and obtained judicial review of the MBC\u2019s adverse decision by petitioning the superior cburt for a writ of administrative mandate. In each of these judicial proceedings, the superior court upheld the license revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Notwithstanding section 2337, which makes an extraordinary writ petition the exclusive method for obtaining appellate review of a superior court decision in a physician license revocation matter, Drs. Leone and Ganti each filed a notice of appeal. Relying on section 2337, the MBC moved in the Court of Appeal to dismiss both appeals. For the purpose of ruling on these motions, the Court of Appeal consolidated the two appeals. It then heard oral argument and issued a single opinion in which it denied the MBC\u2019s motions to dismiss. The Court of Appeal construed the appellate jurisdiction clause of the California Constitution as granting litigants a constitutional right of appeal, and it held section 2337 unconstitutional because, as the Court of Appeal put it, \u201cthe Legislature does not have the power to destroy the right of an appeal that is constitutionally granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">This court granted the MBC\u2019s petition for review, which framed the issues this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">\u201c1. Does the Legislature have the authority to specify the mode of appellate review of physician discipline without infringing on the \u2018appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>jurisdiction\u2019 of the appellate court under article VI, section 11 of the California Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201c2. Is Business and Professions Code section 2337 constitutional under California\u2019s Constitution, article VI, section 11, to the extent that it specifies the mode of appellate review of a superior court\u2019s decision regarding physician discipline and permits appellate review solely by extraordinary writ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Plaintiff doctors contend that the California Constitution\u2019s appellate jurisdiction clause grants them a right of direct appeal from final judgments in administrative mandate proceedings in which superior courts exercise original jurisdiction. In their view, this constitutional right of appeal necessarily includes the rights to oral argument, a decision on the merits, and a written opinion explaining the basis of the appellate court\u2019s decision. Plaintiffs contend that section 2337 violates this constitutional right of appeal because it precludes them from appealing the superior courts\u2019 judgments in their administrative mandate actions and because it relegates them to seeking review by an extraordinary writ petition, which a Court of Appeal may deny summarily, without hearing oral argument or issuing a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">A majority of this court rejected the core of plaintiffs\u2019 argument in <em>Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, concluding instead that the appellate jurisdiction vested in the Courts of Appeal by article VI, section 11, of the California Constitution encompasses review by extraordinary writ as well as review by direct appeal. <em>(Powers, supra, </em>at pp. 92-93 (plur. opn. of Kennard, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 122 (conc. opn. of George, J.).) The Court of Appeal in this case failed to recognize that the plurality and concurring opinions in <em>Powers </em>agreed on this crucial point. Although <em>Powers </em>provides controlling authority that makes further analysis unnecessary, we summarize the reasoning of the <em>Powers </em>plurality that supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">When construing a constitution, courts view as the paramount consideration the intent of those who enacted the provision at issue. <em>(Davis v. City of Berkeley </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 227, 234 [272 Cal.Rptr. 139, 794 P.2d 897].) To determine that intent, courts look first to the language of the constitutional text, giving the words their ordinary meaning. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Bowens v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 36, 48 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 376, 820 P.2d 600]; <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The constitutional text at issue here is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction when judgment of death has been pronounced. With that exception courts of appeal have appellate jurisdiction when superior courts have original jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Nothing in this language conveys an intention to grant litigants a right of direct appeal from judgments in proceedings within the superior courts\u2019 original jurisdiction. \u201cGiving the words their ordinary meaning, the provision serves to establish and allocate judicial authority, not to define or guarantee the rights of litigants. Indeed, the provision nowhere mentions direct appeals or a \u2018right of appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, 91 (plur. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In particular, the reference to \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d does not imply a right of litigants to bring direct appeals.  A legal dictionary defines \u201cappellate\u201d as \u201c[p]ertaining to or having cognizance of <em>appeals and other proceedings for the judicial review of adjudications.\u201d </em>(Black's Law Dict. (6th ed. 1990) p. 97, col. 2, italics added.) The same dictionary defines \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d as \u201c[t]he power vested in an appellate court to review and revise the judicial action of an inferior court\u201d and as \u201cthe power of review and determination <em>on appeal, writ of error, certiorari, or other similar process.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 98, col. 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The United States Supreme Court has declared that the \u201cessential criterion of appellate jurisdiction\u201d is \u201cthat it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\u201d <em>(Marbury v. Madison </em>(1803) 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 175 [2 L.Ed. 60, 73].) Applying this . definition, the high court has concluded that a court exercises appellate jurisdiction when it reviews a lower court\u2019s decision in ruling on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>(Ex parte Watkins </em>(1833) 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 568, 572 [8 L.Ed. 786, 788].) Courts in other states have defined \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d similarly. (See <em>Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, 92-93 (plur. opn. of Kennard, J.), and cases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Thus, the ordinary and widely accepted meaning of the term \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d is simply the power of a reviewing court to correct error in a trial court proceeding. By common understanding, a reviewing court may exercise this power in the procedural context of a direct appeal or a writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">A review of the process that resulted in adoption of the California Constitution\u2019s appellate jurisdiction clause reinforces this construction. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>voters enacted the appellate jurisdiction clause in substantially its present form at the November 8, 1966, General Election, when the previous article VI of the California Constitution was repealed and its provisions revised and redistributed.  This comprehensive revision of the provisions concerning the judicial branch of state government was largely drafted by the California Constitutional Revision Commission, and a court may consult the commission\u2019s official reports to determine the intent and objective of ambiguous provisions. <em>(Mosk </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 474, 495 [159 Cal.Rptr. 494, 601 P.2d 1030].)  The records of the commission\u2019s official proceedings reveal that its main objective in revising article VI was \u201cto delete provisions which were redundant, obsolete, or unnecessary for inclusion in the Constitution, such as procedural matters which could be prescribed or provided for by statute or court rule.\u201d <em>(Mosk v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 496.) By removing unnecessary provisions from article VI, and allowing many of those matters to be regulated by statute, the commission\u2019s revisions of article VI effectively broadened the scope of the Legislature\u2019s control over judicial procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In its report recommending adoption of section 11 of article VI of the California Constitution, the commission gave this explanation: \u201cThis section collects those parts of existing Sections 4, 4b, 4e, and 5 that deal with appellate jurisdiction. Some of the existing sections contain detailed references to instances of appellate jurisdiction. The Commission deleted those references as unnecessary in the Constitution except in death penalty cases where, because of the extreme nature of the penalty, jurisdiction was given to the Supreme Court, [\u00b6] The phrase \u2018on questions of law alone,\u2019 as a description of appellate jurisdiction in criminal causes when judgment of death has been rendered was deleted as unnecessary since this is the ordinary scope of review in appellate courts.\u201d (Cal. Const. Revision Com., Proposed Revision (1966) p. 91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In the records of the commission\u2019s proceedings and reports bearing on the appellate jurisdiction provision, we find not a single reference to a litigant\u2019s right of appeal, nor anything suggesting that the commission intended that the appellate jurisdiction clause would confer on litigants a right to a direct appeal. Nor does the ballot pamphlet for the November 1966 election mention a right of appeal under the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In its decision, the Court of Appeal here relied on statements in certain early court decisions referring to a right of appeal under the state Constitution. (See <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 209, 213-214 [47 P.2d 705]; <em>In re Sutter-Butte By-Pass Assessment </em>(1923) 190 Cal. 532, 536 [213 P. 974]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(1889) 79 Cal. 105, 107 [21 P. 423].) For several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>reasons, this reliance was misplaced. None of these decisions construed the current appellate jurisdiction clause, enacted in November 1966, and none addressed the constitutional validity of a legislative scheme making a writ petition the exclusive mode of appellate review of a superior court proceeding. The courts authoring these decisions appear to have used the term \u201cappeal\u201d to encompass a right to appellate review generally, without distinguishing between review by writ petition and review by direct appeal. Finally, many contemporaneous and later decisions of this co\u00fcrt and the Courts of Appeal stated that the right of appeal is entirely statutory and that there is no constitutional right of appeal. (See <em>Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, 105-108 (plur. opn. of Kennard, J.), and cases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Because a reviewing court may exercise appellate jurisdiction-\u2014that is, the power to review and correct error in trial court orders and judgments\u2014either by a direct appeal or by an extraordinary writ proceeding, the clause of the state Constitution conferring appellate jurisdiction on the Courts of Appeal \u201cdoes not necessarily or strongly imply a right of litigants to bring direct appeals\u201d from judgments in civil proceedings within the superior court\u2019s original jurisdiction. <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, 93, 105-108 (plur. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Rather, that constitutional provision is, properly construed as generally permitting the Legislature to enact laws, such as section 2337, specifying that an extraordinary writ petition shall be the method for obtaining appellate review of a superior court judgment in an administrative mandate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Legislature\u2019s authority to specify the mode of appellate review of superior court judgments is subject to an important qualification. Because the appellate jurisdiction clause is a grant of <em>judicial </em>authority, the Legislature may not restrict appellate review in a manner that would \u201c \u2018substantially impair the constitutional powers of the courts, or practically defeat their exercise.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Jessup </em>(1889) 81 Cal. 408, 470, italics omitted, quoting <em>Ex Parte Harker </em>(1875) 49 Cal. 465, 467.) \u201cIf it could be demonstrated in a given case, or class of cases, that, for whatever reason, the Courts of Appeal or this court could not effectively exercise the constitutionally granted power of appellate review by an extraordinary writ proceeding, then such a proceeding could not constitutionally be made the exclusive mode of appellate review.\u201d <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, 110 (plur. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Relying on this qualification, plaintiff doctors argue that section 2337 substantially impairs the exercise of appellate jurisdiction because the percentage of extraordinary writ petitions that the Courts of Appeal summarily deny is greater than the percentage of direct appeals in which the Courts of Appeal affirm the superior court\u2019s judgment. We find the argument entirely unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Plaintiffs cite no relevant statistics demonstrating that, when a writ petition is the exclusive method of appellate review of a final judgment, the Courts of Appeal summarily deny writ petitions with greater frequency than they affirm judgments on direct appeal in comparable proceedings. This lack of relevant supporting data is by itself sufficient reason to reject this argument. In addition, the argument lacks any coherent logic. We perceive no reason to infer from the frequency of summary denials that extraordinary writ review is not a sufficient or effective appellate remedy in physician discipline proceedings. Section 2337 does not limit the kinds of superior court error that the Court of Appeal may correct, the record that the Court of Appeal may consider, or the time the Court of Appeal may devote to appellate review. Nor does it prevent the Court of Appeal, when a petition appears to have merit, from hearing oral argument or issuing a written opinion. Thus, nothing in section 2337 substantially impairs a Court of Appeal\u2019s ability to effectively exercise its power to review and correct error in superior court administrative mandate decisions in physician discipline matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Finally, Dr. Leone argues that even if section 2337 does not on its face violate the appellate jurisdiction clause of the California Constitution, Courts of Appeal may not deny extraordinary writ petitions in these physician discipline cases summarily, without an order to show cause or alternative writ, oral argument, and a written opinion. Dr. Leone asserts that a summary writ denial is not an exercise of jurisdiction and thus cannot not satisfy an appellate court\u2019s obligation to exercise the appellate jurisdiction with which it is constitutionally vested. This argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">A reviewing court\u2019s obligation to exercise the appellate jurisdiction with which it is vested, once that jurisdiction has been properly invoked, is established and not open to question. (See <em>Colorado River Water Cons. Dist. v. U.S. </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 800, 817 [96 S.Ct. 1236, 1246, 47 L.Ed.2d 483]; <em>People v. Jordan </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 644, 646 [4 P. 683].)  We do not agree with Dr. Leone, however, that a Court of Appeal fails to exercise its appellate jurisdiction when it summarily denies an extraordinary writ petition that lacks substantive merit or is procedurally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">As authority for the proposition that a Court of Appeal fails to exercise jurisdiction when it summarily denies an extraordinary writ petition, Dr. Leone relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kowis v. Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250]. In that case, we held that a summary denial of a writ petition on a pretrial issue does not establish the law of the case. In the course of explaining that holding, we made this statement, on which Dr. Leone relies: \u201cWhen the court denies a writ petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>without issuing an alternative writ, <em>it does not take jurisdiction over the </em>case; it does not give the legal issue full plenary review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 897.) The italicized statement was addressed to writ petitions challenging pretrial superior court rulings that could also be reviewed on appeal from the judgment ultimately entered in the action; it was not addressed to situations in which a writ petition was the only authorized mode of appellate review.  In the latter situation, an appellate court must judge the petition on its procedural and substantive merits, and a summary denial of the petition is necessarily on the merits. (See <em>Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, 113-114 (plur. opn. of Kennard, J.); <em>Dowell v. Superior Court </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 483, 486-487 [304 P.2d 1009]; <em>May v. Board of Directors </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 125, 133-134 [208 P.2d 661].) An appellate court that summarily denies a writ petition for lack of substantive merit or for procedural defect thereby fulfills its duty to exercise the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by the state Constitution\u2019s appellate jurisdiction clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Plaintiff doctors argue that section 2337 not only violates the appellate jurisdiction clause of the state Constitution, but also denies them due process and equal protection. Because these due process and equal protection claims are outside the issues on which we granted review, and because the Court of Appeal has not yet addressed them, we decline to consider them at this time. The Court of Appeal will address these issues on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In section 2337, the Legislature has determined that for superior court decisions in certain physician licensing matters, the mode of appellate review shall be an extraordinary writ proceeding rather than direct appeal. To determine whether, as plaintiff doctors contend, the appellate jurisdiction clause of the state Constitution forbids this legislative choice, we have examined the text and history of this constitutional provision. We conclude that the appellate jurisdiction clause does not require the Legislature to provide for direct appeals in all cases within the original jurisdiction of the superior courts; that it permits some variation in and experimentation with the procedures for appellate review of civil actions brought in the superior courts, provided always that the constitutional powers of the courts are not thereby impaired; and that in particular it does not guarantee a physician a right to a direct appeal from a superior court administrative mandate judgment upholding the MBC\u2019s revocation of the physician\u2019s license to practice medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal denying the MBC\u2019s motions to dismiss is reversed, and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>GEORGE, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">I concur in the holding of the majority that Business and Professions Code section 2337 (section 2337) does not violate article VI, section 11, of the California Constitution. Appellate review of superior court judgments entered upon review of administrative orders revoking, suspending, or restricting a physician\u2019s license to practice medicine may be limited to review by petition for extraordinary writ without violating the appellate jurisdiction clause of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">I would analyze the issue, however, in the manner explained in my concurring opinion in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 85 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 893 P.2d 1160] <em>(Powers). </em>There I cautioned against any holding that would permit the Legislature to undertake wholesale replacement of direct appeal with review by extraordinary writ <em>(id. </em>at pp. 116, 124 (conc. opn. of George, J.)), thereby \u201crestructur[ing], in a fundamental manner, the operation of the state\u2019s appellate process.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 117.) Focusing upon the authority of the appellate courts, the concurring opinion suggested that legislation might violate article VI, section 11, of the California Constitution if it transformed the Court of Appeal \u201cfrom an appellate tribunal whose duties generally involve the resolution of cases in which litigants have a direct appeal \u2018as a matter of right\u2019\u2014and in which most decisions must be rendered \u2018in writing with reasons stated\u2019 [citation]\u2014into an appellate court whose jurisdiction consists <em>entirely </em>of writ review and as to which the court has no obligation to resolve <em>any </em>of the cases before it by a written decision setting forth the reasons for its ruling.\u201d <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 116 (conc. opn. of George, J.), italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In addition, the concurring opinion suggested that in some instances, from the perspective of the <em>parties </em>to an action, \u201cthe nature or subject matter\u201d under review or \u201cthe nature of the particular rights or interests at stake\u201d might signify that \u201cadequate appellate review\u201d could be provided \u201conly by direct appeal, and not by extraordinary writ.\u201d <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 121 (conc. opn. of George, J.), italics omitted.) The concurring opinion also suggested that the wholesale elimination of direct review from entire classes of cases could implicate not only the authority of the appellate courts, but also the rights of the parties, <em>(Id. </em>at p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">I agree with the majority in the present case that there is no basis for concluding that the judicial power of the appellate courts is impaired when review of judgments in administrative mandate actions in cases of physician discipline is limited to extraordinary writ. This restriction affects only a very narrow class of cases, and the essential function of the reviewing court is not threatened. There is no claim that the instances in which the Legislature has provided for writ review of lower court orders and judgments are so numerous that cumulatively the appellate process has been transformed to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>extent that the exercise of the power of the appellate courts has been impaired. Further, the judicial power of the appellate courts is exercised <em>effectively </em>when review is sought by extraordinary writ. (See <em>Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 113-114 (lead opn. of Kennard, J.).) Indeed, the provision limiting plaintiffs to writ review does not limit the record that the appellate court may consider. The administrative proceeding is recorded (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11512, subd. (d)), and this record generally is submitted to the superior court with a petition for administrative mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (a); <em>Alford v. Pierno </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691 [104 Cal.Rptr. 110]) and normally also would be presented to the Court of Appeal. (See <em>Sherwood v. Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 183, 186-187 [154 Cal.Rptr. 917, 593 P.2d 862].) This provision does not limit the time the Court of Appeal may choose to devote to the evaluation of the writ petition. Further, in any case in which the Court of Appeal\u2019s assessment of the petition leads it to conclude that the petition may have merit, the appellate court may issue an alternative writ and obtain additional briefing and oral argument. Thus, from the point of view of the Court of Appeal, there is no indication that writ review under section 2337 would prevent that court from exercising its appellate power effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">With respect to the additional concern noted in the concurring opinion in Powers\u2014the rights of the litigants\u2014section 2337 is within the constitutional latitude recognized by that opinion in permitting legislative innovation, since the statutory provisions are \u201ccompatible with the particular issue or ruling subject to review and . . . serve to promote a fair and efficient judicial system.\u201d <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 123 (conc. opn. of George, J.).) The restriction on appellate review serves a significant public interest in the speedy removal of incompetent physicians from the practice of medicine. (See <em>Kees </em>v. <em>Medical Board </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1801, 1813 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 112] [government has a pressing need to protect the public from the risk of harm presented by physicians who cannot practice medicine safely].) Moreover, the statutory procedure for reviewing an administrative decision revoking, suspending, or modifying a physician\u2019s license to practice medicine includes what is essentially the equivalent of a direct appeal\u2014the physician is afforded the right to a full and complete hearing at the administrative level, and then has the right to obtain review of the administrative decision through administrative mandate in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Plaintiffs, relying upon language in the concurring opinion in <em>Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at page 121, contend that with respect to both \u201cthe nature of the subject matter\u201d and \u201cthe nature of the particular rights at stake,\u201d section 2337 is distinguishable from the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.) provision at issue in Powers, and that in light of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>distinctions it is appropriate to conclude that adequate appellate review may be provided only by direct appeal and not by extraordinary writ. It is true, as plaintiffs maintain, that the right to practice their profession is a vested right (see <em>Unterthiner </em>v. <em>Desert Hospital Dist. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 285, 297 [188 Cal.Rptr. 590, 656 P.2d 554]), the deprivation of which has great significance to the affected individual. It is also true, as plaintiffs contend, that the proceedings resulting in a disciplinary sanction in many instances may be significantly more protracted, and more factually and legally complex, than those presented in a typical California Public Records Act controversy. And it is also true that, unlike the California Public Records Act provisions at issue in <em>Powers, </em>section 2337\u2014though similarly intended to speed the resolution of litigation through the substitution of writ review for direct appeal\u2014was not enacted to promote the interests of the affected parties, in this instance, physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Nonetheless, certain factors weigh heavily against plaintiffs\u2019 claim that extraordinary writ review in the Court of Appeal does not afford adequate appellate review in the cases to which section 2337 applies. First, although plaintiffs undoubtedly possess a very significant interest in continuing to practice their profession, this interest properly is subject to legislative control. As we have observed, \u201c \u2018[t]he general right to engage in a trade, profession or business is subject to the power inherent in the state to make necessary rules and regulations respecting the use and enjoyment of property necessary for the preservation of the public health, morals, comfort, order and safety .... [Citation.] No person can acquire a vested right to continue, when once licensed, in a business, trade or occupation which is subject to legislative control under the police powers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hughes v. Board of Architectural Examiners </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 790 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 952 P.2d 641].)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Moreover, in the California Public Records Act action at issue in <em>Powers, </em>the superior court proceeding that was subject to review by extraordinary writ was the initial and <em>only </em>proceeding to address the litigants\u2019 California Public Records Act claim. By contrast, the proceedings to. which section 2337 applies are administrative mandate proceedings, in which, as noted, the superior court itself essentially provides a direct appeal from extensive quasi-judicial administrative proceedings. In a manner consistent with their significant interest in continuing to practice their profession, physicians are afforded a panoply of procedural safeguards at the administrative level, and the hearing before the administrative law judge is in many respects comparable to an initial trial before a superior court in an ordinary civil action. When a physician challenges a decision of the administrative law judge that has been adopted by the medical board, the parties may file the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>administrative record with the superior court (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (a)), and that court determines whether the administrative body \u201chas proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).) If it is claimed that the administrative findings are not supported by the evidence, the court exercises its independent judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (c); <em>Yellen v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 1040, 1057-1058 [220 Cal.Rptr.2d 426].) In addition, the parties are entitled to a written decision upon request. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">It is evident, accordingly, that the superior court entertains what is closely comparable to a direct appeal from the administrative decision. In this setting, the further appellate review that the physician may seek in the Court of Appeal provides a <em>second </em>check on any possible error. Accordingly, because the superior court already will have reviewed the administrative record in the manner described, the distinctions drawn by plaintiffs between California Public Records Act proceedings and the proceedings to which section 2337 applies do not demonstrate that limiting appellate review in the present context to extraordinary writ review imposes any greater intrusion on a party\u2019s interests in adequate appellate review than tide procedures applicable in the California Public Records Act context.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In light of the extensive protections afforded physicians at the administrative level and, most particularly, at the superior court level, and considering the important public interest in imposing timely discipline upon physicians, I believe that exclusive review of a superior court judgment in an administrative mandate proceeding by extraordinary writ in these circumstances is \u201ccompatible with the particular issue or ruling subject to review and . . . , at the same time, serve[s] to promote a fair and efficient judicial system.\u201d <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 123 (conc. opn. of George, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Having expressed these views, in future cases I shall be bound by the broader rule established by the majority in the present case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b718-7\">MOSK, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Am5\">I joined the dissent in <em>Powers v. City of Richmond </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 85, 124 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 893 P.2d 1160] <em>(Powers), </em>which concluded, after extensive historical review, that article VI, section 11 of the California Constitution was intended to give litigants who had their cause adjudicated in superior court a right of direct appeal that could not be supplanted by discretionary writ review. The majority today formulate a ^position to whichonly three justices on the <em>Powers </em>court assented\u2014that the Legislature has the virtually unlimited authority to substitute writ proceedings for appeal. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The differences between review by writ and by appeal are not merely formal or theoretical. Despite the majority\u2019s clarification that when a writ is the only means of appellate review, denial of the writ must necessarily be on the merits (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 670), it can hardly be doubted that writ review affords fewer procedural protections. This is so because writ review lacks those basic components of ordinary appellate review\u2014oral argument and a written opinion\u2014that ensure the merits of an appeal will be fairly considered. \u201cOral argument provides the only opportunity for a dialogue between the litigant and the bench. As a result, \u2018it promotes understanding in ways that cannot be matched by written communication.\u2019 [Citation.] For example, in complex cases, oral argument \u2018provides a fluid and rapidly moving method of getting at essential issues.\u2019 [Citation.] In the words of one judge, \u2018 \u201cMistakes, errors, fallacies and flaws elude us in spite of ourselves unless the case is pounded and hammered at the Bar.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] [\u00b6] No proof of the value of oral argument is more compelling, however, \u2018than the fact that many judges find that the opportunity for a personal exchange with counsel makes a difference in result.\u2019 [Citation.] This aspect of oral argument\u2014the chance to make a difference in result\u2014is extremely valuable to litigants.\u201d <em>(Moles </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 867, 872 [187 Cal.Rptr. 557, 654 P.2d 740].) We know too, from personal experience, that when a reviewing court must account for its conclusions in a written opinion, even if that opinion is not published in the official records, there is a greater likelihood that it will carefully analyze the merits. For reasons fully articulated by the dissent in <em>Powers, </em>I continue to be persuaded that a right of direct appeal\u2014including oral argument and a written opinion\u2014is what the drafters of article VI, section 11 of the California Constitution and its predecessor sections had in mind by \u201cappellate jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Unlike the lead opinion in <em>Powers, </em>and the majority today, the concurring opinion in <em>Powers </em>proposed a narrow holding. It focused primarily on the statute before it, the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.). It concluded that requiring appellate review by extraordinary writ in such a case did not violate article VI, section 11 of the California Constitution, in part because the Legislature \u201cdetermined that appellate review by extraordinary writ, rather than by direct appeal, would better protect the rights afforded by the Public Records Act.\u201d <em>(Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 85, 123 (conc. opn. of George, J.).) Implicit in this position is the assumption that the Legislature may substitute writ review for that of direct appeal if such substitution advances an important legislative objective. But assuming arguendo that this position is correct, and that rights under the California Public Records Act were indeed best protected by resort to an expeditious writ, in the present case I find that no such legislative objective is advanced. It is not claimed that review by extraordinary writ under Business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Professions Code section 2337 will better protect the right of physicians to practice their profession. On the contrary, the substitution of writ review for direct appeal is inconsistent with the heightened constitutional protections afforded someone who is in danger of losing a vested right to practice his or her profession. (See <em>Unterthiner </em>v. <em>Desert Hospital Dist. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 285, 297 [188 Cal.Rptr. 590, 656 P.2d 554].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The concurring opinion in the present case would justify the restriction on appellate review in part by the \u201csignificant public interest in the speedy removal of incompetent physicians from the practice of medicine.\u201d (Conc. opn. of George, C. J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 672.) But the requirement of writ review does not substantially advance this interest. Once the Medical Board of California has suspended or revoked a physician\u2019s license, a physician can only obtain a stay of the order if it is granted by the superior court to which he or she has applied for a writ of mandate. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (h)(1).) A stay may be granted only if \u201cthe court is satisfied that the public interest will not suffer and that the [licensing] agency is unlikely to prevail ultimately on the merits\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>which means that the court must convince itself that the physician is likely to prevail on the merits <em>(Board of Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 272, 276 [170 Cal.Rptr. 468]). Thus, the Medical Board already has the power to timely remove from practice incompetent or unscrupulous physicians, and further restriction on the ability to grant a stay may be legislated without the need to eliminate a right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In short, the majority and concurring opinions in this case do not merely follow <em>Powers, </em>but significantly broaden it by expanding the class of cases in which the Legislature may deny the constitutional right of appeal. I cannot join them in that enterprise.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b720-6\">BROWN, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\"The bald truth is this, isn\u2019t it, that the power to regulate jurisdiction is actually a power to regulate rights\u2014rights to judicial process . . . and substantive rights generally?\u201d (Hart, <em>The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic </em>(1953) 66 Harv. L.Rev. 1362, 1371.) Henry Hart was, of course, questioning the power of Congress to restrict the jurisdiction of the federal courts in his justly famous Dialogue of almost half a century ago. Yet the principle enunciated by Professor Hart applies with even greater force to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Dissenting in the <em>Powers </em>case <em>(Powers </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 85, 125 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 893 P.2d 1160] <em>(Powers)), </em>Chief Justice Lucas gave an exhaustive account of the historical materials bearing on the question of the framers\u2019 intent in adopting our constitutional \u201cright of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>appeal\u201d provision. As that opinion compellingly demonstrates, what the framers of now article VI, section 11 of the California Constitution (hereafter article VI, section 11) intended to secure for the citizens of California was a constitutional right of direct appeal to a reviewing court, a right that included oral argument and an opinion in writing on the merits of the case. (10 Cal.4th at p. 141 [quoting Delegate Wilson at the 1879 convention that \u201c \u2018[t]he importance of requiring the Court to give written opinions cannot be overrated. ... It tends to purity and honesty in the administration of justice.\u2019 ([2 Willis &amp; Stockton, Debates and Proceedings, Cal. Constitutional Convention (1878-1879)] at p. 951, col. 1.\u201d].) Rather than confer on the Legislature the power to make exceptions to appellate jurisdiction\u2014not just the federal model but the dominant state model of the day\u2014the framers of the 1849 and 1879 California provisions instead expressly described the jurisdiction conferred on our appellate courts, following the example set by Louisiana. <em>(Powers, </em>supra, at pp. 134-137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Unfortunately, a plurality of the court in <em>Powers </em>rejected that view of the meaning of article VI, section 11\u2014a rejection today\u2019s majority affirms. Not only does that holding mark an epochal change in the understanding of the appellate rights of California litigants, in effect, it threatens to overturn the conception of a constitutionally rooted, truly independent judiciary. From now on, the sole limitation on the Legislature\u2019s otherwise plenary power to manipulate the jurisdiction of California\u2019s appellate courts is the notion that such statutory enactments may not \u201c \u2018 \u201csubstantially impair the constitutional powers of the courts, or practically defeat their exercise.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 668, quoting <em>In re Jessup </em>(1889) 81 Cal. 408, 470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The concurring opinion advances a similar but more elaborated standard to protect the appellate courts from legislative overreaching: legislation cannot constitutionally \u201ctransform[] the Court of Appeal \u2018from an appellate tribunal whose duties generally involve the resolution of cases in which litigants have a direct appeal \u201cas a matter of right\u201d . . . into an appellate court whose jurisdiction consists entirely of writ review and as to which the court has no obligation to resolve any of the cases before it by a written decision setting forth the reasons for its ruling.\u2019 \u201d (Conc. opn. of George, C. J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 671, quoting <em>Powers, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 116, italics omitted.) Would it were so.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The tripartite structure of government and the separation of powers doctrine that underlies it are not ends in themselves; the issue is not one of governmental \u201cturf.\u201d The structural divisions of the Constitution are intended to promote the chief aim of our government\u2014individual liberty. (See Miller, <em>Liberty and Constitutional Architecture: The Rights-Structure Paradigm </em>(1993) 16 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 87; Brown, <em>Separated Powers and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Ordered Liberty </em>(1991) 139 U.Pa. L.Rev. 1513.) It is that concern\u2014the potential for the impairment of individual liberty through the impairment of the structural powers of the judiciary\u2014that is at the root of my disagreement with the majority in this case. The fear of an insensible, aggrandizing \u201ctyranny\u201d that underlies the structural division of government is timeless; as real today as it was in 1879, in 1849, and in 1776. And, \u201c[c]entral to [the concept of separation of powers] are three . . . insights: (1) the very fact of the concentration of political power in the hands of one governmental organ is unacceptable, even absent a showing of misuse of that power; (2) it will, as a practical matter, be all but impossible to determine when the level of the concentration of political power has reached the danger point; and (3) the point at which such an unacceptable concentration is actually reached is too late for the situation to be remedied.\u201d (Redish &amp; Cisar, <em>\u201cIf Angels Were to Govern\u201d: The Need for Pragmatic Formalism in Separation of Powers Theory </em>(1991) 41 Duke L.J. 449, 476, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">I agree with Edmund Burke that the first virtue of politics is prudence. (See Burke, The Philosophy of Edmund Burke, Prudence as a Political Virtue (1960) p. 38; <em>id. </em>at p. 41 [\u201cPrudence is not only the first in rank of the virtues political and moral, but she is the director, the regulator, the standard of them all.\u201d].) The appetite for power by the departments of government is, as Madison wrote, \u201cof an encroaching nature.\u201d (Madison, The Federalist No. 48 (Rossiter ed. 1961) p. 308.) Its accretion leads to even greater accretion. Short of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, legislative aggrandizement need not\u2014indeed, likely will not\u2014assume a dramatic form. More probably, as in this case, it appears in the form of legislators \u201ceagerly bent on some favorite object, and breaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of it . . . .\u201d (Madison, The Federalist No. 50, <em>supra, </em>at p. 318.) And it is for that very reason, as Thomas Jefferson wrote, that \u201c[t]he time to guard against . . . tyranny, is before [it] shall have gotten hold on us.\u201d (Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia (Peden ed. 1982) p. 121.) It is not the last invasive stroke on the judiciary\u2019s constitutional prerogatives that should mobilize resistance, but the first. This truism of politics is the reason the limitations on legislative power endorsed in the majority and concurring opinions will protect neither the courts nor the people of California. Or, put another way, would protect them only if, in Madison\u2019s striking phrase, \u201cangels were to govern.\u201d (Madison, The Federalist No. 51, <em>supra, </em>at p. 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In my view, where the Legislature has asserted control over the right of appeal\u2014a subject central to the judicial function\u2014a case-by-case inquiry into the likelihood of adverse effects in the wake of a separation of powers breach is ill-conceived. It is ill-conceived for the simple reason that no effective method exists of making that inquiry until it is too late to avoid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>danger it represents. Indeed, for the second time in as many months, the majority continues to validate such incursions seriatim. (See <em>In re Rose </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 430, 466 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 298, 993 P.2d 956] (dis. opn. of Brown, J.).) The idea that the court can monitor legislative inroads into our jurisdiction, calling a halt to the invasion when we have determined that it has gone \u201ctoo far,\u201d sacrifices the impairment of individual liberties to a kind of interbranch \u201ccomity.\u201d It is for that very practical reason the separation of powers doctrine has to operate prophylactically.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Two additional considerations fuel my concern with today\u2019s result. The majority expressly affirms the power of a reviewing court to summarily deny a disciplined physician\u2019s writ petition\u2014the postcard denial sent without oral argument or an opinion \u201cin writing with reasons stated.\u201d (See Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 14.) Imposing upon the Courts of Appeal the obligation to issue alternative writs as a matter of course in cases falling within Business and Professions Code section 2337 (hereafter section 2337) would go far to mitigate the unhappy potential of today\u2019s ruling. As it stands, however, today\u2019s majority expressly authorizes the Court of Appeal to dismiss summarily writ petitions falling within section 2337. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 669 [\u201cWe do not agree . . . that a Court of Appeal fails to exercise its appellate jurisdiction when it summarily denies an extraordinary writ petition that lacks substantive merit or is procedurally defective.\u201d].) In my view, the summary denial of writ relief by the Court of Appeal denies a benefit the Constitution itself confers.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">My concern is only compounded by looking at the alternatives available to the Legislature, alternatives that pose no risk to the constitutional powers of the judiciary and achieve the identical public end sought by section 2337. As Justice Mosk points out in his dissenting opinion, the simplest and most expeditious way to secure the ends sought by the Legislature is to declare that no court shall issue a stay of an administrative order revoking a medical license pending appellate review. (See dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 676.) Indeed, in physician misconduct cases decided under the current regime, a stay of license revocation can be issued by the Courts of Appeal only under narrowly prescribed circumstances. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (h)(1).) Thus, in most cases, the public is fully protected against malpracticing physicians pending resolution of their appeals. The expedition promised by section 2337 is not only unnecessary, but comes at a cost in terms of constitutional structure. Last, of course, one justifiably wonders whether the promised expedition gained by eliminating the time consumed by direct appeals of disciplined physicians seeking judicial review is really any more than the time required for meaningful judicial review in a writ proceeding, including issuance of an alternative writ, additional briefing, and oral argument. (Cf. <em>Lewis v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1232 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>85, 970 P.2d 872].) The necessary time expenditure can hardly be less than an expedited direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The limits imposed by the Constitution\u2014always permeable\u2014now become wholly illusory. A rule that prohibits substantial impairment of the constitutional powers of the court (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 668) is meaningless when the constitutional provisions are emptied of substantive content. The concurring opinion asserts that legislation cannot constitutionally \u201ctransform[] the Court of Appeal . . . \u2018into an appellate court whose jurisdiction consists entirely of writ review ....\u2019\u201d (Conc. opn. of George, C. J., <em>ante, </em>at p. 671, italics omitted.) The Legislature may perhaps be forgiven if its derisive response is: \u201cSez who?\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
