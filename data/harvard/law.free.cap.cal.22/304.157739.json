Code, \u00a7 81000 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits any person from making a campaign contribution in someone else\u2019s name. The question here is whether section 83116.5, by which the Legislature amended the Act in 1984, exempts lobbyists from criminal liability for violation of this prohibition and subjects them solely to administrative sanctions. We find such a restriction would not only conflict with manifest legislative intent but would contravene the Legislature\u2019s statutory and constitutional authority to amend or repeal the Act as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>initiative measure. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which concluded sections 83116.5 and 91015 precluded criminal liability for violations of the Act by lobbyists.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Only a few essential facts are relevant to the question before us: Defendant Arthur K. Snyder (defendant), a lawyer primarily engaged in lobbying, was convicted of eight misdemeanor counts of malting political contributions in a false name and one count of conspiring to make such contributions during the period from January 1989 through May 1992 on a plea of guilty,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and obtained a certificate of probable cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 84301, 91000, subd. (a).) The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of conviction, concluding that section 83116.5 exempted lobbyists from criminal prosecution for violations of the Act. (See \u00a7 91015.) We granted review to determine the proper construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In 1974, the voters approved the Act as an initiative measure concerning elections and various means for preventing corruption and undue influence in political campaigns and governmental activities. (See <em>Fair Political Practices Com. v. Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 37 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46].) Its provisions included a broad prohibition against what is commonly termed money laundering: \u201cNo contribution shall be made, directly or indirectly, by any person in a name other than the name by which such person is identified for legal purposes.\u201d (\u00a7 84301.) Violation of this proscription subjects the person to criminal penalties. (\u00a7 91000, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">In 1984, the Legislature added section 83116.5: \u201cAny person who violates any provision of this title, who purposely or negligently causes any other person to violate any provision of this title, or who aids and abets any other person in the violation of any provision of this title, shall be liable under the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, that this section shall apply only to persons who have filing or reporting obligations under this title, or who are compensated for services involving the planning, organizing, or directing of any activity regulated or required by this title, and that a violation of this section shall not constitute an additional violation under Chapter 11.\u201d (See \u00a7 91015; Stats. 1984, ch. 670, \u00a7 2, p. 2464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In concluding section 83116.5 exempts defendant from criminal liability for money laundering, the Court of Appeal reasoned thusly: Defendant is a lobbyist.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See \u00a7 82039.) Lobbyists have reporting obligations under the Act. (\u00a7 86100 et seq.) As originally adopted, the Act prohibited any person, including lobbyists, from making campaign contributions in a false name and made the violation a misdemeanor. Since 1984, however, section 83116.5 has provided that as to \u201cpersons who have filing or reporting obligations under this title,\u201d they \u201cshall be liable under the provisions of this chapter\u201d and \u201cviolation of this section shall not constitute an additional violation under Chapter 11.\u201d \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d refers to chapter 3 of the Act, which created the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) and granted the FPPC authority to institute administrative action for violations of the Act. (\u00a7 83100 et seq.; see <em>McCauley v. BFC Direct Marketing </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1262, 1267 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 498] <em>(McCauley).) </em>Chapter 11 sets forth the Act\u2019s civil and criminal enforcement provisions. (\u00a7 91000 et seq.) Section 91015, also part of the 1984 amendment, further states, \u201cThe provisions of [Chapter 11] shall not apply to violations of Section. 83116.5.\u201d Accordingly, defendant\u2019s status as a lobbyist removed him from the criminal purview of the Act, and he could incur only administrative sanctions for any violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The Court of Appeal impliedly acknowledged that its construction of section 83116.5 subjected defendant\u2014and by extension anyone else with statutory filing and reporting obligations\u2014to weaker sanctions for money laundering than ordinary citizens, but found this anomaly compelled by the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute. In its view, the electorate \u201ccorrect[ed]\u201d this disparity in 1996 by approving Proposition 208, which deleted the statutory proviso and repealed section 91015. (But see <em>California Prolife Council v. Scully </em>(E.D.Cal. 1998) 989 F.Supp. 1282, 1301-1302, affd. (9th Cir. 1999) 164 F.3d 1189 [enjoining enforcement of Prop. 208 provisions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Like the Act itself, section 83116.5 is not \u201ca prototype of sapient drafting\u201d <em>(Fair Political Practices Com. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 54 (conc. and dis. opn. of Newman, J.)), and no plain meaning appears on the face of the statute. Nevertheless, neither the language of section 83116.5 nor its legislative history supports the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation. Both the specific prohibition against money laundering (\u00a7 84301) and the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>charging statute (\u00a7 91000, subd. (a)) are cast in the broadest terms, applying to \u201cany person\u201d coming within their ambit. (See <em>post, </em>at pp. 311-314.) Nothing in section 83116.5 reflects an object or intent to narrow the scope of this preexisting liability. Indeed, the statute expressly provides that \u201cviolation <em>of this section </em>shall not constitute an <em>additional </em>violation under Chapter 11\u201d (italics added), which further connotes that any independent civil or criminal sanctions then available would continue unaffected by the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Moreover, the purpose of the legislation was to broaden the reach of the Act. The FPPC sponsored Senate Bill No. 1438 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.), which eventually became section 83116.5. The bill was prompted by concern that \u201cin certain circumstances, violations of the Act cannot fairly be attributed to those persons named in the Act, particularly true [sic] in the area of campaign reporting where the candidate and treasurer are responsible for violations of the Act, and yet, rely on others who cannot be held liable for their errors and omissions under the Act.\u201d (FPPC, Mem. to Sen. Com. on Elections &amp; Reapportionment (Feb. 27, 1984) p. 1; <em>id., </em>(May 22, 1984) p. 1.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In summarizing its impact, the Senate Committee on Elections and Reapportionment reported that \u201c[i]n practical terms, this renders campaign managers and associates liable [for violations of the Act] as well as candidates and treasurers.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Elections &amp; Reapportionment, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1438 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 7, 1984, p. 1 (Senate Committee Analysis); see Assem. Com. on Elections, Reapportionment &amp; Constitutional Amendments, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1438 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) June 19, 1984, p. 1 (Assembly Committee Analysis).)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The original version allowed for civil and criminal penalties. The Legislature, however, ultimately restricted liability to administrative sanctions, apparently in response to concern that campaign volunteers and low-paid workers would incur substantial responsibility even though they were not involved in significant campaign reporting activities. (See FPPC, Mem. to Assem. Com. on Elections, Reapportionment &amp; Constitutional Amendments (June 11, 1984).) As the Assembly Committee on Elections, Reapportionment, and Constitutional Amendments explained in its analysis, the bill \u201cextends . . . liability [then imposed only on candidates and treasurers] to other persons who are, in effect, in decision making capacities on a campaign, but does not apply to rank and file campaign volunteers.\u201d (Assem. Com. Analysis, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>It thus appears evident the Legislature sought to expand the class of persons the FPPC could hold accountable for reporting violations under the Act, not limit liability for money laundering by lobbyists and others with filing and reporting obligations.  In its amicus curiae brief, the FPPC supports this view, which \u201cbecause of the agency\u2019s expertise ... is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous or unauthorized.\u201d <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 101, 111 [172 Cal.Rptr. 194, 624 P.2d 244].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">This expansion of coverage operates in two ways: First, it imposes administrative liability on persons not previously subject to regulation or penalties under the Act, i.e., those persons, such as campaign managers, \u201cwho are compensated for services involving the planning, organizing, or directing of any activity regulated or required by this title . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 83116.5; see <em>McCauley, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1267-1268.) Although neither civil nor criminal, sanctions apply, such persons come within the administrative control of the FPPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Second, section 83116.5 sanctions conduct not previously subject to regulation or penalties under the Act, i.e., the statute imposes administrative liability on any person \u201cwho purposely or negligently causes any other person to violate any provision of this title, or who aids and abets any other person in violation of any provision of this title . . . .\u201d Those already having direct reporting obligations are now also subject to administrative liability if they indirectly cause others to engage in prohibited activity. This interpretation accords with the Legislature\u2019s understanding of both the FPPC\u2019s concern in sponsoring Senate Bill No. 1438 and the impact the legislation was intended to have. (See Sen. Com. Analysis, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1; Assem. Com. Analysis, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1; Sen. Republican Caucus, Dig. of Sen. Bill No. 1438 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 14, 1984; Sen. Democratic Caucus, Dig. of Bill No. 1438 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 14, 1984.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In sum, we construe the proviso in section 83116.5 to mean that administrative sanctions, but not \u201cadditional\u201d civil or criminal liability, may be imposed upon persons with reporting obligations who engage in newly prohibited conduct\u2014aiding and abetting or negligently causing violation\u2014as well as upon persons newly regulated by the Act\u2014those such as campaign managers otherwise compensated for services involving filing and reporting activities. We find no basis for concluding that in so amending the Act the Legislature intended to affect liability outside these circumstances. The Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of section 83116.5 fails to accord with this intent and undermines the rigorous civil and criminal enforcement previously approved by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Nor could the Legislature have eliminated criminal liability for violation of section 84301 without contravening constitutional and statutory constraints on amendment or repeal of the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Article II, section 10, subdivision (c) of the California Constitution provides in part that \u201c[the] Legislature . . . may amend or repeal an initiative statute by another statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors unless the initiative statute permits amendment or repeal without their approval.\u201d The Act authorizes amendment by statute \u201cto further its purposes\u201d (\u00a7 81012, subd. (a)); if not, it \u201cmay be amended or repealed by a statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)). Eliminating criminal liability for money laundering by lobbyists would not further the purpose of the Act and would effectively repeal such sanctions. Either of these circumstances places the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation beyond legislative prerogative.  \u201cWe presume the Legislature did not intend to enact a statute of doubtful validity.\u201d <em>(People v. Simon </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 493, 522 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 886 P.2d 1271].)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Defendant argues in favor of the Court of Appeal judgment but embraces an alternate, somewhat bolder, analysis. According to his interpretation, the Act originally prescribed sanctions for violation of section 84301 against only candidates and treasurers, not lobbyists. With respect to lobbyists, section 83116.5 subsequently imposed administrative liability; only by the passage of Proposition 208 did they incur civil and criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The plain language of the Act categorically contradicts this interpretation. Since its inception, section 84301 has prohibited \u201cany person\u201d from directly or indirectly making a political contribution \u201cin a name other than the name by which such person is identified for legal purposes.\u201d Section 82047 defines \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of the Act as \u201can individual, proprietorship, firm, partnership, joint venture, syndicate, business trust, company, corporation, limited liability company, association, committee, and any other organization or group of persons acting in concert.\u201d (As amended by Stats. 1994, ch. 1010, \u00a7 144.) Section 91000, subdivision (a), provides that \u201c[a]ny person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of this title is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d Beyond cavil, lobbyists have always come within the scope of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In support of his contention that the unqualified reference to \u201cany person\u201d in sections 84301 and 91000 extended only to candidates and treasurers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>defendant cites certain statements by Senator William A. Craven, who introduced Senate Bill No. 1438.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In his introductory remarks, Senator Craven stated in part, \u201cCurrently, only candidates and campaign treasurers can be held accountable for campaign disclosure violations\u2014and errors and omissions are often the result of action taken by campaign managers or consultants, many highly paid, who cannot be held liable under current law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Assuming we may consider the statements of individual legislators in this regard (cf. <em>C-Y Development Co. v. City of Redlands </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 926, 932 [187 Cal.Rptr. 370]; see also <em>ante, </em>fn. 7), we fail to discern any support for defendant\u2019s position in these observations. Money laundering does not violate campaign disclosure obligations but rather campaign contribution restrictions. A candidate could fully comply with his or her reporting mandates while a contributor would remain liable for making the contribution \u201cin a name other than the name by which such person is identified for legal purposes\u201d in violation of section 84301. In approving the Act, the electorate plainly understood lobbyists were among, if not chief among, campaign contributors and included provisions specifically directed to their activities. (See \u00a7 81002, subd. (b); Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (June 4, 1974), argument in favor of Prop. 9, p. 36 [initiative measure adding Act]; Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec., <em>supra, </em>Legis. Counsel, analysis of Prop. 9, p. 34; see also former \u00a7\u00a7 86200, 86202.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In particular, former section 86202 made it \u201cunlawful for a lobbyist to make a contribution, or to act as an agent or intermediary in the making of any contribution, or to arrange for the making of any contribution by himself or by any other person.\u201d (Stats. 1974, p. A-182; see also <em>ante, </em>fn. 8.) The statutory prohibition against money laundering would afford one obvious mechanism for enforcing this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Defendant also extrapolates a limitation on the scope of section 84301 liability as to lobbyists from section 84104, which states, \u201cIt shall be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>duty of each candidate, treasurer and elected officer to maintain such detailed accounts, records, bills and receipts that are necessary to prepare campaign statements and to comply with the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Again, he confuses the more narrow reporting obligations imposed on a select class of individuals, a class that section 83116.5 expanded, with the general prohibition against certain forms of campaign contributions contained in section 84301, which applies broadly and categorically to \u201cany person.\u201d Furthermore, section 84104 was enacted several years after the electorate approved the Act. (See Stats. 1979, ch. 779, \u00a7 6, p. 2663.) It required that certain accounts, bills, records, and receipts formerly kept by candidates, treasurers, and elected officers to expedite performance of campaign disclosure obligations now \u201cbe maintained to prepare campaign statements and to comply with the provisions relating to campaign disclosure.\u201d (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Sen. Bill No. 998, 4 Stats. 1979 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 227.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It thus has no bearing on our construction of section 84301, which was part of the original Act and concerned campaign contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Moreover, defendant\u2019s construction of the statutory scheme disregards the overarching directive that the Act \u201cshould be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes.\u201d (\u00a7 81003.) Among the enumerated purposes, \u201c[t]he activities of lobbyists should be regulated and their finances disclosed in order that improper influences will not be directed at public officials\u201d (\u00a7 81002, subd. (b)), and \u201c[a]dequate enforcement mechanisms should be provided to public officials and private citizens in order that this title will be vigorously enforced\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (f)). Defendant\u2019s crabbed interpretation of \u201cany person\u201d in section 84301 fails to effectuate these directives and finds no support in the Act. (Cf. <em>Calatayud v. State of California </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1057, 1065-1068 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 202, 959 P.2d 360] [legislative history of statute creating exceptions to firefighter\u2019s rule established that reference to \u201cany person\u201d should not be read literally].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Finally, defendant relies on language in <em>McCauley, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 1262. In <em>McCauley, </em>the plaintiff brought a private enforcement action (see \u00a7 81002, subd. (f)) alleging that a political action committee failed to report a contribution in support of a tax initiative. (See \u00a7\u00a7 84101, 84200.) The defendant claimed it had no duty to do so because it had acted in the capacity of a campaign manager and section 84101 on its face imposed reporting responsibilities only upon candidates, treasurers, and elected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>officials. Although section 83116.5 may have expanded these obligations to campaign managers, they could incur only administrative sanctions for any violation. The Court of Appeal agreed to the extent the record established the defendant in fact had acted in the capacity of a campaign manager. (McCauley, <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 1267.) \u201c[A]s a general rule, \u2018violations\u2019 of the Act by persons other than elected officials, candidates, and treasurers under the expanded liability of section 83116.5 can only be addressed in an administrative action, i.e., under the provisions of chapter 4 of the Act, and not by a private cause of action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1268-1269, fn. omitted; see \u00a7 91015.) The court nevertheless reversed the grant of summary judgment because the record disclosed a factual dispute as to whether the defendant had acted as a campaign treasurer and therefore was subject to civil liability for reporting violations under provisions of the Act predating the 1984 amendment. <em>(McCauley, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 1269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Plainly, <em>McCauley </em>affords defendant no assistance. There, the court was considering a violation of the reporting obligations under section 84101 et seq. If, because the defendant functioned as a campaign manager, those obligations did not arise prior to the enactment of section 83116.5, then only administrative sanctions applied. Here, the violation is money laundering under section 84301, a prohibition that at all times imposed criminal liability against \u201cany person,\u201d including defendant. The <em>McCauley </em>court specifically held that section 83116.5 did not alter such preexisting liability. <em>(McCauley, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1268-1269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Defendant also invokes the rule of lenity: \u201cWhen language which is susceptible of two constructions is used in a penal law, the policy of this state is to construe the statute as favorably to the defendant as its language and the circumstance of its application reasonably permit. The defendant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt as to the true interpretation of words or the construction of a statute.\u201d <em>(People v. Overstreet </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 896 [231 Cal.Rptr. 213, 726 P.2d 1288].)  In this case, the rule offers defendant no solace: Under the circumstances, we entertain no doubt that the reference to \u201cany person\u201d in section 84301 should be construed according to its plain and obvious meaning and that nothing in the language or intent of section 83116.5 did or could qualify that meaning. Only by after-the-fact casuistry can defendant claim ignorance of his criminal liability for violation of the Act\u2019s proscription against making campaign contributions in a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">George, C.

To the extent we must consider the question to determine whether the Court of Appeal properly construed section 83116.5, we deem it \u201cfairly included\u201d in the issue on which we granted review. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29.2(b).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The record does not contain the document in which Senator Craven\u2019s statement appears or a letter from him addressed to a Senate committee on which defendant also relies. We deny defendant\u2019s request to augment or correct the record by including these materials (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 12(a)) and find no basis for taking judicial notice (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 452). As discussed in the text, however, even considering the cited documents, we reach the same conclusion as to the proper construction of section 83116.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Former section 86200 defined \u201ccontribution\u201d as that term applied to restrictions on contributions by lobbyists; former section 86202 prohibited lobbyists from making campaign contributions. (Added by Prop. 9; Stats. 1974, p. A-182.) In <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at page 49, this court held former section 86202 unconstitutional as \u201ca substantial limitation on associational freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment . . . .\u201d The Legislature repealed both sections in 1984. (Stats. 1984, ch. 161, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, p. 534.) Neither action alters the fact the electorate contemplate that lobbyists came within the purview of the Act both generally and specifically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We grant the FPPC\u2019s request to take judicial notice of this legislative history material.
