We granted review and limited the issue on review to \u201cwhether the risk of harm required to elevate kidnapping to aggravated kidnapping may be a risk of <em>psychological </em>harm.\u201d (Italics added.) As explained below, we conclude the answer to this question is that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Julie Overacker rented a room in Thomas Savoca\u2019s house in San Jose. As she was unpacking her boxes, Tuan Van Nguyen (defendant) and Binh Nguyen (Binh) walked in. Binh pointed a gun at Savoca\u2019s head and ordered Overacker and S avoca to lie on the floor. Defendant ripped the telephone cord from the wall and used it to bind Savoca. Binh pointed the gun at Overacker and demanded money and jewelry. She complied. Not satisfied, Binh demanded more, pointing the gun at Overacker\u2019s temple. Overacker replied they could take anything in the house. She was led downstairs at gunpoint, at which time she noticed two additional men in the house. Three of the robbers went upstairs while Binh remained to guard Overacker. Overacker heard the three men looking through her belongings. Binh ordered her to close the blinds and turn off the lights. She complied. Binh then led <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Overacker back upstairs and placed her in a closet, while the robbers continued to rummage through the house. Binh announced the robbers would remove her from the house because she did not have anything they wanted. She offered her credit card. Binh declined, but asked whether she had an automatic teller machine (ATM) card. She said she did and was told to retrieve it. Binh also retrieved Savoca\u2019s ATM card, and both victims were made to reveal their personal identification numbers. The robbers then decided to leave Savoca tied up and take Overacker with them to a bank to use the ATM cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">At this point the robbers had been in the house about 45 minutes. Binh, accompanied by defendant, led Overacker out of the house at gunpoint. She could see men carrying things out of the house and loading them into a car. Binh, defendant and Overacker got into Overacker\u2019s green Honda Accord, and the other two robbers followed in a brown hatchback. Once at the bank, Binh ordered Overacker to withdraw \u201call\u201d her money. She withdrew $200 from the ATM, explaining to her assailants that withdrawals were limited to a daily maximum of $200. They returned to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In the meantime, Savoca managed to free himself. He ran towards a neighbor\u2019s home, but hid when he saw Overacker\u2019s car return. When the robbers discovered Savoca was gone, they engaged in much shouting and quickly drove off, with Overacker still in the car. Binh told Overacker, \u201cyour boyfriend got away, he\u2019s very stupid, we told him we\u2019d kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Binh told Overacker to lie under the dashboard of the car and not look up and try to identify him or he would have her killed. She offered that Savoca had probably called the police so they should just let her go. Defendant initiated an animated discussion with his companions, apparently in Vietnamese, which Overacker took to mean he disagreed with her suggestion. They transferred their stolen goods from Overacker\u2019s car to the brown hatchback. Rather than release Overacker, however, the kidnappers forced her to the rear floor of the brown car while one of the robbers covered her eyes with his hands. They went to a convenience store, where the kidnappers engaged in another animated discussion. They eventually gave Overacker some juice and told her to drink it and go to sleep. Fearing the juice was drugged, Overacker pretended to drink and then feigned sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The robbers then drove to a remote wooded area and told Overacker to wake up. Overacker believed they would kill her there. Instead, after another conversation among themselves, the kidnappers told her they would wait until after midnight so they could use the ATM cards again, whereupon they would release her. After midnight, they drove in Overacker\u2019s green Honda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Accord to a different bank, where Binh attempted to use the stolen ATM cards. San Jose Police Officer Tomlin observed the green Honda, obtained confirmation that it belonged to Overacker, and radioed for assistance while he followed the car. When he identified himself, two kidnappers exited the car and ran in opposite directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Because the initial report involved four kidnappers and the green Honda had tinted windows that prevented Officer Tomlin from seeing inside the car, he waited about 45 seconds to ensure no more people would emerge from the car. Satisfied, he approached the car and found it empty except for Overacker, who was lying in a fetal position on the floor. She was \u201c[v]ery distraught . . . crying, shaken.\u201d Officer Tomlin testified he \u201ccould hardly get her out of the car.\u201d He estimated it took \u201cup to two minutes\u201d to coax Overacker from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Defendant was charged, among other felonies, with violating section 209, subdivision (b), kidnapping Overacker for purposes of robbery. In closing argument, the prosecutor spoke to the nature of the compelled movement of the victim: \u201cWhere [the movement] becomes more than slight, brief or trivial is where they take her out of her own house on Palm Sunday, put her in her car, and drive her down to [the bank] to go rob her. [\u00b6] I would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that at that point you have got enough movement at about the time they are out of that house, getting close to the car. The rest is just icing on the cake in that regard. [\u00b6] The movement substantially increased the risk of harm to the person moved over and above that necessarily present in the robbery itself. And that means that you rob a person in their house. Obviously they are in danger. But when you take a person out of their house at gunpoint, you can see by the facts we saw here what can happen. They drove her around for close to two hours. They took her up in the foothills, in the woods someplace. [\u00b6] Does that increase the risk of injury? Of course it does. The risk of harm? Ask Julie Overacker where she comes to that. That\u2019s pretty simple and pretty straightforward. Again, movement in the house, I would submit to you that that\u2019s incidental to the robbery itself. Once you get out of that front door with the intent to go to the ATM, we have kidnap for robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Regarding the aggravated kidnapping charge, the trial court delivered the following instruction: \u201cKidnapping is the unlawful movement by physical force of a person without that person\u2019s consent for a substantial distance where the movement is not merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and <em>where the movement substantially increases the risk of harm to the person moved, over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself </em>[\u00b6] Kidnapping is also the unlawful compulsion of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>person without that person\u2019s consent and because of a reasonable apprehension of harm, to move for a substantial distance where such movement is not merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and where the movement substantially increases the risk of harm to the person moved, over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself. [\u00b6] Brief movements to facilitate the crime of robbery are incidental to the commission of the robbery. [\u00b6] On the other hand, movements to facilitate the robbery that are for a substantial distance ... are not incidental to the commission of the robbery. [\u00b6] In order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] 5. <em>The movement substantially increased the risk of harm to the person moved, over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">After it had retired to deliberate, the jury sent out a question, asking whether the \u201charm\u201d referred to in the phrase \u201cThe movement substantially increased the risk of harm to the person moved\u201d could include \u201cpsychological harm.\u201d The trial court gave this reply: \u201cWebster\u2019s defines harm as physical or mental damage.\u201d The jury found petitioner guilty of aggravated kidnapping as well as the other charged felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">In light of the jury\u2019s question about psychological harm and the trial court\u2019s response, defendant contends the jury may have relied on his infliction of such nonphysical injury to convict him of aggravated kidnapping. Because he contends section 209 is limited to forced movements of the victim that substantially increase the risk of bodily or physical harm only, he argues we must reverse his conviction for aggravated kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">In 1995, at the time defendant committed his crime, section 209, subdivision (b) provided: \u201cAny person who kidnaps or carries away any individual to commit robbery shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with possibility of parole.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 55, \u00a7 3, p. 394.) Although the statute at that time had no express requirement that movement of the victim substantially increase the risk of harm to the victim, we held in 1969 that implicit in the history of section 209 was a requirement that\u2014in order to constitute an aggravated kidnapping\u2014the movement (or asportation) of the victim (1) could not be incidental to the robbery, and (2) must \u201csubstantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d <em>(People v. Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119, 1139 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677] <em>(Daniels); </em>see generally <em>People v. Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1, 14-19 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369] [recounting the history of the <em>Daniels </em>rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>In 1997, the Legislature made this implicit requirement explicit, so that section 209, subdivision (b) now provides: \u201c(1) Any person who kidnaps or carries away any individual to commit robbery [or other enumerated crimes] shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with possibility of parole, [\u00b6] (2) <em>This subdivision shall only apply if the movement of the victim is beyond that merely incidental to the commission of and increases the risk of harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in, the intended underlying </em>offense.\u201d (\u00a7 209, as amended by Stats. 1997, ch. 817, \u00a7 2, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The first step in our analysis is to examine the actual words of the statute, giving to them a commonsense meaning. <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 633 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175]; <em>Mercer v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 753, 763 [280 Cal.Rptr. 745, 809 P.2d 404].)  As indicated, however, in 1995, at the time defendant committed his crime, section 209, subdivision (b) did not expressly require any type of harm. Considering the 1995 version of section 209, subdivision (b) together with <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, is no more illuminating, for although <em>Daniels </em>interpreted the statute to require an increased risk of harm, it did not distinguish for that purpose between bodily and psychological harm. Nor did the 1997 amendment to section 209 clarify matters: the Legislature adopted and codified the <em>Daniels </em>rule, but the amended statute does not indicate on its face whether the harm required for an aggravated kidnapping embraces psychological harm or whether only physical or bodily harm will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">lust as the actual words of the statute do not resolve this problem, an examination of <em>post-Daniels </em>case law is similarly unhelpful. Defendant relies on <em>People v. Timmons </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 411 [93 Cal.Rptr. 736, 482 P.2d 648] <em>(Timmons). </em>In <em>Timmons, </em>we addressed whether a substantial increase in the risk of harm to the victims occurred when the defendants forced them to drive five blocks to effectuate their robbery. We concluded \u201cthis brief asportation may conceivably have increased the risk in some slight degree beyond that inherent in the commission of the robberies, but it cannot be said to have \u2018substantially\u2019 increased that risk.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 416, fn. omitted.) In reaching this conclusion, we described the rule in <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, stating that when <em>Daniels </em>referred to a movement that \u201c \u2018substantially increase^] the risk of harm,\u2019 \u201d \u201cwe intended to refer to an increase in the risk that the victim may suffer significant <em>physical injuries </em>over and above those to which a victim of the underlying crime is normally exposed.\u201d <em>(Timmons, supra, </em>at p. 414, italics added.) Subsequent opinions also spoke in terms of physical harm. (See, e.g., <em>In re Earley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 122, 128, fn. 7 [120 Cal.Rptr. 881, 534 P.2d 721]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 588, 598 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>[114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 522 P.2d 1058], overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 237 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Milan </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 185, 192-193 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956].) Defendant thus urges that <em>Timmons </em>suggests the risk to which <em>Daniels </em>refers is limited to a risk of <em>physical </em>injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">By contrast, the People rely on <em>People v. Laursen </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 192 [104 Cal.Rptr. 425, 501 P.2d 1145] <em>(Laursen). </em>In that case, defendant Laursen and a companion committed an armed robbery and then fled the scene. When their getaway car failed to start, the robbers commandeered a car driven by Teeter, forcing him to drive them to a place of safety. Upon Laursen\u2019s conviction of kidnapping for robbery, he claimed on appeal that Teeter\u2019s kidnap, committed while Laursen had attempted to escape from the site of the robbery, did not come within the terms of the aggravated kidnapping statute because his intent to kidnap Teeter arose after the robbery had already begun. In rejecting that contention, we described the rule of <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, noting, \u201cthe primary purpose of [section 209] is to impose harsher criminal sanctions to deter the carrying away of persons during the commission of a robbery in a manner which substantially increases the risk that someone will suffer grave bodily <em>or psychic injury </em>or even death.\u201d <em>(Laursen, supra, </em>at p. 198, italics added.) The People thus assert <em>Laursen </em>recognizes that the risk to which <em>Daniels </em>refers can include a risk of <em>psychological </em>injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Neither <em>Timmons, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 411, nor <em>Laursen, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 192, addressed the precise question of whether a substantially increased risk of psychological injury, in the absence of a similarly increased risk of physical injury, can satisfy the <em>Daniels </em>test. Accordingly, any comment the cases made concerning the type of harm required by <em>Daniels </em>was unnecessary to their respective decisions and, thus, dicta. <em>(Mercury Ins. Group v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, 348 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 965 P.2d 1178] [\u201cA decision, of course, is not authority for what it does not consider\u201d]; <em>In re Marriage of Cornejo </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 381, 388 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 81, 916 P.2d 476] [\u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 482, fn. 7 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580].)\u201d (Fn. omitted.)].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">To our knowledge, the question of psychological versus physical harm occurring in the context of aggravated kidnapping has specifically been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>addressed only once, still only in dictum. This was in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in the infamous Chowchilla kidnapping case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schoenfeld </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 671 [168 Cal.Rptr. 762] <em>(Schoenfeld).) </em>In that case, the three defendants confined the kidnapped bus driver and children in a van buried in a quarry. A hole had been cut in the roof of the van to allow ingress and egress, and holes had been cut in the fenders to serve as rudimentary toilets. Battery-powered fans supplied air through flexible hoses connected to four-inch holes cut into the walls of the van. Water and some food were provided. The kidnappers told the children they would stay in their underground prison for 24 to 48 hours. After all the victims had been lowered into the van, a steel plate was placed over the roof opening and weights were placed on it. Fortunately, through the heroic efforts of the bus driver and some of the older children, all the victims escaped with only minor physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The defendants in <em>Schoenfeld </em>were charged with 27 counts of kidnapping for ransom and with five counts alleging the victims therein suffered \u201cbodily harm.\u201d <em>(Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at p. 675; former \u00a7 209; see now \u00a7 209, subd. (a).) They pleaded guilty to kidnapping, but reserved the right to contest the disputed allegations of bodily harm in a bifurcated hearing before the court. After the hearing, the trial court found that three of the victims had suffered bodily harm; accordingly, the court sentenced the defendants to life in prison without possibility of parole on those three counts. On appeal, the Court of Appeal struck the findings of bodily harm and the related determination of parole ineligibility but otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">In rejecting the trial court\u2019s determination of bodily injury, the Court of Appeal observed that, while every kidnapping for purposes of ransom necessarily involves some form of physical restraint, \u201cit is the introduction of substantial <em>bodily </em>harm or injury\u2014not the physical restraint\u2014which triggers the augmented penalty.\u201d <em>(Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at p. 687.) The court noted the evidence showed the victims suffered only minor physical ailments, such as scrapes, nosebleeds and stomachaches. None of these \u201ctransient physical distresses,\u201d the court concluded, \u201camounted to serious or substantial bodily injuries.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Addressing the trial court\u2019s stated view that the total experience \u201cconstituted \u2018an ordeal of terror, . . . [which] . . . causes suffering .... And suffering to me is what this statute is all about\u2019 \u201d <em>(Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at p. 680), the Court of Appeal stated: \u201cNo rational person could doubt that the combined effect of such difficult and trying circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>together with the level of fear generated during the long hours of dark confinement, would cause <em>all </em>of the imprisoned victims\u2014especially the youngest\u2014to undergo great <em>mental </em>suffering or <em>emotional </em>harm implied in the findings below. But as the cases which have grappled with the amorphous concept of \u2018bodily harm\u2019 in a variety of factual contexts teach[], something more than emotional trauma or mental or psychological harm, typically associated with all forms of involuntary restraint and confinement, is required in order to justify the harsher mandatory penalty ....</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">\u201cThough it is debatable that no meaningful distinction exists in human terms between trauma-inflicted pain and suffering as opposed to fright-induced mental anxiety and emotional distress, the latter is not the functional equivalent of a substantial bodily injury due to the application of a physical force beyond that necessarily involved in the forcible restraint itself. The trial court compounded its error in mechanically equating the statutory objective with any level or kind of \u2018suffering.\u2019 But as discussed herein, it appears eminently more reasonable to conclude that <em>all </em>kidnapings involve some degree of suffering insofar as mental distress or emotional harm is relatively manifested. If, as the People contend, such evidence alone (with or without minor physical symptoms) is sufficient, then conceptually every forcible restraint and confinement would be automatically subject to the augmented penalty without the essential showing of substantial bodily injury. Such an unreasonable result would totally defeat the dual purpose of preventing physical harm to the victim and providing an added penalty for the more abhorrent criminal conduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>[(1955)] 44 Cal.2d [511,] 517 [282 P.2d 898].)\u201d <em>(Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pp. 687-688, italics in original, underscoring added, fns. omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">As may be seen, <em>Schoenfeld </em>is inapposite. Whereas in <em>Schoenfeld </em>the court was concerned with the express statutory requirement that, to render a defendant convicted of kidnapping for ransom ineligible for parole, the victim must have suffered serious \u201cbodily harm\u201d <em>(Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pp. 682, 685), here we are dealing with the requirement that, for a kidnapping for robbery to qualify as an aggravated kidnapping, the asportation of the victim must substantially increase the \u201crisk of harm\u201d to the victim <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1139). That the injuries to the victims in <em>Schoenfeld </em>did not qualify as \u201cbodily harm\u201d for purposes of the increased penalty has no bearing on whether the asportation of the victims increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>their \u201crisk of harm.\u201d Indeed, one could readily conclude the victims did suffer such increased risk of harm, both mental and physical (including, e.g., dehydration, starvation, suffocation, a cave-in, or physical injuries suffered while trying to escape). (See generally <em>People v. Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 13.) Accordingly, <em>Schoenfeld </em>is not authority for concluding the risk of harm requirement of section 209, subdivision (b) is limited to movement increasing the risk only of physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Just as an examination of precedent provides no definitive answer, scrutiny of the legislative evolution of section 209 does not reveal whether a risk of psychological harm is encompassed within the <em>Daniels </em>rule. Section 207, originally enacted in 1872, delineated what is today called \u201csimple kidnapping\u201d and merely restated the common law, which required that the victim be moved across county or state lines. <em>(People v. Wein </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 383, 414 [326 P.2d 457] (dis. opn. of Carter, J.), overruled in part by <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1225 [277 Cal.Rptr. 382] <em>(Ordonez).) </em>The first aggravated kidnapping statute, section 209, was enacted in 1901; it provided that one who \u201cmaliciously, forcibly, or fraudulently takes or entices away any person with intent to restrain such person and thereby to commit extortion or robbery, or exact from the relatives or friends of such person any money or valuable thing, is guilty of a felony, and shall be punished therefor by imprisonment in the state\u2019s prison for life, or any number of years not less than ten.\u201d (Stats. 1901, ch. 83, \u00a7 1, p. 98; quoted in <em>People v. Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 194 [217 P.2d 1] (dis. opn. of Edmonds, J.).) At that early time, the offense included no requirement that the individual kidnapped for robbery be harmed or endure the risk or threat of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In the wake of the nation\u2019s heightened concern over kidnappings for ransom occasioned by the infamous abduction of the Lindbergh baby, this state in 1933 followed the enactment of the Federal Kidnaping Act (the so-called Lindbergh Law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with an amendment to section 209. Twice amended in 1933, section 209 eventually read: \u201cEvery person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>who seizes, confines, inveigles, entices, decoys, abducts, conceals, kidnaps or carries away any individual by any means whatsoever with intent to hold or detain, or who <em>holds or detains, </em>such individual for ransom, reward or to commit extortion or robbery or to exact from relatives or friends of such person any money or valuable thing, or who aids or abets any such act, is guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall suffer death or shall be punished by imprisonment in the State prison for life without possibility of parole, at the discretion of the jury trying the same, in cases in which the person or persons subjected to such kidnaping <em>suffers or suffer bodily harm </em>or shall be punished by imprisonment in the State prison for life with possibility of parole in cases where such person or persons do not <em>suffer bodily harm.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1933, ch. 1025, \u00a7 1, pp. 2617-2618, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">As explained in <em>Ordonez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at page 1226: \u201cThe 1933 amendment omitted [as a requirement] the element of asportation which the Lindbergh Law had included, and it increased the penalty to death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the victim suffered bodily harm. Thus, California law, like the federal law, tied the severity of the penalty to the harm suffered by the victim. \u2018Both the federal and California Supreme Courts recognized the augmented penalty\u2019s purpose to deter the kidnaper from harming his victim, to induce him to release the victim unharmed.\u2019 <em>(In re Maston </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 559, 563 [109 Cal.Rptr. 164], citing <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1945) 324 U.S. 282, 284 [89 L.Ed. 944, 946, 65 S.Ct. 666]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson[, supra,] </em>44 Cal.2d 511, 517 . . . .)\u201d (See also <em>People v. Knowles, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at p. 180 [discussing abandonment of the asportation requirement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In short, the 1933 amendment to section 209 changed the crime of aggravated kidnapping to include, for the first time, the concept of harm to the victim, linking that concept to the severity of the penalty. In so doing, the amendment spoke specifically of \u201cbodily harm.\u201d (Stats. 1933, ch. 1025, \u00a7 1, p. 2618.)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Section 209 was amended again in 1951 to reintroduce asportation as a requirement for kidnapping for robbery. (Stats. 1951, ch. 1749, \u00a7 1, p. 4167.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>The Legislature, however, retained the previous statutory language making \u201cbodily harm\u201d a prerequisite for the death penalty (or life imprisonment without possibility of parole): <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In 1973, the Legislature again amended section 209, this time providing for a mandatory death penalty in the event the victim died during an aggravated kidnapping. (Stats. 1973, ch. 719, \u00a7 8, p. 1300; see generally <em>Ordonez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1226 &amp; fn. 10.) As before, the Legislature retained the mandatory higher penalty of life imprisonment without parole in cases where the victim suffers \u201cbodily harm.\u201d (Stats. 1973, ch. 719, \u00a7 8, p. 1300.) (The Legislature subsequently abolished the mandatory death penalty for aggravated kidnapping resulting in death [Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7 15, p. 1262], instead making the death penalty merely permissive under those circumstances [former \u00a7 190.2, subd. (c)(3)(ii); see Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7 9, pp. 1257-1258].)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">In 1976, as part of the reorganization and rewriting of penal statutes that resulted from the enactment of the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 350, p. 5175), section 209 was reconfigured, segregating the crime of kidnapping for ransom, extortion or reward into subdivision (a) of the section and that of kidnapping for robbery into subdivision (b). (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 136.5, p. 5099.) This division of crimes made sense because kidnapping for ransom, extortion or reward does not require the kidnappers forcibly to move the victim, whereas since the 1951 amendment to the statute, kidnapping for robbery has required such movement. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 12, fn. 8; <em>Ordonez, supra, 226 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 1226-1227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">For the section 209, subdivision (a) crimes (kidnapping for ransom, extortion or reward), the statutory language linking \u201cbodily harm\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>higher penalty of life imprisonment without possibility of parole was retained. The new subdivision (b) of section 209, by contrast, made no reference to bodily harm, nor did it retain the increased penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. That subdivision merely stated: \u201cAny person who kidnaps or carries away any individual to commit robbery shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with possibility of parole.\u201d (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 136.5, p. 5099.) In other words, by its terms the statute did not carry over to the crime of kidnapping for robbery, now set forth in new section 209, subdivision (b), a linkage of \u201cbodily harm\u201d with an increased penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The Legislature\u2019s failure, in new section 209, subdivision (b), to retain the concept of \u201cbodily harm\u201d in connection with the required asportation seems deliberate. In separating out kidnapping for robbery from kidnapping for ransom or extortion, the Legislature also eliminated any possibility of a sentence of life without parole for the former crime. Consequently, no justification appears for retaining, in the definition of \u201charm\u201d for asportation, the requirement of section 209, subdivision (a) that only <em>bodily </em>harm would suffice. That is, that the Legislature has long provided greater punishment for aggravated kidnappers (or at least some aggravated kidnappers) who cause bodily harm to their victims does not necessarily mean the Legislature also intended to confine <em>the asportation element </em>of kidnapping for robbery to cases where the forced movement has increased the risk of physical injury, and to render irrelevant an increased risk of mental, emotional or psychological harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Rather, the more plausible conclusion is that when it separately criminalized the act of kidnapping to commit robbery, the Legislature intended to target coerced movement resulting in an increased risk either of grave physical injury or of mental terror. This conclusion is consistent with <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119. Although the <em>Daniels </em>court was concerned with the asportation element of kidnapping, it first discussed the element of bodily harm, proof of which was required for an enhanced penalty. In discussing the meaning of \u201cbodily harm\u201d for purposes of enhanced punishment, the court quoted <em>People v. Tanner </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 279, 297 [44 P.2d 324] to the effect that \u201cbodily\u201d pertains to the body: \u201c \u2018It is opposed to mental,\u2019 \u201d whereas \u201charm\u201d \u201c \u2018is defined as \u201churt; injury; damage; (2) grief, pain, sorrow . . . <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>at p. 1132.) Although the <em>Daniels </em>court noted that in <em>People v. Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 511, we modified <em>Tanner </em>to require <em>substantial </em>bodily harm for purposes of an enhanced penalty <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>at p. 1133), neither <em>Jackson </em>nor <em>Daniels </em>rejected the <em>Tanner </em>court\u2019s understanding of the meaning of \u201charm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Having thus expressly recognized that the word \u201charm,\u201d standing alone, could include mental suffering, the <em>Daniels </em>court, in requiring a substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>increased risk of harm for the asportation element of kidnapping for the purpose of robbery, logically must have intended that requirement to be satisfied by a substantially increased risk of either physical <em>or </em>mental harm. Viewed in this light, substantial movement of a victim, by force or fear, which poses a substantial increase in the risk of psychological trauma to the victim beyond that to be expected from a stationary robbery, seems an entirely legitimate basis for finding a separate offense. To conclude the word \u201charm,\u201d as used in section 209, subdivision (b), includes psychological harm is thus reasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   Accordingly, the Court of Appeal did not err in affirming defendant\u2019s conviction of kidnapping for robbery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The decision of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">George, C.

The record indicates Overacker was forcibly removed from her new home at gunpoint, driven against her will to her bank, then to a convenience store, then to an isolated place in the woods and, finally, to a second bank. Not only was she emotionally terrorized to the point of being physically paralyzed when she was rescued by Officer Tomlin, she was told to drink juice she believed to be poisoned and she reasonably believed her abductors took her to an isolated place in the woods to kill her. That she escaped relatively unscathed physically is beside the point; the evidence shows defendant moved her a substantial distance and that such movement substantially increased the risk to her of both psychological <em>and </em>physical harm.

Daniels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">As the majority explains, before 1997, section 209 did not expressly specify as a requirement that the movement of the victim increased the risk of harm. We first announced this requirement in <em>People v. Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677] <em>(Daniels). </em>There, we held that \u201cthe intent of the Legislature in amending . . . section 209 in 1951 was to exclude from its reach not only \u2018standstill\u2019 robberies [citation] but also those in which the movements of the victim are merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself. (See Note, <em>Room-to-Room Movement: A Risk Rationale for Aggravated Kidnaping </em>(1959) 11 Stan.L.Rev. 554, 555; Note, A <em>Rationale of the Law of Kidnapping </em>(1953) Colum.L.Rev. 540, 554-557.)\u201d <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Although our <em>Daniels </em>opinion does not speak clearly to the issue now before us, for two reasons I conclude that <em>Daniels </em>requires an increased risk of physical or bodily harm, and that an increased risk of only psychological harm is insufficient. First, the two law review articles we cited as authority for our holding support this conclusion. The sole focus of the first article is the history, construction, and application of section 209. (Note, <em>Room-to-Room Movement: A Risk Rationale for Aggravated Kidnapping </em>(1959) 11 Stan. L.Rev. 554 (hereafter <em>Room-to-Room Movement).) </em>The page of the article <em>Daniels </em>cites identifies the justification for section 209\u2019s harsh penalties as \u201ca substantial risk of <em>bodily </em>harm\u201d and \u201can express threat of death or great <em>bodily </em>injury.\u201d <em>(Room-to-Room Movement, supra, </em>11 Stan. L.Rev. at p. 555, italics added.) Nowhere on the cited page or anywhere else in the article is there even a reference to psychological harm. The second article considers the law of kidnapping generally, including the justification for making kidnapping a separate crime. (Note, A <em>Rationale of the Law of Kidnapping </em>(1953) 53 Colum. L.Rev. 540.) The portion of the article <em>Daniels </em>cites concludes by asserting that a separate kidnapping offense should be limited to kidnapping for ransom, which alone involves \u201cconduct which ... is invariably of a highly dangerous order. In ransom kidnappings the means by which the victim is subjugated must almost inevitably be forcible; the victim must be subdued for a period of time sufficient to allow the defendant to demand and secure the ransom, and the accomplishment of the defendant\u2019s purpose involves at least a <em>threat to harm or kill the </em>captive.\u201d (Note, A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number><em>Rationale of the Law of Kidnapping, supra, </em>53 Colum. L.Rev. at p. 557, italics added.) In context, the referenced \u201cthreat to harm\u201d logically refers to a threat to inflict <em>bodily </em>harm, which is the kind of harm kidnappers threaten in order to accomplish their purpose, i.e., payment of ransom. Thus, our reliance in <em>Daniels </em>on these articles strongly suggests we were referring to an increased risk of only <em>bodily </em>harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Second, my conclusion is consistent with both the analysis in <em>Daniels </em>and the very existence of its \u201cincreased risk of harm\u201d requirement. In <em>Daniels, </em>we relied in part on <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 511 [282 P.2d 898] <em>(Jackson). </em>There, we refused broadly to construe the term \u201cbodily harm,\u201d reasoning: \u201cIf the more serious penalty [under section 209] may be imposed when the only injury is of a nature similar to that shown by the present record, <em>which concededly is almost necessarily an incident to every forcible kidnapping, </em>neither the purpose of enhancement of the penalty for the more heinous crime nor the intention of deterring the kidnaper from killing or injuring his victim is subserved.\u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 517, italics added.) After quoting this passage, we explained in <em>Daniels: </em>\u201cJust as we recognized in <em>Jackson </em>that some minor injuries are necessarily incidental to the crime of forcible kidnapping, so we now recognize that some brief movements are necessarily incidental to the crime of armed robbery. Indeed, \u2018It is difficult to conceive a situation in which the victim of a robbery does not make some movement under the duress occasioned by force or fear.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1134.) Similarly, <em>every </em>movement that is not incidental' to a robbery inflicts <em>actual </em>and <em>significant </em>emotional harm, unless the victim is unaware of or cannot understand what is happening. (See <em>People v. Wolcott </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 92, 1081 [192 Cal.Rptr. 748, 665 P.2d 520]; <em>People v. Schoenfeld </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 671, 687 [168 Cal.Rptr. 762].) Thus, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the second requirement <em>Daniels </em>announced\u2014a substantially increased risk of harm\u2014is effectively no requirement at all. The <em>Daniels </em>requirement only has meaning if it refers to the risk of bodily harm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">I disagree with the majority that, having \u201cexpressly recognized\u201d the word \u201charm\u201d could include mental suffering, the <em>Daniels </em>court \u201clogically must have intended\u201d that the statutory requirement can \u201cbe satisfied by a substantially increased risk of either physical <em>or </em>mental harm.\u201d (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 885-886, original italics.) For this conclusion, the majority relies on our quotation in <em>Daniels </em>of a passage from <em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>279, 297 [44 P.2d 324] <em>(Tanner), </em>which stated in part: \u201cHarm is defined as \u2018hurt; injury; damage; (2) grief, pain, sorrow; (3) evil; wrong; wickedness.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 885; <em>Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1132.) However, <em>Tanner </em>addressed a completely different issue of section 209\u2019s construction: the meaning of the term \u201cbodily harm\u201d in the statute\u2019s punishment provision. <em>(Tanner, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d at p. 297.) Moreover, in <em>Daniels, </em>soon after quoting what \u201c[t]he court. . . said\u201d in <em>Tanner, </em>we explained that <em>Jackson </em>\u201creconsidered the matter\u201d and concluded: \u201c \u2018[I]t is seriously questionable whether the definition in the <em>Tanner </em>case states the intention of the Legislature ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1133.) Thus, <em>Daniels </em>did <em>not </em>endorse the cited <em>Tanner </em>discussion, but cited its subsequent <em>rejection </em>in <em>Jackson </em>only to demonstrate that we may properly reconsider and overrule our prior cases interpreting section 209 despite legislative silence. <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1134.) When we later held in <em>Daniels </em>that a substantially increased risk of harm is necessary for a section 209 conviction, we were not referring back to Tanner\u2019s definition of harm, which appeared much earlier in the <em>Daniels </em>opinion in an entirely unrelated discussion and which, as <em>Daniels </em>recognized, <em>Jackson </em>had rejected. Rather, as I have explained, we were referring to the risk of <em>bodily </em>harm discussed in the two law review articles we specifically cited in establishing this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Indeed, were the majority correct that we were referring to Tanner\u2019s subsequently rejected definition of harm, an increased risk of evil, wrong, wickedness, sorrow, or grief\u2014terms that also appeared in the quoted <em>Tanner </em>definition\u2014would be sufficient. I do not believe <em>Daniels </em>meant to construe section 209 so broadly. Moreover, it appears that the very source <em>Tanner </em>used to define the word \u201charm\u201d indicated that the definition on which the majority relies\u2014grief, pain, sorrow\u2014was obsolete, i.e., it had disappeared from current usage. (Webster's New Internat. Dict. (2d ed. 1948) pp. xcv, 1139.) Thus, the <em>Daniels </em>passage the majority cites does not support its conclusion that a substantially increased risk of psychological harm is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">II. <em>Decisions Applying Daniels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">According to the majority, our <em>post-Daniels </em>cases are \u201cunhelpful\u201d in determining the issue in this case. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 878.) I disagree; our decisions actually applying <em>Daniels </em>to determine whether the evidence sustains a conviction under section 209 strongly support the conclusion that a substantially increased risk of psychological harm does <em>not </em>satisfy the second <em>Daniels </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Our first significant decision in this regard was <em>People </em>v. <em>Timmons </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 411 [93 Cal.Rptr. 736, 482 P.2d 648] <em>(Timmons), </em>which we decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>only 15 months after <em>Daniels. </em>The sole issue in <em>Timmons </em>was whether the evidence showed that the defendant committed \u201cconduct proscribed by . . . section 209 as we construed it in <em>Daniels.\u201d (Timmons, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 414.) Applying the <em>Daniels </em>two-part test, we first found that the five-block movement of the defendant\u2019s victims \u201cwas \u2018incidental to the commission of the robbery.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Timmons, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 414.) Applying \u201cthe second branch of the <em>Daniels </em>test,\u201d we explained: \u201c[W]e recognize that . . . the movement of the car also increased the likelihood that the victims would be robbed. But that risk is not what we meant in <em>Daniels </em>[citation] when we spoke of movements which \u2018substantially increase the risk of harm\u2019 beyond that inherent in the underlying crime. Rather, we intended to refer to an increase in the risk that the victim may suffer significant <em>physical </em>injuries over and above those to which a victim of the underlying crime is normally exposed.\u201d <em>(Timmons, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 414, italics added, fn. omitted.) Applying this standard, we concluded in <em>Timmons </em>that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not meet the <em>Daniels </em>test. <em>(Timmons, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 415-416.) We reached this conclusion even though the defendant moved his victims to \u201ca place where it would be more difficult for them to raise an immediate alarm\u201d and he could rob them \u201cwith less danger of detection\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 414), which surely substantially increased the risk they would suffer psychological harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">In subsequent decisions, we have consistently applied <em>Daniels </em>as we did in <em>Timmons, </em>i.e., as requiring that the movement substantially increased the risk of <em>physical </em>harm. In <em>People v. Beamon </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 625, 636 [105 Cal.Rptr. 681, 504 P.2d 905], we rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a section 209 conviction, explaining: \u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Timmons </em>[citation] we stated that the <em>Daniels </em>risk-of-harm test referred \u2018to an increase in the risk that the victim may suffer significant physical injuries over and above those to which the victim of the underlying crime is normally exposed.\u2019 [Citation.] There was present here by reason of the abduction a material increase in the risk that the victim would suffer significant physical injuries . . . .\u201d In <em>People v. Milan </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 185, 192 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956], we again quoted <em>Timmons's </em>statement that an increased risk of \u201c \u2018significant physical injuries\u2019 \u201d is necessary for a section 209 conviction. We then affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction because the asportation \u201cgave rise to dangers, not inherent in robbery, that a traffic collision would occur and that as a result of the motion of the car the gun [held to the victim\u2019s head] would accidentally discharge.\u201d <em>(People v. Milan, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at p. 193.) In <em>In re Crumpton </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 463, 467 [106 Cal.Rptr. 770, 507 P.2d 74], we overturned a section 209 conviction in part because the movement of the victim did not substantially increase the risk of \u201cphysical harm\u201d or \u201cphysical assault.\u201d In <em>People v. Stanworth </em>(1974) 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Cal.3d 588, 598 [114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 522 P.2d 1058], disapproved on another ground in <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 237 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512] <em>(Martinez), </em>we reversed a conviction under section 209, applying the <em>Timmons </em>formulation of the <em>Daniels </em>test and finding \u201cno evidence\u201d the asportation \u201csubstantially increased the risk . . . [the victim] would suffer <em>physical </em>harm.\u201d (11 Cal.3d at p. 598, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In <em>In re Earley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 122 [120 Cal.Rptr. 881, 534 P.2d 721] <em>(Earley), </em>we applied <em>Daniels </em>in considering a habeas corpus petition challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a section 209 conviction. We explained that in this context, the defendant could obtain relief only if \u201cas a matter of law\u201d his conduct did not violate section 209 \u201cas construed\u201d in <em>Daniels. (Earley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 125.) Thus, we had \u201cto consider the exact nature of the <em>Daniels </em>test.\u201d <em>(Earley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 126.) As to the \u201cincreased risk of harm\u201d requirement, we quoted <em>Timmons </em>in stating that this requirement \u201c \u2018refers to the risk created by the victim\u2019s movements that he will \u201csuffer significant physical injuries over and above those to which a victim of the underlying crime is normally exposed\u201d; . . . [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Earley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 131.) Applying this rule, we upheld the conviction, finding \u201cthat the asportation gave rise to dangers, not inherent in robbery, that an auto accident might occur or that the victim might attempt to escape from the moving car or be pushed therefrom by [the defendant].\u201d <em>(Earley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 132.) We also expressly endorsed both a 1973 CALJIC instruction that used the \u201c \u2018significant physical injuries\u2019 \u201d formulation <em>(Earley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 128, fn. 8) and a statement from Justice Mosk\u2019s dissent in an earlier decision that the movement must \u201c \u2018substantially increase[] the risk of physical harm to the victim . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 128, fn. 7 &amp; accompanying text.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Finally, in <em>People v. Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369] <em>(Rayford), </em>we applied section 209\u2019s asportation requirement in an appeal from a conviction under section 208 for kidnapping with the intent to commit rape. We first held that section 209\u2019s asportation requirement governs in prosecutions under section 208. <em>(Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 20-21.) We then rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence failed to establish this requirement, stating: \u201cThe jury here applied the <em>Daniels </em>test to find that defendant moved [the victim] a \u2018substantial distance\u2019 and that this movement \u2018substantially increased\u2019 her risk of <em>physical </em>injury \u2018over and above those to which such person is normally exposed in the commission of the crime of rape.\u2019 <em>Applying the same test, </em>we conclude that the evidence of asportation in this case was sufficient to support the kidnapping conviction.\u201d <em>(Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 23, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">These decisions demonstrate that under <em>Daniels, </em>a substantially increased risk of physical harm is necessary to sustain defendant\u2019s section 209 conviction, and that a substantially increased risk of only psychological harm is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>insufficient. In each of them, we had to determine whether the evidence satisfied the <em>Daniels </em>requirements for a conviction under section 209 (or a statute incorporating its asportation requirement). In each of them, we specifically referred only to an increased risk of <em>physical </em>harm. In none of them did we look to the risk of psychological harm, even though doing so might have resulted in affirmance rather than reversal. Thus, the majority\u2019s conclusion is inconsistent with our subsequent construction and application of <em>Daniels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Although citing some (but not all) of these decisions, the majority, with little analysis, declines to follow them. Instead, the majority asserts that because <em>Timmons </em>did not address the \u201cprecise question\u201d of whether a substantially increased risk of psychological harm is alone sufficient under <em>Daniels, </em>its unequivocal statement of the need for an increased risk of <em>physical </em>injury was \u201cunnecessary . . . and, thus, dicta.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 879.) Similarly, in a footnote, the majority summarily casts aside the other decisions I have cited, asserting that the question of physical versus psychological harm \u201cwas not posed\u201d in them. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 879, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The majority is incorrect. As I have explained, in <em>Timmons </em>and the other cited cases, we had to decide whether the evidence at trial actually established the <em>Daniels </em>requirement that the movement substantially increased the risk of harm. Were the risk of psychological injury relevant to this question, we certainly would have discussed that risk, especially before reversing convictions for insufficient evidence. But we never even mentioned the risk of psychological injury, and instead focused <em>exclusively </em>on the increased risk of <em>physical </em>harm. Thus, even were the majority correct that none of the decisions I have cited \u201cdirectly mention[s] the point\u201d we are considering here, each, \u201con its facts, necessarily stands as a direct authority on the question.\u201d <em>(Bank of Italy etc. Assn. v. Bentley </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 644, 650 [20 P.2d 940]; see also <em>Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 734-735 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406] [\u201c \u2018the language of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts presented by the case, and the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts\u2019 \u201d].) The majority, therefore, errs in characterizing the statement in <em>Timmons </em>as dictum and in declining to follow <em>Timmons </em>and the other cases I have discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Of course, even under the majority\u2019s mistaken view that our statement in <em>Timmons </em>was dictum, \u201cit does not follow that\u201d the statement should <em>necessarily </em>\u201cbe discarded.\u201d <em>(San Joaquin etc. Irr. Co. v. Stanislaus </em>(1908) 155 Cal. 21, 28 [99 P. 365].) We often follow dicta, especially dicta in which courts have \u201clong acquiesce[d].\u201d <em>(In re Garner </em>(1918) 179 Cal. 409, 411 [177 P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>162], disapproved on another ground in <em>In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 424, fn. 15 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921].) The majority offers no persuasive reason for declining to follow our decisions that for almost 30 years have construed and applied <em>Daniels </em>to require a substantially increased risk of <em>physical </em>harm. Indeed, as I explain in this opinion, those decisions are, in fact, consistent with both <em>Daniels </em>and section 209\u2019s history. The majority\u2019s conclusion is consistent with neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The majority is correct, however, in declining to rely on <em>People v. Laursen </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 192 [104 Cal.Rptr. 425, 501 P.2d 1145] <em>(Laursen), </em>which the Attorney General cites. There, we stated: \u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>[citation], we held \u2018that the intent of the Legislature in amending . . . section 209 in 1951 was to exclude from its reach not only \u201cstandstill\u201d robberies [citation omitted] but also those in which the movements of the victim are merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, the primary purpose of the statute is to impose harsher criminal sanctions to deter the carrying away of persons during the commission of a robbery in a manner which substantially increases the risk that someone will suffer grave bodily or psychic injury or even death.\u201d <em>(Laursen, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 198.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">For several reasons, the Attorney General\u2019s reliance on <em>Laursen </em>is unpersuasive. First, as the majority correctly explains, the statement the Attorney General cites was unnecessary to the <em>Laursen </em>decision. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 879.) The defendant in <em>Laursen </em>contended that for a section 209 violation, an intent to kidnap must exist before the robbery begins and the movement of the victim must occur before the robbery\u2019s completion. <em>(Laursen, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 198.) To resolve this contention, we did not need to consider\u2014 and, in fact, did not consider\u2014whether an increased risk of psychological harm satisfies section 209\u2019s asportation requirement. In this crucial regard, <em>Laursen </em>is different from the cases I have discussed above, in which we had to determine whether the evidence satisfied section 209\u2019s asportation requirement. Second, <em>Laursen </em>offered no analysis for its statement about section 209\u2019s purpose; it analyzed neither <em>Daniels </em>nor the statute\u2019s legislative history. Third, other statements in <em>Laursen </em>support the conclusion that a substantially increased risk of psychological harm is <em>not </em>sufficient under <em>Daniels </em>to sustain a section 209 conviction. After concluding that section 209 applies to kidnappings committed to effect a robber\u2019s escape, <em>Laursen </em>cited \u201cour holding[]\u201d in <em>Timmons </em>with approval in stressing that the <em>Daniels </em>two-part asportation test applies to all section 209 prosecutions. <em>(Laursen, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 200.) And, in explaining the \u201clogic\u201d of interpreting section 209 consistently with the law on felony murder, <em>Laursen </em>stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>\u201cThrough the imposition of harsher penalties, both seek to deter an aggravation of the risks to which persons involved in a robbery would otherwise be exposed. And to this extent both are reflections of the skeptical, though sensible, belief that a transgressor\u2019s intention to avoid <em>physical </em>injury at the time he embarks upon the . . . robbery serves as no reasonable safeguard that death or <em>physical </em>injury will not result before he finishes.\u201d <em>(Laursen, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 200, fn. 6, italics added.) These considerations no doubt explain why in the almost 30 years since we decided <em>Laursen </em>we have never applied or even mentioned the statement the Attorney General now cites. Indeed, to the extent <em>Laursen </em>is relevant, it is, for the most part, consistent with my conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">III. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">As the majority explains, a 1933 amendment to section 209 linked the severity of punishment to whether the victim \u201csuffer[ed] bodily harm.\u201d (Stats. 1933, ch. 1025, \u00a7 1, p. 2618.) This linkage had a dual purpose: to recognize that the crime is more heinous and deserves a more severe penalty when a victim suffers bodily harm and to deter kidnappers from inflicting such harm. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 511, 517.) The punishment for kidnapping for robbery remained linked to whether the victim \u201csuffer[ed] bodily harm\u201d until 1976, when the Legislature reorganized section 209, placed kidnapping for robbery in subdivision (b), and retained the linkage between punishment and \u201cbodily harm\u201d only for those crimes in subdivision (a) . (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 136.5, p. 5099.) In 1997, the Legislature added a paragraph to subdivision (b) that provides: \u201cThis subdivision shall only apply if the movement of the victim is beyond that merely incidental to the commission of, and increases the risk of harm to the victim over and above that necessarily present in, the intended underlying offense.\u201d (\u00a7 209, subd. (b) (2), added by Stats. 1997, ch. 817, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">For several reasons, this statutory evolution supports the conclusion that an increased risk of psychological harm does not satisfy section 209\u2019s asportation requirement. First, it provides the context for understanding <em>Daniels. </em>When we decided <em>Daniels </em>in 1969, the legislative focus of section 209 was, as it had been since 1933, preventing the infliction of <em>bodily </em>harm on the victim. Logically, when we held in <em>Daniels </em>that the Legislature intended section 209 to apply only where the movement \u201csubstantially increase[d] the risk of harm\u201d <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1139), we were referring only to <em>bodily </em>harm, which is the kind of harm the Legislature expressly designed the statute to prevent. Nothing in <em>Daniels </em>indicates we were using the word \u201charm\u201d in any other sense. On the contrary, as I have explained, the second <em>Daniels </em>requirement\u2014a substantially increased risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>harm\u2014effectively does not exist under the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Daniels. </em>As I have also explained, the definition on which the majority relies\u2014grief, pain, sorrow\u2014was obsolete.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Second, in the 1997 legislation that added language to subdivision (b) similar to the <em>Daniels </em>test, the Legislature included an uncodified section declaring its \u201cintent\u201d that the <em>Daniels </em>\u201ctwo-prong test of asportation ... be applied\u201d to kidnapping for robbery prosecutions \u201cpursuant to\u201d our decision in <em>Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 1. (Stats. 1997, ch. 817, \u00a7 17.) This amendment \u201ccodifie[d] both <em>Rayford\u2019 </em>and \u201ca modified version of\u2019 the <em>Daniels </em>asportation standard. <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 232, fn. 4.) As I have explained, in <em>Rayford, </em>we used the following test in applying <em>Daniels </em>to determine the sufficiency of the evidence: whether \u201cdefendant moved [the victim] a \u2018substantial distance\u2019 \u201d and whether \u201cthis movement \u2018substantially increased\u2019 her risk of <em>physical </em>injury . . . .\u201d <em>(Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 23, italics added.) Thus, the relevant legislative history supports the conclusion that for conviction under section 209, subdivision (b), the movement of the victim must have increased the risk of <em>bodily </em>harm; an increased risk of psychological harm is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">By contrast, the most the majority can say about section 209\u2019s history to support its conclusion is that the Legislature\u2019s decision to impose greater punishment on aggravated kidnappers who inflict bodily harm on their victims \u201cdoes not necessarily mean\u201d the Legislature intended to require an increased risk of only physical injury. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 885.) Arguably, the majority may be correct that the \u201cbodily harm\u201d requirement in section 209\u2019s punishment provision does not <em>necessarily </em>establish that an increased risk of psychological harm is insufficient. However, for the reasons I have discussed, it fully supports that conclusion. Moreover, the majority cites <em>nothing </em>in either the statute\u2019s history <em>or </em>our cases that supports its contrary view.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">In summary, <em>Daniels, </em>our decisions applying it, and section 209\u2019s history all indicate that a substantially increased risk of only psychological harm cannot establish the asportation requirement for defendant\u2019s section 209 conviction. Thus, the trial court erred in instructing the jury it could consider an increased risk of \u201cmental damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">IV. <em>Harmless Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Although I conclude the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury, I agree with the majority that the error was harmless because the evidence demonstrates to a virtual certainty that the movement of the victim substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>increased the risk of bodily injury. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 886, fn. 7; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Flood </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 470 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 180, 957 P.2d 869].) Accordingly, I concur in the affirmance of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-15\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-6\">The majority correctly notes that <em>Daniels </em>required that the movement <em>substantially </em>increased the risk of harm. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 886, fn. 6.) However, since 1997, section 209 has -expressly provided that it \u201conly appl[ies]\u201d if the movement is more than \u201cmerely incidental . . . and increases the risk of harm . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 209, subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b940-5\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab6\">\u2014I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The superior court in this case instructed the jury that an element of kidnapping for robbery is that the victim suffered an increased risk of harm as a result of the movement. In response to a question from the jury whether the risk of harm included psychological harm, it instructed that \u201cWebster\u2019s defines harm as physical or mental damage.\u201d The majority hold that the instruction was not erroneous because the risk of harm required under Penal Code section 209, subdivision (d), may involve \u201cphysical <em>or </em>mental harm.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 886.) I disagree. An increased risk of psychological injury will not satisfy the asportation element for the offense of aggravated kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">At the time defendant Tuan Van Nguyen committed the underlying offenses, Penal Code section 209, subdivision (b), provided that \u201c[a]ny person who kidnaps or carries away any individual to commit robbery shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with possibility of parole.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 55, \u00a7 3, p. 394.) Under <em>People v. Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119, 1139 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677] (hereafter <em>Daniels), </em>the offense of aggravated kidnapping required more than merely incidental movement of the victim; the asportation of the victim must \u201csubstantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">It is abundantly clear in <em>Daniels, </em>which I authored, that we assumed the increased risk of harm required under the statute was of physical injury. <em>Daniels </em>itself involved allegations that the kidnapping victims suffered bodily harm. Indeed, the version of Penal Code section 209 that we explicated in <em>Daniels </em>expressly applied only \u201c \u2018in cases in which the person . . . subjected to such kidnapping suffers . . . <em>bodily harm.' \" (Daniels, supra, </em>71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Cal.2d at p. 1125, quoting former Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, Stats. 1951, ch. 1749, \u00a7 1, p. 4167, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Our analysis in <em>Daniels </em>addressed the risk of physical harm only. Thus, we pointed out, with regard to the \u201cbodily harm\u201d element under Penal Code section 209, that some minor physical injuries are necessarily incidental to the crime of forcible kidnapping, but, as we had earlier held in <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 511, 517 [282 P.2d 898]), are not of the nature contemplated by the Legislature in providing a more serious penalty for an act of kidnapping that involves an increased risk of harm to the victim. <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at pp. 1133-1134.) <em>Jackson </em>had explained that in the case of merely trivial physical injury, \u201cneither the purpose of enhancement of the penalty for the more heinous crime nor the intention of deterring the kidnaper from killing or injuring [the] victim is subserved.\u201d <em>(People v. Jackson, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 517.) By analogy, we construed the legislative intent with regard to the asportation element under Penal Code section 209 as excluding those \u201cmovements of the victim [that] are merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">At no point in <em>Daniels </em>did we discuss the psychological or emotional aspects of the physical movement. Significantly, we concluded that the victims in <em>Daniels </em>were <em>not </em>subjected to a substantial increase in \u201cthe risk of harm otherwise present\u201d by the movements they were compelled to perform in furtherance of the robbery <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1140), even though the evidence showed that they were moved at knifepoint or gunpoint and were \u201c[b]adly frightened\u201d and \u201cdistraught\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1123).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Viewed in context, nothing we said in <em>Daniels </em>can reasonably be understood to suggest that we meant anything other than increased risk of <em>bodily </em>harm. Had we intended to hold that the increased risk of harm element could be satisfied by a risk of merely psychological injury\u2014a conclusion that would appear at odds with the \u201cbodily harm\u201d that had been a requirement under Penal Code section 209 for decades\u2014we would have so stated expressly and unmistakably.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">We subsequently explained in <em>People v. Timmons </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 411, 414 [93 Cal.Rptr. 736, 482 P.2d 648], that we intended in <em>Daniels </em>\u201cto refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>to an increase in the risk that the victim may suffer significant <em>physical injuries </em>over and above those to which a victim of the underlying crime is normally exposed.\u201d (Italics added.) We have repeatedly referred to <em>physical injuries </em>in describing the risk of harm factor under <em>Daniels. </em>(See, e.g., <em>In re Early </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 122, 131 [120 Cal.Rptr. 881, 534 P.2d 721] [requirement under <em>Daniels </em>of increased risk of \u201c ' \u201csignificant physical injuries\u201d \u2019 \u201d to the victim]; <em>People v. Stanworth </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 588, 598 [114 Cal.Rptr. 250, 522 P.2d 1058] [no aggravated kidnapping when there was no increased risk that the victim \u201cwould suffer physical harm\u201d]; <em>People v. Milan </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 185, 192-193 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956] [requiring an increased risk of physical harm]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 771 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.) [\u201c[W]e required in <em>Daniels </em>... the jury must find that the movements . . . substantially increased the risk of physical harm to the victim\u201d]; <em>People v. Lara </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 903, 910 [117 Cal.Rptr. 549, 528 P.2d 365] (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.) [disagreeing with majority that the evidence showed \u201cthe substantial increase in the risk of serious physical harm to the victim required by <em>Daniels\u201d].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Recently, <em>People </em>v. <em>Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1, 23 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369], described the <em>Daniels </em>test as requiring a substantial increase in the risk of <em>physical injury. </em>(See also <em>id. </em>at p. 24 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.) [no evidence of substantially increased risk of harm because victim was not moved to a more secluded location, where there would be an increased risk \u201cnot only [of] rape, but also death\u201d].) Similarly, <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 236 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512] explained that \u201ca primary reason forcible asportation is proscribed by the kidnapping statutes is the increase in the risk of harm to the victim because of the diminished likelihood of discovery, the opportunity for the commission of additional crimes, and the possibility of injury from foreseeable attempts to escape.\u201d These considerations all involve the increased risk of physical harm, not of psychological injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Nor do I agree with the majority that the 1976 amendment of Penal Code section 209\u2014which placed the offense of kidnapping to commit robbery in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>subdivision (b) (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 136.5, p. 5099)\u2014was a \u201cdeliberate\u201d expression of legislative intent to expand the risk of harm element to include psychological injury. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 885.) The majority offer no persuasive support for such conclusion in the legislative history or elsewhere. The Legislature has repeatedly demonstrated that it knows how to deliberately include psychological harm in a statute. (See, e.g., Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4303 [referring to \u201cserious bodily or serious psychological injury\u201d]; Health &amp; Saf. Code, .\u00a7 24176, subd. (c) [referring to \u201csubstantial risk of serious injury, either bodily harm or psychological harm]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 3508 [referring to \u201cpermanent physical or psychological injury\u201d].) It did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In my view, the requirement under Penal Code section 209, subdivision (b), must be understood in the context of our analysis in <em>Daniels </em>and of the statutory language, now in Penal Code section 209, subdivision (a), which has for decades spoken only of \u201cbodily harm.\u201d We should also avoid a construction of the statute that threatens, as does the majority\u2019s, to undermine the statute\u2019s purpose of deterring kidnappers from harming their victims and inducing them to release the victim unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">No doubt there is some risk of psychological harm in every criminal contact, however brief. It would appear that, in future, virtually any act of kidnapping for the purpose of robbery may satisfy the requirement of a substantial (i.e., more than slight or trivial) increase in the risk of harm to the victim, even when there was no risk of physical injury. I cannot agree with the majority that the statute was intended to cast so wide a net.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied July 12, 2000. Mosk, J., Chin, J., and Brown, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-9\"><em>Daniels </em>found the risk of harm requirement implicit under an earlier version of the aggravated kidnapping statute. <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1139.) In 1997, the Legislature expressly incorporated the rule in <em>Daniels </em>in amended Penal Code section 209. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b)(2), as amended by Stats. 1997, ch. 817, \u00a7 2 [\u201cThis subdivision shall apply only if the movement of the victim is beyond that merely incidental to the commission of, and increases the <em>risk of harm </em>to the victim over and above that necessarily present in, the intended underlying offense.\u201d (Italics added.)]; see also Stats. 1997, ch. 817, \u00a7 17 [stating legislative intent to codify the <em>Daniels </em>test].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b941-9\"> Although, as the majority point out (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 885-886), <em>Daniels </em>quoted an earlier case that cited the dictionary definition of the word \u201charm\u201d as including \u201c ' \u201cgrief, pain, sorrow,\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Daniels, <em>supra, 11 </em>Cal.2d at p. 1132, quoting <em>People v. Tanner </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 279, 297 [44 P.2d 324]), we did not purport to state or imply that the increased risk of harm required for a conviction of aggravated kidnapping could be established by a showing that asportation increased the risk of psychological injury to the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The People point to dictum in <em>People </em>v. <em>Laursen </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 192, 198 [104 Cal.Rptr. 425, 501 P.2d 1145] that refers to the requirement under Penal Code section 209 as one involving \u201cgrave bodily or psychic injury.\u201d I agree with the majority that the reference, which was not supported by <em>Daniels </em>or followed in any of our numerous other cases in point, is not persuasive authority herein. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 879.) As explained in the text, the offense of aggravated kidnapping expressly required \u201cbodily harm\u201d; the reference to \u201cpsychic injury\u201d in <em>Laursen </em>was obviously a misstatement. Significantly, until this case, no appellate court has held that the increased risk of psychological harm may satisfy the requirements for aggravated kidnapping until this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b943-9\">The majority observe that even if they had concluded that the trial court erred, such error was harmless.
