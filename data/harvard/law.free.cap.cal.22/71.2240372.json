By the contract of sale the defendant was to take the land at that price, provided the title was good. The plaintiff\u2019s title to the land was derived through the will of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Romain DeBoom, and the only question raised as to its validity was whether the will was properly and legally admitted to Probate. The agreed ease states that the will was made in Belgium\u2014that an authenticated copy of it was filed in the Probate Court of San Francisco, where the testator resided at the time of his death, together with a petition for probate by the person named as executor, in which petition were stated \u201c all the necessary facts \u201d\u2014that due notice was given of the application as required by law, and that upon a hearing the will was duly admitted to probate, and thereupon recorded. The plaintiff had judgment and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-5\"><em>A. J.

The jurisdiction of the Probate Court having attached, by reason of the death of the testator in the county, the order admitting the will to probate is not void. It could only be voidable. The jurisdiction of the Probate Court in matters pertaining to wills is exclusive, and its decrees are conclusive until set aside by a direct appeal. The jurisdiction extends over this class of cases, and its judgments cannot be questioned. <em>(Fisher </em>v. Bassett, 9 Leigh. 131; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Scriber, </em>18 Cal. 499.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b74-10\">Norton, J. delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Cope, C.

It is also shoAvn that a judgment was entered admitting the Avill to probate, and that the will Avas thereupon duly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">If, as is agreed, the petition stated ah the necessary facts, then upon its presentation with a copy of the will, and the publication of due and legal notice, the Court acquired jurisdiction to probate the will, and the judgment of the probate thereafter entered is conclusive. If any irregularities occurred in the proceedings or error in the judgment after jurisdiction was acquired, they could only be corrected by a direct proceeding for that purpose, and cannot be inquired into in this collateral proceeding. <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Scriber, </em>18 Cal. 499; <em>In the Matter of the Estate of Preston Warfield, ante </em>51.) any error-We do not, however, by this remark, intend to intimate that any error occurred in the probate proceeding<em>s</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">judgment affirmed. ----* <em>___A</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
