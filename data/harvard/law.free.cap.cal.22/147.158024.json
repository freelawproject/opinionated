Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1082, 1104 [282 Cal.Rptr. 841, 811 P.2d 1025] (hereafter sometimes <em>Wells Fargo), </em>we acknowledged was \u201cimportant and difficult\u201d: In the face of Title VII and the ADEA, does section 24, Fifth, preempt FEHA?</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">As we shall explain, we conclude that the answer that we must give is this: Yes and no. Section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA. As impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA to the extent that it conflicts, but it does not to the extent that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Ora Peatros filed a complaint for damages in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County against the Bank of America and C. Gordon Brown (collectively Bank of America or the bank). In this pleading, as subsequently amended, she alleged, in pertinent part, to this effect: The bank employed her as an officer, specifically, a vice-president, and assigned her to work as a branch manager subject to the supervision of Brown as a district manager. \u201c[U]nder the guise of an alleged error\u201d on her part, the bank, through Brown, demoted her from an officer to a nonofficer, and then terminated her altogether, on grounds including her race, which was African-American, and her age, which was 45 years at the time of demotion and 47 years at the time of termination. Relying, apparently, on California law alone, she asserted five causes of action. The first was for \u201cbreach\u201d of an \u201cimplied-in-fact contract of employment.\u201d The second was for \u201cviolation\u201d of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act or FEHA. The third was for wrongful \u201ctermination ... in violation of public policy\u201d as declared in FEHA. The fourth was for \u201cbreach\u201d of a \u201ccovenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d \u201c[i]mplied by law\u201d in the contract of employment referred to above. The fifth and final was for \u201cmisrepresentation and deceit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Bank of America filed an answer to Peatros\u2019s complaint as amended. In this pleading, it raised an affirmative defense based on section 8 of the National Bank Act of 1864, as codified at section 24, Fifth, of title 12 of the United States Code\u2014to the effect that the provision granted a national bank the power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors, and thereby bestowed immunity from liability arising from its exercise; that it was, in fact, a national bank; and that the provision preempted all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>state law underlying Peatros\u2019s causes of action, including FEHA, and hence removed their necessary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Not long thereafter, Bank of America filed a motion for summary judgment against Peatros\u2019s complaint as amended. It claimed that there was no triable issue of material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on section 24, Fifth, and its asserted preemption of all of the state law underlying her causes of action, including FEHA. It relied on <em>Wells Fargo. </em>In pertinent part, <em>Wells Fargo </em>holds that section 24, Fifth, requires a national bank to exercise its power to dismiss an officer, with resulting immunity, by its board of directors; that it prohibits the board to delegate the power; but that it allows the board to employ the power not only directly, by acting itself, but also indirectly, by authorizing or ratifying action by an agent. <em>(Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1094-1104.) In reliance thereon, the bank argued in favor of the applicability of section 24, Fifth, asserting that its board of directors employed its power to dismiss Peatros as an officer by ratification. The facts that it stated were undisputed included the following: It was a national bank. She was African-American. It appointed her, at 42 years of age, as an officer, specifically, a vice-president, by its board of directors, which, it appears, made the appointment itself or at least ratified a prior managerial appointment. About three years later, within a period of a single week, and at the hands of a single customer, she caused it to suffer losses in the amount of almost $135,000 when she approved for immediate credit, without any uncollected-funds hold, the deposit of a series of three checks in the amounts of $100,000, $20,000, and $15,000, which were drawn on out-of-state banks and later returned unpaid because they were not covered by sufficient funds. It then demoted her, at 45 years of age, from an officer, specifically, vice-president, to a nonofficer by its board of directors, which promptly ratified a prior managerial demotion in which Brown and perhaps others participated. The day after she was notified of the managerial demotion, she went out on an extended medical absence, during which she apparently received disability payments based on her salary prior to the managerial demotion. Bank policy provided for termination when an extended medical absence exceeded 24 consecutive months. In due course, her extended medical absence came to exceed such a period. The bank terminated her, at 47 years of age, by its board of directors, which promptly ratified a prior administrative termination mandated by the policy referred to above. It never recovered the almost $135,000 in losses that it had suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Peatros opposed Bank of America\u2019s motion for summary judgment against her complaint as amended. She denied what it claimed. But she did not contest the substance of the facts that it stated were undisputed. Relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Wells Fargo </em>for her own part, she argued against the applicability of section 24, Fifth, asserting that the bank\u2019s board of directors delegated its power to dismiss her as an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">After a hearing, the superior court issued an order granting Bank of America\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Peatros\u2019s complaint as amended, accepting its position and rejecting hers, and hence concluding that section 24, Fifth, preempts all of the state law underlying her causes of action, including FEHA, completely and in its entirety. It caused entry of judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">After Peatros filed a notice of appeal in the superior court, an appeal was docketed in the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District, and was later assigned to Division Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">By a judgment announced in a two-to-one decision certified for publication, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the superior court. In a majority opinion, two justices subjected the superior court\u2019s order granting Bank of America\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Peatros\u2019s complaint as amended to what was evidently independent review. On such review, they sustained the ruling. Determining that, in accordance with <em>Wells Fargo, </em>the bank exercised its power to dismiss her as an officer by its board of directors, which did not delegate the power but employed it by ratification, they concluded that section 24, Fifth, was indeed applicable. Declining to follow decisions including <em>Marques </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 356 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 154] (hereafter sometimes <em>Marques), </em>which had been handed down while the present appeal was pending, they also concluded that, even in the face of Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA completely and in its entirety, as well as, apparently, all of the other state law underlying the causes of action in question. In a dissenting opinion, one justice would have struck down the superior court\u2019s ruling and reversed its judgment. Following decisions including <em>Marques, </em>she concluded that, in the face of Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, does not preempt FEHA in any part or aspect whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Peatros filed a petition for review. We granted her application. Subsequently, we specified as the sole question on review whether, in the face of Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">We now proceed to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The question that we address on review, as stated above, is whether, in the face of Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA. In order to give an answer, we must advance step by step.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The doctrine relating to the preemption of the law of one of the several states by that of the United States itself may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Clause 2 of article VI of the United States Constitution\u2014the supremacy clause\u2014declares that \u201cLaws of the United States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Ever since the decision in <em>McCulloch v. Maryland </em>(1819) 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 427 [4 L.Ed. 579, 607], \u201cit has been settled that state law that conflicts with federal law is \u2018without effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cipollone v.

Mohrenstecher </em>(8th Cir. 1896) 76 Fed. 118, 122, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit uttered what has become the classic statement: \u201cObservation and experience alike teach that it is essential to the safety and prosperity of banking institutions that the active officers, to whose integrity and discretion the moneys and property of the bank and its customers are intrusted, should be subject to immediate removal whenever the suspicion of faithlessness or negligence attaches to them. High credit is indispensable to the success and prosperity of a bank. Without it, customers cannot be induced to deposit their moneys. When it has once been secured, and then declines, those who have deposited demand their cash, the income of the bank dwindles, and often bankruptcy follows. It sometimes happens that, without any justification, a suspicion of dishonesty or carelessness attaches to a cashier or a president of a bank, spreads through the community in which he lives, scares the depositors, and threatens immediate financial ruin to the institution. In such a case it is necessary to the prosperity and success\u2014to the very existence\u2014of a banking institution that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the board of directors should have power to remove such an officer, and to put in his place another, in whom the community has confidence. In our opinion, the provision . . . was inserted, ex industria, to provide for this very contingency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Today, more than 100 years later, the statement of the <em>Westervelt </em>court on the purpose of what is now section 24, Fifth, remains current. (See, e.g., <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1089; <em>Mardula v. Rancho Dominguez Bank </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 790, 793-794 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 63]; <em>Aalgaard v.

Bank </em>(1986) 111 Idaho 314, 316 [723 P.2d 858, 860].) The provision\u2019s object is \u201cto give\u201d national banks the \u201cgreatest latitude possible to hire and fire their . . . officers\u201d <em>(Mackey </em>v. <em>Pioneer Nat.

It does so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>explicitly. <em>In ipsissimis verbis, </em>it states that a national bank \u201cshall have power\u201d \u201cby its board of directors to . . . dismiss\u201d any of its officers \u201cat pleasure . . . .\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, Fifth.) It expressly grants the greater power to dismiss a person <em>who is an officer, </em>it impliedly grants the lesser power to dismiss a person <em>as an officer, </em>that is, to \u201crelieve\u201d him \u201cof his authority\u201d to act as such (Sinclair, <em>Employment at Pleasure: An Idea Whose Time Has Passed </em>(1992) 23 U. Tol. L.Rev. 531, 541; see generally <em>id. </em>at pp. 532-546). It does not limit the power in question; indeed, it does not allow any such limitation, even by a national bank itself. (E.g., <em>Aalgaard v. Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 689; <em>Citizens Nat. Bank &amp; Trust v.

Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1991) 1991 Okla. 23 [809 P.2d 1298, 1301-1303] [same].) Hence, the power that it grants may be characterized as unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Within the judicial sphere, section 24, Fifth, bestows on a national bank immunity from liability arising from the exercise of its power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors. It does so implicitly. \u201cIt is idle to say that\u201d the provision \u201cgives the power to\u201d dismiss an officer, \u201cwithout the right to do so. The grant of the power carries with it the untrammeled right to its exercise, free from penalty.\u201d <em>(Copeland </em>v. <em>Melrose Nat.

We do not seek the meaning of a statute or a statutory provision in isolation. (E.g., <em>Calatayud v. State of California </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1057, 1065 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 202, 959 P.2d 360].) Rather, we do so by looking to the \u201centire scheme of law of which it is part . . . .\u201d <em>(Clean Air Constituency v. California State Air Resources Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 801, 814 [114 Cal.Rptr. 577, 523 P.2d 617].) Indeed, we look beyond neighboring law to the law as a whole. (See <em>Kopp </em>v. <em>Fair Pol. Practices Com. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 607, 672-673 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 108, 905 P.2d 1248] (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) For \u201c[t]o seek the meaning of a statute\u201d or a statutory provision is \u201cto discern\u201d its \u201csense ... in the legal . . . culture\u201d itself <em>{ibid., </em>italics omitted), which, of course, encompasses the law generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">When we consider section 24, Fifth, in conjunction with Title VII and the ADEA, as we ought, as part of the law as a whole,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we find at least apparent conflict. In pertinent part, section 24, Fifth, grants a national bank the unlimited power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors. It thereby bestows absolute immunity from liability arising from its exercise. But, in pertinent part, Title VII and the ADEA confer on officers of a national bank, as employees, a right against dismissal on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age. They also create a remedy - for its violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Against at least apparent conflict, we seek, if we can, to harmonize section 24, Fifth, on the one side, and Title VII and the ADEA, on the other, in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>to avoid any actual conflict, and, if we cannot, to recognize that the earlier statutory provision has been impliedly amended or even repealed by the later statutes in order to bring the conflict to resolution (see, e.g., <em>Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 518, 523-524 [106 S.Ct. 768, 771, 88 L.Ed.2d 877] [implied repeal]; <em>St. Martin Lutheran Church v. South Dakota </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 772, 778 [101 S.Ct. 2142, 2146, 68 L.Ed.2d 612] [implied amendment or repeal]; <em>In re Manuel L. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 229, 235-236 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 865 P.2d 718] [implied repeal]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Leong Fook </em>(1928) 206 Cal. 64, 69-70 [273 P. 779] [implied amendment or repeal]), but then only to the extent necessary and no further (e.g., <em>Silver v. New York Stock Exchange </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 341, 357 [83 S.Ct. 1246, 1257, 10 L.Ed.2d 389] [implied repeal]; <em>Governing Board v. Mann </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 819, 828 [135 Cal.Rptr. 526, 558 P.2d 1] [same]).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Despite our efforts, we are unable to harmonize section 24, Fifth, on the one side, and Title VII and the ADEA, on the other, in order to avoid any actual conflict. As stated, section 24, Fifth, grants a national bank the unlimited power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors. As also stated, it bestows absolute immunity from liability arising from its exercise. For their part, Title VII and the ADEA effectively deny a national bank the power to dismiss any of its officers, by its board of directors or otherwise, on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age. They also effectively withdraw immunity from liability arising from its exercise on any such ground. The grant of unlimited power and bestowal of absolute immunity by section 24, Fifth, cannot be reconciled with even a partial denial of power or withdrawal of immunity by Title VII and the ADEA. One cannot reasonably read section 24, Fifth, with its unlimited power and absolute immunity, to allow an exception for the later enacted Title VII and the ADEA: The unlimited power and absolute immunity of section 24, Fifth, are antithetical even to their partial denial and withdrawal by Title VII and the ADEA. Similarly, one cannot reasonably read Title VII and the ADEA to allow an exception for the earlier enacted section 24, Fifth: Title VII and the ADEA do not refer to section 24, Fifth, expressly. Neither do they even allude to it by implication. Furthermore, although they exclude certain employers from coverage, they do <em>not </em>exclude national banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Unable to harmonize section 24, Fifth, and Title VII and the ADEA, we must recognize that section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended or even repealed by Title VII and the ADEA in order to resolve the conflict. And we believe that we need recognize only its implied amendment rather than its implied repeal. As impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, grants a national bank a <em>limited </em>power to dismiss any of its officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>at pleasure by its board of directors, not extending to dismissal on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age. And, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, bestows a <em>qualified </em>immunity from liability arising from its exercise, allowing only specified relief, with limits and/or bars against compensatory and/or punitive damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">With that said, we may presently answer the question whether, in the face of Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There is no express preemption of FEHA by section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA. The provision itself does not contain the requisite explicit language. Its implied amendment by the cited statutes has not changed a word.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">There is also no field preemption of FEHA by section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA. Speaking generally, we can say that the National Bank Act of 1864 as a whole \u201cis not a comprehensive statutory scheme occupying the entire field relating to national banks.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>(Aalgaard v. Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 688; see <em>Perdue </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 937-938; see also <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.A. v. Nelson, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 33 [116 S.Ct. at p. 1109] [recognizing the \u201cpower\u201d of the states \u201cto regulate national banks\u201d].) Speaking specifically, we can say the same about section 24, Fifth, itself. For such \u201cgrants of . . . \u2018powers\u2019 to national banks\u201d have historically been interpreted as \u201cgrants of authority\u201d that do not \u201cordinarily pre-empt[]\u201d state law generally, but only such state law as is \u201ccontrary\u201d thereto. <em>(Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.A. </em>v. <em>Nelson, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 32 [116 S.Ct. at p. 1108].) The implied amendment of the provision by the cited statutes has not affected it in any material way.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">There is, nevertheless, conflict preemption of FEHA by section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">True, it may not be \u201cimpossible\u201d for a national bank \u201cto comply with both\u201d section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, and FEHA. <em>(English v. General Electric Co., supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 79 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2275].) For example: FEHA effectively prohibits dismissal of an officer by a national bank on the ground of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, or age; it likewise allows an officer to obtain relief against a national bank in the case of such dismissal. But section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, does not command any national bank to dismiss any officer on any of the grounds identified in FEHA; neither, apparently, does it bar any national bank from affording any relief to any officer dismissed on any such ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">But FEHA may nevertheless \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d <em>(Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, supra, </em>312 U.S. at p. 67 [61 S.Ct. at p. 404]) underlying section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In order to further the integrity and stability of national banks as institutions in appearance and reality, section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, grants a national bank the limited power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors, not extending to dismissal on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age. To the same end, it bestows qualified immunity from liability arising from its exercise, allowing only specified relief, with limits and/or bars against compensatory and/or punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In part, FEHA merely limits a national bank\u2019s power to dismiss an officer at pleasure by its board of directors in duplication of the limitation of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, on the ground of race, religious creed (which is evidently synonymous with religion), color, national origin, sex, age, or ancestry (insofar as it is reducible to race, color, national origin, etc.). But, in other part, it would further limit the power so as not to extend to dismissal on the ground of physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, or ancestry (insofar as it is not reducible to race, color, national origin, etc.). Such a further limitation would \u201creduce the power\u201d itself. <em>(Aalgaard </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 692.) In this way, it would hinder attainment of the end for which the power was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Similarly, in part, FEHA merely qualifies the immunity arising from a national bank\u2019s exercise of its power to dismiss an officer at pleasure by its board of directors in duplication of the qualification of section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, to the extent that it allows relief, as specified, that does not offend the limits and/or bars against compensatory and/or punitive damages. But, in other part, it would further qualify the immunity so as to allow all relief generally available, including unlimited compensatory and punitive damages. Such a further qualification would \u201cinhibit\u201d the exercise of the power. <em>(Aalgaard </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 692.) In this way, it too would hinder attainment of the end for which the power was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">It may indeed be true that FEHA does not \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d <em>(Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </em>312 U.S. at p. 67 [61 S.Ct. at p. 404]) underlying <em>Title VII and the ADEA, </em>by which section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended. For it appears that Title VII (see Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 708, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-7; see also <em>California Federal S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Guerra </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 272, 282 [107 S.Ct. 683, 690, 93 L.Ed.2d 613] (plur. opn. by Marshall, J.)) and the ADEA (see Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, \u00a7 14, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633; see also <em>Simpson v. Providence Washington Ins. Group </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 608 F.2d 1171, 1175 (per Kennedy, J.), affg. <em>Simpson v. Alaska State Com'n for Human Rights </em>(D. Alaska 1976) 423 F.Supp. 552, 555-556) establish only a <em>minimum </em>level of protection for employees that FEHA may not fail to reach. (See generally <em>English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 89-90 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2281]; <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Lai </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 42 F.3d 1299, 1303, fn. 1 [stating that \u201c[p]arallel state anti-discrimination laws are explicitly made part of Title VII\u2019s enforcement scheme\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">It does not follow, however, that FEHA may not \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>(Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </em>312 U.S. at p. 67 [61 S.Ct. at p. 404]) underlying <em>section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA. </em>That is because section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, effectively establishes a <em>maximum </em>level of protection for officers of a national bank that FEHA may not exceed: It grants a national bank a power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors, limited only against dismissal on the ground of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age. And it bestows an immunity from liability arising from its exercise, qualified to allow only specified relief, with limits and/or bars against compensatory and/or punitive damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The conflict preemption of FEHA by section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, means this: As impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA to the extent that it conflicts, but it does not to the extent that it does not. The reason is this: Conflict preemption of state law by federal law does not automatically and necessarily result in the <em>complete </em>displacement of state law by federal law <em>in its entirety. </em>Rather, it does so insofar <em>(English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 79 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2281]), but only insofar <em>(Dalton v. Little Rock Family Planning Services, supra, </em>516 U.S. at p. 476 [116 S.Ct. at p. 1064] <em>(per curiam)), </em>as there is conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Therefore, section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, preempts FEHA to the extent that, unlike Title VII and the ADEA, FEHA confers on officers of a national bank a right against dismissal on the ground of physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, or ancestry (insofar as it is not reducible to race, color, national origin, etc.). Here, there is conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">But section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, does not preempt FEHA to the extent that, like Title VII and the ADEA, FEHA confers on officers of a national bank a right against dismissal on the ground of race, religious creed (which is evidently synonymous with religion), color, national origin, sex, age, or ancestry (insofar as it is reducible to race, color, national origin, etc.). Here, there is no conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Also, section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, preempts FEHA to the extent that, unlike Title VII and the ADEA, FEHA creates a remedy for violation of the right of an officer of a national bank against dismissal on the ground of physical disability, mental disability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>medical condition, marital status, or ancestry (insofar as it is not reducible to race, color, national origin, etc.), in the form of any relief whatsoever, including, of course, unlimited compensatory and punitive damages. Here too, there is conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">But section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, does not preempt FEHA to the extent that, like Title VII and the ADEA, it creates a remedy for violation of the right of an officer of a national bank against dismissal on the ground of race, religious creed (which is evidently synonymous with religion), color, national origin, sex, age, or ancestry (insofar as it is reducible to race, color, national origin, etc.), in the form of relief, as specified, that does not offend the limits and/or bars against compensatory and/or punitive damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In a word, section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, preempts FEHA to the extent that it conflicts, but it does not to the extent that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Not inconsistent with our analysis is the discussion by the <em>Marques </em>court, which focuses on the extent to which section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, does not preempt FEHA insofar as it is not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>conflict, specifically with regard to the right that FEHA confers on employees against dismissal on grounds including national origin, sex, and age. (See <em>Marques </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at pp. 359-364.) Concededly, it does not express any acknowledgment that section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, in fact preempts FEHA insofar as it is in conflict. But neither does it imply any denial thereof. We decline to read it differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Inconsistent with our analysis, however, is the discussion by both the majority and the dissenting justice in the Court of Appeal below. Each is too extreme. As for the majority, their opinion is not at all unsound in its focus on the extent to which section 24, Fifth, which we have concluded has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, preempts FEHA insofar as it is in conflict, specifically with regard to the remedy that FEHA creates in the form of all relief generally available, including unlimited compensatory and punitive damages. But their opinion is indeed unsound in its implication that section 24, Fifth, which they failed to recognize has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, preempts FEHA completely and in its entirety. As for the dissenting justice, her opinion is similarly not at all unsound in its focus on the extent to which section 24, Fifth, which she recognized has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, does not preempt FEHA insofar as it is not in conflict, specifically with regard to the right that FEHA confers against dismissal on grounds including race and age. But her opinion too is indeed unsound in its implication that section 24, Fifth, which she fails to recognize has only been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA and not superseded, does not preempt FEHA in any part or aspect whatsoever.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In arriving at our conclusion, we are mindful that the national banking system created by the National Bank Act of 1864 was meant to be one \u201cwith uniform operation\u201d within the \u201cterritorial limits of the United States.\u201d <em>(Talbott v. Silver Bow County, supra, </em>139 U.S. at p. 443 [11 S.Ct. at p. 596].) Our conclusion does not in any way undermine such a system. Insofar as FEHA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>conflicts with section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, it is preempted. To that extent, it cannot threaten national uniformity. But, insofar as FEHA does not conflict with section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, it is not preempted. To that extent, it does not threaten national uniformity. For, to that extent, it merely duplicates what the <em>Marques </em>court properly declared to be the uniform \u201cnational standard enunciated\u201d in Title VII and the ADEA, by which section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended\u2014a standard that incorporates FEHA, with its rights and remedies, to the extent that it is consistent, to function as the primary mechanism in achieving the purpose of Title VII and the ADEA. <em>(Marques v. Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In concluding that section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA completely and in its entirety, Justice Brown implies, at the outset, that appreciable \u201cdecisional authority\u201d supports her position. (Dis. opn. of Brown, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 183.) A careful and precise review of such authority, which is present in our analysis (see <em>ante, </em>fns. 4, 6, &amp; 7 on pp. 169, 173, &amp; 174) but absent from hers, shows that such support ranges between minimal and nonexistent. She then puts forth two reasons\u2014\u201cone grounded in congressional intent and policy, the other in pragmatics.\u201d (Dis. opn. of Brown, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 185.) The first reason involves both a disagreement with the fact that section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, and also a belief that a national bank cannot operate without unlimited power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors and without absolute immunity from liability arising from its exercise. The disagreement, however, is hardly serious, in evident, if unspoken, recognition of the absence of support in reason or authority. In addition, the belief founders on reality, seeing that, in the more than 30 years since the enactment of Title VII and the ADEA, national banks, like Bank of America here, have operated, quite successfully, with what they themselves have understood to be only limited power and qualified immunity. The second reason involves a desire for national uniformity. The desire is understandable. The national uniformity desired, however, is a will-o\u2019-the-wisp. It is incompatible generally with the fact that, \u201csince\u201d before the \u201cpassage of the . . . National Bank Act,\u201d \u201cregulation of [national] banking has been one of dual\u201d \u201cfederal-state\u201d \u201ccontrol.\u201d <em>(National State Bank, Elizabeth, N.J. v. Long, supra, </em>630 F.2d at p. 985.) It is also incompatible specifically with the fact that Title VII and the ADEA, by which section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended, each incorporate any consistent state antidiscrimination law, with its rights and remedies, to function as its primary mechanism in achieving its purpose. To be sure, as the United States Supreme Court made plain in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 85 [103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490], to conclude that federal law does not preempt state law completely and in its entirety \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>cause certain practical problems.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 105 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2904].) But as it also made plain therein, such \u201cproblems are the result of congressional choice and should be addressed by congressional action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 106 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2904].)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In concluding that section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA completely and in its entirety, Justice Kennard, for her part, invokes the just cited <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>Curiously so. The result that the United States Supreme Court reached there is similar to the result that we reach here, that is, federal law preempts state law to the extent that it conflicts, but it does not to the extent that it does not. <em>Shaw\u2019s </em>underlying proposition is to the effect that otherwise expressly preemptive federal law does not preempt state law that other federal law incorporates. It follows, a fortiori, that section 24, Fifth, which is not expressly preemptive, does not preempt FEHA, which Title VII and the ADEA incorporate to the extent that it is consistent. True, in reaching its result, the court impliedly rejected a \u201csimplistic \u2018double saving clause\u2019 argument.\u201d <em>(Shaw v.

But no such \u201cdouble saving clause\u201d argument, or even a \u201csingle saving clause\u201d argument, is present here. Contrary to Justice Kennard\u2019s assertion, the federal law on which the court focused simply did not \u201ccontain[]\u201d any \u201cself-imposed limitation on its preemptive force\u201d (cone, and dis. opn. of Kennard, J., <em>post, </em>at pp. 182-183), but only a circumscription of its scope with respect to other federal law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We pass at this time to the decision of the Court of Appeal, which affirmed the judgment of the superior court on its order granting Bank of America\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Peatros\u2019s complaint as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">At the threshold, the Court of Appeal majority did not err when they subjected the superior court\u2019s order granting Bank of America\u2019s summary judgment motion, as they evidently did, to independent review. \u201cRulings on such motions are examined de novo.\u201d <em>(Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 60 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766].) Including, as here, rulings granting such motions. (E.g., <em>Silva v. Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Cal.App.4th 256, 261 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 382]; <em>Lenane </em>v. <em>Continental Maritime of San Diego, Inc. (1998) 61 </em>Cal.App.4th 1073, 1079 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 121].)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">But, on the merits, the Court of Appeal majority did indeed err when they sustained the superior court\u2019s order granting Bank of America\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">To be sure, the Court of Appeal majority were right to conclude that section 24, Fifth, was applicable. As stated, <em>Wells Fargo </em>holds: The provision requires a national bank to exercise its power to dismiss an officer, meaning \u201cpresident,\u201d \u201cvice president,\u201d \u201ccashier,\u201d or \u201cother officer[],\u201d with resulting immunity, by its board of directors; it prohibits the board to delegate the power; but it allows the board to employ the power not only directly, by acting itself, but also indirectly, by authorizing or ratifying action by an agent. <em>(Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1094-1104.) Here, under the undisputed facts, Bank of America dismissed Peatros as an officer, specifically, a vice-president, by its board of directors, not by delegation to Brown and/or others, but by ratification of a prior managerial demotion from officer to nonofficer in which Brown and perhaps others participated. As a vice-president, she was one of the officers expressly enumerated by the provision, whether or not she would be included among its \u201cother officers\u201d solely by virtue of her work as a branch manager. Likewise, under the undisputed facts, Bank of America dismissed Peatros altogether by its board of directors, not by delegation to Brown and/or others, but by ratification of a prior administrative termination mandated by its policy on extended medical absences. When it dismissed her altogether, she was not an officer and hence was not within the ambit of section 24, Fifth. But when it dismissed her as an officer, she surely was. As stated, the power to dismiss an officer includes the greater power to dismiss a person <em>who is an officer </em>and also the lesser power to dismiss the person <em>as an officer. </em>The bank now asserts that Peatros\u2019s extended medical absence prevented the effectiveness of its earlier dismissal of her as an officer until its later dismissal of her altogether. Such fact, if fact it be, is apparently not included among those that are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The Court of Appeal majority, however, were wrong to conclude that section 24, Fifth, preempts FEHA completely and in its entirety. As we have explained, section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA. As impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, does indeed preempt FEHA to the extent that it conflicts\u2014here, to the extent that it creates a remedy in the form of all relief generally available, including unlimited compensatory and punitive damages. But, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, does not preempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>FEHA to the extent that it does not conflict\u2014here, to the extent that it confers a right against dismissal on grounds including race and age.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In support of the Court of Appeal majority, Bank of America presents arguments that fail against our analysis as set forth above. For example, it asserts in substance that section 24, Fifth, which it effectively admits has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, amounts to a \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme occupying the entire field relating to national banks\u201d <em>(Aalgaard v. Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 688), or at least the entire field relating to their powers, and thereby preempts FEHA completely and in its entirety. We have already concluded otherwise. In making its claim to the contrary, it does so only in passing, and does not follow through. It also asserts in substance that, prior, to its implied amendment by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, would have preempted FEHA (had it then existed) completely and in its entirety. But today, after its implied amendment by Title VII and the ADEA, section 24, Fifth, does not. Finally, and fundamentally, it asserts that section 24, Fifth, even as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, preempts FEHA completely and in its entirety as threatening national uniformity. Not so. We state here what we have stated above. Insofar as FEHA conflicts with section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, it is preempted. To that extent, it cannot threaten national uniformity. But, insofar as FEHA does not conflict with section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, it is not preempted. To that extent, it does not threaten national uniformity. For, to that extent, it merely duplicates what the <em>Marques </em>court properly declared, and the bank itself effectively admits, to be the uniform \u201cnational standard enunciated\u201d in Title VII and the ADEA, by which section 24, Fifth, has been impliedly amended\u2014a standard, we repeat, that incorporates FEHA, with its rights and remedies, to the extent that it is consistent, to function as the primary mechanism in achieving the purpose of Title VII and the ADEA. <em>(Marques v. Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">For her part, the Court of Appeal dissenting justice was wrong to conclude that section 24, Fifth, which she recognized has been impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, does not preempt FEHA in any part or aspect whatsoever. To state it once more: Although section 24, Fifth, as impliedly amended by Title VII and the ADEA, does not preempt FEHA to the extent that it does not conflict, it does to the extent that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In support of the Court of Appeal dissenting justice, Peatros presents arguments that fail against our analysis as set forth above. For example, she asserts in substance that, in and of itself, section 24, Fifth, grants a national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>bank the power to dismiss any of its officers at pleasure by its board of directors <em>against the restraints of contract only but not those of law, </em>including FEHA. The power that the provision grants has been characterized as unlimited. As such, it operates generally against all restraints, legal as well as contractual. In urging her point, Peatros directs our view back from section 24, Fifth, through its proximate source in section 5136 of title 62 of the Revised Statutes of 1878, to its ultimate source in section 8 of the National Bank Act of 1864. Section 8, however, helps her not at all. For its background suggests, according to commentary on which she herself relies, that the power that it granted, it granted against the restraints of law as well as those of contract. (See Sinclair, <em>Employment at Pleasure: An Idea Whose Time Has Passed, supra, </em>23 U. Tol. L.Rev. at pp. 540-541 [stating that, at the time at which the National Bank Act of 1864 was enacted, \u201cif an employment contract was not for a definite term, then it was presumed\u201d at law \u201cto be for a year\u201d; and that, in light thereof, the \u201coriginal purpose\u201d of the \u201c \u2018at pleasure\u2019 language\u201d of section 8 \u201cwas to enable banks to remove officers who otherwise would be entitled, by law, to remain at least until the end of the year\u201d].) From all that appears, section 8 was concerned with the existence of restraints that might otherwise affect the power that it granted, and not with their nature or source\u2014including perhaps uncontemplated state antidiscrimination statutes. So to conclude accords fully with its purpose of promoting national banks as institutions and of furthering their integrity and stability in appearance and reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that we must reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and must remand the cause to that court with directions to reverse the judgment of the superior court and remand the cause in turn to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Werdegar, J., and Haning, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\"> The \u201cthree circumstances\u201d in which preemption of state law by federal law is found should not be understood to be \u201crigidly distinct.

It has been argued that the provision, \u201cdesigned to protect bank customers in the days before Federal deposit insurance, has no place in the modern banking industry, which needs to be able to offer certain employment prospects in order to attract management personnel of high quality.\u201d <em>(Kemper </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank in Newton </em>(1981) 94 Ill.App.3d 169, 171 [418 N.E.2d 819, 821].) The <em>Marques </em>court was evidently persuaded: \u201cNeedless to say, public trust in\u201d a national bank \u201cis no longer based primarily on community confidence in the personal integrity of its individual officers.\u201d <em>(Marques </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 363, fn. 5.) It nevertheless declined to act: \u201cIt is up to Congress ... to decide whether the . . . provision has therefore become entirely obsolete.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Whether or not the <em>Marques </em>court was right to be' persuaded, it was surely right to decline to act. It is not the role of a court to \u201creconsider\" the provision\u2019s underlying \u201cpolicy .... That task is for Congress\u201d\u2014and for Congress alone. <em>(Kemper </em>v. <em>First Nat.

It may be noted that, although, after codification, Congress has often amended the neighbors of section 24, Fifth, and has done so materially (see hist. notes, 12 U.S.C.A.

The bank then demoted her. The next day, plaintiff took an extended medical absence. Consistent with its policy, the bank terminated plaintiff when her medical absence exceeded 24 consecutive months.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Plaintiff sued, asserting, as here relevant, that she was demoted and terminated because of her race and age, in violation of California\u2019s Fair Housing and Employment Act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.; hereafter FEHA.)

A branch manager, as the title itself reveals, manages not the bank but only one of its many branches. <em>(Wells Fargo Bank v.

Instead, the lead opinion adopts a \u201cpartial\u201d preemption approach. It holds that plaintiff\u2019s FEHA cause of action is viable only to the extent it mirrors a cause of action under Title VII and the ADEA. (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 154, 172.) The lead opinion\u2019s theory is that Congress \u201cimpliedly amended\u201d section 24(5) of the National Bank Act when it enacted Title VII and the ADEA. (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 168-169.) The lead opinion reasons that because the preemptive effect of the National Bank Act does not extend to Title VII and the ADEA, and Title VII and the ADEA do not preempt state employment laws such as FEHA, the National Bank Act preempts FEHA only to the extent it exceeds the scope of Title VII and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The United States Supreme Court rejected similar reasoning in <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 85 [103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490] (hereafter <em>Shaw). </em>In that case the plaintiff employers sought a declaratory judgment that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.; hereafter ERISA) preempted the State of New York\u2019s antidiscrimination laws. The high court described the federal Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in that case as follows: \u201cThe Court of Appeals properly rejected the simplistic \u2018double saving clause\u2019 argument\u2014that because ERISA does not pre-empt Title VII, and Title VII does not pre-empt state fair employment laws, ERISA does not pre-empt such laws. [Citation.] Title VII does not transform state fair employment laws into federal laws that \u00a7 514(d) saves from ERISA pre-emption.\u201d <em>(Shaw, supra </em>at p. 101, fn. 22 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2902].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In <em>Shaw, </em>ERISA section 514(d) limited its own preemptive force by expressly providing: \u201cNothing in this title shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States ... or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(d); <em>Shaw, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 91 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2897].) The high court in <em>Shaw </em>held that it would impair enforcement of Title VII if ERISA preempted state laws prohibiting the same discriminatory acts that Title VII prohibits. By contrast, the National Bank Act at issue here contains no similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>self-imposed limitation on its preemptive force, a crucial distinction the lead opinion fails to recognize. Because the National Bank Act does not limit its preemptive effect, there is no basis for adopting a partial preemption analysis as the lead opinion does.  The National Bank Act\u2019s preemptive effect on state law causes of action is absolute and unqualified; it completely preempts FEHA in all cases involving bank \u201cofficers.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, I cannot join the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion of partial preemption of FEHA by the National Bank Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Because in my view plaintiff is not an officer within the meaning of the National Bank Act, I conclude that the National Bank Act does not preempt her FEHA state causes of action.

The absence of a clear consensus in this decisional authority reflects the lack of guidance from the United States Supreme Court or, more properly, the Congress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without such guidance, several plausible answers emerge from the analysis, but none is wholly persuasive or compelling because each depends upon the relative significance assigned the interpretive principles applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The rationale for full preemption derives from the fundamental conflict between federal law conferring at-will dismissal authority on boards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>directors to maintain bank stability and integrity and state laws qualifying that authority by imposing liability for termination of officers in violation of antidiscrimination statutes. (See <em>Aalgaard v. Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 674, 686-693 [274 Cal.Rptr. 81].) However, most courts finding full preemption merely cite <em>Ana Leon T. </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago </em>(6th Cir. 1987) 823 F.2d 928, 931, in which the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated without discussion, \u201cSection 4, Fifth, of the Federal Reserve Act . . . specifically provides that employees of a Federal Reserve Bank [such as the plaintiff] may be dismissed \u2018at pleasure.\u2019 This provision preempts any state-created employment right to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Kispert v.

Some decisions have with certain justification rejected this determination as \u201cmere ispe dixit\u201d: \u201cthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s pronouncement [in <em>Ana Leon T.] </em>gives no basis for its opinion and sets forth no policy reasons for its holding.\u201d <em>(Moodie v.

Some have concluded that \u201cnothing in the legislative history [of the National Bank Act] tend[s] to show congressional intent to preempt state-law discrimination claims. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(White v. Fed. Res. Bank, supra, </em>103 Ohio App.3d at p. 538 [660 N.E.2d at p. 496]; see <em>Moodie </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of New York, supra, </em>831 F.Supp. at pp. 336-337.) Others have determined \u201cthat Congress intended the \u2018at pleasure\u2019 language [of section 24, Fifth,] to mean \u2018at will\u2019 as applied in the common law. The purpose of the \u2018at pleasure\u2019 provision was to give national banks the \u2018greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their chief operating officers.\u2019 [Citation.] That latitude, however, was intended in a contractual sense.\u201d <em>(Mueller v. First Nat. Bank of the Quad Cities </em>(C.D.Ill. 1992) 797 F.Supp. 656, 663; see also <em>White v. Fed. Res. Bank, supra, </em>103 Ohio App.3d at p. 538 [660 N.E.2d at p. 496].) Still others, like the lead opinion in this case, have found no conflict between state law and the National Bank Act to the extent title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>VII)) or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq. (ADEA)) affords comparable remedies for discrimination in employment. <em>(Marques </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at pp. 363-364; <em>White </em>v. <em>Fed. Res. Bank, supra, </em>103 Ohio App.3d at pp. 538-539 [660 N.E.2d at p. 496]; <em>Moodie </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of New York </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1993) 835 F.Supp. 751, 753; <em>Moodie </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve of New York, supra, </em>831 F.Supp. at p. 337; but see <em>Bollow v. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, supra, </em>650 F.2d at p. 1100 [\u201cThe mere existence of [federal] age-discrimination statutes does not create job entitlements for government employees over a certain age.\u201d]; cf. <em>Aalgaard v. Merchants Nat. Bank, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 694 [state age discrimination claim preempted because bank with fewer than 20 employees not subject to ADEA].)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">This latter approach necessarily assumes that Title VII and the ADEA have impliedly repealed or amended section 24, Fifth. Few decisions, however, have critically analyzed the point. (See, e.g., <em>Marques </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 364; <em>White v. Fed. Res. Bank, supra, </em>103 Ohio App.3d at pp. 538-539 [660 N.E.2d at p. 496]; <em>Moodie </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of New York, supra, </em>831 F.Supp. at p. 337; see also <em>Ana Leon T. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, supra, </em>823 F.2d at pp. 931-932; <em>Mueller v. First Nat. Bank of the Quad Cities, supra, </em>797 F.Supp. at p. 662; <em>Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1989) 704 F.Supp. 441, 447-448; cf. <em>Jaffe v. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago </em>(N.D.Ill. 1984) 586 F.Supp. 106, 108 [assuming without discussion that \u201cat pleasure\u201d dismissal provision of Federal Reserve Act did not preempt claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981].) Here, the lead opinion engages in some discussion but fails to consider whether its conclusions comport with congressional intent as to either the National Bank Act or the antidiscrimination statutes. While it is possible Congress effected an implied partial repeal, such a result is generally disfavored. The legislative intent to do so must be clear and manifest <em>CTV A </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 153, 189-190 [98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117]), particularly to support a finding that a general statute has impliedly repealed a specific one <em>(United States v. United Continental Tuna </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 164, 168-169 [96 S.Ct. 1319, 47 L.Ed.2d 653]).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In my view, two critical reasons\u2014one grounded in congressional intent and policy, the other in pragmatics-\u2014warrant a finding that section 24, Fifth, fully preempts claims by bank officers for violation of California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq. (FEHA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">First, such a finding more fully accords with the underlying rationale for investing boards of directors with unfettered discretion to dismiss bank officers. \u201cNational banks are instrumentalities of the Federal government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>created for a public purpose, and as such necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States. It follows that an attempt by a State to define their duties or control the conduct of their affairs is absolutely void, wherever such attempted exercise of authority expressly conflicts with the laws of the United States, and either frustrates the purpose of the national legislation or impairs the efficiency of these agencies of the Federal government to discharge the duties, for the performance of which they were created. These principles are axiomatic\u201d to the nature of a national banking system. <em>(Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank </em>(1896) 161 U.S. 275, 283 [16 S.Ct. 502, 40 L.Ed. 700].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">More specifically, boards of directors must retain the fullest possible authority to terminate officers at will and without liability to maintain confidence in the financial integrity of their institutions. \u201c[B]ank officers are the vehicles through which the bank engages in transactions and performs legal acts; in this sense, the officers are the bank. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1082, 1091 [282 Cal.Rptr. 841, 811 P.2d 1025], italics omitted <em>{Wells Fargo).) </em>Among other attributes, they have \u201cthe express legal authority to bind the bank in its transactions with borrowers, depositors, customers, or other third parties by executing contracts or other legal instruments on the bank\u2019s behalf. [Citation.] [Their] decision-making authority, however it might be limited by bank rule or policy, relates to fundamental banking operations in such a manner as to affect potentially the public\u2019s trust in the banking institution. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Accordingly, \u201c[t]he purpose of the [\u2018at pleasure\u2019 dismissal] provision in the National Bank Act was to give those institutions the greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their chief operating officers, in order to maintain the public trust.\u201d <em>[Mackey </em>v. <em>Pioneer Nat. Bank </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 867 F.2d 520, 526.) \u201c \u2018[T]he power to dismiss a bank officer at will reflects the Congressional mandate to establish an independent national system in order to maintain the stability of, and promote the welfare of, national banks.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1089, quoting <em>Alegria v. Idaho First Nat. Bank </em>(1986) 111 Idaho 314, 316 [723 P.2d 858, 860]; <em>Aalgaard </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat. Bank, Inc., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 692.) As the court in <em>Westervelt v. Mohrenstecher </em>(8th Cir. 1896) 76 Fed. 118 observed more than a century ago: \u201cObservation and experience alike teach that it is essential to the safety and prosperity of banking institutions that the active officers, to whose integrity and discretion the moneys and property of the bank and its customers are intrusted, should be subject to immediate removal whenever the suspicion of faithlessness or negligence attaches to them. High credit is indispensable to the success and prosperity of a bank. Without it, customers cannot be induced to deposit their moneys. When it has once been secured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and then declines, those who have deposited demand their cash, the income of the bank dwindles, and often bankruptcy follows. It sometimes happens that, without any justification, a suspicion of dishonesty or carelessness attaches to a cashier or a president of a bank, spreads through the community in which he lives, scares the depositors, and threatens immediate financial ruin to the institution. In such a case it is necessary to the prosperity and success\u2014to the very existence\u2014of a banking institution that the board of directors should have power to remove such an officer, and to put in his place another, in whom the community has confidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 122; see also <em>Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1089.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In the era of global economies, this rationale is all the more compelling; we need not speculate that one individual can bring about the demise of a worldwide financial enterprise. Just as with contract actions, allowing a FEHA cause of action inhibits boards of directors from exercising their \u201cat pleasure\u201d discretion consistently with congressional intent. (See <em>Wells Fargo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1093.) \u201cThe effect would be to substitute [FEHA] for contract claims, thus subjecting the national bank to all the dangers attendant to dismissing an officer.\u201d <em>(Mackey v. Pioneer Nat. Bank, supra, </em>867 F.2d at p. 526.) Those dangers remain the same regardless of the underlying cause of action. Such claims would \u201cimpair[] the efficiency of these agencies of the Federal government to discharge the[ir] duties\u201d <em>(Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, supra, </em>161 U.S. at p. 283) and would \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>(Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 52, 67 [61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581]; cf. <em>Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. de la Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 156 [102 S.Ct. 3014, 3024, 73 L.Ed.2d 664].) Under the supremacy clause, state law must therefore yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The fact Congress may have chosen to qualify boards of directors\u2019 discretion by enacting Title VII and the ADEA does not undermine this conclusion. Absent a clear expression of such intent, amendment or repeal of one federal statute by another should not be read as an invitation to append analogous state laws to the national scheme. (Cf. <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 1, 16, fn. 11 [104 S.Ct. 852, 861, 79 L.Ed.2d 1].) Federal antidiscrimination laws apply uniformly throughout the country as to both substance and procedure. Banks can thus conform their conduct to one fixed standard, thereby facilitating the congressional goal of eradicating discriminatory employment practices. (Cf. <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>FDIC </em>(1997) 519 U.S. 213, 226-231 [117 S.Ct. 666, 674-676, 136 L.Ed.2d 656] [uniform national standard not necessary to achieve legislative goal and clear congressional intent to preserve state law standard even if more stringent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The value of uniformity underscores the second consideration supporting full preemption. A finding of partial preemption strikes at the essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>nature of a national banking system, which depends upon \u201cuniform and universal operation throughout the entire territorial limits of the country . . . .\u201d <em>(Talbott </em>v. <em>Silver Bow County </em>(1891) 139 U.S. 438, 443 [11 S.Ct. 594, 596, 35 L.Ed. 210].) While the system might tolerate a certain measure of local diversity, \u201cit would militate much against its national character\u201d if banks were subject to particular laws in one state but not in another. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As we have seen, courts are divided as to whether state antidiscrimination statutes survive section 24, Fifth. Moreover, each state has a different statutory scheme, both substantive and procedural. Thus, depending upon the jurisdiction in which a claim arose, a bank might or might not be subject to liability, the extent of which would remain uncertain until some court adjudicated the scope of the local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Furthermore, the lead opinion of necessity reserves questions of which specific provisions of FEHA are not in actual conflict with Title VII and the ADEA, and therefore survive preemption. (See also lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 176, fn. 8.) State and federal laws \u201cdiffer in reach, remedies and remedial fora, as well as in certain procedural standards.\u201d <em>(Marques </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 362, fn. 4.) For example, not only do Title VII and FEHA have different statutes of limitations, interpretation of those statutes diverges as well. (See <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Rockwell Internat., Inc. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 496-500 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114] [in construing accrual of cause of action under FEHA, court rejected reasoning of United States Supreme Court as to analogous provisions of Title VII].) Each facet of the law will become a point of preemptive contention with only the vaguest standard to guide the resolution. For this very reason, as the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Shaw v. Delta Airlines, Inc. </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 85 [103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490], that partial preemption \u201cmay cause certain practical problems. Courts and state agencies, rather than considering whether employment practices are unlawful under a broad state law, will have to determine whether they are prohibited by Title VII. If they are not, the state law will be superseded and the agency will lack authority to act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 105-106 [103 S.Ct. at p. 2904].) The necessity of such piecemeal determination burdens our judicial system and further impairs uniformity by creating uncertainty and ambiguity in the law. This a high price to pay for a cause of action that merely duplicates remedies already available under Title VII and the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Notwithstanding the enactment of federal antidiscrimination statutes, Congress has given no indication it intended to override section 24, Fifth, and subject banks to liability for dismissing officers in violation of state laws such as FEHA. (Cf. <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.A. v. Nelson </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 25, 34-35 [116 S.Ct. 1103, 1109-1110, 134 L.Ed.2d 237]; <em>Franklin Nat. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>Bank </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 373, 378 [74 S.Ct. 550, 553-554, 98 L.Ed. 767].) \u201cThe policy is one of long standing; the \u2018at pleasure\u2019 language has been in the statute for 131 years. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mardula </em>v. <em>Rancho Dominguez Bank, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 794.) It should not be lightly discarded, particularly when \u201cCongress has amended other portions of section 24, Title 12 numerous times, without altering paragraph 5 . . . .\u201d <em>(Kemper </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank in Newton </em>(1981) 94 Ill.App.3d 169, 172 [49 Ill.Dec. 799, 418 N.E.2d 819, 821].) For the foregoing reasons, I would find section 24, Fifth, preempts plaintiff\u2019s FEHA and other state law causes of action. I would disapprove <em>Marques </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th 356, to the extent it is inconsistent with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">George, C.

Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1991) 1991 Okla. 23 [809 P.2d 1298, 1302] [action permitted because \u201cpublic policy whose violation gives rise to [the wrongful termination] claim parallels that of the federal law which is sought to be invoked as a shield from liability\"]; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Old Nat. Bank </em>(N.D.W.Va. 1995) 900 F.Supp. 836, 843 [same]; see also <em>White </em>v. <em>Fed. Res. Bank </em>(1995) 103 Ohio App.3d 534, 538 [660 N.E.2d 493]; but see <em>Inglis v. Feinerman </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 701 F.2d 97, 99 [rejecting claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The National Bank Act, the Federal Reserve Act, and the Federal Home Loan Act contain the same \u201cat pleasure\u201d dismissal provision, and courts tend to cite interpretive authority interchangeably. (See <em>Osei-Bonsu v. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1989) 726 F.Supp. 95, 97-98.) I will do so as well without necessarily noting which act a particular case involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Division One, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
