We conclude the undisputed facts demonstrate the tool being used was not a die and, therefore, the injury was not caused by the operation of a power press without a point of operation guard. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The undisputed facts are taken from the parties\u2019 statements of undisputed facts and from other materials in support of and in opposition to defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Plaintiff was injured while operating a Wasino L3-J3 lathe in the manufacture of a small aluminum- knob. In this manufacturing process, the material being formed into the knob is held in a spindle, opposite which is a turret containing 12 different tooling stations. Directed in its operation by a computer, the turret brings the various tools into use to cut or otherwise form the metal. One of these tools was the V-notching tool, a carbide-point cutting tool. It was programmed to cut a .65-inch-long groove down the side of the knob being manufactured, making six passes along the knob to successively deepen the groove. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s hand was injured by the V-notching tool while it was in operation or being brought into operation. The lathe\u2019s safety sensor, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>was designed to prevent operation while the door was open, had been intentionally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The superior court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding section 4558 inapplicable in that \u201c[p]laintiff does not dispute that he was injured by a lathe which uses a sharp edge cutting tool rather than a \u2018mirror image\u2019 pressing or stamping die.\u201d The Court of Appeal reversed, rejecting the idea a power press necessarily employs a die that forms material into a \u201cmirror image\u201d of itself, as suggested in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1483 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 82]. Relying on a regulatory agency\u2019s definition, the appellate court held a power press is any mechanically powered machine that forms material by use of \u201ctools <em>or </em>dies\u201d attached to slides. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for review. Two days before the scheduled oral argument, the parties jointly moved to dismiss review on the ground they had settled all claims between them.  We denied the joint motion,- following \u201cthe well-established line of judicial authority recognizing an exception to the mootness doctrine, and permitting the court to decline to dismiss a case rendered moot by stipulation of the parties where the appeal raises issues of continuing public importance.\u201d <em>(Lundquist </em>v. <em>Reusser </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1193, 1202, fn. 8 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 875 P.2d 1279]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Eubanks </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 580, 584, fn. 2 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 927 P.2d 310]; <em>Baluyut v.

State Lands Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 50, 60-62 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 399, 900 P.2d 648].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">We begin with the statutory language. Subdivision (b) of section 4558 provides: \u201cAn employee, or his or her dependents in the event of the employee\u2019s death, may bring an action at law for damages against the employer where the employee\u2019s injury or death is proximately caused by the employer\u2019s knowing removal of, or knowing failure to install, a point of operation guard on a power press, and this removal or failure to install is specifically authorized by the employer under conditions known by the employer to create a probability of serious injury or death.\u201d Subdivision (a)(4) of section 4558 provides: \u201c \u2018Power press\u2019 means any material-forming machine that utilizes a die which is designed for use in the manufacture of other products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Although this court has not previously discussed the definition, of power press in section 4558, subdivision (a)(4), two Court of Appeal decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>prior to the decision below have done so in a manner pertinent to the present case. <em>(Ceja v. J. R. Wood, Inc. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1372 [242 Cal.Rptr. 531] <em>(Ceja); Graham </em>v. <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 1483 <em>(Graham).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In <em>Ceja, </em>the plaintiff had been injured while operating a hand-held circular saw. The appellate court held the saw was not a power press because the saw blade was not a die. Referring to a dictionary definition of a die as \u201cany of various tools or devices ... for molding, stamping, cutting or shaping,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to a regulatory definition of a die as \u201c[t]he tooling used in a press for cutting or forming material\u201d (former Cal. Admin. Code [now Cal. Code Regs.], tit. 8, \u00a7 4188), the court explained: \u201cA die usually forms material. It can cut material. It cuts things in a substantially different way, however, from a saw blade. [\u00b6] Unlike a die, a saw blade cuts material with a sharp edge or sharp-edged teeth.\u201d <em>(Ceja, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1376, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><em>Graham </em>elaborated on <em>Ceja's </em>distinction between a die and a blade. In <em>Graham, </em>the plaintiff was injured while operating a Festo wood-molding machine. The machine had five cutting heads, past which wooden boards were moved. A rotating blade attached to each cutting head performed a cutting or planing operation on the boards. <em>(Graham, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1486.) The <em>Graham </em>court noted a common characteristic in all the devices mentioned in the dictionary definition quoted in <em>Ceja: </em>\u201c[I]n each case the shape of the \u2018die\u2019 itself determines the shape of the product that is formed. That is, in each case, the product formed or the cut made is in some sense a \u2018mirror image\u2019 of the die. Of course, that is not true of a saw blade or the Festo machine cutting heads. In short, the cutting heads do not fall within the common definition of the word \u2018die.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Graham, supra, </em>at p. 1488.) The <em>Graham </em>court went on to reject the definition of \u201cdie\u201d proposed by the plaintiff in that case\u2014\u201c \u2018a device which shapes materials\u2019 \u201d\u2014as so broad that it would render the term without meaning or purpose in section 4558 and as potentially including, contrary to common usage, such instruments as \u201ca chisel, a pair of scissors or a whittling knife.\u201d <em>(Graham, supra, </em>at p. 1488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The Court of Appeal below disagreed with <em>Graham's </em>approach. Citing the regulatory definition quoted in <em>Ceja </em>as well as an unabridged dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>definition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court found it \u201capparent. . . that a \u2018die,\u2019 as that term is used in section 4558, should be very broadly construed and necessarily includes any cutting or forming tools which are <em>utilized in a power press. </em>Obviously, this will include tools which operate in ways other than being pressed or stamped into material in order to make a mirror image.\u201d (Italics in original.) Without further addressing the nature of a die, the lower court adopted a definition of \u201cpower operated presses\u201d from safety standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 4188, subd. (b)): \u201call mechanically powered machines that shear, punch, form, or assemble metal or other materials by means of tools or dies attached to slides . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Defendant endorses the <em>Graham </em>court\u2019s analysis, according to which a die forms material by imparting to the material some version of the die\u2019s own shape, and contends the Court of Appeal below erred in omitting from its definition of \u201cpower press\u201d the statutory element that the press use a die as distinguished from a cutting blade or other tool. Plaintiff contends <em>Graham </em>erred in this respect and agrees with the Court of Appeal below that a die should instead be broadly understood as a material-forming tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We agree with defendant and the <em>Graham </em>court. From the dictionary definitions previously quoted (see fns. 1 &amp; 2, <em>ante), </em>as well as others we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>have consulted,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the term \u201cdie\u201d clearly denotes not <em>all </em>material-forming tools, but a subset of such tools. The devices described in dictionary definitions of \u201cdie\u201d generally share two pertinent characteristics. First, they impart form to the material by impact or pressure <em>against </em>the material, rather than <em>along </em>the material. Second, they impart to the material some version of the die\u2019s own shape. The two characteristics are logically related, since the die, acting by impact against the material, can only alter the form of the material where it impacts it, necessarily leaving an impression or cutout of its own shape (unlike a linear cutting blade that, moving along the surface of the material, can be directed to cut out any desired shape). The first characteristic (impact or pressure against or through the material) particularly describes dies used in <em>presses </em>and hence limits the term as used in section 4558, subdivision (a)(4); but, because the first characteristic necessarily implies the second, the <em>Graham </em>court did not err in treating the second characteristic as a test of whether a tool is a die within the meaning of section 4558, subdivision (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In all its pertinent uses, then, the term \u201cdie\u201d refers to a tool that imparts shape to material by pressing or impacting against or through the material, that is, by punching, stamping or extruding; in none of its uses does the term refer to a tool that imparts shape by cutting <em>along </em>the material in the manner of a blade. As it is undisputed the V-notching tool at issue in this case formed the material by cutting along its surface, the superior court correctly concluded the tool was, as a matter of law, not a die.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">It may be that one or more types of dies referred to in the quoted dictionary definitions are exceptions to the above general principles in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>they act to shape material by means other than by pressing or impacting against or through the material. Assuming that to be so, however, we nonetheless do not believe the Legislature intended the term \u201cdie\u201d in section 4558, subdivision (a)(4)\u2014a die used in a power press\u2014to be understood more broadly than as a tool that imparts shape to material by pressing or impacting against or through the material, that is, by punching, stamping or extruding. Indeed, as the <em>Graham </em>court noted, the Legislature presiimably believed the operation of power <em>presses </em>without point of operation guards to be particularly dangerous, because a press typically forms or cuts the material by use of high pressure or strong impact of the die.against or through the material, using a \u201cpowerful pressing or stamping motion which can cause serious crush injuries.\u201d <em>(Graham, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 1490.) In defining a \u201cpower press,\u201d for purposes of section 4558,\" in terms of a \u201cdie,\u201d the Legislature patently intended to embody the characteristic that differentiates \u201cpress[es]\u201d from other \u201cmaterial-forming machinefs],\u201d i.e., the use of a tool that imparts shape to material by pressing or impacting against or through the material, that is, by punching, stamping or extruding.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">That the definition of \u201cpower press\u201d promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 4188, subd. (b)), upon which the appellate court below relied, may be broader than that in section 4558 in its inclusion of other \u201ctools\u201d as well as dies is of no significance in interpreting section 4558.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board is not charged with enforcing section 4558\u2019s exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity. Nor was that board\u2019s definition of power press promulgated under the authority of section 4558 of as a purported interpretation of that statute; rather, the cited authority for the regulation -is Labor Code section 142.3, which merely grants the board the power to adopt occupational safety and health standards. In any event, section 4558 provides its own definition of \u201cpower press\u201d\u2014a definition that limits the category to machines using dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Large power-operated machines of many kinds may present dangers similar to those presented by the narrower class of machines defined in section 4558, and the government may rationally prescribe various safety procedures and mechanisms for that broader class of machines. This does not affect the Legislature\u2019s decision to select certain machines only, and certain kinds of injury only, for an exception to the exclusive jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the workers\u2019 compensation system over employees\u2019 workplace injuries. Even if we were convinced point of operation guards were as essential for the safe operation of power lathes as for power presses, and observed that a regulatory agency had taken steps to ensure power lathes are so equipped, we could not rewrite section 4558 to include what has been omitted. (See <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Zahniser Graphics, Inc. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 107, 111 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 871] [plaintiff \u201cmisses the mark\u201d with argument that a printing press should be considered a power press because the \u201c \u2018gravity of harm\u2019 \u201d arising from its use is similar].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Relying on a portion of his own deposition in which he asserted the V-notching tool cuts by \u201cimpact,\u201d plaintiff contends a triable issue of fact remains, even under the <em>Graham </em>approach, because the tool may have actually cut by a stamping motion. Plaintiff, however, formally agreed the following fact was undisputed: \u201cDuring the manufacture of the aluminum knob . . . the V-Notching tool creates a V-notch on the knob by moving down the side of the knob and making a cut which is .65 inches in length.\u201d This undisputed fact is inconsistent with his suggestion, made for the first time on appeal, that the tool cuts by stamping rather than by slicing or pushing the material along the line of the cut. In context, moreover, plaintiff\u2019s deposition claim that the tool cut by \u201cimpact\u201d could not have referred to a stamping motion, since he agreed, at the same time, that in operation the tool was \u201csliding\u2014or cutting along the length of the material,\u201d was \u201cin contact with the material,\u201d was \u201cmoving down the side of the knob as the knob is held in the spindle,\u201d and that .65 inches was \u201cthe length of the travel of the cut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Finally, in what plaintiff lauds as \u201ca master stroke of legal acuity,\u201d the appellate court below held it was not enough for defendant to demonstrate that the V-notching tool, the only tool in operation at the time of plaintiff\u2019s injury, is not a die; defendant could prevail on summary judgment only by showing that <em>none </em>of the 12 tools installed on the Wasino L3-J3 lathe are dies. The court reasoned that because section 4558 applies to specified injuries in the use of a power press, and defines a power press as a \u201cmaterial-forming machine that utilizes a die\u201d (\u00a7 4558, subd. (a)(4)), the statute applies whether or not the machine was using a die at the time of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">We are less impressed with this reasoning than is plaintiff. Section 4558 applies only to injuries proximately caused by the employer\u2019s knowing removal of, or failure to install, a point of operation guard on a power press. (\u00a7 4558, subd. (b).) An injury caused by the operation of a machine that <em>could </em>operate as a power press, but was not so operating at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>injury, would not be proximately caused by the employer\u2019s removal of, or failure to install, a point of operation guard on a power press. As the evident intent of the statute was to provide a greater remedy for those workers injured in power <em>press </em>accidents, moreover, it would make no sense to interpret the statute as applying, as well, when the worker was operating, say, a power <em>lathe, </em>even if the same machine could, under other circumstances, have been used as a press. That the undisputed facts demonstrate the V-notching tool is not a die was, therefore, sufficient to support the grant of summary judgment to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In summary, section 4558\u2019s exemption from workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity applies, by the statute\u2019s own plain and express terms, only to material-forming machines utilizing a die; contrary to the appellate decision below, machines using other types of tools to cut material are not within the statute\u2019s application, even if they would meet a regulatory agency\u2019s definition of power press.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">George, C.

The majority, apparently concluding that it raises an important question of law, retained jurisdiction and now determine that the Wasino L3-J3 is not a power press. In my view, the case should have been dismissed. It now has no significance for the parties and is of limited precedential value: it properly involves only a question of fact as to whether a single machine was used by plaintiff Hector Rosales as power press; the point is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s result. They determine that Rosales, who was injured after defendant Depuy Ace Medical Company intentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>removed a point of operation guard from the Wasino L3-J3, could not seek a tort remedy under Labor Code section 4558 because the machine is not a power press within the meaning of the statute. They do so based on a handful of common dictionary definitions of the word \u201cdie\u201d\u2014excluding other definitions that would be inconsistent with their result, and dismissing as \u201cof no significance\u201d the regulatory definitions of the Occupational Safety and Health Standard Board.

They assert that a die must \u201cimpart form to the material by impact or pressure <em>against </em>the material\u201d and impart \u201csome version of the die\u2019s own shape.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 285, italics in original.) I am not persuaded. Even the dictionaries consulted by the majority suggest otherwise. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 285, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The statute merely requires that the machine in question be \u201cmaterial-forming\u201d and that it \u201cutilize[] a die which is designed for use in the manufacture of other products.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4558, subd. (a)(4).) It appears that Rosales, an experienced machinist who operated the Wasino L3-J3 for over a decade, thought he was using a power press; so did his supervisor. Much of the expert testimony in the record\u2014including that of a mechanical engineer with 32 years of experience in machine safety\u2014is inconsistent with the conclusion that the Wasino L3-J3 is not a power press.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In my view, this dispute was not properly subject to resolution by way of summary judgment in light of the numerous disputed issues of material fact, such as whether the machine was in fact operating <em>by impact against the material </em>when Rosales was injured. In addition, as the Court of Appeal correctly ruled, summary judgment was inappropriate because there was no determination that the Wasino L3-J3 does not operate as a power press in <em>all </em>of its numerous functions; i.e., liability could apply even if a die were not in operation at the time of injury, so long as the machine itself may be used as a power press. These were questions for a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
