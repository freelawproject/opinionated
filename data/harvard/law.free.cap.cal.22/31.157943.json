We conclude section 2034 does not require the submission of an expert witness declaration for a treating physician, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Plaintiff Faith Dawn Schreiber was involved in an automobile accident with Donald Wayne Kiser. Schreiber alleged she had suffered neck and back injuries as a result. Kiser subsequently died of causes unrelated to the accident, and Schreiber sued his estate and the City of Huntington Beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">During discovery, Schreiber designated as expert witnesses, but did not submit expert witness declarations for, seven treating physicians. In response to a motion <em>in limine, </em>the trial court ruled the physicians could \u201ctestify as percipient witnesses but not as experts.\u201d At trial, Schreiber called two of the designated physicians as expert witnesses. As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, these physicians were precluded from opining that Schreiber\u2019s injuries were caused by the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The defense stipulated to Kiser\u2019s negligence. The jury returned a defense verdict, specifically finding Kiser\u2019s negligence did not cause Schreiber\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The Court of Appeal affirmed. The court stated the ordinary role of a treating physician is to give percipient testimony regarding what he observed, concluded, and did. Once a treating physician offers opinion testimony regarding causation, he exceeds this ordinary role, and becomes a retained expert within the meaning of section 2034, subdivision (a)(2). Thus, an expert witness declaration is required. The court stated, \u201cto the degree that Schreiber\u2019s treating physicians were going to be used to show that her particular aches and pains were caused by the auto accident as distinct from some preexisting event, they . . . were going to offer opinion, not percipient, testimony. None of Schreiber\u2019s experts actually observed the auto accident which . . . prompted her suit. Absent the required expert witness declaration the trial judge was thus thoroughly correct to preclude [causation] testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Schreiber\u2019s petition for rehearing was denied. We granted her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Under section 2034, subdivision (a), any party may demand the exchange of expert witness information. In this exchange, a party may provide either \u201c[a] list setting forth the name and address of any person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at the trial\u201d or \u201c[a] statement that the party does not presently intend to offer the testimony of any expert witness.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f)(1)(A), (B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">For an expert witness who \u201cis a party or an employee of a party,\u201d or, as relevant here, \u201chas been retained by a party for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion in anticipation of the litigation or in preparation for the trial of the action\u201d (\u00a7 2034, subd. (a)(2)), \u201cthe exchange shall also include or be accompanied by an expert witness declaration . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f)(2); <em>Bonds v. Roy </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 140, 144 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 289, 973 P.2d 66] [declaration requirement applies to <em>\u201ccertain </em>expert witnesses\u201d (italics added)].) Failure to submit such a declaration may result in exclusion of the expert opinion. (\u00a7 2034, subd. (j)(2).) The question here is whether a treating physician becomes a \u201cretained\u201d expert within the meaning of subdivision (a)(2), requiring the submission of an expert witness declaration, whenever the physician gives opinion testimony. (\u00a7 2034, subds. (a)(2), (f)(2).) For the reasons that follow, we conclude he does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">At the outset, we note that the treating physicians in this case were designated as <em>expert </em>witnesses. (\u00a7 2034, subds. (a)(1), (f)(1)(A).) By its terms, subdivision (f)(1)(A) requires \u201c[a] list setting forth the name and address of any person <em>whose expert opinion </em>that party expects to offer in evidence at the trial.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, defendants were on notice at the time of the designation that plaintiff intended to offer opinion testimony by her treating physicians. Indeed, by definition, an \u201cexpert\u201d witness is one entitled to give opinion testimony. Evidence Code section 801 provides that an expert\u2019s opinion testimony must generally be \u201c[r]elated to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact; and [\u00b6] [b]ased on matter (including his special knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education) perceived by or personally known to the witness or made known to him . . . .\u201d Thus, a treating physician does not <em>become </em>an expert only when nonpercipient opinion testimony is elicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">As noted, the declaration requirement applies to only \u201ccertain\u201d expert witnesses, i.e., those who are parties, employees of parties, or are \u201cretained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>by a party for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion in anticipation of the litigation or in preparation for the trial . . . (\u00a7 2034, subd. (a)(2); <em>Bonds v. Roy, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 144.) A treating physician generally falls into none of these categories. This is explained in section 2034\u2019s legislative history. Prior to the Civil Discovery Act of 1986, a party was required to describe the general substance of the expected testimony of every expert witness. (Former \u00a7 2037.3, as amended by Stats. 1982, ch. 1400, \u00a7 3, p. 5337.) That is no longer the case. As Professor Hogan, who was the Reporter for the State Bar/Judicial Council Joint Commission on Discovery that proposed the Civil Discovery Act of 1986, states, section 2034, subdivision (a)(1), does \u201crequire[] the designation [of] any expert that the parties to the exchange intend to use at trial, even if that expert\u2019s knowledge and opinion has been acquired independently of the trial preparation activities of the side designating him.\u201d (State Bar/Judicial Council J. Com. on Discovery, Proposed Cal. Civil Discovery Act of 1986, and Reporter\u2019s Notes (Reporter\u2019s Notes), notes on \u00a7 2034, subd. (a)(1), reprinted in 2 Hogan &amp; Weber, Cal. Civil Discovery (1997) appen. C, p. 455.) Hence, treating physicians who will testify as experts must be listed, as they were in this case. However, unlike former section 2037.3, \u201c[a]lthough any person who will be called at trial to give expert testimony must be included on [this] list . . . , the designation of an expert who is an employee of a party or has been specially retained to give expert testimony requires additional disclosure in the form of an expert witness declaration .... The limitation of this additional disclosure duty to employed or retained experts . . . makes a slight change in existing law. Since a percipient expert acquires his information independently of the party that expects to be calling him, such expert is more like a fact witness. . . . [I]t [has been] held that compelled disclosure of the anticipated testimony of fact witnesses constitutes an invasion of the absolute protection given by the work product doctrine to the thought processes of an attorney in preparation for trial.\u201d (Reporter's Notes, notes on \u00a7 2034, subd. (a)(1), reprinted in 2 Hogan &amp; Weber, Cal. Civil Discovery, <em>supra, </em>appen. C, p. 455.) \u201cSuch an expert would be someone who has acquired, independently of the litigation, personal knowledge of relevant facts, and whose training, skill, and experience enables him or her to form an opinion about those facts . . . .\u201d (1 Hogan &amp; Weber, Cal. Civil Discovery, <em>supra, </em>Expert Witness Disclosure, \u00a7 10.6, p. 543.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">A treating physician is a percipient expert, but that does not mean that his testimony is limited only to personal observations. Rather, like any other expert, he may provide both fact and opinion testimony. As the legislative history clarifies, what distinguishes the treating physician from a retained expert is not the content of the testimony, but the context in which he became familiar with the plaintiff\u2019s injuries that were ultimately the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of litigation, and which form the factual basis for the medical opinion. The contextual nature of the inquiry is implicit in the language of section 2034, subdivision (a)(2), which describes a retained expert as one \u201cretained by a party <em>for the purpose </em>of forming and expressing an opinion in anticipation of the litigation or in preparation for the trial of the action.\u201d (Italics added.) A treating physician is not consulted for litigation purposes, but rather learns of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and medical history because of the underlying physician-patient relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The conclusion that treating physicians generally are not experts \u201cretained\u201d within the meaning of section 2034, subdivision (a)(2) is supported by subdivision (i)(2), and similar language in Government Code section 68092.5, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These provisions clearly differentiate between the retained expert described in subdivision (a)(2), for whom an expert witness declaration is required, and a treating physician expert witness. Subdivision (i)(2) provides, \u201cA party desiring to depose any expert witness, other than a party or employee of a party, who is either (A) an expert described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) except one who is a party or an employee of a party, (B) <em>a treating physician and surgeon or other treating health care practitioner who is to be asked during the deposition to express opinion testimony, including opinion or factual testimony regarding the past or present diagnosis or prognosis made by the practitioner or the reasons for a particular treatment decision made by the practitioner, </em>but not including testimony requiring only the reading of words and symbols contained in the relevant medical record or, if those words and symbols are not legible to the deponent, the approximation by the deponent of what those words or symbols are, or (C) an architect, professional engineer, or licensed land surveyor, who was involved with the original project design or survey for which he or she is asked to express an opinion within his or her expertise and relevant to the action or proceeding, shall pay the expert\u2019s reasonable and customary hourly or daily fee for any time spent at the deposition . . . .\u201d (Italics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The implication of these sections is that expert witness treating physicians are not included within the meaning of subdivision (a)(2). (See <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 753, 754, 756 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 358] [expert witness declaration not required for treating physician to give opinion testimony]; <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>Western Medical Center </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1198, 1202-1203 [272 Cal.Rptr. 324] [plaintiff not required to produce treating physicians designated as experts for deposition because they were not \u201cretained\u201d within the meaning of subdivisions (a)(2) and (i)(2)].) Indeed, it would be difficult to interpret subdivision (a)(2) in a contrary fashion without rendering subdivision (i)(2) superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Such a conclusion is also consistent with the discovery statutes as a whole. The identity and opinions of a party\u2019s retained experts are generally privileged unless they are going t\u00f3 testify at trial. (Kennedy &amp; Martin, Cal. Expert Witness Guide (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 1999) \u00a7 10.6, p. 254.2.) Thus, were the physicians in this case consulted solely for the purpose of assisting counsel in, for example, assessing plaintiff\u2019s injuries, their identity and opinions would generally not have been discoverable. If an expert\u2019s opinion does not support the position of the hiring party, that party can effectively \u201cbury\u201d the witness by not calling the witness at trial and not otherwise disclosing his identity or opinion. (See 2 Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1998) \u00b6 8:1616.2, p. 8I-31 rev. #1 1996 [advising counsel to have consulting physician verbally report evaluation if opinion is negative and to instruct physician not to make written report to avoid disclosure of his identity and opinion under \u00a7 2032].)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Moreover, whether a retained expert will testify need not be revealed until shortly before trial. (\u00a7 2034, subd. (b) [\u201cA party shall make this demand no later than the 10th day after the initial trial date has been set, or 70 days before that trial date, whichever is closer to the trial date.\u201d].) It makes sense in this situation that the Legislature would require the person presenting the expert to submit an expert witness declaration. The information contained in this declaration<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> allows the parties to assess within a short time frame \u201cwhether to take the expert\u2019s deposition, to fully explore the relevant subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>area at any such deposition, and to select an expert who can respond with a competing opinion on that subject area.\u201d <em>(Bonds v. Roy, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">By contrast, the identity and opinions of treating physicians are not privileged. Rather, because they acquire the information that forms the factual basis for their opinions independently of the litigation, they are subject to no special discovery restrictions. (2 Hogan &amp; Weber, Cal. Civil Discovery, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.13, pp. 221-222; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 13.14, pp. 222-224.) They can be identified early in the litigation through interrogatories, production of the plaintiff\u2019s medical records, and completion of case questionnaires which by statute expressly ask for information regarding \u201ctreating physicians.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 93, subd. (c), 2030, 2031, 2032, subds. (i), (j).) Indeed, defendants have a strong incentive to depose treating physicians well prior to the exchange of expert information to ascertain whether their observations and conclusions support the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. (See Kennedy &amp; Martin, Cal. Expert Witness Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 10.8, pp. 255-256.) Conceivably, some treating physicians may ultimately become defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Accordingly, the Legislature has apparently determined that by the time of the exchange of expert witness information, the information required by the expert witness declaration is unnecessary for treating physicians who remain in their traditional role.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is evidenced by the fact that not all of the requirements of section 2034, subdivision (f)(2) regarding the content of an expert witness declaration apply to a treating physician. It seems unlikely the Legislature would create requirements for certain experts with which a party could never comply. For example, a treating physician does not work for the party, and hence it is possible he may not \u201cagree[] to testify at the trial,\u201d but have to be subpoenaed. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f)(2)(C).) A requirement that the expert has \u201cagreed to testify\u201d is understandable in the retained-expert context so that an opposing party knows the expert is sufficiently committed that it should expend the resources to depose the expert. Moreover, the party has no control over whether the treating physician \u201cwill be sufficiently familiar with the pending action to submit to a meaningful oral deposition concerning the specific testimony, including any opinion and its basis, that the expert is expected to give at trial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f)(2)(D.) Indeed, at this point in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>litigation, the treating physician has probably already been deposed. In addition, the Legislature was apparently concerned that requiring counsel to provide \u201c[a] brief narrative statement of the general substance of the testimony that the expert is expected to give\u201d for treating physicians and other percipient experts would violate the work product doctrine. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f)(2)(B); Reporter's Notes, notes on \u00a7 2034, subd. (f)(2)(B), reprinted in 2 Hogan &amp; Weber, Cal. Civil Discovery, <em>supra, </em>appen. C, p. 455.) Finally, our interpretation avoids assigning trial judges the near-impossible task of determining whether an expert witness treating physician is providing percipient or opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Thus, rather than encouraging gamesmanship, the Civil Discovery Act of 1986 places litigants on roughly equal footing. To the extent a physician is retained \u201cfor the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion in anticipation of the litigation or in preparation for the trial of the action,\u201d his identity and opinions are generally privileged unless he testifies. (\u00a7 2034, subd. (a)(2).) Should the physician testify, an expert witness declaration is required. On the other hand, to the extent a physician acquires personal knowledge of the relevant facts independently of the litigation, his identity and opinions based on those facts are not privileged in litigation presenting \u201can issue concerning the condition of the patient.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 996; 1 Hogan &amp; Weber, Cal. Civil Discovery, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.19, p. 437; 2 Hogan &amp; Weber, Cal. Civil Discovery, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12:11, p. 62; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 12.24, pp. 110-111.) For such a witness, no expert witness declaration is required, and he may testify as to any opinions formed on the basis of facts independently acquired and informed by his training, skill, and experience. This may well include opinions regarding causation and standard of care because such issues are inherent in a physician\u2019s work. An opposing party would therefore be prudent to ask a treating physician at his deposition whether he holds any opinions on these subjects, and if so, in what manner he obtained the factual underpinning of those opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Defendants rely on <em>Plunkett v. Spaulding </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 114 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 377], which in dicta upheld the exclusion of the treating physicians\u2019 standard of care testimony, stating, \u201cexpert witness declarations would not have been required if the treating physicians were expected to testify only as to their treatment of plaintiff, including diagnosis and prognosis. However, when in addition to this testimony they were asked to provide expert opinions on the standard of care that defendant should have used in treating plaintiff,\u201d they became \u201cretained\u201d experts within the meaning of section 2034, subdivision (a)(2), and declarations were required. (52 Cal.App.4th at pp. 119-120.) To the extent <em>Plunkett </em>concluded a treating physician could never, regardless of the manner in which he obtained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>factual basis of his opinion, testify as to standard of care without an expert witness declaration, we disagree for the reasons discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Defendants assert that even if the trial court erred in precluding the doctors\u2019 causation testimony, such error was not prejudicial. Because of its disposition, the Court of Appeal did not address this issue. We will therefore let it do so in the first instance. (See <em>People v. Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 510 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">George, C.

(a)(2).) We need not explore the parameters of such a metamorphosis in this opinion. Here, defendants do not contend the witnesses in question were not treating physicians. Rather, they contend that a causation opinion is per se outside the role of a treating physician because it requires information from the patient or other sources, and is not based solely on the physician\u2019s personal observations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"><em>Plunkett v.
