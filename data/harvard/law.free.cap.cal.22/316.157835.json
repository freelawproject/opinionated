(See, e.g., <em>Grenier </em>v. <em>Vermont Log Bldgs., Inc. </em>(1st Cir. 1996) 96 F.3d 559; <em>King v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours and Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1993) 996 F.2d 1346, cert. dism.

Cir. 1984) 736 F.2d 1529 [237 App.D.C. 164].)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">While we are not bound by decisions of the lower federal courts, even on federal questions, they are persuasive and entitled to great weight. <em>(People v. Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 86 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Where lower federal precedents are divided or lacking, state courts must necessarily make an independent determination of federal law <em>(Rohr Aircraft Corp. v. County of San Diego </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 759, 764 [336 P.2d 521], revd. without comment on this point (1960) 362 U.S. 628 [80 S.Ct. 1050, 4 L.Ed.2d 1002]), but where the decisions of the lower federal courts on a federal question are \u201cboth numerous and consistent,\u201d we should hesitate to reject their authority <em>(Conrad v. Bank of America </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 133, 150 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 336]).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The federal court decisions holding that FIFRA preempts state law failure-to-warn claims are numerous, consistent, pragmatic and powerfully reasoned. As discussed below, we find their analysis persuasive and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal reaching the contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Under FIFRA, all pesticides sold in the United States must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the registration application, manufacturers must submit draft label language addressing a number of different topics, including ingredients, directions for use (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 152.50 (1999)), and any information of which they are aware regarding \u201cunreasonable adverse effects of the pesticide on man or the environment.\u201d (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 152.50(f)(3).) Prior to registering a pesticide, the EPA must find that its labeling complies with FIFRA\u2019s requirements. (\u00a7 136a(c)(5)(B).) This includes the EPA\u2019s determination that the pesticide is not \u201cmisbranded.\u201d (See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 152.112(f).) A pesticide is misbranded if, inter alia, its label \u201cdoes not contain a warning or caution statement which may be necessary and ... is adequate to protect health and the environment.\u201d (\u00a7 136(q)(G).) In addition, the EPA must find that the pesticide, when used in accordance with its labeling, \u201cwill perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.\u201d (\u00a7 136a(c)(5)(C).) \u201cUnreasonable adverse effects on the environment\u201d are defined as \u201cany unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide.\u201d (\u00a7 136(bb).) Finally, FIFRA provides that a state \u201cshall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling ... in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.\u201d (\u00a7 136v(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Defendant Bayer Corporation (Bayer) manufactures the pesticides Guthion and Morestan, the labels of which were approved by the EPA. The label for Guthion states that application to walnuts to kill codling moths and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>other insects is a recommended use, with the recommended amount being three to four pounds per acre as a full-coverage spray. The label for Morestan states that application to walnuts to kill aphids and mites is a recommended use, with the recommended amount being one to one and one-half pounds per 100 gallons of water as a full-coverage spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Plaintiffs operate walnut orchards and purchased Guthion and Morestan from defendant Tri-Ag Service, Inc. (Tri-Ag). Defendant Paul Osterlie, a pest control adviser licensed in' California and a Tri-Ag employee, recommended a combined application of Guthion and Morestan at three pounds each per treated acre, along with other materials, and water delivered in an aggregate of 125 gallons of material per acre. Plaintiffs followed Osterlie\u2019s recommendations and applied the combination of Guthion and Morestan to three orchards, resulting in approximately $150,000 damage to their walnut crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Plaintiffs sued Tri-Ag, Osterlie, and Bayer for negligence, strict liability for ultrahazardous activity, negligence per se, products liability, breach of implied warranty, misrepresentation, and trespass. Defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that all of the causes of action, in effect, challenged the adequacy of the warnings on Guthion\u2019s and Morestan\u2019s EPA-approved labels, and thus were preempted by FIFRA. In two summary judgment rulings, the trial court agreed, holding that all of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action \u201callege inadequate labeling in one form or another,\u201d with the \u201cmain issue being the failure of the labels to warn against mixing chemicals.\u201d In addition, the court held plaintiffs failed to produce evidence indicating a cause of action for negligence against defendants Tri-Ag and Osterlie, and, as to the cause of action for misrepresentation, failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to intent to defraud on the part of defendants. The Court of Appeal reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Recognizing that the overwhelming majority of the courts examining the question have concluded FIFRA preempts state law failure-to-warn claims, the Court of Appeal asked itself how \u201cthe bulk of the case law [had] gone astray.\u201d There were two answers, the court found. One was the perceived failure of the other courts to draw the correct lesson from <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407] <em>(Cipollone), </em>in which the Supreme Court held the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 preempted state law failure-to-warn actions. Specifically, the Court of Appeal argued, \u201cthe case law goes wrong in failing to consider, as the proper analogy, the preemption provision of the Cigarette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965,\u201d which the high court held does not bar common law actions. The second was the failure of the other courts \u201cto consider adequately\u201d the text of the FIFRA preemption provision (\u00a7 136v(b)) in light of the rest of the statute, particularly subdivision (a) of section 136v. The one case that got it right, in the view of the Court of Appeal, was <em>Ferebee </em>v. <em>Chevron Chemical Co., supra, </em>736 F.2d 1529 <em>(Ferebee).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\n<em>A. Cipollone, the Preemption Provisions of the 1965 and 1969 Cigarette Acts, and the Lessons to Be Drawn for FIFRA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, the plaintiff, a woman who ultimately died of lung cancer after years of smoking, sued cigarette manufacturers under state common law for failure to warn consumers of the dangers of smoking. The manufacturers argued state law failure-to-warn actions were preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 (Pub.L. No. 89-92 (July 27, 1965) 79 Stat. 282, codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq.) (the 1965 Cigarette Act) and its successor, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (Pub.L. No. 91-222 (Apr. 1, 1970) 84 Stat. 87, amending 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq.) (the 1969 Cigarette Act). The Supreme Court held the 1965 Cigarette Act did not bar common law claims, but the 1969 act does. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 524-525, 530-531 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 2622, 2625.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The preemptive scope of the two acts, the high court held, was \u201cgoverned entirely by the express language in \u00a7 5 of each Act.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 517 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Section 5 of the 1965 Cigarette Act provided in part: \u201c(a) No statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by section 4 of this Act, shall be required on any cigarette package, [\u00b6] (b) No statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\u201d (Pub.L. No. 89-92, \u00a7 5 (July 27, 1965) 79 Stat. 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">By contrast, section 5 of the 1969 Cigarette Act provides: \u201c(b) .No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\u201d (Pub.L. No. 91-222, \u00a7 5 (Apr. 1, 1970) 84 Stat. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">As the high court observed, in the preemption provision of the 1965 Cigarette Act, Congress \u201cspoke precisely and narrowly,\u201d merely prohibiting state and federal rulemaking bodies from mandating particular cautionary <em>statements </em>on cigarette labels or in cigarette advertisements. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 518 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Compared to its predecessor in the 1965 Cigarette Act, the plain language of the preemption provision of the 1969 Cigarette Act, the high court held, is \u201cmuch broader,\u201d barring \u201cnot simply \u2018statement[s] \u2019 but rather \u2018requirements] or prohibition[s] . . . imposed under State law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 520 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2619].) \u201cThe phrase \u2018[n]o requirement or prohibition\u2019 sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law; to the contrary, those words easily encompass obligations that take the form of common-law rules. As we noted in another context, \u2018[state] regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief. The obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 521 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2620], quoting <em>San Diego Building Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon </em>(1959) 359 U.S. 236, 247 [79 S.Ct. 773, 780, 3 L.Ed.2d 775].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Like the preemption provision of the 1969 Cigarette Act, section 136v(b) of FIFRA provides that a state \u201cshall not impose or continue in effect any <em>requirements </em>for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u201cThere is no notable difference between the language in the 1969 Cigarette Act and the language in FIFRA.\u201d <em>(Taylor AG Industries v. Pure-Gro, supra, </em>54 F.3d at p. 559.) \u201cFor this reason,\u201d the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted, \u201cseven circuits have held that \u00a7 136v(b) preempts failure to warn claims based on inadequate labeling. <em>See Bice v. Leslie's Poolmart, Inc., </em>39 F.3d 887, 888 (8th Cir.1994); <em>MacDonald v. Monsanto Co., </em>27 F.3d 1021, 1024-25 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Worm v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>5 F.3d 744, 747 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(4th Cir. 1993) . . . ; <em>King, </em>996 F.2d at 1349; <em>Shaw, </em>994 F.2d at 371; <em>Papas v. Upjohn Co., </em>985 F.2d 516, 518 (11th Cir.) . . . ; <em>Arkansas-Platte &amp; Gulf Partnership </em>v. <em>Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 1177, 1179 (10th Cir.) . . . .\u201d (54 F.3d at p. 560.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u201cWe believe ... the prohibition of \u2018any\u2019 requirement is the functional equivalent of \u2018no\u2019 requirement. We see no difference between the operative effect of the two acts.\u201d <em>(Arkansas-Platte &amp; Gulf </em>v. <em>Van Waters &amp; Rogers, supra, </em>981 F.2d at p. 1179 [10th Cir. 1993].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u201cThe FIFRA language prohibiting the states from \u2018imposing] or continuing] in effect any requirements,\u2019 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b), is virtually indistinguishable from the state-imposed \u2018requirement\u2019 language that <em>Cipollone </em>held preempted the state common law tort claims based on inadequate warning. FIFRA\u2019s language, too, preempts the state law lack-of-warning claims involved in this case.\u201d <em>(King v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours and Co., supra, 996 </em>F.2d at p. 1349 [1st Cir. 1993].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u201cIn order to succeed in the wake of <em>Cipollone, </em>then, Shaw would have to show that FIFRA\u2019s pre-emption language is less sweeping than the language of the 1969 Cigarette Act. Yet we can discern no significant distinction at all\u2014FIFRA says that \u2018[s]uch State shall not impose . . . any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required . . . ,\u2019 while the cigarette law says \u2018[n]o requirement[s] or prohibition[s] . . . imposed under State law\u2019 shall be permitted. Both seem equally emphatic: \u2018[n]o requirements or prohibitions\u2019 is just another way of saying a \u2018[s]tate shall not impose . . . any requirements.\u2019 Not even the most dedicated hair splitter could distinguish these statements. If common law actions cannot survive under the 1969 cigarette law, then common law actions for labeling and packaging defects cannot survive under FIFRA.\u201d <em>(Shaw v. Dow Brands, Inc., supra, </em>994 F.2d at p. 371 [7th Cir. 1993].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The Court of Appeal acknowledged the weight of authority, but found the analysis flawed. \u201cA striking omission in the <em>post-Cipollone </em>FIFRA preemption case law is the lack of any comparison of the FIFRA preemption provision and the preemption provision, in the <em>1965 Act.\u201d </em>We disagree. <em>Cipollone </em>emphasized that \u201cthe pre-emptive scope of the 1965 Act and the 1969 Act is.governed entirely by the express language in \u00a7 5 of each Act.\u201d (505 U.S. at p. 517 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2618].) The circuit courts analyzed the FIFRA preemption provision in light of <em>Cipollone. </em>Indeed, two of them were expressly remanded in light of <em>Cipollone. (Papas v. Upjohn Co., supra, </em>985 F.2d 516; <em>Arkansas-Platte &amp; Gulf v. Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Inc., supra, </em>981 F.2d 1177.) In holding that FIFRA was functionally equivalent to the 1969 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Cigarette Act, insofar as their preemption provisions were concerned, they impliedly found that it was distinguishable from the 1965 Cigarette Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In an attempt to show that section 136v(b) of FIFRA \u201cis more grammatically akin\u201d to the 1965 Cigarette Act preemption provision, the Court of Appeal \u201csubstitute[d]\u201d the \u201ccore\u201d of the 1965 and 1969 Cigarette Acts\u2019 preemption provisions \u201cinto the format\u201d of section 136v(b), thereby literally rewriting the text of section 136v(b). Furthermore, the \u201csubstitution of \u2018requirements\u2019 for \u2018required\u2019 \u201d to demonstrate that the 1965 Cigarette Act provision is a cognate of section 136v(b) is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s own comparison of the 1965 and 1969 provisions. As we have noted above, the Supreme Court explained that the 1965 Cigarette Act \u201cbars . . . <em>simply \u2018statements\u2019 \u201d </em>whereas the 1969 Cigarette Act\u2019s provision is \u201cmuch broader\u201d and bars \u201c \u2018requirement[s] . . . imposed under State law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 520 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2619], italics added.) Thus, the Supreme Court drew the very distinction between the 1965 and 1969 Cigarette Acts that the Court of Appeal seeks to explain away in its effort to prove that all of the other courts are guilty of a \u201cstriking omission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">B. <em>Ferebee and Subdivision (a) of Section 136v</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">As previously mentioned, the one case that got it right, in the view of the Court of Appeal, was a <em>pr&amp;-Cipollone case\u2014Ferebee, supra, </em>736 F.2d 1529. The gist of the argument made in <em>Ferebee </em>was that a state\u2019s freedom under section 136v(a) to ban a pesticide outright presupposes the freedom to control the use of that pesticide by imposing tort liability on the manufacturer \u201cfor injuries that could have been prevented by a more adequate label.\u201d (736 F.2d at p. 1541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u201cWhile FIFRA does not allow states directly to impose additional label-ling requirements, the Act clearly allows states to impose more stringent constraints on the <em>use </em>of EPA-approved pesticides than those imposed by the EPA: \u2018A State may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the State, but only if and to the extent the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this subchapter.\u2019 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(a); <em>See also </em>Sen.Rep. No. 838 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1982) <em>[sic: </em>1972] <em>reprinted </em>in 1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4021 (\u2018Generally, the intent of the provision is to leave to the States the authority to impose stricter regulation on pesticides uses than that required under the Act.\u2019) [citations]. Given this provision, Maryland might well have the power to ban paraquat entirely. We need not decide that issue, however, to hold that, if a state chooses to restrict pesticide use by requiring that the manufacturer compensate for all injuries or for some of these injuries resulting from <em>use </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>a pesticide, federal law stands as no barrier.\u201d <em>(Ferebee, supra, 736 </em>F.2d at p. .1541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Reliance upon <em>Ferebee </em>is misplaced because it is no longer good law.

We think this argument is sophistry. If plaintiffs could recover large damage awards because the herbicide was improperly labeled under state law, the undeniable practical effect would be that state law <em>requires </em>additional labeling standards not mandated by FIFRA.\u201d <em>(MacDonald </em>v. <em>Monsanto Co., supra, </em>27 F.3d at p. 1025.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u201cShaw\u2019s argument is appealing because, unlike federal regulations which firms are required to follow, common law duties may be simply ignored by defendants. ... On the other hand, damages actions, just like regulatory mandates, cause companies to modify their economic decisions. It would be silly to pretend that federal lawmakers, seeking to occupy a whole field of regulation, wouldn\u2019t also be concerned about the distorting effects of tort actions.\u201d <em>(Shaw </em>v. <em>Dow Brands, Inc., supra, </em>994 F.2d at p. 370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u201cThe Worms\u2019 argument that their state law claims are based on duties not inconsistent with those imposed by FIFRA has no merit. Because the language on the label was determined by the EPA to comply with the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>standards, to argue that the warnings on the label are inadequate is to seek to hold the label to a standard different from the federal one. Nor does it make any difference that the standard the Worms seek to apply is one imposed by the common law rather than by positive legislative or executive enactment. Any distinction between the two is \u2018illusory.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Worm </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co., supra, </em>5 F.3d at p. 748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">When Congress intends to preempt state regulatory authority but to leave common law actions intact, it knows how to accomplish that.

(21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a).) Section 360k(a) of title 21 of the United States Code provides that \u201cno State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014 [\u00b6] (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and [\u00b6] (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The manufacturer argued, in essence, that \u201cthe plain language of the statute pre-empts any and all common law claims brought by an injured plaintiff against a manufacturer of medical devices.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 486 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2251].) Rejecting this \u201csweeping\u201d interpretation of the statute, the plurality opinion held that \u201c\u00a7 360(k) simply was not intended to pre-empt most, let alone all, general common law duties enforced by damages actions.\u201d (518 U.S. at p. 491 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em>Medtronic </em>is distinguishable on the ground Congress gave the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a unique role in determining the scope of preemption under the MDA. \u201cUnlike the statute construed in <em>Cipollone, </em>for instance, pre-emption under the MDA does not arise directly as a result of the enactment of the statute; rather, in most cases a state law will be pre-empted only to the extent that the FDA has promulgated a relevant federal \u2018requirement.\u2019 . . . Congress explicitly delegated to the FDA the authority to exempt state regulations from the pre-emptive effect of the MDA\u2014an authority that necessarily requires the FDA to assess the preemptive effect that the Act and its own regulations will have on state laws. . . . The ambiguity in the statute\u2014and the congressional grant of authority to the agency on the matter contained within it\u2014provide a \u2018sound basis,\u2019 ... for giving substantial weight to the agency\u2019s view of the statute. . . . [\u00b6] The regulations promulgated by the FDA expressly support the conclusion that \u00a7 360k \u2018does not preempt State or local requirements that are equal to, or substantially identical to, requirements imposed by or under the act.\u2019\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp. 496-497 [116 S.Ct. at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>2255-2256] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.); see also <em>id. </em>at p. 506 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2260] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.)

Even though the question presented in this case has been addressed by nine of the federal circuit courts of appeals, the United States failed to file amicus curiae briefs in any of the cases and permitted those courts to proceed upon a fundamental assumption that it now characterizes as mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">According to the EPA, the courts that have reached the conclusion that FIFRA preempts state failure-to-warn claims have done so under the mistaken impression that FIFRA regulates all aspects of pesticide labeling. In fact, with congressional approval, the EPA concerns itself only with whether a pesticide would have unreasonably adverse effects on human health or the <em>natural </em>environment. In initially registering a pesticide, the EPA does not address the question whether it will control the target pest or harm the crop it was intended to protect\u2014the claim made here. Those are questions of pesticide <em>efficacy. </em>Congress gave the EPA authority to waive the review of pesticide efficacy claims, and the EPA has exercised this authority, leaving it to the marketplace and <em>the prospect of tort liability </em>to fill the gap. Therefore, the maintenance of state failure-to-warn claims, the United States argues, is entirely consistent with FIFRA as it is actually administered by the EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The factual support for the foregoing characterization of the pesticide registration and label approval process, the United States submits, is supplied by a document issued by the EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticides Programs, Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice 96-4 (June 3, 1996). Notice will be taken of PR Notice 96-4 as an \u201cofficial act\u201d of the federal government within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>meaning of Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c). (See <em>Empire Properties </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 781, 788, fn. 2 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 69] [notice taken of report of task force commissioned by the Legislature]; <em>San Mateo County Coastal Landowners' Assn. </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 523, 552-553 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 117] [trial court properly took notice of letter from the Secretary of Resources to the Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission]; <em>People v. Goodloe </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 485, 493-494 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 15] [notice taken of Department of Corrections\u2019 administrative bulletin].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The gravamen of PR Notice 96-4 is that the courts reaching the conclusion that FIERA preempts state law failure-to-warn claims have done so under the mistaken impression that the EPA evaluates <em>efficacy </em>in the initial pesticide registration and label approval process. However, plaintiffs do not claim the pesticides they used were inefficacious, i.e., that they failed to control the target pests. Rather, they claim they should have been warned that the combined use of these pesticides could be <em>phytotoxic, </em>i.e., that they might damage the crop they were intended to protect. (\u201cThis warning, that Morestan when combined with [Guthion] produces some phytotoxicity is totally missing from the label restrictions.\u201d) As defendants point out, the EPA\u2019s testing guidelines appear to make it clear that phytotoxicity and efficacy are distinct concepts and that, contrary to the implications of PR Notice 96-4 and assertions made in the briefs of plaintiffs and the United States, the former concept is not included in the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The EPA\u2019s testing guidelines for assessing a pesticide\u2019s potential hazards to \u201cnon-target plants,\u201d e.g., crops, define phytotoxicity as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018phytotoxicity\u2019 or \u2018plant toxicity\u2019 means unwanted detrimental deviations from the normal pattern of appearance, growth, and function of plants in response to pesticides and to other toxic chemicals that may be applied with the pesticide.\u201d (EPA, Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, subd. J, Hazard Evaluation: Non-Target Plants (Oct. 1982) \u00a7 120-2, p. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">A separate set of guidelines for assessing a pesticide product\u2019s performance states that \u201c[t]he term \u2018effectiveness\u2019 ... is synonymous with the term \u2018efficacy,\u2019 \u201d and defines \u201c \u2018effectiveness\u2019 \u201d as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018effectiveness\u2019 refers to a product\u2019s ability to control the specific target pest . . . when the product is applied in accordance with the label directions, precautions, and limitations of use.\u201d (EPA, Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, subd. G, Product Performance (Nov. 1982) \u00a7 90-2(b), p. 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The claim made in PR Notice 96-4\u2014that the EPA does not concern itself with questions of efficacy in the initial pesticide registration and label <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>approval process\u2014is thus beside the point. Phytotoxicity is not a matter of efficacy, and it is phytotoxicity of which plaintiffs complain. Nevertheless, we will proceed to consider the argument the United States makes on the basis of PR Notice 96-4, which may be summarized as follows: The 1972 amendments to FIFRA required the EPA to evaluate all claims of pesticide efficacy. (\u00a7 136a(c)(5).) However, as the House Agriculture Committee observed, the pesticide approval process then ground to \u201ca virtual halt.\u201d (H.R.Rep. No. 95-663, 1st Sess., p. 18 (1977) reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 1991.) In an effort to streamline the process, Congress amended FIFRA in 1978 to permit the EPA to <em>waive </em>review of pesticide efficacy claims. (7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(5).) The EPA issued such a waiver (40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 158.640(b), 158.540 (1999)), explaining that it would enable the agency to focus on its \u201cprimary mandate under FIFRA ... the health and safety aspects of pesticides\u201d (47 Fed.Reg. 53192, 53196 (Nov. 24, 1982)). Because the EPA does not review efficacy claims, the United States asserts, \u201cpreemption of state damages actions challenging pesticide efficacy would leave such statements largely, or entirely, unregulated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Again, the short answer to this argument is that the EPA\u2019s waiver of the submission of efficacy data is irrelevant, since plaintiffs complain of phytotoxicity, not inefficacy. However, even assuming arguendo that phytotoxicity is included within the concept of efficacy, there remain two fundamental flaws in the argument that pesticide efficacy will go \u201clargely, or entirely, unregulated\u201d if state law failure-to-warn claims are preempted: (1) Although the EPA has waived the submission of efficacy data for agricultural pesticides at the time of their <em>initial </em>registration, the agency does require and review such data if efficacy-related problems develop later; and (2) California has a comprehensive registration and regulatory program for pesticides, and while the California Department of Pesticide Regulation may not impose its own requirements for labeling, it can restrict or prohibit the sale or use of products that it determines are inefficacious or phytotoxic. (See \u00a7 136v(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">1. <em>The EPA\u2019s postregistration consideration of efficacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\"><em>' </em>Before granting registration, the EPA is required by FIFRA to determine whether a pesticide \u201cwill perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment\u201d (\u00a7 136a(c)(5)(C)), which means \u201cany unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use\u201d of the pesticide (\u00a7 136(bb)). The term \u201cenvironment\u201d is defined to include \u201call plants\u201d (\u00a7 136(j)), and this definition includes crops (see <em>Kuiper </em>v. <em>American Cynamid Co., supra, </em>131 F.3d at p. 664).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The 1978 amendment to FIFRA allows the EPA, \u201c[i]n considering an application for the registration of a pesticide [to] waive data requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>pertaining to efficacy.\u201d (\u00a7 136a(c)(5).) However, in promulgating the waiver, the EPA emphasized that in the event that efficacy-related problems developed after a pesticide was registered, the agency would require and review such data. \u201cThe Administrator reserves the right to request submission of efficacy data in support of label claims for any registered product. A request may be made for any product for which a pattern of inadequate performance has been reported.\u201d (44 Fed.Reg. 27932, 27939 (May 11, 1979); see 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 158.640(b) [EPA \u201creserves the right to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of efficacy data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration\u201d].) Along the same lines, the EPA subsequently explained that without \u201cinitial product performance data, the Agency is compelled to monitor more closely the content of use directions on labels. ... If a pattern of inaccurate, outdated, or ambiguous use directions is determined to be a major problem, the Agency will require the submission of efficacy data.\u201d (49 Fed.Reg. 37960-37961 (Sept. 26, 1984).)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The EPA\u2019s recent adverse effects reporting rule (\u00a7 136d(a)(2)) requires pesticide manufacturers to submit \u201ctoxic or adverse effect incident reports,\u201d specific\u00e1lly including data concerning \u201calleged effect[s] involving] damage to plants.\u201d (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 159.184(c)(5)(iv)(1999).) Significantly, the regulation provides that information need not be reported for an \u201cincident\u201d which \u201cconcerns non-lethal phytotoxicity to the treated crop <em>if the label provides an adequate notice </em>of such a risk.\u201d (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 159.184(b)(4), italics added.) Moreover, upon receiving crop damage reports under the adverse effects reporting rule, the agency\u2019s regulatory options are not limited to cancellation; it can also require labeling changes. The EPA explained when it promulgated the rule that, \u201c[w]hile reportable information under section 6(a)(2) could conceivably result in cancellation . . . action, this information could also be used by the Agency in other ways. The information could suggest the need for modification to the terms and conditions of registration which could be necessitated by the balancing of the risks and benefits associated with a particular pesticide.\u201d (42 Fed.Reg. 49370, 49372 (Sept. 19, 1997).)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">2. <em>California\u2019s regulatory program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Congress, the United States asserts, did not intend to leave pesticide efficacy unregulated. \u201cOn the contrary, Congress specifically sanctioned state regulation of pesticide efficacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">FIFRA clearly does contemplate a state/federal partnership in the regulation of pesticide efficacy and phytotoxicity. Section 136v(a) provides that a \u201cState may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>device in the State, but only if and to the extent the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this subchapter.\u201d This does not mean, however, that the regulation may be accomplished through the back door by means of tort suits that effectively require changes in EPA-approved labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">California requires that pesticide manufacturers and their products be registered with the Department of Pesticide Regulation. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12811, 12993.) The code requires that a comprehensive risk/benefit analysis be undertaken in the public interest when the department considers whether a product should be registered in the first instance or whether its registration should be canceled. (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12824, 12825; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 3, \u00a7 6158.) With regard to the specific claim made in this case, the department may require data on \u201c[p]hytotoxicity\u201d and \u201c[t]he effect from the use of . . . two or more products, in combination.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 3, \u00a7 6192, subds. (b), (e).) To ensure that California\u2019s agriculture is protected from unforeseen or newly discovered risks, the director is charged with the responsibility for the \u201ccontinuous evaluation of all registered products.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 3, \u00a7 6226.) As part of this continuous evaluation, the director must make administrative determinations regarding precisely the issue raised by this case\u2014\u201c[u]ndesirable phytotoxicity.\u201d (Cal.

(f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Given the comprehensive and stringent character of California\u2019s program of pesticide regulation, having lay juries assess questions of phytotoxicity in the context of failure-to-warn claims is neither necessary nor desirable, and holding that such actions are preempted by FIFRA promotes federalism, rather than undermines it.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">E. <em>Determining Whether Particular Causes of Action Are Preempted Under FIFRA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Having concluded that FIFRA preempts state law claims for failure to warn of the risks of using a pesticide, we now turn to the question whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims can fairly be so characterized. (See <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 523 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2621] [\u201cwe must look to each of petitioner\u2019s common-law claims to determine whether it is in fact pre-empted\u201d (fn. omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">In determining whether specific claims are preempted by the 1969 Cigarette Act, \u201c[t]he central inquiry in each case,\u201d the high court said, is \u201cstraightforward.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 523-524 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2621].) \u201c[W]e ask whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>common-law damages action constitutes a \u2018requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . imposed under State law with respect to . . . advertising or promotion,\u2019 giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 524 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2621].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u201cIn this case,\u201d <em>Cipollone </em>continued, \u201cpetitioner offered two closely related theories concerning the failure to warn: first, that respondents \u2018were negligent in the manner [that] they tested, researched, sold, promoted, and advertised\u2019 their cigarettes; and second, that respondents failed to provide \u2018adequate warnings of the health consequences of cigarette smoking.\u2019 [\u00b6] Petitioner\u2019s claims are pre-empted to the extent that they rely on a state-law \u2018requirement or prohibition . . . with respect to . . . advertising or promotion.\u2019 Thus, insofar as claims under either failure-to-warn theory require a showing that respondents\u2019 post-1969 advertising or promotions should have included additional, or more clearly stated, warnings, those claims are pre-empted. The Act does not, however, pre-empt petitioner\u2019s claims that rely solely on respondents\u2019 testing or research practices or other actions unrelated to advertising or promotion.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 524-525 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 2621-2622].) The court went on to consider petitioner\u2019s other causes of action, summarizing its holding as follows: \u201c[T]he 1969 Act pre-empts petitioner\u2019s claims based on a failure to warn and the neutralization of federally mandated warnings to the extent that those claims rely on omissions or inclusions in respondents\u2019 advertising or promotions; the 1969 Act does not pre-empt petitioner\u2019s claims based on express warranty, intentional fraud and misrepresentation, or conspiracy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 530-531 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2625].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In determining whether particular causes of action are preempted under FIFRA, \u201c[w]e can do no better than to adapt the United States Supreme Court\u2019s approach in <em>Cipollone: </em>the central inquiry in each case is whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the common law damages action constitutes a State \u2018requirement[] for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from\u2019 the FIFRA requirements, giving that clause a fair but narrow reading. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b); <em>Cipollone, </em>at [524], 112 S.Ct. at 2621.\u201d <em>(Hue </em>v. <em>Farmboy Spray Co., Inc. </em>(1995) 127 Wash.2d 67, 85-86 [896 P.2d 682, 692].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">When a claim, however couched, boils down to an assertion that a pesticide\u2019s label failed to warn of the damage plaintiff allegedly suffered, the claim is preempted by FIFRA.

In their first cause of action, plaintiffs alleged that defendant Bayer negligently manufactured, formulated, produced, packaged and tested Morestan and Guthion. They also alleged that defendants Tri-Ag and its employee Osterlie negligently recommended the application of Morestan together with Guthion at certain concentrations and with certain other products. Their other causes of action, in the order recited in the complaint, were: strict liability for ultrahazardous activity, negligence per se for violating certain sections of the Food and Agriculture Code, product liability, breach of implied warranty, misrepresentation, and trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">As previously stated, defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that all of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action, in effect, challenged the adequacy of the warnings on Guthion\u2019s and Morestan\u2019s EPA-approved labels, and thus were preempted by FIFRA. In two summary judgment rulings, the trial court agreed, holding that all of the causes of action did \u201callege inadequate labeling in one form or another,\u201d with the \u201cmain issue being the failure of the labels to warn against mixing chemicals.\u201d In addition, the court held that plaintiffs failed to produce evidence indicating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>cause of action for negligence against defendants Tri-Ag and Osterlie, and, as to the cause of action for misrepresentation, failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to intent to defraud on the part of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Because the Court of Appeal held that state law failure-to-warn claims are not preempted by FIFRA, it did not discuss \u201cthe other points raised by the parties,\u201d in particular, defendants\u2019 contention that all of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action were predicated upon alleged inadequacies in Guthion\u2019s and Morestan\u2019s EPA-approved labels. We remand that it may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">For the guidance of the Court of Appeal on remand, we address one final issue\u2014the extent to which FIFRA preempts actions based on so-called off-label statements, that is, statements made outside of the context of labeling or packaging; for example, claims made orally or in advertising materials. The critical question is whether the off-label statements \u201cmerely repeat information in the label itself.\u201d <em>(Kuiper </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co., supra, </em>131 F.3d at p. 662.) Where off-label statements address matters outside the scope of the label, an action may well lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">George, C.

However, in his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, stated that he agreed with the following language of the plurality opinion; \u2018that the language of the . . . Act plainly reaches beyond [positive] enactments; that the general tort-law duties petitioner invokes against the cigarette companies can, as a general matter, impose \u201crequirements or prohibitions\u201d within the meaning of [\u00a7 1334(b)]; and that the phrase \u201cstate law\u201d as used in [\u00a7 1334(b)] embraces State common law. . . .\u2019 <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., . . </em>.112 S.Ct. at 2634 (citations and internal quotations omitted). Thus, the holding of the plurality opinion that the language of \u00a7 1334(b) preempted the plaintiff\u2019s failure-to-warn claim can fairly be said to constitute the view of the Court because six members of the Court concurred in that conclusion. <em>See King v.

In order to establish preemption, defendants would have to show that \u201cthe EPA, after full consideration of information relevant to the allegation that combined use of its products causes crop damage, has determined that no change in the products\u2019 labels is required.\u201d (See cone, and dis. opn. of Kennard, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 340.) The EPA would be unlikely ever to make such a determination. If few reports of crop damage were brought to the EPA\u2019s attention, or if the state law failure-to-warn actions claiming such damage were unsuccessful, the agency would have no reason to expend the resources required to reassess the adequacy of a label. On the other hand, if a substantial number of successful failure-to-warn actions claiming crop damage were brought to the EPA\u2019s attention, the agency would hardly be likely to affirm the label. And even if a substantial number of unsuccessful state law failure-to-warn suits claiming crop damage were to prompt the EPA to reconsider and reaffirm a product\u2019s label, the ability of a defendant to assert preemption would depend upon whether a particular suit were brought before or after the critical mass had been reached. In short, the rule proposed in the concurring and dissenting opinion would be as destructive to the ideal of reaching like results in like cases as it would be to Congress\u2019s goal of ensuring uniformity in pesticide labeling by preempting state law failure-to-warn claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b381-10\">KENNARD, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Axy\">I am unable to join either the majority or the dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>I reject the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136 et seq.) preempts <em>no </em>state law tort actions asserting failure-to-warn claims predicated upon alleged inadequacies in pesticide labels that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">But I also reject the majority\u2019s conclusion that FIFRA preempts <em>all </em>such state law failure-to-warn claims. Rather, I conclude that FIFRA preempts a state law failure-to-warn claim based upon alleged inadequacies in an EPA-approved pesticide label if, but only if, a finding of inadequacy would be inconsistent with FIFRA. And, unlike the majority, I do not view the EPA\u2019s approval of a pesticide label as conclusively establishing the manufacturer\u2019s compliance with FIFRA. Because FIFRA itself requires correction of EPA-approved labels upon proof of crop damage or similar adverse effects, preemption exists only if the EPA, presented with evidence of the crop damage, has not required, and would not require, any label correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The provision of FIFRA at issue here reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c(a) In general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">\u201cA State may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the State, but only if and to the extent the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201c(b) Uniformity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\u201cSuch State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">\u201c(c) Additional uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">A State may provide registration for additional uses of federally registered pesticides formulated for distribution and use within that State to meet special local needs in accord with the purposes of this subchapter and if registration for such use has not previously been denied, disapproved, or canceled by the Administrator. . . .\u201d (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">In her dissenting opinion, Justice Werdegar views subdivision (b) of this provision, which prohibits states from imposing any \u201crequirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter,\u201d as preempting only positive law, in the form of statutes or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>regulations, but not suits at common law. I disagree. Tort liability, imposed by a suit at common law, is an indirect but powerful method of regulating the contents of pesticide labels. To the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with the requirements of FIFRA, I conclude that federal law preempts it, just as it preempts inconsistent state requirements imposed by statute or regulation. Thus, I agree with the majority in rejecting a distinction between state regulation by statute or regulation and state regulation by tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On the other hand, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s assumption that when the EPA has once exercised its authority under FIFRA by approving a pesticide label, the pesticide\u2019s manufacturer necessarily demonstrates full compliance with FIFRA by affixing the EPA-approved label to the product. EPA approval of a pesticide label is always provisional, subject to correction if the EPA becomes aware of information suggesting the need for different or additional warnings. (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 159.184 (1999); see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 332-333.) In this regard, FIFRA differs from the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq.), which specifies particular language for a label warning. Accordingly, I do not agree with the majority that <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407], which construed the preemption provision of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, is controlling or particularly helpful in construing FIFRA\u2019s preemption provision. Because FIFRA does not require any specific warning, but leaves the content of the label to be approved by the EPA, with a continuing duty of revision in response to new information, a manufacturer\u2019s use of an EPA-approved label does not establish full compliance with FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Here, for example, plaintiffs allege that a combined application of two chemicals, each of which carried an EPA-approved label, caused significant damage to plaintiffs\u2019 walnut crop. Under FIFRA, the manufacturer of these two chemicals was required to notify the EPA of significant and unexpected crop damage resulting from combined use of its products. Upon consideration of this information, the EPA may determine that the products are \u201cmisbranded\u201d and require that their labels be revised to caution against the combined use. The record before us does not reveal whether anyone has notified the EPA of alleged crop damage caused by the combined use of these chemicals, much less what the EPA has done in response to this information. It seems not unreasonable to assume, in the absence of other information, that if the combined use of these chemicals does cause significant crop damage, as plaintiffs have alleged but have not yet had the opportunity to prove, the EPA will, if it has not already done so, require label revision. If this assumption is correct, then allowing plaintiffs to pursue a failure-to-warn claim against the manufacturer does not conflict with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>FIFRA because both impose the same requirement: revision of the product labels to include appropriate warnings against combined use.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Because the Court of Appeal correctly determined, albeit for the wrong reason, that defendants have failed to establish FIFRA preemption of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Upon remand to the trial court, I would permit defendant manufacturer to attempt to establish FIFRA preemption through evidence that the EPA, after full consideration of information relevant to the allegation that combined use of its products causes crop damage, has determined that no change in the products\u2019 labels is required.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b384-5\">WERDEGAR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_0\">I dissent. Defendant Bayer Corporation (Bayer) manufactured and placed into the stream of our nation\u2019s commerce chemical products that it (and the other defendants) represented were effective in destroying certain insect pests. Plaintiffs believed these assurances and applied the product to their orchards, allegedly causing thousands of dollars worth of damage. Plaintiffs then sought compensation for this damage to their property under legal doctrines long established in this state. In concluding plaintiffs are no longer entitled to seek this relief in our courts due to the asserted preemptive effect of federal legislation, the majority discerns an expression of congressional intent to deprive plaintiffs of their historic legal remedies that I do not perceive. In so doing, the majority not only misapplies the latest United States Supreme Court decision in this area of the law, but, more importantly, fails to heed the most basic and important rule governing questions of federal preemption of state law: when Congress intends to displace state law, it must express that intent <em>clearly. </em>Finding no such clear statement of congressional purpose, I conclude state tort law is not preempted in this case. Because the majority finds otherwise, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Plaintiffs, owners of commercial walnut orchards, sought to use a pesticide to protect their crop against insect pests. They spoke to defendant Paul Osterlie, an employee of defendant Tri-Ag Service, Inc., who recommended the combined application of Guthion and Morestan mixed in water in certain proportions. Guthion and Morestan are insecticides manufactured by defendant Bayer. Because the insecticides did not dissolve well in water, Osterlie recommended that a chemical surfactant be added to the mixture to facilitate solubility (to permit the mixture to be sprayed on the trees). Plaintiffs followed Osterlie\u2019s recommendations, allegedly resulting in $150,000 damage to their walnut crop. Plaintiffs allege the chemical surfactant, alone or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>combination with the insecticides, tended to dissolve the waxy surface of the leaves, causing them to wither.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Plaintiffs sued Osterlie, Tri-Ag Service, Inc., and Bayer, alleging: (1) negligence; (2) strict liability for ultrahazardous activity; (3) negligence per se; (4) products liability; (5) breach of implied warranty; (6) misrepresentation; and (7) trespass. Defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming (among other things) that all causes of action were preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 United States Code section 136 et seq. (hereafter FIFRA). The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment. In a split decision, the Court of Appeal reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">I begin with the basic rules governing questions of preemption. Of course, where state law directly conflicts with federal law, the federal law controls, for \u201cthe laws of the United States . . . shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d (U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2.) Because we are concerned in this case with an express preemption provision (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b)), we may assume Congress intended to preempt <em>some </em>state law. Our task, then, is to determine the <em>scope </em>of that preemption. \u201cAlthough our analysis of the scope of the pre-emption statute must begin with its text, see <em>Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., </em>505 U.S. 88, 111 [112 S.Ct. 2374, 2389-2390, 120 L.Ed.2d 73] (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), our interpretation of that language does not occur in a contextual vacuum. Rather that interpretation is informed by two presumptions about the nature of pre-emption.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 470, 484-485 [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250, 135 L.Ed.2d 700] <em>(Medtronic).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">First, and most importantly, proper appreciation of the states as independent sovereigns in our federal system demands that we presume Congress did <em>not </em>intend to displace the historic police powers of the states unless such intent is both \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp. </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 218, 230 [67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447], quoted in <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 516 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407] <em>(Cipollone).) </em>The United States Supreme Court has \u201clong presumed that Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 485 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2250]), stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>that \u201cwe have never assumed lightly that Congress has derogated state regulation, but instead have addressed claims of pre-emption with the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law.

Because the federal government is a relative latecomer in the area of protecting public safety, courts should be cautious in concluding federal law supplants state law, lest the public be left without protection in matters of health and safety. We recently have recognized this rebuttable presumption against federal preemption of state law. <em>(Peatros v. Bank of America </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 147, 157 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 659, 990 P.2d 539] (plur. opn.); <em>Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 138, 148 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 900 P.2d 690], affd.

Similarly, we also have applied the presumption against preemption when interpreting FIFRA, noting that \u201cin the absence of a clear manifestation of intention to preclude state regulation in an area traditionally regulated by the exercise of state . . . police powers, it will not be presumed that a federal statute was intended to supersede such powers.\u201d <em>(People ex rel.

Citibank, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 147.) \u201c \u2018[T]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u2019 in every preemption case.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 485 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2250], quoting <em>Retail Clerks v. Schermerhom </em>(1963) 375 U.S. 96, 103 [84 S.Ct. 219, 222, 11 L.Ed.2d 179]; see also <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. atp. 516 [112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>S.Ct. at p. 2617].) \u201cCongress\u2019 intent . . . primarily is discerned from the language of the pre-emption statute and the \u2018statutory framework\u2019 surrounding it. [Citation.] Also relevant, however, is the \u2018structure and purpose of the statute as a whole,\u2019 [citation], as revealed not only in the text, but through the reviewing court\u2019s reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers, and the law.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 486 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2250-2251].) We recently have recognized the primacy of Congress\u2019s intent when deciding preemption questions. <em>(Peatros </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 157 (plur. opn.); <em>Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">With this basic interpretive framework in mind, I turn to whether FIFRA preempts state common law causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The FIFRA preemption provision, 7 United States Code section 136v(b) (hereafter section 136v(b)), provides: \u201c[A] State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.\u201d We choose in this case between two competing interpretations of the word \u201crequirements,\u201d as used in the statutory preemption provision. On the one hand, \u201crequirements\u201d could mean only positive enactments of law, such as statutes enacted by our Legislature and administrative regulations promulgated by an appropriate state agency. On the other hand, the word \u201crequirements\u201d could encompass both positive enactments of law as well as common law tort actions based on a failure to warn, on the theory that such actions constitute \u201crequirements for labeling.\u201d The majority adopts this latter interpretation. As I explain, it is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">To begin with, either meaning admittedly is possible. A \u201crequirement[] for labeling or packaging\u201d most certainly includes all positive enactments of law, but it could also include common law claims for damages, the success of which could have the indirect effect of encouraging manufacturers to alter their labeling or packaging and thus allow the state to indirectly regulate labeling. The pertinent inquiry is whether the words of section 136v(b) <em>clearly </em>embrace the latter, broader interpretation. To that, one would have to answer in the negative. At best, FIFRA\u2019s preemption provision is ambiguous. Such ambiguity weighs in favor of interpreting section 136v(b) to have a narrow, rather than a broad, preemptive effect. (See <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 489 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2252] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.) [because of \u201cambiguities in the statute,\u201d the Medical Devices Amendments of 1976 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>(MDA) should be interpreted as not preempting state law]; <em>id. </em>at p. 505 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2260] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.) [that the MDA\u2019s preemption provision \u201cis highly ambiguous\u201d is a factor against preemption].) To reiterate, the presumption is <em>against </em>preemption, and Congress\u2019s intent to supplant state law must be \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d <em>(Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, </em>331 U.S. at p. 230 [67 S.Ct. at p. 1152].)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The majority responds that \u201c[w]hen Congress intends to preempt state regulatory authority but to leave common law actions intact, it knows how to accomplish that,\u201d citing language in the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 providing that \u201c[n]othing in this chapter shall relieve any person <em>from liability at common law </em>or under State statutory law to any other person.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 328, quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 4406(c), italics added.) The majority thus suggests that because FIFRA does not expressly leave state tort law intact, we should infer Congress intended to override it. Such reasoning is flawed for two reasons. First, its premise\u2014that Congress would have expressly left state tort law intact if that had been its intent\u2014-is not necessarily true. Rather, Congress expresses its intent in various ways. For example, Congress sometimes indicates its preemptive intent not by silence, as the majority would have it, but by expressly stating a federal law will override a state\u2019s common law. (See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-17(d) [providing that rules for certain mortgage insurance \u201cshall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, <em>court decree, common law, </em>rule, or public policy limiting or prohibiting increases in the outstanding loan balance after execution of the mortgage\u201d (italics added)].) That we may draw much meaning from Congress\u2019s failure to mention state tort law in section 136v(b) is therefore doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">A second and more basic flaw in the majority\u2019s reasoning is that it ignores the fundamental rule governing preemption of state law. To reiterate, the presumption is <em>against </em>preemption, and Congress\u2019s intent to supplant state law must be \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, </em>331 U.S. at p. 230 [67 S.Ct. at p. 1152].) Any attempt to infer Congress\u2019s intent from its statutory silence is thus improper. (See <em>Mortier, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 607 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2483] [noting, in a FIFRA case, that \u201cMere silence . . . cannot suffice to establish a \u2018clear and manifest purpose\u2019 to pre-empt local authority\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">More profitable than attempting to divine Congress\u2019s intent from its silence is to examine what Congress actually has said. Returning to the actual words of FIFRA, we find that Congress has supplied some affirmative indication of its intent regarding the scope of FIFRA\u2019s preemption. The statutory provision immediately preceding FIFRA\u2019s preemption provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>states: \u201cA State may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the State, but only if and to the extent the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this subchapter.\u201d (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(a), hereafter section 136v(a).) Thus, short of permitting the sale of a substance FIFRA has banned, Congress has affirmatively and specifically <em>preserved </em>the power of the states to regulate pesticides. Indeed, our high court has held that FIFRA \u201cleaves ample room for States and localities to supplement federal [regulatory] efforts even absent the express regulatory authorization of \u00a7 136v(a).\u201d <em>(Mortier, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 613 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2486].)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Because Congress, in the statutory provision immediately preceding the preemption provision, expressly affirmed the power of the states to regulate pesticides, to view FIFRA as an overarching federal regulatory scheme intended to supplant all or even most state regulation is inaccurate. Instead, its goals are more modest. (See <em>Mortier, supra, </em>501 U.S. 597 [FIFRA held not to preempt pesticide regulation by local town, because language of FIFRA does not explicitly preempt local regulation, Congress\u2019s intent is ambiguous, and FIFRA language shows no clear and manifest indication of congressional intent to preempt].) Reading FIFRA\u2019s preemption clause in conjunction with section 136v(a) reveals Congress\u2019s intent that the scope of FIFRA\u2019s preemption of state law should be limited in nature. The majority\u2019s failure to appreciate the significance of section 136v(a) as a critical indicator of Congress\u2019s intent thus undercuts its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The majority, adopting the view of the lower federal appellate courts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> finds <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, applicable here. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 323 et seq.) In <em>Cipollone, </em>the high court did not address the meaning of FIFRA, but instead considered the proper interpretation of section 5(b) of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (hereafter the 1969 Cigarette Act). (Pub.L. No. 91-222 (Apr. 1, 1970) 84 Stat. 87, codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq.) In explaining the scope of the 1969 Cigarette Act, the high court found the phrase \u201cNo requirement or prohibition based on smoking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>health . . . with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\u201d to have broad preemptive effect, supplanting state common law causes of action for injuries caused by smoking. \u201cThe phrase \u2018[n]o requirement or prohibition\u2019 sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law; to the contrary, those words easily encompass obligations that take the form of common-law rules.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 521 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2620] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.).) Finding \u201c \u2018no notable difference between the language in the 1969 Cigarette Act and the language in FIFRA\u2019 \u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 324, quoting <em>Taylor AG Industries v. Pure-Gro </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 54 F.3d 555, 559), the majority then applies <em>Cipollone\u2019&amp; </em>reasoning to the present case and concludes FIFRA preempts state common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">With due respect to both the majority and the several federal appellate courts that have reached the same result (see, e.g., <em>Taylor AG Industries </em>v. <em>Pure-Gro, supra, </em>54 F.3d at p. 560; <em>Worm </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1993) 5 F.3d 744, 747), the two situations are not comparable. First and foremost, the preemption provision of the 1969 Cigarette Act is not prefaced with a provision specifically <em>affirming </em>the power of the states to regulate in its subject area of \u201csmoking and health.\u201d Section 136v(b), by contrast, is so prefaced: section 136v(a) explicitly recognizes the power of the states to \u201cregulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the State . . . .\u201d (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(a).) As explained above, section 136v(a) is critically important in interpreting FIFRA\u2019s preemptive scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Faced with an express statement by Congress retaining the states\u2019 regulatory power, and in the absence of a \u201cclear and manifest\u201d expression of congressional intent to supplant the common law of the states, to maintain, as does the majority, that state tort law must be preempted because a successful tort lawsuit will \u201cindirectly\u201d affect pesticide labeling and packaging is untenable. Such indirect pressure on manufacturers to alter their pesticide labels is not embraced within the scope of FIFRA. For example, a state may, pursuant to section 136v(a), ban outright the use of an insecticide for which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved a label pursuant to FIFRA. Although such direct state regulation would, of course, have the indirect effect of encouraging the manufacturer to change its label (e.g., \u201cNot valid for use in California\u201d), such indirect pressure on a manufacturer would nevertheless seem to be permissible. Indeed, what other meaning could section 136v(a) have?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Moreover, as the majority admits (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 336), common law causes of action based on other than a failure-to-wam theory are not preempted by FIFRA. (See, e.g., <em>Worm v. American Cyanamid Co., supra, </em>5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>F.3d at p. 747 [in a FIFRA case, \u201c[c]laims for negligent testing, manufacturing, and formulating, on the other hand, are not preempted\u201d]; <em>Lyall v. Leslie's Poolmart </em>(E.D.Mich. 1997) 984 F.Supp. 587 [same for claims of negligent design and manufacturing]; <em>Higgins v. Monsanto Co. </em>(N.D.N.Y. 1994) 862 F.Supp. 751 [claim of strict liability based on design defect and express warranty]; <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co. </em>(Iowa 1998) 586 N.W.2d 208 [586 N.W.2d 208] [claims of negligent design and testing]; see also <em>Kawamata Farms </em>v. <em>United Agri Products </em>(1997) 86 Hawaii 214 [948 P.2d 1055] [negligence, as well as strict liability and express warranty claims].) If plaintiffs, therefore, are successful in proving liability based on, e.g., negligent manufacture and testing, or negligently recommending a combination of Guthion and Morestan in conjunction with chemical surfactants, such litigation success could, of course, have the practical effect of convincing the manufacturer of these chemicals to change the labels so as to warn of the possibility of phytotoxicity to emergent growth of nut trees, especially when used with chemicals that promote solubility.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of FIFRA thus leads to this conundrum: A state may <em>directly </em>regulate pesticides pursuant to section 136v(a)\u2014even to the point of banning their use\u2014through statutes or administrative regulations (so long as the state does not require labeling inconsistent with what the EPA has approved), <em>even if such regulation has the indirect effect of encouraging manufacturers to alter their labels, </em>but a state may not <em>indirectly </em>regulate pesticides by permitting tort suits at common law for damages, <em>for the very same reason that such regulation has the indirect effect of encouraging manufacturers to alter their labels. </em>This makes so little sense that the majority must be mistaken in concluding FIFRA preempts common law tort actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">A second reason why reliance on <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, is unjustified is that case\u2019s unwarranted focus on the word \u201crequirement,\u201d a term common to both section 136v(b) as well as the preemption provision in the 1969 Cigarette Act. The majority, following the views of the lower federal appellate courts, essentially concludes that the broad definition of the word \u201crequirement,\u201d as that term is used in section 5(b) of the 1969 Cigarette Act and interpreted in <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, requires we interpret the same word in section 136v(b) to have a similarly broad effect. (See, e.g., maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 325.) The word \u201crequirement,\u201d however, is not some type of \u201cpreemption litmus paper.\u201d Instead, we must look beyond superficial semantic similarities to determine what Congress actually intended under the particular circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Illustrative of this point is the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. 470, a case that postdates <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Medtronic, </em>the defendant contended the MDA preempted the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendant negligently designed a pacemaker. The relevant statute, 21 United States Code section 360k(a), provides that \u201cno State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014 [\u00b6] (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and [\u00b6] (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">One could conclude that the use of the word \u201crequirement\u201d in the MDA must mean the same thing as in the 1969 Cigarette Act, and thus the MDA must preempt state common law causes of action. This was, in fact, the precise argument of the defendant in <em>Medtronic: </em>\u201cMedtronic suggests that any common-law cause of action is a \u2018requirement\u2019 which alters incentives and imposes duties \u2018different from, or in addition to,\u2019 the generic federal standards that the [Federal Drug Administration] has promulgated in response to mandates under the MDA. In essence, the company argues that the plain language of the statute pre-empts any and all common-law claims brought by an injured plaintiff against a manufacturer of medical devices.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 486 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2251] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Supreme Court disagreed, finding the argument \u201cnot only unpersuasive,\u201d but \u201cimplausible\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 487 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2251] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.); see also <em>id. </em>at p. 505 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2260] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.) [agreeing the MDA does not preempt state common law causes of action]), and its discussion of the issue is illuminating. \u201cUnder Medtronic\u2019s view of the statute, Congress effectively precluded state courts from affording state consumers any protection from injuries resulting from a defective medical device. Moreover, because there is no explicit private cause of action against manufacturers contained in the MDA, and no suggestion that the Act created an implied private right of action, Congress would have barred most, if not all, relief for persons injured by defective medical devices. Medtronic\u2019s construction of \u00a7 360k would therefore have the perverse effect of granting complete immunity from design defect liability to an entire industry that, in the judgment of Congress, needed more stringent regulation in order \u2018to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use,\u2019 90 Stat. 539 (preamble to Act). It is, to say the least, \u2018difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct,\u2019 <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>464 U.S. 238, 251 [104 S.Ct. 615, 623, 78 L.Ed.2d 443] (1984), and it would take language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>much plainer than the text of \u00a7 360k to convince us that Congress intended that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u201cFurthermore, if Congress intended to preclude all common-law causes of action, it chose a singularly odd word with which to do it. The statute would have achieved an identical result, for instance, if it had precluded any \u2018remedy\u2019 under state law relating to medical devices. \u2018Requirement\u2019 appears to presume that the State is imposing a specific duty upon the manufacturer, and although we have on prior occasions concluded that a statute preempting certain state \u2018requirements\u2019 could also pre-empt common-law damages claims, see <em>Cipollone, </em>505 U.S., at 521-522 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2620] (opinion of Stevens, J.), that statute did not sweep nearly as broadly as Medtronic would have us believe that this statute does.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u201cThe pre-emptive statute in <em>Cipollone </em>was targeted at a limited set of state requirements\u2014those \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019\u2014and then only at a limited subset of the possible applications of those requirements\u2014those involving the \u2018advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of\u2019 the federal statute. See <em>id., </em>at 515 [521 U.S. at pp. 2616-2617]. In that context, giving the term \u2018requirement\u2019 its widest reasonable meaning did not have nearly the preemptive scope nor the effect on potential remedies that Medtronic\u2019s broad reading of the term would have in this suit. The Court in <em>Cipollone </em>held that the petitioner in that case was able to maintain some common-law actions using theories of the case that did not run afoul of the pre-emption statute. See <em>id., </em>at 524-530 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 2621-2624]. Here, however, Medtronic\u2019s sweeping interpretation of the statute would require far greater interference with state legal remedies, producing a serious intrusion into state sovereignty while simultaneously wiping out the possibility of remedy for the Lohrs\u2019 alleged injuries. <em>Given the ambiguities in the statute and the scope of the preclusion that would occur otherwise, we cannot accept Medtronic\u2019s argument that by using the term \u2018requirement, \u2019 Congress clearly signaled its intent to deprive States of any role in protecting consumers from the dangers inherent in many medical devices.\u201d (Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at pp. 487-489 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2251-2252] (plur. opn. of Stevens, J.), fns. omitted, italics added; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 505-508 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2260-2261] (cone. opn. of Breyer, J.) [agreeing the MDA does not preempt state tort law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">This same reluctance to ascribe to Congress an unstated intention to deprive consumers of their historic protection under this state\u2019s common law is applicable to the determination of the scope of FIFRA\u2019s preemptive effect. According to the majority, Congress intended to eliminate from all 50 states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>lawsuits that are based on a defendant\u2019s common law duty to warn of the dangers of a product it has placed into the stream of commerce. This historic ability of persons to gain redress for injuries caused by defective products is not replaced by creation of a federal cause of action. Instead, consumers are left with this meager \u201cremedy\u201d: they may complain to the administrator of the EPA that the label on the pesticide is inadequate and the manufacturer should be made to change it. As the high court concluded in <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. 470, with regard to the preemptive effect of the MDA, so too here it is implausible that Congress, through the use of such ambiguous statutory language, intended FIERA to effect this .sweeping change in the manner in which injured persons can gain compensation for their injuries. That FIFRA concerns a category of commercial products that, by design, are intended to kill living organisms and thus, by their nature, are potentially harmful to the biological environment and our very lives supplies further evidence that Congress could not have intended the broad preemptive effect now endorsed by the majority. Some post <em>-Medtronic </em>courts agree. <em>(Brown v. Chas. H. Lilly Co. </em>(1999) 161 Or.App. 402 [985 P.2d 846]; <em>Kawamata Farms v. United Agri Products, supra, </em>948 P.2d 1055 [negligence, strict liability and express warranty claims not preempted by FIFRA].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Does it make sense to interpret FIFRA to preempt positive law, in the form of statutes and regulations, but not to preempt suits at common law? Given the reality that suits at common law can have an indirect regulatory effect on the labeling of products, a decision that suits at common law are not preempted by FIFRA will lead to a situation in which states may not directly regulate labeling, but may indirectly do so. This state of affairs, however, is not unlike the situation the high court recognized in <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp., supra, </em>464 U.S. 238 <em>(Silkwood). </em>In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that in passing the Price-Anderson Act (Pub.L. No. 85-256 (Sept. 2, 1957) 71 Stat. 576), an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 et seq.), Congress intended that, despite the federal Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s exclusive regulatory power over safety matters in nuclear facilities, persons injured in such facilities remained free to utilize state tort remedies. \u201cNo doubt there is a tension between the conclusion that safety regulation is the exclusive concern of the federal law and the conclusion that a State may nevertheless award damages based on its own law of liability. But as we understand what was done over the years in the legislation concerning nuclear energy, Congress intended to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there was between them. We can do no less. It may be that the award of damages based on the state law of negligence or strict liability is regulatory in the sense that a nuclear plant will be threatened with damages liability if it does not conform to state standards, but that regulatory consequence was something that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Congress was quite willing to accept.\u201d <em>(Silkwood, supra, </em>at p. 256 [104 S.Ct. at p. 625]; see also <em>Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 174, 186 [108 S.Ct. 1704, 1712, 100 L.Ed.2d 158] [in a nuclear regulatory case, \u201cCongress may reasonably determine that incidental regulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory authority is not\u201d].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">As in <em>Silkwood, supra, </em>464 U.S. 238, it must be assumed, in the absence of a clear expression of congressional intent, that Congress intended to tolerate the tension between section 136v(b)\u2019s grant of exclusive power to the EPA over pesticide labeling and the availability of state tort remedies that could have an indirect effect on the content of such labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Section 136v(a) expressly affirms state regulatory power in the area of pesticides and thus suggests we should interpret FIERA\u2019s preemptive effect narrowly. Although <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. 504, suggested the word \u201crequirement\u201d be given a broad interpretation in the preemption context, the high court\u2019s later decision in <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. 470, revealed that such an interpretation is too simplistic. There being no clear and manifest expression of Congress\u2019s intent in FIERA to preempt state tort law <em>(Mortier, supra, </em>501 U.S. 597), and, it appearing implausible Congress intended to remove the remedies that historically have been available to compensate people for injuries caused by unreasonably dangerous commercial products, I conclude the majority\u2019s expansive view of FIERA\u2019s preemptive effect is erroneous. I thus respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Or, in the words of plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatory answer: \u201cSurfactants in aqueous solution that reach certain threshold concentrations solubilize epicuticular and cuticular waxes on the surface of plant tissue, such as on the surfaces of leaves, and can be inherently phytotoxic.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\">I recognize the lower federal appellate courts are largely in agreement with the majority, and I do not lightly reject their views. Nevertheless, \u201cthe decisions of the lower federal courts are persuasive <em>but not </em>controlling\u201d <em>(In re Tyrell J. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 68, 79 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 876 P.2d 519], italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 86 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457,460 P.2d 129] [lower federal court decisions entitled to great weight but are not binding]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 942, pp. 983-984 [same]), and we have an independent constitutional obligation to interpret the federal Constitution, which, of course, includes the supremacy clause of article VI, clause 2. (See Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 3 [judicial officers swear an oath to support the Constitution of the United States].) In any event, the majority of federal appellate court decisions cited by the majority predate the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. 470, which, as explained, <em>post, </em>found state tort law was not preempted despite the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201crequirement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Congress later amended the law to overrule the part of the <em>Silkwood </em>decision that interpreted the Price-Anderson Act to permit recovery of punitive damages under state law.
