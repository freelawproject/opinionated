The complaint shows affirmatively that this defendant never was charged by plaintiff for this work nor on this contract; on the contrary, by the contract and warrant this property was assessed and the charge for the work was made to Lucas, Turner &amp; Co., and not to defendant. (See Secs. 8-10 amending Secs. 48-50, Laws of 1861, 547, 548.) The warrant is made <em>prima fade </em>proof in plaintiff\u2019s favor (Laws of 1861, 548, Sec. 10, amending Sec. 50), but plaintiff shows by this warrant that Lucas, Turner &amp; Co., not this defendant, are the owners. Plaintiff is therefore estopped from charging any other party than Lucas, Turner &amp; Co. with the liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>It. No demand for the payment of this street work was made upon the defendant as required by statute. The complaint alleges that the demand was made upon Lucas, Turner &amp; Co.\u2019s agent. No allegations of demand upon this defendant, or that he could not conveniently be found, as required by the said Sec. 9 amending Sec. 49. (See also Laws of 1862, Sec. 11, p. 398.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-4\">HI. The Superintendent had no power to enlarge the time for completion of the contract. It would be palpably unjust to property owners, inducive of fraud and collusion between contractors and the Street Superintendent, to award a contract and then empower the Superintendent to extend <em>ad libitum </em>the time in the contractor\u2019s favor. Time is of the essence of the contract. Whether the law requires a clause limiting the time or not, if such a clause is inserted it binds the parties; and the property owner who has the statutory right to take the contract with the time clause, is justly supposed to accept or decline the contract in view of that clause, which may make a vast difference in the question of expense in performing the contract. Sec. 7, Stat. of 1862, 394, purporting to legalize extensions of contracts made before that time is, so far as it attempts this, unconstitutional, null, and void. It is a judicial act <em>ex post facto, </em>retroactive, and no Court should sustain it. (Sedgwick on Statutes, 166, 169, 177; Constitution of Cal., Art. 3; <em>Guy </em>v. <em>Hermance, </em>5 Cal. 74; 7 Johns. 508, 509; 7 Hill. 80.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-7\">IV. There is no force in plaintiff\u2019s allegation that defendant made no appeal to the Board of Supervisors. 1. The alleged extension of the contract annulled that contract. It was therefore no longer within the jurisdiction of the Board. (33 Barb. 147.) 2. Defendant had nothing to appeal from since he was never charged with the assessment. 3. Plaintiff has chosen to allege facts which, if true, exhibit no cause of action. He surely cannot recover when he sets forth that he has failed to comply with the terms of the statute under which he seeks to recover <em>stricti juris. </em>If he shows that he has not such a \u201c warrant \u201d as entitles him to sue, or that by reason of acts or omissions he is not entitled to the statutory \u201c warrant,\u201d he shows himself out of Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Robert C. </em>and <em>Daniel </em>Rogers, for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-4\">The extension of the time in which to complete the work was made by the Superintendent of Streets, one of the parties to the contract, upon the application of the contractor and his sureties; and as a party to the contract it was an act which he could legally do. Sec. 7 of the Act of 1862 (Statutes of 1862, 391) declares that in those cases where the time has been extended \u201c such act shall be deemed and held to have been legally done, and it shall be so held in all Courts of this State.\u201d The exercise of such a power is not within the prohibited powers of the Legislature. <em>(Hart </em>v. Gaven, 12 Cal. 478; <em>People </em>v. Seymour, 16 Id. 332.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-5\">Crocker, J. delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Norton, J. concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">This is an action brought by the assignee of a street contractor against a property holder to enforce a lien and payment for work done in grading Lombard Street, between Stockton and Mason streets, in the City of San Francisco. The defendent demurred to the complaint on the ground, among others, that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Court below overruled the demurrer, and no answer being filed, rendered a judgment for the plaintiff, from which the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The first objection to the complaint is, that the work was not done within the one hundred and thirty-five days specified in the contract; that the Superintendent had no authority to extend the time, as alleged in the complaint, and therefore the defendant is discharged from all liability. Sec. 43 of the act known as the Consolidation Law, as amended by the Act of 1861, confers the power of entering into contracts awarded by the Board of Supervisors for the grading of streets, upon the Superintendent of Streets, who is for that purpose the official agent of the city and the lot-holders. Sec. 44 provides that the work \u201c must in all cases be done under the direction and to the satisfaction of the Superintendent,\u201d and he is required to make the assessment and apportionment of the expenses. Sec. 45 provides that \u201c if any party directly interested in any such work, contract, or assessment,, shall feel aggrieved by the acts or determination of the said Superintendent in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>thereto, he may appeal to the Board of Supervisors, whose decision thereon, upon hearing, shall be final.\u201d We think it clear that the law vests full power in the Superintendent to make the contract, and also if he sees fit, to fix therein the time for the completion of the work, and to enlarge the time if he thinks proper. If in the performance of any of these acts any person directly interested feels aggrieved thereby, he has a remedy by appeal to the Board of Supervisors, and failing to so appeal he is to be deemed to have acquiesced therein. This objection, therefore, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The next objection is that as the complaint shows that the property was assessed to Lucas, Turner &amp; Co., and not to the defendant, therefore he is not hable. The complaint also avers that the defendant was, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, and ever since has been, the owner and in the possession of the premises, and the demurrer admits these facts. It is the <em>owner </em>that is made liable for the expense of grading; and the fact that the assessor erred, or was mistaken in the name of the true owner of the premises, does not release the real owner, or transfer the liabilily to a person who has rio interest in the property, or estop the plaintiff from enforcing his claim against the real party in interest who has received the benefit of the work performed\u201eby the plaintiff\u2019s assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">It is also urged that the complaint is defective in not averring a special demand upon the defendant. The forty-ninth section of the act provides that \u201c the contractor or his agent shall call upon the person so assessed, or them agents, if they can conveniently be found, and if payment be not made, shall demand payment upon the premises.\u201d The complaint fully avers a performance of these requirements. The act does not make a special demand upon the defendant necessary before a suit can be brought. The Court below properly overruled the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
