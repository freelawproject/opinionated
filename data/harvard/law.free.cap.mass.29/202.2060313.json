That action was duly entered at September term 1830, of the Court of Common Pleas, and the plaintiffs recovered judgment for $ 60*70 damage and $ 8*20 costs of suit. Upon this judgment execution was sued out, dated October 2, 1830, and put into the hands of a deputy sheriff, who on December 3d, and not before, demanded of Smith, by the plaintiffs\u2019 direction, the articles which he had attached on their original writ; with which demand Smith refused to comply. Soon af ter the attachment, to wit, on April 12, 1829, the defendant, at Brown\u2019s request, and without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, accepted one M\u2018Intosh as a receipter for the goods ; which were then restored to Brown\u2019s possession. On April 30, 1829, Brown commenced an action of trespass against Smith on account of some of the articles taken by him, which action was tried at February term 1830, on the general issue, and Brown recovered a verdict for 200 dollars. The plain tiffs defended the action for Smith at their sole expense, and after judgment they indemnified Smith by paying to Brown the damages recovered and all costs. In the trial of Brown\u2019s action against Smith, Brown gave in evidence to the jury the value of each of the articles named in this writ, and as he claimed damages for an interruption to his business, it was also given in evidence that he had had the use and possession of those articles ever after he procured the receipter as before mentioned. Brown contended, in his action, that those articles were tools of his trade, and so not subject to attachment, and such was the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">On December 6, 1830, the plaintiffs commenced this action against Smith, and if they were entitled to recover, the Court were to award such damages as law and justice should require ; otherwise the plaintiffs were to be nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-5\"><em>Mann </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUm\">The defendant was bound to transfer to the plaintiffs the tools of trade attached, for the plaintiffs having satisfied the judgment recovered by Brown, the property in the tools became vested in them. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>1 Pick. 62; <em>Keyworth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Aid. 685 ; 3 Stark.

The value was proved only in reference to the question whether they were exempted from attachment as tools of trade. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Pick. 83.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> See <em>Buel </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>Kirby, 40; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>1 Root, 481; <em>Catlin v. Lowrey, </em>1 Chipman, 397; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>2 Tyler, 208; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>21 Pick. 318</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards drawn up by</p>\n<author id=\"b216-12\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_2\">Upon the facts agreed the plaintiffs claim damages of the defendant for not safely keeping certain goods' by him attached on mesne process in their favor against one Brown, and for not delivering them to the plaintiffs\u2019 .agent on demand, so that the same might be taken on the plaintiffs\u2019 execution on the judgment recovered in that suit, or otherwise disposed of as the law directs.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">The defence is, that the plaintiffs\u2019\u201eexecution was put into hands of one John Baker, a deputy sheriff, and that no demand was made upon the defendant until after the space of thirty days from final judgment in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">And as to a part of the goods and articles attached, we are of opinion\" that the defence is well maintained and valid. At the period when the demand was made, the attachment was dissolved by lapse of time. If the goods had remained in the defendant\u2019s hands when the thirty days expired, he would have been liable immediately after to restore the possession to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>debtor ; and having restored it before that time on the accountable receipt of a third person, he is entitled to the same protection and defence as he could have claimed if the goods had been restored to the debtor after the thirty days. While the attachment continued, the attaching officer had the constructive possession of the goods attached, and a security for their delivery. The removal of the goods from the commonwealth had no effect on the rights and liabilities of the parties, but the defendant\u2019s remedy on his security, as to the portion of goods which were in Brown the debtor\u2019s possession, at the time of the demand, and which he had a right to retain, has been lost by the plaintiffs\u2019 laches ; and as to these goods the plaintiffs have no claim on the defendant either in law or equity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">But some of the goods the debtor had no right to withhold ; and the plaintiffs\u2019 remedy, as to these, remains unimpaired by the dissolution of the attachment; because by the action com menced by Brown against the officer, and by the recovery of judgment, and the satisfaction of it by the plaintiffs, the property was changed, and thereupon vested in them. The plaintiffs had the same right to claim these goods at the hands of the officer, as the debtor would have had after the attachment had been dissolved, if they had remained in the actual possession of the attaching officer, and there had been no permutation of property. It is not denied by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that such would be the legal effect of a recovery of the full value of the goods, but they contend that there was only a temporary conversion, that the goods were restored before the commencement of the debtor\u2019s action, and that he only recovered damages for the detention of them for a short time. But the facts agreed are irreconcilable with this supposition. It is agreed that the value of the goods was given in evidence on the trial of the action against the officer, and the amount of the verdict shows conclusively that the jury gave damages to the full extent of the value of the goods, and not for the mere detention of them for a few days. For the value of these goods, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>fore, at the time of the demand, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover ; and according to the agreed statement of facts, the defendant is to be defaulted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
