The judge decided that these facts could not be proved by the testimony of Collins, but must be proved by a copy of the record, and he directed a nonsuit; to which decision and direction the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-8\"><em>Jones, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOP\">cited as to the admissibility of the testimony, 3 Stark.

The plaintiff\u2019s case required him to show that a final judgment had been entered in the action in question, pending in another county. The evidence by the testimony of a witness, might have been very satisfactory in the particular case ; but by the general rul\u00e9, adopted for general convenience, we think it was inadmissible and was rightly rejected. The exception is overruled, and the judgment of the C. C. P. affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-18\"> See <em>Webb </em>v.
