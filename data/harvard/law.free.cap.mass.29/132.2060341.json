On the 18th of May, 1830, the note was taken up at the bank by the plaintiff, who had indorsed it subsequently to the defendant, and it was never returned to the bank. It was testified that the maker lived in Middleborough, in the county of Plymouth ; that he went away in the winter or spring of 1830 ; that when he went away it was expected that he would return, but before the month of May he had been heard from, and it was then understood that he was not coming back ; that he sent for his family, who left Middleborough in April and went to join him in Vermont; that he was destitute and embarrassed, though he held much real estate, and that his property was attached before the 18th of May and he was considered insolvent.

R. 524, and <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>13 Mass. R. 556, that as the note in suit was not at the Plymouth Bank on the day on which it became due, no legal demand was made, and therefore the defendant was discharged from liability as indorser.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\"> See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>1 Caro.
