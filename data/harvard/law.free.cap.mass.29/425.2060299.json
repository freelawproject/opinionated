Joshua Atkins testified that he run her upon shares, according to the agreement made with Zenas, and that the owners afterwards confirmed this agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">The judge instructed the jury, that if they were satisfied that the vessel had been chartered by the owners to the master, for the voyage in question, in pursuance of the supposed usage, they should find for the defendants, and that the questions how far the minority of the master, or the usage, would affect the rights and liabilities of the parties, would be reserved for the consideration of the whole Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">It was objected on the part of the plaintiff, that Zenas Atkins had no power from the owners to let the vessel to his brother, but that he was only authorized to give her up to him. As to this the jury were instructed, that they were to judge from the evidence, what was the intention of the owners in this respect, and whether under the circumstances the authority to give up the vessel did not imply an authority also to agree upon the terms ; and that in weighing the testimony on this point, the usage might serve in some measure to show what was the intention of the parties, or to substantiate the testimony of Zenas and Joshua Atkins ; but of this they would judge, taking it in connexion with the other evidence; and that the usage, whether valid or not, would not avail the defendants, unless the vessel was actually let or chartered to Joshua Atkins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">The jury lound a verdict for the defendants ; but if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>directions given to the jury were wrong, or if they aught to have been instructed that Joshua Atkins, being a minor, was not competent to charter the vessel, so as to relieve the owners from their liability to the shipper, in this case a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b440-6\"><em>March 25th, </em>1831.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-9\"><em>D.

They also argued that an infant might be the master of a vessel, and that any bonds required by law to be given by a master, would be binding on the infant as incidental to his capacity o'f master. 2 Inst. 382.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b441-12\"><em>April </em>6th, 1832.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Amb\">The defendants do not pretend that there was any charter-party showing the exact terms of the contract alleged to have been made between them and Joshua Atkins, the master of the schooner. But it is settled law in this Commonwealth, that a vessel may be chartered by parol, that the parol charterer, and not the general owner, is answerable to the shipper of goods, and that in this respect, when the general owner is to receive of the charterer a proportion of the profits for the use of the vessel, it is the same thing as if he was to receive a determinate sum, it being only the means of ascertaining the amount of the compensation. <em>Cutler </em>v. Winsor, 6 Pick. 335 ; <em>Perry </em>v. Osborne, 5 Pick. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We are to consider then, whether the defendants are exonerated from responsibility, on the ground of having let the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>vessel. And upon this point we are of opinion, that the questl0n \u00b0f fact was properly left to the jury, and that the Usage was admissible in \u25a0 evidence to explain the act of the owners, and to enable the jury to determine whether that act amounted to a letting to hire, or to an appointment of a master. It was argued that this was not an ancient usage ; but that is im*material. The question is, whether the parties contracted with reference to it; and in this view, the fact of its being well established, so as to be generally known to persons engaged in this course of business, is of importance, but not its antiquity. We cannot perceive that the verdict is not right, and so far therefore the owners appear not to be answerable to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0o\">But then it is objected, that the vessel was chartered to minor, and so the general owners are liable. We think <em>t </em>would be extremely difficult to sustain this proposition, lc would be to declare the contract with the minor an absolute nullity. Now the rule in regard to the contracts of a minor, and which was established for his protection, is, that they are voidable, not void ; they are valid as against- the party of full age, but may be avoided by the minor. Here the contract of hiring being good as against the general owners of the vessel, and not having been avoided by the minor, it could not be avoided by a stranger. The hirer became owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>and persons dealing with him did so as with a minor. But if the hiring were a nullity, it is doubtful whether the defendants could be liable, the vessel not being in fact employed on their account, and the minor being a wrong-doer, a trespasser. We do not however put the cause on this ground, but on the ground of the hiring being voidable and not void, and not avoided by the minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The question whether an infant can he master of a vessel, need not be determined in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> See <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>5 Shepl. 462; <em>Donnell </em>v. <em>Columbian Ins.
