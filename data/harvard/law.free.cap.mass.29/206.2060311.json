Those wdio were allowed to send to Medfield were included in the western school district. Those who sent to Natick and Dedham were not included in either the western or the eastern school district, as bounded, by the vote of 1807, but in the part of Dover left for the cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tre school district.

The report then <em>proceeds:\u2014\u201c </em>Israel Loring, Samuel Perry and Jacob Marshall to have liberty to send their children to the first school in Natick.

All other inhabitants of said district (of Dover) to belong to the centre school in said district.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">At the same meeting it was voted, that the school money should be divided in certain proportions between the three districts, and that a proportionate sum should be allowed to those inhabitants who paid their proportion of money to schools out of Dover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">The return on the warrant for the March meeting of the inhabitants of Dover in 1819, was as follows:\u2014\u201c Dover, March 1st, 1819. Pursuant to the within warrant, I have notified and warned the inhabitants of said Dover, and other inhabitants as therein expressed, to meet at the time and place and for the purposes therein mentioned. Jonathan Battelle junior.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">One article in this warrant was, \u201c to see if the district (o\u00ed Dover) will define or renew the limits of their school districts or act any thing thereon that shall facilitate the rebuilding of their school-houses if thought expedient, or to enable any one of said school districts to act on the subject.\u201d Upon which it was voted, that Israel Loring and other persons named, and the estate of Samuel Perry or his heirs, be included in the centre district for building their school-house, and that Simon Cheney and other persons named be exempted from the centre district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\">Loring and others, first named m the foregoing vote, were those who had sent their children to Natick, and Cheney and others, last named, were those who had sent to Dedham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\">The supposed reason for exempting the last mentioned class of individuals was, that they had in 1806 contributed the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of $78.09 towards building the school-house in Dedham. But the school district in Dedham was a common school district ; that is, unincorporated ; though these exempts had always sent their children there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-7\">On the 2d of May, 1827, the selectmen of Dover issued their warrant to Nathan M. Fisher, an inhabitant of the centre school district, directing him to warn the inhabitants to meet at a place specified, on the 10th of the same May, among other things, \u201c to see if the district will vote to build a schoolhouse,\u201d and \u201c to see if the district will grant money to defray the expense of building a school-house.\u201d Fisher made return as follows. \u2014 \u201cCommonwealth, &amp;c.

This sum went into the treasury of Dover, and to recover it back, this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-11\">Judgment was to be rendered for the plaintiff or for the de fendants, according to the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The cause was argued in writing.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-4\"><em>Metcalf </em>and <em>Mann, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6T\">contended that the district of Dover had never been legally divided into school districts. <em>St. </em>1789, c. 19, \u00a7 <em>2 </em>; <em>Withington </em>v.

The cases cited respecting the returns of the warrants, are not analogous. They are all cases of precepts issuing from judicial courts, to be executed under their authority and subject to their revision and control. Whereas the warning of town or district meetings is for the purpose of giving every one an opportunity to act on the several matters contained in the warrants, and to protect their own rights, and may be presumed to be regular and legal if the meeting is held in pursuance of the warrant, and the matters therein contained are acted upon without any objection to the legality of the warning; and considering the almost universal practice of the country in this particular, without this necessary presumption most of the proceedings in town and school district meetings would be vitiated, and great inconveniences would arise. <em>Saxton </em>v. <em>Nimms, </em>14 Mass. R. 320; <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>1 Pick. 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-8\">The objection that the districting was not by geographical .ines, cannot prevail. The committee first set off the western and eastern school districts by geographical lines, and it is manifestly their intention that the rest of Dover, which is equally well defined, being the territory comprehended between those districts, should constitute the third or centre district. It is said that Samuel Perry and others were excluded from the centre district and were not included in any of the districts. But it cannot be supposed that the committee in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>tended to disfranchise them ; and the language of the provisions authorizing them to send their children to schools out of Dover, and to pay to those schools their proportion of the money annually granted by Dover for the support of schools, was merely permissive. They had still a legal right to send their children to the centre district school. Had the words in the report, \u201c all the other inhabitants to belong to the centre district,\u201d preceded the names of those persons to whom this liberty was given, ho question could fairly have been raised as to the districting being by geographical lines ; and the Court will not permit the inartificial collocation of the two sentences, made by unlearned men, to have the effect to destroy the districting and defeat the manifest intention both of the inhabitants of Dover and of their committee. The vote of 1819, to include the estate of Samuel Perry or his heirs in the centre district for the purpose of building a school-house, did not annex him to that district, but was merely declaratory of his liability as a member of that district to pay his proportion of all grants made by that district for their own particular purposes, and so was not a districting in a limited and partial manner or for a special purpose only, as suggested by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-8\">Lastly, the plaintiff contends, that supposing the districting to be valid, the assessment is illegal and void, because Cheney and others belonging to the centre district were not assessed ; and he attempts to distinguish this case from several which he cites. He assumes however that the omission was not founded on mistake or error of judgment, but was a plain, deliberate and premeditated violation of right. The omission may have been irregular, but it evidently proceeded upon equitable considerations and upon a mistake in law, and according to the cases referred to, it did not render the tax void, so as to discharge the plaintiff from his liability to pay his proportion of it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-9\">Morton J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahg\">drew up the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is founded upon the illegality of the assessment made upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The first objection to the assessment is, that the school meeting at which the money was granted was not legally warned. The return of the freeholder to whom the warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>was directed, bears date on the day appointed for the meeting ; and states that he had \u201c warned all the legal voters \u201d in the district \u201c to meet at the time and place and for the purposes within mentioned.\u201d When the selectmen direct a warrant for calling a school district meeting, to a proper person, he is made a returning officer for that occasion, and all his acts done in pursuance of such special authority, are to be treated like those of other returning officers. The returns on warrants for town, district, or other corporate meetings may sometimes be treated with greater lenity than returns upon writs and other judicial precepts ; but the principles applicable to both are essentially the same. <em>Lancaster </em>v. Pope, 1 Mass. R. 86; <em>Davis </em>v. Maynard, 9 Mass. R. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">All returning officers are ministerial and are bound to set forth in their returns all the acts by them done, that the proper tribunal may judge of their sufficiency. They are not competent to judge of the legality of a notice or service, and a return that a precept had been <em>legally </em>served, or that the duty enjoined by a warrant had been <em>duly </em>performed, would most clearly be insufficient. But in this case the return does not even state that the voters had been <em>duly </em>or <em>legally </em>warned.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The law (St. 1799, c. 66, \u00a74, and St. 1826, c. 143, \u00a7 14,) requires that warrants for school district meetings shall be served by giving personal notice to, or leaving a written notification at the usual place of abode of every legal voter in the district. The term warned, according to its common use and acceptation, implies that notice had been given, but whether by posting up copies of the warrant, in some public places, as is usual in other cases, or in one of the modes prescribed by the statute, is left entirely uncertain. Either of the three modes would satisfy the usual import of this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The statute further requires that the notice 'shall be given <em>seven </em>days before the time appointed for the meeting. All that can fairly be inferred from the language used is, that notice had been given before the return was made. The person making the return says, <em>\u201c I have </em>warned,\u201d but whether <em>one </em>or <em>seven </em>days before the meeting, he does not state. The return would not be <em>false </em>if the notice had been given but a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>day before the meeting, or if it had been given by posting notifications, instead of personal notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The case of <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Stearns et al., </em>1 Pick. 109, is clearly distinguishable from this. There the money had been legally granted, and fairly assessed. The only question was whether the assessors had been legally chosen. Under all the circumstances of that case, the Court held that the assessors were not liable to an action of trespass. If the defective warning had related to the meeting at which the money xvas granted, it would have stood on different grounds and might have received a different decision. If in the case at bar the money had been legally voted and the defective return applied to the warrant for the meeting when the assessors were chosen, it would have presented a different question. It is also to be recollected, that the return now under consideration is much more defective than the one in the case cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The return of the officer is the only competent evidence of the service of the warrant. And as it does not appear from this evidence, that the inhabitants of the district xvere notified in the manner or for the length of time required by laxv, the meeting was not legally holden ; and the proceedings were invalid. As the defect appears of record, the assessors might have known it and refused to assess the tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">But this error is one which may be remedied, if the facts will admit of it, by an amendment of 'the return. <em>Welles </em>v. <em>Bat</em>telle, 11 Mass. R. 477. We will therefore proceed to examine the other objections to the validity of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">In 1807 the inhabitants of Dover undertook, in pursuance of the statute 1789, c. 19, \u00a7 2, to \u201c determine and define the limits \u201d of their school districts. They appointed a committee who made a report which was accepted by and became the act of the district. This report geographically designated the east and west districts, and provided that each should include all the inhabitants upon its respective territory. Then comes the following language : \u201c H. T., B. T. and S. C. to have liberty to send their children to school in the westerly part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Dedham. I. L., S. P. and J. M. to have liberty to send their children to the first school in Natick. E. A. and J. N. to have liberty to send their children to the north school in Medfield. All other inhabitants of said district (of Dover) to belong to the centre school in said district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">What is the true meaning of this language ? <em>Ml other inhabitants, 8fc. </em>Other than whom ? Who are excluded from the centre school ? Clearly the individuals first named ; and doubtless all the inhabitants included in the east and west districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Towns can execute the power given them to \u201c determine and define the limits of school districts,\u201d only by geographical divisions of their territories. <em>Withington </em>v. <em>Eveleth, 7 </em>Pick. 106. If the words \u201c <em>all other inhabitants\u201d </em>had immediately succeeded the formation of the other two districts, as suggested by the defendants\u2019 counsel, we think the districting might have been sustained. Although the expression naturally refers to individuals ; yet taken in connexion with the other parts of the report, it might properly be understood to extend to the remaining territory, as well as to the inhabitants residing upon it; and thus to form a third geographical district.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">But we are bound to take the report as it was adopted. And we can no more change the arrangement of the words and sentences, than we can change the words and sentences themselves. And according to the obvious as well as the grammatical construction, it is quite as clear that the <em>individuals named </em>were to be excluded from \u201c the centre school,\u201d as that the inhabitants of the other two districts were to be excluded. Under this construction it can hardly be said that a territorial district was formed. None was defined by metes and bounds. It was not provided that all the remaining territory should form the centre district. But certain individuals were to compose the district, and if it included their estates, the territory would change with every change of their estates. The principles of the case of <em>Withington </em>v. <em>Eveleth </em>apply to this part of the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">But even if we could construe this act of the inhabitants of Dover so as to establish a territorial district, yet the individuals named would necessarily be excluded, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>before seen ; and for this cause the districting would be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Towns, in executing the power to form school districts, are bound so to do it, as to include every inhabitant in some of the districts. They cannot lawfully omit any and thus deprive them of the benefits of our invaluable system of free schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In whatever light, therefore, we view this subject, we are brought to the same conclusion. If the district was not legally established, the assessors could derive no authority from it to make the assessment. If it was legally established, yet the plaintiff was not included in it, and therefore could not rightfully be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">But it is contended, that if the plaintiff and his associates were not included in the original district, yet that they were annexed to it by the vote of 1819. The power of towns to divid\u00e9 or alter old districts or to form new ones is unquestionable. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Daggett et al., </em>4 Mass. R. 534. But this, if done at all, must be done absolutely. The same persons cannot belong to one district for one purpose and to another for a different one. The vote was, that certain persons, among whom was the plaintiff, \u201c be included in the centre district fo*\u25a0 <em>building their school-house, </em>\u201d and that certain others \u201c be exempted from said district.\u201d The district of Dover had no power to form districts or to annex citizens to districts already formed for special purposes. Towns may define the limits of school districts ; but the law determines the rights and duties of the inhabitants of them when they are established. This vote therefore, whether considered in reference to the annexation of the plaintiff and others to the centre district or to the exemption of S. C. and others, was unauthorized and ineffective. But if it could not operate to annex the plaintiff to the centre district, <em>a fortiori, </em>it could not give validity to a districting which before was inoperative and void.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">According to the agreement of the parties, the defendants must be defaulted and judgment be given for the plaintiff for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the amount of the tax which was collected of him and for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">The general question, whether a town is liable to an action for money collected on an illegal assessment upon a school district, is not raised in this case, nor was it alluded to in the arguments of counsel on either side. Their object seemed to be to try the validity of the assessment, unembarrassed with any formal or technical objections. And it might as well be tried in this action as any other. It may however be proper to remark, that it is not easy to see how in ordinary circumstances such an action could be sustained. By <em>St. </em>1826, c. 143, \u00a7 11, the collector is required to pay over the money when collected, to the town treasurer ; but the latter receives it as the agent of the district and holds it subject to \u201c the disposal of the committee of the district.\u201d The town have no control over it, and the treasurer would not be justified in paying it away by their order. It would therefore seem that it could not be considered in the possession of the town, and that they should not be in any way responsible for it. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Merrill et al., </em>10 Pick. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">It is however expressly agreed by the parties in this case, that the money collected of the plaintiff \u201c came into the treasury of the district of Dover.\u201d It was not legally there. The district had no right to retain it. And it having been taken from the plaintiff without his consent and without legal authority, he is entitled to recover it back.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-12\"> But see <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>23 Pick. 237; <em>Briggs </em>v <em>Murdock, </em>13 Pick. 305</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-12-pl-split\"> See Rev.
