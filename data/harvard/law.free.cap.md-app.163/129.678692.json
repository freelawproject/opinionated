White, appellant, filed suit on March 18, 2004, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, against appellees Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cCounty\u201d) and four of its police officers: Mark Elie; Herbert Pettiford, Jr.; Barba; and Evans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As amended in May 2004, appellant alleged a violation of his civil and constitutional rights; battery and the use of excessive force; and negligent entrustment of a police dog and \u201ccontinuing police powers\u201d to Officer Elie. Appellees moved to dismiss, claiming appellant failed to provide the requisite notice under the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d), Md. Code (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 <em>at seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC. j.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>After the court granted appellees\u2019 motions and then denied appellant\u2019s motion to alter or amend, White noted this appeal. He presents two questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">I. Did the Trial Court commit error by failing to find substantial compliance with the 180 day notice requirement of Courts and Judicial Proceedings (CJ) [\u00a7 ] 5-304?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">II. Did the Trial Court commit error by failing to find good cause for not following the strict requirements of CJ [\u00a7 ] 5-304?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Appellant was arrested by Prince George\u2019s County Police officers on April 23, 2001, and was charged with first degree burglary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The arrest led appellant to file the underlying suit, alleging police brutality during the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In response to a motion to dismiss filed by the County alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the County was misnamed, appellant filed an Amended Complaint on May 10, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> White alleged that, after he \u201cpeacefully\u201d surrendered, he was handcuffed and ordered to \u201clay on the floor.\u201d Then, according to appellant, \u201cwithout cause or provocation,\u201d Officer Elie \u201creleased his [police] dog and ordered the dog to bite.\u201d Appellant averred that the dog \u201cviolently bit\u201d him, \u201ctearing flesh from [appellant\u2019s] leg.\u201d When appellant attempted to stand, Officer Elie struck him in the head with a baton, \u201csplitting open\u201d appellant\u2019s head and inflicting a wound that required twenty-four stitches. Although Officers Pettiford, Barba, and Evans \u201cwere present during the entire incident,\u201d White claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>they \u201ctook no action to prevent Officer Elie from causing injury\u201d to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Because the Amended Complaint failed to allege compliance with the statutory notice requirement in C.J. \u00a7 5-304, appellees moved to dismiss the suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Entertain Suit,\u201d claiming substantial compliance with the notice requirement and good cause for failing to follow \u201cthe strict requirements of C.J. \u00a7 5-304(a).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">With his Motion to Entertain Suit, appellant submitted an undated affidavit. He averred, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">2. After the incidents alleged in the Complaint, I filed a Complaint with the Prince George\u2019s County Police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">3. I was visited by Sgt. Allen W. Dis[c]hinger who stated that he was from Internal Affairs and that my complaint was being investigated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">4. I was told to take no action while the investigation was taking place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">5. I received subsequent visits by Sgt. Allen W. Dis[c]hinger when I was again assured that the matter was being investigated and I would be advised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">6. I took no action as instructed and awaited action to be taken by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">7. Any delay in this matter was induced by the representations of the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">White also submitted a copy of the business card of Sergeant Dischinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Thereafter, the County filed an Opposition to the Motion to Entertain Suit. Appellees also submitted an undated affidavit of Sergeant Allen Dischinger, who averred, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>1. I am currently employed as a sergeant for the Prince George\u2019s County police department, assigned to the homicide unit. I have been a Prince George\u2019s County police officer for 23 years and a detective for most of that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">2. I was the iad investigator for the case referenced in Plaintiffs Complained [sic] filed in the above-captioned case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">3. I spoke with the Plaintiff on two occasions \u2014 both at the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center. The first visit was on 7/24/01, during which time I took a taped witness statement from him. I also visited the Plaintiff on 8/1/01 for purposes of photographing him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">4. At no time did I indicate to the Plaintiff that he was \u201cto take no action\u201d while the investigation was taking place. The exhibits reflect that, in July of 2001, appellant filed with</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) a complaint of police brutality in connection with his arrest in April of 2001. In response, on July 18, 2001, Captain Ellis Jones, Commander of the Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Division (\u201cLAD.\u201d), wrote a letter to appellant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The letterhead on the stationery said, \u201cThe Prince George\u2019s County Government.\u201d Across the bottom of the letter, it stated: \u201cHEADQUARTERS: 7600 Barlowe Road, Palmer Park, MD 20785,\u201d which is the primary address for the Department. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">This is to advise you that your complaint was received by this Department on July 18, 2001. Since your complaint alleges brutality on the part of a member of this Department, it must meet certain conditions mandated by State law before any investigation can be conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">On July 1, 1977, the State legislature amended the \u201cLaw Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u201d Article 27, Section 727-734D of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Section 728B(4) states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">\u201cA complaint against a law enforcement officer, alleging brutality in the execution of his duties, <em>may not be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>investigated unless the complaint be duly sworn to by the aggrieved person, </em>a member of the aggrieved person\u2019s immediate family, or by any person with first hand knowledge obtained as a result of the presence at and observation of the alleged incident, or by the parent or guardian in the case of a minor child, before an official authorized to administer oaths. An investigation which could lead to disciplinary action under this subtitle for brutality may not be initiated arid an action may not be taken unless the complaint is filed within 90 days of the alleged brutality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avz\">Therefore, the Police Department is prohibited, by law from conducting any investigation in regard to the brutality portion of your complaint <em>due to the fact it has not been duly sworn to and notarized. </em>Sgt. Allen W. Dischinger # 972, will be contacting you to arrange a meeting to have your complaint notarized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">In the event you have any questions concerning the matter, please do not hesitate to contact any member of the Internal Affairs Division at (301) 896-2660.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Thereafter, on July 24, 2001, Sergeant Allen W. Dischinger, an I.A.D. investigator, met with appellant and took a recorded statement from him. He then photographed appellant on August 1, 2001.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No evidence was presented showing that appellant had any further contact with the Department or I.A.D. personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In the meantime, on July 31, 2001, appellant completed and signed a notarized form with respect to the incident of April 23, 2001,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> titled \u201cPrince George\u2019s County Police Department Complaint Against Police Practices.\u201d In the space provided to describe the incident, appellant wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve Already Provided A Statement!\u201d The top of the form included two pre-printed addresses for the Department. One was for the Headquarters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>located in Palmer Park, and the other was for the Internal Affairs unit in Clinton. In the section asking for the names of the officers \u201cinvolved\u201d in the alleged brutality incident, appellant wrote \u201cCPL Elie,\u201d \u201cPFC Barba,\u201d \u201cP.O. Pettiford,\u201d and \u201cP.O. Evans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Tn a \u201cMemorandum Opinion of the Court\u201d dated July 7, 2004, the court granted the Motion to Dismiss, without a hearing. The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">Before the Court is the question of whether or not the Plaintiff in the above-referenced case provided the required notice or had good cause not to, before bringing an action for unliquidated damages against Defendants as outlined under the Local Government Tort Claims Act....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">As outlined by the Court of Appeals, <em>\u201cike purpose of the notice requirements under the LGTCA is to ensure that the local government is made aware of its possible liability at a time when it is able to conduct its own investigation, and ascertain, for itself, from evidence and recollection that are fresh and undiminished by time, the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility for it.\u201d Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 807 A.2d 632 (2002).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\"><em>\u201cRelevant to determining the amount of diligence with which an \u2018ordinarily prudent </em>person\u2019 <em>under the circumstances of [his/her case] would prosecute his or her claim is the underlying purpose of the notice statute.\u201d Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 807 A.2d 632 (2002).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Plaintiff asserts by affidavit that he filed a complaint with the Prince George\u2019s Police department and that [Sergeant Dischinger] advised him to take no action while the matter was being investigated. He also states that the same officer visited him and assured him that the matter was being investigated. Plaintiff offers the above as proof that he substantially complied with the notice requirements of the LGTCA and that he had good cause not to follow the strict statutory requirements thus the court may still entertain his suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The LGTCA statute explicitly states that actions for unliquidated damages may not be pursued unless notice is given within 180 days after the injury. In this instance, notice was not given until approximately two years later.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] While the Plaintiffs affidavit offers his reasoning for his untimely filing, relying on the internal affairs officer\u2019s advice, the Plaintiff offers no other evidence of any communications with the internal affairs officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, he offers no evidence of an ongoing police investigation that would warrant excusing his lack of diligence. This court finds that an <em>\u2018ordinarily prudent person\u2019 </em>would have, and should have, done more to ensure his action was proceeding in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Opinion and Order of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Under the circumstances of this case the Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating good cause and substantial compliance. Viewing this case in [ ]the light most favorable to the Plaintiff the court finds that he has offered no direct evidence of specific dates, times, or communications to support his allegations so that the court could justifiably infer that any of the Defendants were put on notice within the statutorily prescribed time limits. As such, the court need not address the issue of whether or not the Defendants have been prejudiced by lack of the required notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">On the same date, July 7, 2004, the court issued an \u201cOrder of Court,\u201d granting appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss the case. That ruling prompted appellant to file, on July 14, 2004, a \u201cMotion to Alter and Amend Judgment (Rule 2-534) or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Alternative to Revise (Rule 2-535).\u201d With that motion, appellant submitted the letter of July 18, 2001, from the Department and his notarized complaint of July 31, 2001, along with an affidavit referring to the exhibits. Then, on August 3, 2004, White noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Thereafter, on August 5, 2004, appellees filed an opposition to the revisory motion. The court denied \u201cPlaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration\u201d by \u201cOrder of Court\u201d dated August 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Preliminarily, we shall address appellees\u2019 contentions that 1) appellant noted an appeal solely from the circuit court\u2019s ruling of July 7, 2004, and that 2) because appellant did not appeal from the denial of his revisory motion, it is not appropriate for us to consider the exhibits that appellant attached to his motion to alter or amend. Appellees assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">Had Appellant noted an appeal from the Court\u2019s denial of his \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend judgment (Rule 2-534) or in the Alternative to Revise (Rule 2-535)\u201d these exhibits might properly be considered in an appeal from <em>that </em>judgment. They should not, however, be considered in a review of the Court\u2019s original judgment dismissing the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">When, as here, a motion to alter or amend is filed within ten days after entry of judgment, the filing of the motion stays the time for filing an appeal until thirty days after the court rules on the revisory motion. <em>Southern Mgmt. Corp. v. Taha, </em>378 Md. 461, 494 n. 13, 836 A.2d 627 (2003); <em>Unnamed Attorney v. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 486, 494 A.2d 940 (1985); <em>Pickett v. Noba, Inc., </em>114 Md.App. 552, 557, 691 A.2d 268 (1997), <em>on reconsideration, </em>122 Md.App. 566, 714 A.2d 212 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 663, 719 A.2d 1262 (1998); <em>Stephenson v. Goins, </em>99 Md.App. 220, 225-26, 636 A.2d 481, <em>cert. denied, </em>335 Md. 229, 643 A.2d 384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>(1994). As we explained in <em>Sieck v. Sieck, </em>66 Md.App. 37, 44-45, 502 A.2d 528 (1986), a motion to revise a court\u2019s judgment, \u201chowever labeled, filed within ten days after the entry of judgment will be treated as a Rule 2-534 motion.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Of import here, if a notice of appeal is filed before the court has ruled on a post-judgment motion, the appeal \u201cwill not lose its efficacy ... but its effect will be delayed until the trial court rules on the pending motion.... \u201d <em>Edsall v. Anne Arundel County, </em>332 Md. 502, 506, 632 A.2d 763 (1993). Because appellant filed his revisory motion within ten days of the Order granting the motion to dismiss, appellant is entitled to a review of both the motion to dismiss and the motion to alter or amend. This includes the exhibits that appellant appended to his revisory motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In order to pursue a claim for unliquidated damages under the LGTCA, the claimant must comply with the 180-day notice requirement set forth in C.J. \u00a7 5-304. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\u00a7 5-304. Actions for unliquidated damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">(a) <em>Notice required. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, an action for unliquidated damages may not be brought against a local government or its employees unless the notice of the claim required by this section is given within 180 days after the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">(b) <em>Manner of giving </em>notice.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">(2) In ... Prince George\u2019s County, the notice shall be given in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, bearing a postmark from the United States Postal Service, by the claimant or the representative of the claimant, <em>to the county solicitor or county attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">(3) The notice shall be in writing and shall state the time, place, and cause of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>(c) <em>Waiver of notice requirement. </em>\u2014 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, unless the defendant can affirmatively show that its defense has been prejudiced by lack of required notice, upon motion and for good cause shown the court may entertain the suit even though the required notice was not given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Appellant concedes that he did not strictly comply with the notice provision of the LGTGA. Nevertheless, he contends that the court erred when it failed to find that he substantially complied with C.J. \u00a7 5-304. In his view, the County was put on notice when he timely filed his brutality complaint with the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">With respect to the matter of substantial compliance, appellant observes that 1) he timely sent a letter to the Department in July 2001, which was received on July 18, 2001; 2) the Department commenced an investigation and, to that end, Sergeant Dischinger met with appellant on two occasions, all within the statutory notice period; 3) based on the letterhead that appears on the Department\u2019s letter of July 18, 2001, it \u201cwould lead a reasonable person to believe that Prince George\u2019s County is on notice.\u201d He adds: \u201cHow can the County and the officers ... complain that they were not on notice to allow a timely investigation when they acknowledged the complaint and commenced the investigation?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Appellees respond that the court below did not err in dismissing the suit based on appellant\u2019s failure to comply with C.J. \u00a7 5-304, because appellant did not provide the requisite notice within 180 days. In their view, the complaint filed with the Department did not constitute substantial compliance because \u201cthere is no allegation that it was a notice of claim for unliquidated damages, as required by C.J. \u00a7 5-304,\u201d nor was there any \u201callegation or evidence that the police department was authorized to investigate or settle tort claims on behalf of Prince George\u2019s County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Housing Auth. v. Bennett, </em>359 Md. 356, 358, 754 A.2d 367 (2000), \u201c[ujntil the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>twentieth century, local governments generally had no immunity under Maryland common law in either tort or contract actions.\u201d <em>See Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>157 Md.App. 462, 475, 852 A.2d 1005 (2004), <em>affirmed, </em>386 Md. 104, 124, 872 A.2d 1 (2005). In the early twentieth century, however, the Court of Appeals recognized that local governments had \u201cimmunity in certain types of tort actions based on activity categorized as \u2018governmental\u2019 but had no immunity in tort actions based on activity categorized as \u2018private\u2019 or \u2018corporate\u2019 or \u2018proprietary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bennett, </em>359 Md. at 359, 754 A.2d 367. Thus, \u201cshaped largely by judicial decisions and by statutes dealing with specific agencies or specific matters,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 358, 754 A.2d 367, local governments enjoyed limited immunity from tort liability for \u201cnonconstitutional torts based on activity categorized as \u2018governmental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 754 A.2d 367. <em>See DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 47, 729 A.2d 354 (1999) (\u201cA local governmental entity is liable for its torts if the tortious conduct occurs while the entity is acting in a private or proprietary capacity, but, unless its immunity is legislatively waived, it is immune from liability for tortious conduct committed while the entity is acting in a governmental capacity\u201d); <em>Baltimore Police Department v. Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. 282, 314, 780 A.2d 410 (2001) (stating that \u201clocal governmental bodies have common law governmental immunity only for acts that are governmental, and not for private or proprietary acts, and they do not have immunity from liability for State constitutional torts\u201d); <em>see also Harford County v. Town of Bel Air, </em>348 Md. 363, 373, 704 A.2d 421 (1998); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 101, 660 A.2d 447 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">With the enactment of the LGTCA, codified at C.J. \u00a7\u00a7 5-301, <em>et. seq., </em>the Legislature sought to \u201c \u2018provide a remedy for those injured by local government officers and employees acting without malice and in the scope of their employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faulk v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 298, 808 A.2d 1262 (2002) (citation omitted). At the same time, it sought to ensure \u201cthat the financial burden of compensation is carried by the local government ultimately responsible for the responsible public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>officials\u2019 acts.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. at 108, 660 A.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">C.J. \u00a7 5-304, set forth above, contains the notice requirement that applies to such tort actions. The Court of Appeals recently ruled that the 180-day notice requirement of \u00a7 5-304 is constitutional under both federal and state law. <em>Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>386 Md. 104, 120, 135, 136, 872 A.2d 1 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">As the Court explained in <em>Neuenschwander v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>187 Md. 67, 76, 48 A.2d 593 (1946), <em>overruled on other grounds as stated in Arnold v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>270 Md. 285, 311 A.2d 223 (1973), the notice requirement derives from the Legislature\u2019s authority to grant or deny an individual the right to pursue a legal action against a municipal corporation. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">When the Legislature creates a municipal corporation as part of the machinery of government of the State, it is within its province to adjust the relative rights of the corporation and the citizens.

Serving timely notice is essential to preserve a claimant\u2019s right to file suit at any time during the limitations period. In contrast to the tolling of limitations, nothing in the LGTCA expressly provides for tolling the notice period. <em>See American Gen. Assur. Co. v.

His reliance on <em>Moore </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><em>Moore </em>was a consolidated appeal, arising from separate vehicular accidents involving Montgomery County employees and two claimants, Moore and Mendelson. <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 158-59, 807 A.2d 632. Within days of the accident, the claimants discussed the accidents with representatives of Trigon Administrators, Inc. (\u201cTrigon\u201d), Montgomery County\u2019s third party claims administrator. <em>Id. </em>at 162-64, 807 A.2d 632. Trigon\u2019s representative identified himself as the claims administrator for the county and advised that \u201cformal notification\u201d had been received. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 807 A.2d 632. However, notice was not provided directly to the County, in the manner directed by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 807 A.2d 632; <em>see </em>LGTCA, \u00a7 5-304(b)(l)(iii). Because the claimants failed to notify the County Executive, as required by the statute, Montgomery County argued that they failed to satisfy the statutory notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>requirement under the LGTCA. <em>Moore, </em>371 at 170, 807 A.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The Court recognized that \u201cstrict compliance with the notice provisions of the LGTCA is not always required; substantial compliance may suffice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 171, 807 A.2d 632, \u201ceven though not all of the details prescribed have been complied with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, of import here, the Court underscored that \u201c[t]here must be some effort to provide the requisite notice and, in fact, it must be provided, albeit not in strict compliance with the statutory provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the defective notice must satisfy \u201cthe purpose\u201d of the notice provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The Court then considered whether \u201cnotice to a third-party claims administrator, acting on behalf of a local government,\u201d constituted substantial compliance with the notice requirements of the LGTCA \u00a7 5-304. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 807 A.2d 632. The Court defined \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d as \u201c \u2018such communication that provides the State \u201crequisite and timely notice of facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 807 A.2d 632 (citations omitted). In its view, \u201c \u2018[substantial compliance turns on ensuring that the County [or local government] has sufficient actual notice to perform a proper and timely investigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 807 A.2d 632 (citation omitted; alteration in <em>Moore).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In the Court\u2019s view, the parties substantially complied with the notice statute, given the nature of the County\u2019s system of claims administration and the control that the County exercised over Trigon\u2019s activities. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 807 A.2d 632. The <em>Moore </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">[W]here the tort claimant provides the local government, <em>through the unit or division with the responsibility for investigating tort claims </em>against that local government, or the company with whom the local government or unit has contracted for that function, the information required by \u00a7 5-304(b)(3) to be supplied, <em>who thus acquires actual knowledge within the statutory period, </em>the tort claimant has substantially complied with the notice provisions of the LGTCA. This test is fair and has the advantage of taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>account of the reality of how tort elaims actually are handled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 178, 807 A.2d 632 (emphasis added). <em>See also Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 307-08, 808 A.2d 1262 (concluding that plaintiffs timely notice to town\u2019s insurer, rather then the town, constituted substantial compliance with statutory notice requirement, because notice was provided in sufficient time to enable the town to conduct a \u201ctimely investigation\u201d; the \u201c \u2018evidence and recollection [were] fresh and undiminished by time\u2019 \u201d; and the insurer was notified \u201cthat Plaintiff expected some type of compensation from its insured, the Town of Easton, for his personal injuries and property damage\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Based on the foregoing, we are satisfied that appellant did not substantially comply with the statutory notice requirement by filing a complaint with I.A.D. about police brutality. Unlike in <em>Moore, </em>appellant did not provide notice to an entity with responsibility for investigating tort claims lodged against the County. Instead, appellant sent notice to the Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Division. The content of that complaint pertained to White\u2019s allegation of police brutality, not to tort claims arising from such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Moreover, the investigation that ensued was conducted by and for I.A.D., under a wholly separate procedure. Indeed, as the Department\u2019s letter of July 18, 2001 reflects, the Department indicated that appellant\u2019s brutality claim was governed by the statute pertaining to the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (\u201cLEOBR\u201d) under Md. Code (1999 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734 D.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Notice to I.A.D. simply was not notice to the County Attorney or County Solicitor, as required by C.J. \u00a7 5-304(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">To be sure, in <em>Moore, </em>the Court indicated that substantial compliance may be found when notice is provided to the entity responsible for investigating the tort claim, rather than to the party named in the statute. That is not what happened here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>however. Indeed, there was no indication of a relationship between I.A.D. and the County Attorney or County Solicitor, akin to the working relationship between Montgomery County and Trigon. To the contrary, there was no evidence that the Department actually communicated with the County Attorney or County Solicitor, so as to apprise the County of its potential liability and enable it to conduct a thorough investigation while memories were still fresh. Moreover, unlike in <em>Moore, </em>the Department was not charged with the duty to investigate tort claims against the County, nor did the Department construe appellant\u2019s complaint of police brutality as a tort claim against the County. <em>See Faulk, </em>371 Md. at 307, 808 A.2d 1262 (observing that it was \u201cimportant to us in <em>Moore, </em>in accepting the claimants\u2019 substantial compliance arguments, that the intertwined information technology systems of the two existed, that Trigon had authority to settle unilaterally claims up to $2500 per claim, and that Trigon conducted extensive fact-finding and other negotiations with the claimants, on behalf of the County\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The recent case of <em>Chappelle v. McCarter, </em>162 Md.App. 163, 873 A.2d 458 (2005), supports our conclusion that there was no substantial compliance here. Chappelle, an employee of the Police Athletic League (\u201cPAL\u201d), brought suit in 2002 against an employee of the Baltimore City Police Department, alleging battery and stalking, violation of constitutional rights, and other claims, as a result of events that occurred in January 2000. <em>Chappelle, </em>162 Md.App. at 165, 873 A.2d 458. The circuit court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment based on plaintiffs failure to give the notice required by the LGTCA. <em>Id., </em>at 166-67, 873 A.2d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On appeal, Chappelle averred that she had substantially complied with the notice requirement, because the City Solicitor received notice of her claim in March 2000, when she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim which \u201cshe erroneously had asserted against Baltimore City in the belief that the Police Athletic League was an agency of that municipality.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 171, 873 A.2d 458. Writing for this Court, Judge Rodowsky said: \u201c[Ajbsent the precise notice, we think it unlikely that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>notice of a workers\u2019 compensation claim would be couched as a notice of a claim for unliquidated damages, but the latter is the type of notice required by CJ \u00a7 5-304(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 873 A.2d 458</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Alternatively, appellant argues that he showed good cause for any delay in notice, because he \u201cwas instructed by the police to take no action while the investigation was ongoing.\u201d He asserts: \u201cA reasonably prudent man, having been instructed on what to do by the police would do just as instructed.\u201d Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">There was a specific affirmative representation by the police to Mr. White while under incarceration to take no action. Mr. White obeyed the police instruction. His action in accord with that instruction constitutes good cause for delay. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">The standard is what would the ordinarily prudent man <em>in the same or similar circumstances do. </em>That fictional person in this case is an incarcerated person under the complete control of the prison system. A person who, for purposes of this motion, was brutalized and beaten by the police. What does this prudent person do under those circumstances other than obey the police instructions to give them time to investigate? It is only after an unreasonable passage of time that he can be held to recognize that something is amiss and he better bring suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Appellees counter that the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to find good cause. They assert: \u201cFailure to obtain counsel (and, thus, failure to be aware of the notice requirement) does not constitute the requisite \u2018good cause\u2019 necessary to excuse a plaintiff from complying with the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">In appellees\u2019 view, White\u2019s affidavit \u201cwas remarkable for its vagueness and lack of detail.\u201d They claim that, even if Sergeant Dischinger told White that he should \u201c \u2018take no action\u2019 \u201d during the investigation, White\u2019s affidavit \u201cnever says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>what action it is that Plaintiff would have taken had Dischinger not told him to \u2018take no action\u2019; nor does it tell us what action Sgt. Dischinger was referring to, or even what Plaintiff <em>thought </em>he was referring to at the time the statement was made.\u201d Appellees continue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">Is it reasonable to infer, from the face of the affidavit, that Plaintiff <em>would </em>have filed a notice of action for unliquidated damages with the County Attorney within the statutory time period (or even seen an attorney within that time frame), had he not been instructed to \u201ctake no action\u201d? The fact that Plaintiff fails to plainly state as much in the affidavit suggests that this is not a reasonable inference, but merely the argument of counsel on behalf of a client that simply cannot make such a statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">When, as here, a litigant has not substantially complied with the notice provision, C.J. \u00a7 5-304 permits a waiver of the notice requirement, so long as there is \u201cgood cause\u201d for the dereliction. <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 179, 807 A.2d 632; <em>Heron v. Strader, </em>361 Md. 258, 270, 761 A.2d 56 (2000). Under C.J. \u00a7 5-304(c), if the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing good cause to excuse the failure to comply with the notice requirement, the defendant must \u201caffirmatively show that its defense has been prejudiced\u201d by untimely notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Maryland courts evaluate good cause based upon \u201c \u2018whether the claimant prosecuted his claim with that degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 271, 761 A.2d 56 (quoting <em>Westfarm Associates v.

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>146 Md.App. 457, 463, 807 A.2d 149 (2002) (recognizing that \u201cgood cause is a test \u2018of ordinary prudence, that is, whether the claimant prosecuted his claim with that degree of diligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Bibum v.

An appellate court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>Rios, </em>386 Md. at 144, 872 A.2d 1; <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 168, 807 A.2d 632; <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 271, 761 A.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">What we said in <em>Hargrove </em>is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cThe discretion with which all courts determine whether good cause has or has not been shown is broad.

There, the plaintiff sued Prince George\u2019s County under the LGTCA, claiming malicious prosecution, false arrest, and false imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 260-61, 761 A.2d 56. The case arose from the plaintiff\u2019s arrest on various charges on August 24, 1997. After he was acquitted of all the charges on March 3, 1998, <em>id,, </em>at 261, 761 A.2d 56, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim under the Act on April 30, 1998. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>notice of claim was untimely as to the false arrest and false imprisonment claims, and that the plaintiff lacked good cause for the late filing. <em>Id. </em>But, it found that the notice was timely as to the malicious prosecution claim, <em>id., </em>because that cause of action did not accrue until the acquittal. <em>Id. </em>at 265, 761 A.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">With regard to the belated notice, the Court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that \u201cthe pendency of a criminal case was not sufficient to constitute good cause for late filing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 761 A.2d 56. The Court agreed with the trial judge that \u201can ordinarily prudent person, in Petitioner\u2019s circumstances, would have been able, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, to file such a Notice of Claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In its discussion of good cause, the Court considered the factors that have generally been found to constitute good cause for a belated notice. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">While courts generally consider a combination of factors, circumstances that have been found to constitute good cause fit into several broad categories: [1] excusable neglect or mistake (generally determined in reference to a reasonably prudent person standard), [2] serious physical or mental injury and/or location out-of-state, [3] the inability to retain counsel in cases involving complex litigation, and [4] ignorance of the statutory notice requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 272, 761 A.2d 56 (footnotes and internal citations omitted). In <em>Rios, </em>the Court added that good cause has also been found to exist where representations made by local government representatives are \u201cmisleading.\u201d <em>Rios, </em>386 Md. at 141-42, 872 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The Court of Appeals decided <em>Rios, </em>386 Md. 104, 872 A.2d 1, after the parties in this case submitted their appellate briefs. <em>Rios </em>is instructive as to the issue of good cause. If the trial court in <em>Rios </em>did not abuse its discretion in failing to find good cause, we are satisfied that the court below did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Ms. Rios, a Bolivian immigrant with limited ability to speak or read English, received prenatal care through the Montgomery County Health Department. Her baby was born at Holy Cross Hospital, which is not operated by Montgomery County. Unknown to Ms. Rios, her obstetrician was a County employee. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 872 A.2d 1. At birth, it was apparent that the child sustained an injury to his shoulder. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 872 A.2d 1. Ten years later, Ms. Rios gave notice to the county of a medical malpractice claim. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s determination that the delay was not excused by good cause because the claimant did not exercise due diligence. <em>Id. </em>at 117, 872 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Writing for the Court, Judge Battaglia declined to find that a person\u2019s minority status constitutes good cause <em>per se.

Moreover, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 144-45, 872 A.2d 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">The fact that the trial court, in its discretion, was not persuaded that Ms. Rios\u2019s limited English proficiency or immigrant status constituted good cause does not rise to the level of an abuse of discretion as it was not a determination that was exceptional, extraordinary, or egregious especially under the circumstances where Spanish-speaking nurses and translated forms were available. Therefore, we are not persuaded that Petitioner\u2019s immigrant status or limited English proficiency constitute good cause <em>per se </em>and find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering it with the totality of the facts in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">The Circuit Court considered Luis\u2019s minority, the ten-year delay in filing the claim, Ms. Rios\u2019s limited knowledge of English, available means to investigate, the lack of any form of investigation during the ten years after Luis\u2019s injury, and the fact that the County did not impede or hamper any possibility of investigation or conceal material facts. From all of those factors, the court concluded that good cause did not exist. We do not find that such a determination is beyond the view that a reasonable person would take of the facts of the case <em>sub judice. </em>As such, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that good cause did not exist for waiving the notice requirement under the LGTCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><em>Bibum, 85 </em>F.Supp.2d at 565, is also instructive as to the issues of substantial compliance and good cause, because the case is factually similar to the one at bar. Bibum alleged that a Prince George\u2019s County Police Officer used excessive force in arresting him in 1997. <em>Id </em>at 560. About a month after his arrest, he completed a form titled \u201cPrince George\u2019s Police Department Complaint Against Police Practices,\u201d and sent it to the police department by regular mail. <em>Id. </em>at 564-65. One year later, Bibum filed suit against Prince George\u2019s County and the police officer, alleging assault, battery, malicious prosecution, false arrest, and state and federal constitutional claims. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61. He claimed that he substantially complied with the notice requirement when he completed the \u201cform and mail[ed] it, by regular mail, to either the police headquarters or the police internal affairs department within a month after his arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565. He also argued that he had good cause for the delay because he was misled by the police department. The federal court disagreed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The federal court held that a complaint of police brutality filed with the Department did not substantially comply with the notice requirement under C.J. \u00a7 5-304(b)(2), requiring, in Prince George\u2019s County, that the notice be furnished to the County Solicitor or County Attorney. <em>Id </em>Moreover, it rejected the claim of good cause to excuse the failure to file the requisite notice, even though Bibum asserted that the police never told him that filing a complaint with the Department was insufficient to protect his rights. It said, <em>id. </em>at 565:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACfy\">When Bibum went to the Prince George\u2019s County police station to complain about Officer Zelaya he was given a complaint form, which he completed and filed, but was not advised by the police that separate action would be required to preserve his right to sue the county or its employees. This, Bibum claims, was \u201cmisleading and deceptive,\u201d and would lead a reasonable person to believe that any notice requirement would be satisfied by returning the completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>form. Bibum asserts that because he was misled and deceived, he had good cause for not complying with the statutory notice requirement The court, however, does not agree that Bibum was deceived. There is no allegation of an affirmative misrepresentation by police department employees, nor does the court believe there is an affirmative duty on the part of the police department to provide unsolicited advice (or solicited advice for that matter) to complainants regarding the steps they must take to preserve a claim against the county or one of its employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Further, the <em>Bibum </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">That Bibum simply did not know about the formal notice requirement of the LGTCA does not constitute good cause for his failure to comply. An ordinarily prudent person in a similar situation would have made his own investigation into the existence of any formal notice requirements or consulted an attorney on the matter. Thus, the court finds that good cause does not exist for waiving the LGTCA\u2019s notice requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 565-66 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Downey v. Collins, </em>866 F.Supp. 887, 888, 890 (D.Md.1994) (concluding that claimant did not show \u201cgood cause\u201d for belated notice, even though he had no memory of underlying event that led to injury, and it took three months to locate a witness to a police officer\u2019s beating; plaintiff still had three months in which to file timely notice, and the plaintiffs decision to wait until the county supplied him with evidence did not excuse the delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Claiming that he established good cause, White attempts to distinguish <em>Bibum. </em>He points out that, unlike in <em>Bibum, </em>Sergeant Dischinger affirmatively told him \u201cto take no action while the investigation was ongoing\u201d; he was an \u201cincarcerated person under the complete control of the prison system\u201d; and he was to be advised about the investigation. Thus, appellant contends that he was induced by Dischinger not to take action until the investigation was completed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>he relied on that representation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">In <em>Bibum, </em>a police complaint was filed and the fact that the police did not inform Mr. Bibum of the fact that other notice had to be given was not found to constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d In the case at bar, precisely the opposite has occurred. There was a specific affirmative representation by the police to [appellant] while under incarceration to take no action. [Appellant] obeyed the police instruction. His action in accord with that instruction constitutes good cause for delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Appellant relies primarily on four exhibits: his affidavit; the letter from the Department dated July 18, 2001; the \u201cPrince George\u2019s County Police Department Complaint Against Police Practices,\u201d notarized on July 31, 2001; and Dischinger\u2019s business card.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">It is undisputed that Sergeant Dischinger twice had contact with appellant shortly after White filed his brutality complaint. Dischinger took a typed statement from appellant on his first visit in late July of 2001, and returned to photograph appellant on August 1, 2001. He also gave appellant his business card. Given the posture of the case, we also assume the truth of appellant\u2019s claim that Dischinger told him not to take any action during the pendency of the investigation. Yet, appellant never claimed that he had any communications with I.A.D. after August 1, 2001, nor does he claim that he ever inquired about the status of the police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Appellees contend that appellant failed to meet the burden of showing good cause to waive the statutory notice requirement. They state: \u201cOrdinary citizens are required to seek out and obtain legal representation, within the statutory period, in order to ascertain their legal rights and obligations. Failure to obtain counsel (and thus, failure to be aware of the notice requirement) does not constitute the requisite \u2018good cause\u2019 necessary to excuse [the appellant] from complying with the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>We pause to note that appellees\u2019 ignorance of the law argument does not persuade us. In a footnote in <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 272 n. 13, 761 A.2d 56, the Court cited our decision in <em>Williams v. Montgomery County, </em>123 Md.App. 119, 716 A.2d 1100, <em>aff'd., </em>352 Md. 310, 721 A.2d 989 (1998), for the proposition that the Court of Special Appeals \u201chas specifically rejected ignorance of the law requiring notice as good cause.\u201d But, the <em>Heron </em>Court indicated that Maryland has not adopted that position. <em>See </em>id.; <em>see also Hargrove, </em>146 Md.App. at 467, 807 A.2d 149. Moreover, in <em>Rios, </em>386 Md. at 141-42 n. 18, 872 A.2d 1, the Court reaffirmed that the question remains open as to whether ignorance of the statutory notice requirement constitutes good cause. Notably, however, appellant never asserted ignorance of the law as his excuse for the untimely notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The court below determined that appellant \u201cfailed to meet his burden of demonstrating good cause.\u201d It pointed to the lack of evidence of any continuing communications with I.A.D. after August 1, 2001, or of an \u201congoing\u201d police investigation, which would have \u201cwarrant[ed] [appellant\u2019s] lack of diligence.\u201d We are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion with regard to its good cause ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">As we indicated, good cause is determined by \u201cwhether the claimant prosecuted his claim with that degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 271, 761 A.2d 56; <em>see Madore, </em>34 Md.App. at 345, 367 A.2d 54. And, it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether good cause exists to waive the notice requirement. <em>Heron, </em>361 Md. at 270, 272, 761 A.2d 56. In our view, appellant\u2019s lack of follow up with I.A.D. belies any justification for his delay in giving notice to the County. Based on Dischinger\u2019s alleged representation to appellant, it may have been reasonable for appellant to delay any action for a period of months, but not years. Appellant simply took no action at all; his inaction did not amount to the requisite diligence of any ordinarily prudent person.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>In sum, to justify his own inaction for such an extended period of time, appellant relied on a single comment allegedly made by Disehinger in July of 2001. He identified no other action or conduct by the police in the months that followed. Yet, the Sergeant\u2019s comments did not suggest that appellant should remain idle indefinitely, without further pursuing his complaint. Given appellant\u2019s prolonged failure to act or even inquire, the court below did not abuse its discretion in regard to its good cause ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
