Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004). With <em>Seibert, </em>the Court reinforced the protections afforded by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>Miranda, </em>of course, held that a custodial confession obtained without benefit of proper warnings and waiver of the rights to silence and representation by counsel is generally barred from use by the State at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">In <em>Seibert, </em>the Supreme Court struck down the two-step, \u201cquestion first\u201d interrogation strategy employed by some police. This strategy is one in which the police purposefully withhold <em>Miranda </em>warnings during a custodial interrogation until after an incriminating statement is obtained, then administer proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings, secure a proper waiver, and elicit a second confession, ostensibly admissible in court. The Court held in <em>Seiberi </em>that, when such a technique is used, the second confession must be suppressed because the \u201cmidstream recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>fession could not effectively comply with <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>constitutional requirement.\u201d 124 S.Ct. at 2605.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In the present case, the police engaged in the question first strategy when interrogating appellant, Brian Christopher Cooper. Two statements were produced during the interrogation, the first unwarned, the second, warned. The State did not attempt to introduce the first statement at appellant\u2019s trial, but, over appellant\u2019s objection, did introduce the second statement, to appellant\u2019s prejudice. We therefore agree with appellant that his murder conviction and associated weapons convictions must be reversed, and the case returned to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">On the night of April 16, 2002, appellant, who was then 18 years old, stabbed 21-year-old Elliott Scott in Baltimore City, following an altercation earlier that evening between the two men. Scott died two days later, and the investigation into his murder led the police to suspect appellant as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Appellant was arrested on a warrant, approximately one month after the crime. At the police station following his arrest, appellant was subjected to interrogation and gave two statements. On learning that the State planned to use the second of these statements at trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress it, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was obtained in circumvention of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\n<em>The Suppression Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The warrant to arrest appellant issued on May 15, 2002, and, at approximately 5:30 p.m. that day, members of the Southwestern District Narcotics Unit arrested him and took him to the Southwestern District station house. After a short while, appellant was transported to the Homicide Unit in downtown Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Appellant arrived at the Homicide Unit at 6:22 p.m. and was initially placed in a secured interview room. Detective William Ritz removed the heavy plastic handcuffs that had bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>appellant\u2019s wrists since his arrest. Within ten minutes, however, appellant was escorted into the office of Sargent Barry Grant, where Homicide Unit Detectives Ritz and Michael Baier were waiting for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Detective Ritz initiated his interview with appellant sometime before 7:00 p.m. The detective acknowledged that neither at that time nor at any time in the next hour and a half did he or anyone else inform appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">During this 90-minute period, Detective Ritz first filled out an information sheet, with appellant\u2019s assistance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The detective also advised appellant that he had been arrested on charges of first degree murder and related weapons violations. The detective then began a \u201crambling\u201d discourse about the crime and what his investigation had disclosed. Asked to describe this \u201cprocedure or process,\u201d Detective Ritz stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APp\">Several things. It\u2019s just kind of rambling on. Like I said, I told him [about] my investigation, I had an arrest warrant for him for the homicide of ... Scott, that had occurred on April 17th. I told him the location. Told him that I had spoken with several people during my investigation and that those individuals that I had spoke[n] with identified him as the person involved in the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">I gave him some background information on the victim, portraying the victim as not necessarily a nice guy. That there\u2019s two sides to every story, that I had people that had seen him arguing with the victim that evening. I had witnesses that saw him getting out of a vehicle chasing after the victim that evening, and I kept reiterating that there\u2019s two sides to every story. At that time he just sat there. At times he had his head down and he wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a question and answer type thing. Like I said, I\u2019m just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>rambling on and talking and talking for approximately an hour and a half.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">During this stage of the interview, Detective Ritz showed appellant the face page of the arrest warrant. Detective Ritz also had the approximately two and a half inch homicide file sitting on the desk in the room, where appellant could see it.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Shortly after 9:00 p.m., appellant advised Detective Ritz that he wanted \u201cto tell [] his side of the story.\u201d The detective did not attempt to stop appellant from speaking, nor did he issue <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Appellant gave the following statement at that time, as recounted by Detective Ritz at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">[Appellant] made the statement that he was arguing with the victim. He left the area. Went to a girl\u2019s house. Saw the victim later but he didn\u2019t stab him. The victim started arguing with him and he was inside a vehicle, got out, got back in the car and drove off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">After appellant said this, Detective Ritz \u201ctold him to stop what he was saying\u201d because the detective wanted to tape appellant\u2019s statement and advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Appellant agreed to make an audiotaped statement, and the recording system was set up. The audio recording, which was transcribed for the suppression hearing and later introduced at trial, captured Detective Ritz\u2019s laying out the background of the investigation, reviewing with appellant what had occurred in the previous 90 minutes, and then, at approximately 9:05 p.m., advising appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Detective Ritz gave appellant a written explanation of his rights and asked him to \u201cfamiliarize himself with\u201d them. Then, the detective informed appellant of his rights and asked him to put his initials next to each line stating his rights, to indicate that he understood each of them. Appellant\u2019s name or initials appear next to each of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Following this, Detective Ritz elicited a statement from appellant through a series of questions and answers. Twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>two minutes elapsed during the taking of this statement. Below is the pertinent portion of the exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APp0\">Ritz: Okay, ... what I said before about there\u2019s two sides to every story. It\u2019s extremely important, I wasn\u2019t there when all of this took place. My responsibility in, in this investigation is re-creating what happened that night. And I do that from physical evidence on the scene, from witnesses that are located and interviewed and any other forensic evidence that is collected and I try to re-create what happened that night. You had indicated that you were involved with a, in an argument with [the victim], is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Ritz: How long have you known [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">[Appellant]: A long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">Ritz: What\u2019s a long time to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">[Appellant]: About six years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">Ritz: About six years? ... During the six years of knowing [the victim], how would you describe your relationship with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">[Appellant]: I never say nothing to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">Ritz: Okay going back to the evening of Tuesday, April the sixteenth, you were in the area of the hack[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] stand at Fairmount and Franklintown Road?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">Ritz: Tell me what happened Brian?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-16\">[Appellant]: He walked up, he said something to me, we started arguing, I got in a hack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-17\">Ritz: Okay, if I can just stop you for a second. You said you walked up, he said something to you. What did he say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>[Appellant]: [\u201d]What you looking at?[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">Ritz: And what was your response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">[Appellant]: What you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">Ritz: And what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">[Appellant]: [\u201d]What\u2019s up?[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">Ritz: Did you get the impression that, well what was your impression that he was trying to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">[Appellant]: He was trying to fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">Ritz: He was trying to fight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">[Appellant]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">Ritz: Did it seem like he was showing off for anyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5W\">[Appellant]: No not really, I don\u2019t know, I just thought he was drunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">Ritz: You thought he was drunk? What made you think that [he] was drunk or gave you that impression?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">[Appellant]: I don\u2019t know. He be, they always be drinking over there a lot. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-16\">Ritz: Okay I didn\u2019t know if his speech was slurred or just his actions made you think that he was drunk and was trying to pick a fight with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-17\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-18\">Ritz: I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-19\">[Appellant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-20\">Appellant then described how he got into a hack and was driven to his grandmother\u2019s house. He remained there for two to three minutes, then returned to the hack. The statement resumed with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-21\">[Appellant]: I go down Fairmount and Catherine and [the driver] was gonna make the left to go up Fayette, so I could get back to Franklintown Road on the way we usually make it home. And I see the person or LT <em>[ie., </em>the victim]. And he say something to me, so the hack stopped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-22\">Ritz: Okay what does he say to you Brian?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-23\">[Appellant]: He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-24\">Ritz: And do you....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>[Appellant]: In terms like he was still trying to fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">Ritz: Okay can you describe his tone of voice it was like, you said he, as if he was still trying to fight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">[Appellant]: He sound a little hyper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">Ritz: Okay so the hack stops the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">[Appellant]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">Ritz: Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">[Appellant]: I get out the hack and when I get out the hack he take off. And I looked and see him running up an alley and my hack started pulling off like he was leaving me. So I got back in my hack and went home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">Ritz: Okay when [the victim] takes off running, you said he\u2019s on Catherine Street walking towards Fayette, is that true? You\u2019re coming down Fairmount Avenue and you make a left-hand turn onto Catherine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">[Appellant]: Yeah, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">Ritz: Yes? Okay. You see him walking along, is he walking with anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">[Appellant]: I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">Ritz: Okay. As you see him, he says something to you? [Appellant]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-15\">Ritz: Okay, do you get out of the car at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAj\">[Appellant]: No, the car, I tell the hack [to] stop. And when it stopped, I looked at him and he just started running. That\u2019s when I standed up and shut the hack door and looked. He went up a[n] alley, I just got back in the hack and left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-16\">Ritz: Okay at anytime Brian from when you come back around to Catherine Street and you see [the victim] again, do you get in any sort of physical confrontation with him or anyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-17\">[Appellant]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-18\">As the statement continued, appellant said that he was unarmed, did not physically confront Scott, and only orally confronted him from a distance of six feet away. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>proclaimed his innocence, stating that, when he last saw Scott, he was uninjured and rimning up an alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">On cross-examination, Detective Ritz explained why he conducted the first part of the interview as he did: \u201cI was in no rush to anger him, upset him in any way where he [would] just kind of shut me down and [say] the heck with it. You know, I want an attorney....\u201d Defense counsel pursued this with the detective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Well, let me rephrase the question. Maybe I will make it a little less objectionable. You didn\u2019t want him to ask for a lawyer because that would have been the end of that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">[RITZ:] Yes, sir, whether it was in the first five minutes or the first two hours or twelve hours later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] And that\u2019s the reason why during this one and a half hour period, hour period, you didn\u2019t say anything about Miranda and lawyers, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">[RITZ:] That\u2019s correct, because as soon as he was brought out of the interview room I didn\u2019t take him into the room and advise him of his rights, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Because you felt it was, I guess a good technique to get his trust? I mean you weren\u2019t yelling at him, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">[RITZ:] No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Sitting across the table?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">[RITZ:] Yes, sir, I was trying to gain his trust. Sometimes people when they come in contact with the police they have a stereo type of police. I wanted him to get to know me and get to know him, you know, as well as him feeling comfortable with talking with me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">Appellant presented two grounds for suppression of the taped statement. He argued, first, that it was the product of an unlawful inducement by Detective Ritz and the narcotics officers who arrested him. Second, pertinent to this appeal, he argued that the statement was the unlawful fruit of a <em>Miranda </em>violation. After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and against suppression of the statement, the motions court ruled that appellant\u2019s post-warned statement was voluntary. The court then turned to appellant\u2019s claim that the statement was taken in violation of <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">Now, with respect to his right to remain silent, was he Mirandized, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [appellant] has been warned adequately and waived the privilege against self incrimination knowingly and intelligently under the totality of the circumstances. There must be some police coercive activity to say that [appellant\u2019s] waiver was not voluntary. There was none here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">It was voluntary. Again the starting point is that [appellant] himself said it was. Secondarily, [appellant] was most certainly under interrogation when Detective Ritz was talking to him for 90 minutes. However, no statement was made during that time.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">The statement to be offered by the State was made after the Miranda warning. And Fried versus State, as well the other cases cited to this Court by the State, puts to rest any thought that this statement was coerced because of Detective Ritz\u2019[s] interrogation during the 90 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">For these reasons, the State has met its burden and the statement is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\n<em>The Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Tony Alexander, the hack driver who was in appellant\u2019s company several times on the night of the stabbing, testified as one of the State\u2019s primary witnesses. Alexander first saw appellant, one of his regular hack customers, with the victim, Scott, near the hack stand located at the corner of Fairmont Avenue and Franklintown Road. Scott was \u201ccussing and fussing\u201d and calling appellant names like \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cpunk.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Alexander heard appellant respond, \u201cWhat you talking about,\u201d and, \u201cYou better go ahead with that.\u201d Shortly after this, appellant ran to Alexander\u2019s car and asked for a ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Alexander drove appellant to his grandmother\u2019s house. Appellant went into the house, and returned to the car after \u201ca minute or two.\u201d Appellant sat in the front passenger\u2019s seat and asked to be taken to Fayette Street, a block from Scott\u2019s residence. Alexander saw nothing in appellant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Upon reaching Fayette Street, appellant talked to some females, while remaining in the car. He then asked Alexander to take him to the McCullogh Homes, near the spot where appellant and Scott had exchanged words earlier in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">As he was driving to that destination, Alexander saw Scott standing at the corner of Fayette and North Catherine Street. He was with a female whom Alexander recognized as having been with Scott during appellant\u2019s first encounter with him. Scott saw appellant and \u201cstarted cussing and fussing again,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhat the fuck you going to do now?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Alexander stopped the car. After a few seconds, appellant got out and stood in the doorway of the car, about 10 to 15 feet away from Scott. Alexander saw that Scott had a bag in one hand and, with the other, reached into his pocket. Appellant put his hand into his own pocket, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Alexander testified that he thought at the time that appellant was \u201cbluffing.\u201d Alexander watched as Scott and appellant just \u201cstood there for a few seconds,\u201d then Scott \u201ctook off running.\u201d After a second, appellant closed the car door and ran after Scott. Scott turned into an alley behind a building and appellant followed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">After \u201ca second or two,\u201d appellant returned from the alley and haled Alexander for a ride. Saying nothing, appellant got back into the front passenger seat. Alexander then drove appellant home.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Natisha Brown is the woman who was with Scott on the night of the stabbing. She testified that, as she and Scott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>were \u201cwalking around\u201d that night, Scott stopped at the hack stand to talk to a group of men who were standing there. She heard Scott say \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d in a \u201cloud and aggressive\u201d manner, and, when he rejoined her, he was \u201cmad\u201d and \u201cfussing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Brown and Scott resumed walking together when, at the corner of Fayette and Catherine Streets, a car pulled up and a \u201cyoung man\u201d inside it called, \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d to Scott. Scott responded, \u201cwhat\u2019s up,\u201d and the young man, whom she could not identify, got out of the car and put his hand in his pocket. Scott took off running and the young man \u201cran behind him.\u201d A few seconds later, Brown saw the young man emerge from the alley and run back to the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Scott was stabbed while in the alley. Brown did not witness the stabbing, but soon after the young man left the alley, she heard screams coming from Scott\u2019s house, nearby. She ran to Scott\u2019s house and saw him there, bleeding from his side.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Scott\u2019s sister and mother, Fredericke Scott, were home at the time. Ms. Scott testified that her son said he was stabbed. He was bleeding profusely from his wounds and spitting up blood. The paramedics were called, and Scott was taken by ambulance to the Shock Trauma Unit of the University Maryland Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Ms. Scott also testified, over defense objection that the statement was not an \u201cexcited utterance,\u201d that, almost an hour after her son arrived at the hospital, her husband asked Scott \u201cwho did this to [you].\u201d To this, Scott replied that the assailant \u201chad braids in his hair and he had funny eyes,\u201d and a \u201cmedium skin tone.\u201d We shall say more about this testimony, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Scott died of his wounds on April 18, 2002. The autopsy disclosed that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds, which were inflicted by a double-edged blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Detective Ritz testified about the homicide investigation and his interrogation of appellant at the police station. The audiotape of appellant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>warned statement was played for the jury, and the transcript of it was admitted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>evidence. The transcript was sent to the jury room for the jury\u2019s use during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The jury convicted appellant of first degree murder, wearing and carrying a concealed weapon, and carrying a deadly weapon with intent to injure. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and to a consecutive three years\u2019 imprisonment on the latter of the two weapons convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On appeal, appellant challenges the admissibility of his post-<em>Miranda </em>warned statement to Detective Ritz and Ms. Scott\u2019s testimony concerning the victim\u2019s description of his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Appellant\u2019s first complaint rests upon <em>Seibert. </em>He urges that the motions court erred when it declined to suppress his post <em>-Miranda </em>warned statement, which expanded upon the pre-warned statement he made at the end of the first stage of the interrogation. The State responds that the motions court acted correctly, because the facts of the present case distinguish it from the rule of <em>Seibert. </em>As we shall discuss, appellant has the better part of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">We note at the outset the standard by which we review this issue. We rely solely on the record developed at the suppression hearing. <em>Alston v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 253, 261, 858 A.2d 1100 (2004). \u201c[W]e view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion,\u201d and we reverse a court\u2019s factual findings only when they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439 (2003). Although we extend great deference to the motion court\u2019s findings of fact, determinations regarding witness credibility, and weighing of the evidence, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal of the law as it applies to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>facts of the case. <em>Alston, </em>159 Md.App. at 261-62, 858 A.2d 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Seibert </em>is best considered in light of another decision of the Court that predates <em>Seibert </em>by nearly two decades, <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985). We therefore begin our discussion with a review of that decision. In <em>Elstad, </em>the Court considered \u201cwhether an initial failure of law enforcement officers to administer the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>[], without more, \u2018taints\u2019 subsequent admissions made after a suspect has been fully advised of and has waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 105 S.Ct. 1285. In that case, Michael James Elstad was arrested at his parents\u2019 home for burglary. While Elstad was still in his parents\u2019 living room and one officer was explaining to Elstad\u2019s mother that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, a second officer informed Elstad that he thought Elstad was involved in the burglary. To this statement Elstad responded, \u201cYes, I was there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 105 S.Ct. 1285. Evidently, the officer who put this question to Elstad was unsure that he was in custody at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 315-16, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Elstad was taken to the Sheriff\u2019s headquarters and, approximately one hour later, was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After responding that he understood his rights, Elstad gave a full confession to his involvement in the burglary. Elstad sought to have suppressed the statement he made at his home, as well as his post <em>-Miranda </em>confession. His argument for suppression of the post-warned statement was that his unwarned statement had \u201clet the cat out of the bag\u201d and thereby \u201ctainted the subsequent confession as \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The motions court suppressed Elstad\u2019s first statement, but ruled that the post <em>-Miranda </em>statement was admissible because it was \u201cgiven freely, voluntarily and knowingly by [Elstad] after he had waived his right to remain silent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>have counsel present....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed the motions court, agreeing with Elstad that \u201cthe \u2018cat was sufficiently out of the bag to exert a coercive impact on [his] later admissions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Supreme Court reversed the Oregon Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 105 S.Ct. at 1285. Justice O\u2019Connor, writing for the majority, declared it \u201can unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda </em>to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 105 S.Ct. at 1285. Justice O\u2019Con-nor pointed out that, although <em>\u201cMiranda </em>requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Absent coercive or improper actions on the part of the officers performing the interrogation, \u201ca careful and thorough administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings serves to cure the condition that rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310-11, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The <em>Elstad </em>Court noted that the fruits doctrine, applied in such cases as <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), and <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975), was developed in the context of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, where the objective is to deter unreasonable searches, no matter how probative their fruits. The objective of the Fifth Amendment, by contrast, is to bar use of compelled statements. <em>Miranda, </em>moreover, adopted an exclusionary rule that \u201csweeps more broadly\u201d than does the Fifth Amendment, by establishing an irrebuttable presumption that unwarned statements obtained through custodial interrogation are compelled. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 305-07, 105 S.Ct. 1285. Violation of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>safeguards, the <em>Elstad </em>Court declared, in and of itself does not create a coercive atmosphere that automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>renders involuntary any subsequent, properly warned statement. The relevant inquiry should be \u201cwhether, in fact, the second statement was also voluntarily made[,]\u201d considering \u201cthe surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with respect to the suspect....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285. The Court held that Elstad\u2019s second confession was voluntary and that it complied with <em>Miranda; </em>consequently, it was admissible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><em>Elstad, </em>it must be remembered, dealt only with \u201ca simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285. The Court emphasized \u201cthat, <em>absent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, </em>the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis added). Moreover, the \u201csubsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement <em>ordinarily </em>should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Absent coercion or deliberate tactics, \u201cthe finder of fact may reasonably conclude that the suspect made a rational and intelligent choice whether to waive or invoke his rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Nearly 20 years after <em>Elstad, </em>the Supreme Court was presented in <em>Seibert </em>with the situation hypothesized in <em>Elstad: </em>the failure of police to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings under \u201c \u2018circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will.\u2019 \u201d 124 S.Ct. at 2610 n. 4 (quoting <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285). The <em>Seibert </em>Court held that the two-step interrogation tactic used by the police to obtain a confession from Patrice Seibert violated <em>Miranda. Id. </em>at 2605-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Seibert had a twelve-year-old son, Jonathan, who suffered from cerebral palsy. When Jonanthan died, Seibert feared that neglect charges would be filed against her. She, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>with two of her teenage sons and two friends, devised a plan to conceal Jonathan\u2019s death by burning the family\u2019s mobile home, with Jonathan\u2019s body inside. To make it appear that Jonathan was not alone when he died, the plan entailed leaving Donald Rector, a mentally ill teenager who was living with the family, in the mobile home when it was set ablaze. Seibert\u2019s two sons set fire to the mobile home and Rector died inside the burning structure. <em>Id. </em>at 2605-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Five days later, Seibert was arrested for the death of Rector. The arresting officer was instructed by Officer Richard Hanrahan not to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Seibert. She was transported to the police station and was questioned by the interrogating officer for 30 to 40 minutes, who repeatedly stated to Seibert that \u201cDonald [Rector] was also to die in his sleep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2606. Seibert finally admitted that she knew that Rector was meant to die in the fire. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Seibert was given a 20-minute break during which the interrogating officer turned on a tape recorder, informed her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, and obtained from her a signed waiver of those rights. The officer resumed questioning Seibert by first confronting her with her <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements. The officer then obtained a full confession from Seibert. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Seibert was charged with first degree murder for her part in Rector\u2019s death, and subsequently sought to have her pre- and <em>post-Miranda </em>statements suppressed. \u201cAt the suppression hearing, Officer Hanrahan testified that he made a \u2018conscious decision\u2019 to withhold <em>Miranda </em>warnings, thus resorting to an interrogation technique\u201d of question first until a confession is obtained, then advise the suspect of his or her rights, and then repeat the original question until the answer that has already been provided is repeated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The trial court suppressed Seibert\u2019s pre-warning statement, but allowed her post-warning statements to be admitted. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court, following <em>Elstad, </em>affirmed. The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The Supreme Court affirmed the Missouri court. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision produced four opinions: the plurali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ty opinion (Souter, J., joined by Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ); two concurring opinions (Breyer, J.), (Kennedy, J.); and a dissenting opinion (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, CJ, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ). <em>Id. </em>at 2601-02. As we explain below, Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion provides the test that guides our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The plurality began with a review of <em>Miranda, </em>observing that the Court had, in that case, established a rule that \u201cconditioned the admissibility at trial of any custodial confession on warning a suspect of his rights: failure to give the prescribed warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2608. The plurality pointed out that the purpose behind <em>Miranda </em>was \u201c \u2018to reduce the risk of a coerced confession and to implement the Self-Incrimination Clause,\u2019 \u201d so an \u201c \u2018accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The plurality observed that \u201c[t]he technique of interrogating in successive, unwarned and warned phases\u201d is a popular technique promoted by individual police departments and a national police training organization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The admissibility of a warned confession obtained through this technique requires that \u201cattention must be paid to the conflicting objects of <em>Miranda </em>and [the] question-first\u201d technique. <em>Id. </em>at 2609. \u201cThe threshold issue when interrogators question first and warn later is thus whether it would be reasonable to find that in these circumstances the warnings could function \u2018effectively\u2019 as <em>Miranda </em>requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2610; <em>see also id. </em>at 2612 (characterizing the threshold issue as \u201cwhether <em>Miranda </em>warnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>accomplish their object\u201d). Unless the circumstances are such that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings could function effectively, \u201cthere is no practical justification for accepting the formal warnings as compliance with <em>Miranda, </em>or for treating the second stage of interrogation as distinct from the first, unwarned and inadmissible segment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2610.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The <em>Seibert </em>plurality compared the case before it to <em>Elstad, </em>characterizing the latter as involving \u201ca good-faith <em>Miranda </em>mistake ... open to correction by careful warnings ... [and] posing no threat to warn-first practice generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2612. The plurality noted that the facts of the case before it were \u201c[a]t the opposite extreme [of the facts in <em>Elstad],\u201d </em>and \u201cby any objective measure reveal a police strategy adapted to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The plurality fashioned a multi-factored test for use in deciding whether statements made during continuing interrogations are admissible in light of belated <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The plurality\u2019s test looks to several factors \u201cthat bear on whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings delivered midstream could ... accomplish their object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8D\">the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second [interrogations], the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A39\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Applying that test to the circumstances of <em>Seibert\u2019s </em>two-step interrogation, the plurality concluded: \u201cThese circumstances must be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2613.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Justice Kennedy wrote separately, supplying the vote necessary to make a majority. In his concurrence, Justice Kennedy eschewed the plurality\u2019s multi-factor test, which would apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to both intentional and unintentional two-stage interrogations, as a test that \u201ccuts too broadly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2616. Justice Kennedy set forth \u201ca narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, such as we have here, in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u201c \u2018[W]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grutter v. Bollinger, </em>539 U.S. 306, 325, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003) (quoting <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977)); <em>accord Romano v. Oklahoma, </em>512 U.S. 1, 9, 114 S.Ct. 2004, 129 L.Ed.2d 1 (1994) (citing the concurring opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor in <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 341, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985), and stating: \u201cAs Justice O\u2019Connor supplied the fifth vote in <em>Caldwell, </em>and concurred on grounds narrower than those put forth by the plurality, her position is controlling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Because Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion sets forth the narrowest grounds on which the case is decided, it represents the holding of the Court; it is therefore Justice Kennedy\u2019s test that applies to this and like cases. <em>See United States v. Mashburn, </em>406 F.3d 303, 308-09 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion in <em>Seiberi </em>sets forth the applicable rule); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>388 F.3d 1079, 1086 (7th Cir.2004) (same); <em>but cf. United States v. Fellers, </em>397 F.3d 1090, 1098 (8th Cir.2005) (applying the plurality\u2019s multi-factored test, but finding the second, warned statement admissible under both the plurality\u2019s and Justice Kennedy\u2019s tests).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Justice Kennedy made clear in his concurrence that \u201c[t]he admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of <em>Elstad </em>unless the deliberate two-step strategy was employed.\u201d <em>Seibert, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2616. But, \u201c[i]f the deliberate two-step strategy has been used, postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such curative measures, Justice Kennedy explained, \u201cshould be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would understand the import and effect of the <em>Miranda </em>warning and of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He cited, as examples of curative measures, \u201ca substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the <em>Miranda warning....\u201d Id. A </em>break of this sort \u201cmay suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice Kennedy posited, as a possible alternative curative measure, \u201can additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Because \u201c[n]o curative steps were taken in this case,\u201d Justice Kennedy concurred with the plurality that \u201cthe post-warning statements are inadmissible and the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Turning to the case before us, the State does not argue that this case is controlled by <em>Elstad, </em>and we agree with the State\u2019s implied concession that it does not. As we see it, the facts here are in material respects identical to those in <em>Seibert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We start our analysis with a fact not in dispute: the protections given by <em>Miranda </em>certainly applied to the first 90 minutes of the exchange between Detective Ritz and appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Miranda </em>protections come into play only when a person is subjected to custodial interrogation or its functional equivalent. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>Blake v. State, </em>381 Md. 218, 231, 849 A.2d 410 (2004), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1823, 161 L.Ed.2d 722 (2005). Without the presence of both custody <em>and </em>interrogation, the police are not bound to deliver <em>Miranda </em>warnings and obtain a proper waiver of the rights to silence and counsel before questioning a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Appellant was undeniably in custody, having been arrested earlier that evening and transported, after a short stop at Southwestern Police Station, to the Homicide Unit. Moreover, he was subjected at this time to interrogation or, at the least, \u201cits functional equivalent.\u201d <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also Drury v. State, </em>368 Md. 331, 793 A.2d 567, <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 942, 123 S.Ct. 341, 154 L.Ed.2d 249 (2002). Indeed, the State makes no argument that the first stage of Detective Ritz\u2019s interview was not an interrogation, or that he was not in custody at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Detective Ritz\u2019s description of the interrogation brings it squarely within the purview of <em>Seibert. </em>Indeed, though we have concluded that Justice Kennedy\u2019s test is the applicable test, what occurred in this case fails under both the plurality\u2019s multi-factor test, 124 S.Ct. at 2612, and Justice Kennedy\u2019s test, <em>id. </em>at 2616.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The interrogation began without <em>Miranda </em>warnings and continued for 90 minutes. During this time, Detective Ritz told appellant, among other things, that witnesses \u201csaw him getting out of a vehicle chasing after the victim that evening.\u201d The interrogation proceeded, uninterrupted, until appellant gave a statement that placed him at the scene, arguing with the victim. Then, but only then, did the detective stop appellant from saying more. The only break in the interrogation was to set up the audiotape recording system, give appellant the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and secure a waiver from him, thereby providing him with even less of an interruption than the 20-minute break given in <em>Seibert. </em>Interrogation then resumed, conducted by the same officer, in the same environment. And, much as in <em>Seibert, </em>Detective Ritz began the second stage of the interrogation by harkening back to appellant\u2019s unwarned statement (\u201cYou had indicated that you were involved with a, in an argument with [the victim], is that true?\u201d), as if this part of the interrogation was merely a continuation of the first. Further, of import under Justice Kennedy\u2019s test, Detective Ritz candidly acknowledged that he intentionally withheld the reading of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the first 90-minute stage of the interrogation, for fear that appellant would refuse to talk or ask for a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">This case stands in stark contrast to those cases in which the police unintentionally violated <em>Miranda, </em>and sometime later secure a confession preceded by proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waiver. <em>See, e.g., Mashburn, </em>406 F.3d at 309-10 (noting, in a case involving a <em>Seibert </em>challenge, that the district judge \u201cfound no evidence that the agents\u2019 failure to convey <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Mashburn was deliberate or intentional,\u201d and rejecting Mashburn\u2019s contention that the police used deliberately coercive tactics in obtaining the first, unwarned statement); <em>Fellers, </em>397 F.3d at 1097-98 (applying the <em>Seibert </em>plurality test to hold that Fellers\u2019s post-warned statement was admissible because the prior unwarned statement was elicited at Fellers\u2019 home, the jailhouse interrogation took place almost one hour later, and though there was some overlap between the unwarned and post-warned statements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the latter addressed different allegations; noting also that the post-warned statement comported with Justice Kennedy\u2019s test, \u201c[b]ecause there is no evidence that the officers in this case employed such a deliberate strategy.... \u201d); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Hernandez, </em>384 F.3d 562, 566-67 (8th Cir.2004) (applying <em>Seibert </em>and holding that the five-day lapse in time between the unwarned and warned statement and the change in location and in interrogating personnel rendered the post-warned statement admissible because, under these circumstances, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201cwere effective enough to accomplish their purpose\u201d); <em>Reinert v. Larkins, </em>379 F.3d 76, 91 (3rd Cir.2004) (holding that Reinert\u2019s case more closely resembles <em>Elstad </em>than <em>Seibert, </em>because the officer\u2019s failure to provide warnings before obtaining the first statement \u201cseems much more likely to have been a simple failure to administer the warnings rather than an intentional withholding that was part of a larger, nefarious plot\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>829 N.E.2d 44, 46, (Ind.Ct.App.2005) (holding that the officer\u2019s \u201cfailure to obtain a valid waiver with regard to the first statement involved a good-faith <em>Miranda </em>mistake open to correction by careful warnings, and therefore, did not render the second statement inadmissible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">This case is more like <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>384 F.3d 520 (8th Cir.2004). In that case, the court held that <em>Miranda </em>was violated when the police used the two-step interrogation strategy. The court analyzed the facts under both the <em>Seibert </em>plurality\u2019s and Justice Kennedy\u2019s tests. The court concluded that <em>Miranda </em>was violated because \u201cthe first questioning session consisted of more than routine booking questions, included some good cop/bad cop questioning tactics, and lasted approximately ninety minutes\u201d; the \u201ctwo interrogations were not separate in time\u201d; and they were conducted by the same officers. <em>Id. </em>at 524-25. Further, under Justice Kennedy\u2019s test, \u201cthe method and timing of the two interrogations establish intentional, calculated conduct by the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525; <em>see also Crawford v. State, </em>100 P.3d 440, 450 (Alaska Ct.App. 2004) (holding that, viewed objectively, \u201cCrawford was subjected to a continuing interrogation about his possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>cocaine, with <em>Miranda </em>warnings inserted midstream, with barely an interruption, and after Crawford had already confessed to this crime,\u201d thereby rendering the <em>Miranda </em>warnings ineffective).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We conclude that the case before us is the \u201cinfrequent case\u201d to which Justice Kennedy referred, \u201cin which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d <em>Seibert, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2616. Like the interrogating officer in <em>Seibert, </em>Detective Ritz made a conscious decision to withhold <em>Miranda </em>warnings until appellant gave a statement implicating himself in the crime. Moreover, the second, warned statement followed on the heels of the unwarned statement, without any curative measures designed to ensure that a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position \u201cwould understand the import and effect of the <em>Miranda </em>warning....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We hold, therefore, that appellant\u2019s post-warned statement violated <em>Miranda </em>and should not have been admitted at his trial. Consequently, we must reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial, at which this statement may not be admitted during the State\u2019s case-in-chief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Appellant also challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling allowing Ms. Scott to repeat her son\u2019s description of his assailant, under the guise of an \u201cexcited utterance.\u201d Because this issue may arise on retrial, we shall address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Hearsay is defined in Maryland Rule 5-801(c) as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(2) provides that an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d is an exception to the general rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>that hearsay evidence is inadmissible at trial. Defined as \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d in question, Md. Rule 5 \u2014 803(b)(2), the rationale behind the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception is that the inherent untrustworthiness of hearsay is overcome when the circumstances are such that they render the declarant\u2019s reflective capabilities inoperative. <em>Parker v. State, </em>365 Md. 299, 313, 778 A.2d 1096 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201c \u2018A statement may be admitted under [the excited utterance] exception if \u201cthe declaration was made at such a time and under such circumstances that the exciting influence of the occurrence clearly produced a spontaneous and instinctive reaction on the part of the declarant ... [who is] still emotionally engulfed by the <em>situationWest v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 147, 162-63, 720 A.2d 1253 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>353 Md. 270, 725 A.2d 1068 (1999) (quoting <em>State v. Harrell, </em>348 Md. 69, 77, 702 A.2d 723 (1997)) (quoting <em>Harmony v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 306, 319, 594 A.2d 1182 (1991)). \u201cTt requires a startling event and a spontaneous statement which is the result of the declarant\u2019s reaction to the occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker, </em>365 Md. at 313, 778 A.2d 1096 (quoting <em>Mouzone v. State, </em>294 Md. 692, 697, 452 A.2d 661 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In determining whether a statement properly fits within the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, we look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the foundation for its admissibility has been established. The adequacy of the foundation is judged \u201cby the spontaneity of the declarant\u2019s statement and an analysis of whether it was the result of thoughtful consideration [or] ... the product of the exciting event.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>365 Md. at 313, 778 A.2d 1096 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The record in this case does not establish that the victim\u2019s statement describing his assailant in some detail (\u201cbraids in his hair,\u201d \u201cfunny eyes,\u201d and \u201cmedium skin tone\u201d) was made while he was under the stress of excitement caused by the stabbing. What we know from the evidence is that the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>made the statement while in the hospital, about an hour after the stabbing and before he went into surgery. As described by his mother, the victim was in pain and restless and having some trouble breathing. His statement, however, was not a spontaneous reaction to the stabbing, but, instead, was given in direct response to a question posed by his father. Altogether, the evidence falls short of satisfying the test for admissibility of the statement as an excited utterance. On retrial, the State should not be permitted to elicit the statement under that exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
