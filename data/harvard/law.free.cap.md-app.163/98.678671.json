Rosov, D.D.S., be permanently revoked for violations of the Maryland Dentistry Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, following which that court affirmed the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Appellant presents for our review one issue, which, slightly-recast, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">Whether the circuit court erred in affirming the decision of the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners finding that appellant violated the Maryland Dentistry Act, without substantial evidence and in reliance upon the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s proposed decision that included errors of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A33\">We agree with the circuit court that the ALJ committed no errors of law, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the Board\u2019s decision. Therefore, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Appellant has been a licensed dentist in the State of Maryland since 1973, and engaged in a practice as a specialist in endodontics, with offices in Annapolis and Glen Burnie.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Rosov is not a stranger to the Board, having been disciplined on other occasions prior to the events that gave rise to the instant case. The history of Board interventions includes:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In 1996, he was charged with multiple violations of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">In 1998, he entered into a consent order to resolve all disciplinary matters then pending, including the 1996 violations, under the terms of which he was placed on probation for three years for violation of the Act involving conduct that included the failure to properly record treatments; failing to inform patients of treatment alternatives; failing to record anesthesia administered; and failing to record information about medications administered or prescribed, including type, amount, dosage, and/or duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">On October 8, 2002, the Board summarily suspended his license after investigation of two patient complaints. A resulting Board inspection of his dental office showed numerous and significant violations of Center for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) Guidelines for universal precautions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At a show cause hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ing on October 28, 2002, Rosov represented that, as a result of the summary suspension, he had obtained consultation and training regarding his infection control practices and that the infection control errors had been remediated. Accepting his explanation, the Board stayed the summary suspension until December 31, 2003, pending Rosov\u2019s compliance with, and completion of, certain conditions, including the observation of his practice by an expert in CDC compliance, and inspections of his dental practice throughout 2002 and 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Rosov\u2019s license was again summarily suspended by the Board on June 18, 2003, following an investigation that gave rise to the current litigation. The incident that spurred the latest investigation involved a \u201cneedle stick\u201d in his treatment of a minor patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\n<em>Patient \u201cA\u201d</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>3</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On February 26, 2003, Patient A, an 11 year old female, went with her mother to Rosov\u2019s Glen Burnie office for root canal therapy on one tooth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the root canal procedure, Rosov recommended, and Patient A\u2019s mother agreed to, the extraction of one of Patient A\u2019s baby teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Rosov picked up a syringe containing the anesthetic Lidocain, which had been used for the root canal therapy. After the initial use, the syringe had been recapped and returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the tray. The child was upset and began to cry, so Rosov asked his dental assistant Kimberly Hickman to help calm the patient. At the time, the patient was seated in the dental chair and Hickman was standing to her left; Rosov was sitting on Patient A\u2019s right side, to the rear. Hickman then stood to the right of Rosov, near Patient A\u2019s leg, holding her hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">When Rosov attempted to inject Patient A with the syringe, she moved frantically. As Rosov pulled the needle away from Patient A\u2019s mouth, his hand holding the syringe went in a downward motion to his light side and came into contact with Hickman\u2019s left leg, sticking her in the left thigh. Hickman reacted by saying \u201couch.\u201d Rosov immediately thereafter injected Patient A with the same needle which had stuck Hickman. Patient A\u2019s mother, hearing crying, returned to the room, and it was decided not to proceed with the extraction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The mother was not told about the needle stick incident before she left the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">After having been stuck with the needle, Hickman went into the bathroom. Thereafter, she informed her co-worker, Stephanie Howard, that she had a red mark on her leg as a result of the stick. Howard advised Hickman to tell Rosov about the needle stick, but she did not. Nor, did she see a physician or follow CDC protocol for management of injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">As we shall discuss, <em>infra, </em>no complaint was made to the Board about the incident. Rather, the Board staff became aware as a result of a newspaper article in which the mother of Patient A had been quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The Board summarized the basis for its summary suspension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">numerous ongoing and repetitive CDC violations as well as the treatment of a particular patient during an episode in which the following was alleged to have occurred: Dr. Rosov attempted to inject Patient A [child patient whose identity was withheld], stuck his dental assistant, KH, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the same needle when the patient started struggling, and finally used the same needle to inject Patient A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The Board conducted a Show Cause Hearing on July 2, 2003, to consider (1) Rosov\u2019s representations that the CDC violations had been ameliorated; and (2) affidavits regarding the needle stick incident. Thereafter, the Board stayed the summary suspension pending the outcome of an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On the same day, the Board filed charges against Rosov alleging that he had violated multiple provisions of the Maryland Dentistry Act, specifically, Health Occupations \u00a7 4-315(a)(6), (11), (16), (18), (20) and (28). The Board delegated to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) the authority to conduct an administrative hearing and to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The OAH conducted a six-day, contested, evidentiary hearing in August 2003, at which the ALJ heard from 11 lay and expert witnesses and considered more than 70 exhibits. The ALJ issued a proposed decision on September 29, 2003, finding that Rosov violated the Maryland Dentistry Act by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">Practicing dentistry in a professionally incompetent manner or in a grossly incompetent manner in violation of Health Occ. \u00a7 4-315(a)(6);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">Behav[ing] dishonorably or unprofessionally or violated a code of ethics pertaining to the dentistry profession pursuant to Health Occ. \u00a7 4-315(a)(16); willfully made or filed a false report or record in the practice of dentistry pursuant to Health Occ. \u00a7 4-315(a)(20);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">Failing] to comply with the CDC guidelines for universal precautions pursuant to Health Occ. \u00a7 4~315(a)(28);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">Permitting] unauthorized individuals to practice dentistry under his supervision in violation of Health Occ. \u00a7 4-315(a)(ll);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">Violating] rules and regulations adopted by the Board, pursuant to Health Occ. \u00a7 4-315(a)(18).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The enumerated violations, the Board found, were based on a \u201cwide spectrum of conduct ... involving the treatment of a minor patient ... and numerous other ongoing actions and omissions in his practice of dentistry generally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">More specifically, the ALJ found violations by a preponderance of the evidence, and which were cited by the Board in its final order, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">1. Failing to record the type and amount of anesthetic used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">3. Failing to record the attempted extraction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">4.

In consideration of the entire record, the Board, with certain limited exceptions, adopted the proposed decision of the ALJ, and incorporated it by reference in its Final Order that permanent revocation of Rosov\u2019s dental license was necessary to protect the public. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The standard of appellate review of administrative agency decisions requires us to review the decision of the agency, not of the circuit court. <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). \u201cJudicial review of administrative agency action is narrow.\u201d <em>Mayer v.

Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 652 A.2d 1183 (quoting <em>Caucus Distributors, Inc. v.

In other words, the question on appeal becomes whether a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the agency\u2019s factual conclusion. <em>[Eberle v.

Nonetheless, appellant devotes his brief and appellate argument to his perceived errors involving the \u201cneedle stick\u201d incident, to the virtual exclusion of all the other charges. We shall discuss his arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Investigative Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Maria Bartrem, an investigator employed by the Board, conducted an inquiry and interviewed a number of witnesses. She compiled a confidential report consisting of 12 pages of background and witness statements and interviews. Appended to the report were 341 pages of records, reports, and other documents that had been generated as a result of the \u201cneedle stick\u201d incident, and other incidents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Rosov argues that the Bartrem report was biased and included non-evidentiary, inadmissible, and highly prejudicial material.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He alleges errors of law by the ALJ in reliance on the report because his counsel did not have access to the author during the investigation (as did the Board staff) and because Bartrem was not available for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">Preliminarily we note that Rosov\u2019s allegation that <em>all </em>references in Bartrem\u2019s report to his closed cases before the Board were improper and prejudicial must fail. His counsel commented before the ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>I don\u2019t have any objection to \u2014 those are in the final order of November 20, 2002, final decision and order, that the inspections and unannounced visits and that had \u2014 I\u2019m not objecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">What I\u2019m objecting to is everything that came before that, 1998, 1996, the termination of his probation, the summary suspension in October, and the transcript of the Show Cause hearing in October.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">If a party fails to object, \u201che will not later be heard to complain that the evidence should not have been admitted.\u201d <em>Ginn v.

Com\u2019r, </em>67 Md.App. 727, 740, 509 A.2d 719 (1986) (citing <em>Withrow, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The <em>Withrow </em>Court rejected a denial of due process claim, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">The contention that the combination of investigation and adjudicative function necessarily creates as unconstitutional risk of bias is administrative adjudication has a much more difficult burden of persuasion to carry. It must overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators; and it must convince that, under a realistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>appraisal or psychological tendencies and human weakness, conferring investigative and adjudicative powers on the same individuals poses such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><em>Withrow, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Rosov has not met the <em>Withrow </em>burden. Rosov refers us to the statement in Bartrem\u2019s report that \u201c[Bartrem] and [the State] interviewed [Stephanie] Howard under oath.\u201d His complaint is founded upon the fact that his counsel was not present at this interview, that counsel was not permitted to question Stephanie Howard at that time, and that the State unfairly participated in the interviews that were included in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We know of no requirement, either in law or investigative technique, that compels an investigative agency, prior to charging, to include the investigation target or counsel in the interview process. The Board\u2019s investigative processes to determine whether charges are justified and sustainable violates neither <em>Withrow </em>nor the Administrative Procedure Act. Safeguards were available for Rosov \u2014 the interview was taken under oath and Howard was available for cross-examination at the administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Rosov next alleges that the entire Bartrem report was hearsay, was unauthenticated by the investigator, and would not have been admitted in a judicial trial. We cannot disagree with his conclusion about admissibility in a judicial proceeding. That does not, however, preclude admissibility at the administrative level. Under the relaxed rules of evidence applicable in an administrative hearing, the focus is whether admitted hearsay was credible and sufficiently probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Rosov asserts that the report reveals Bartrem\u2019s biased viewpoint, and cites \u201cmajor defects in the manner of the investigation, including the participation of the State but not Dr. Rosov, the documentation of the investigation, the manner of how conclusions were reached, etc.\u201d But, he provides no support in the record for his allegation that the investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>was substantially defective. He presented no evidence that Bartrem\u2019s manner of investigation was faulty, nor does the record support such a conclusion. Rosov rests his argument on the fact of Bartrem\u2019s employment by the Board and interaction with the staff during the investigation. If that were that the standard, any such report, by any agency charged with the enforcement of professional standards, would be suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"AmF\">The AL J did not err in admitting the report. A fair reading of the report discloses that it contains summaries of statements made by witnesses, not the opinions of the investigator. All but one of those who were interviewed by the investigator testified at the administrative hearing and were subject to cross-examination, thus curing any harm of hearsay within the report.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Finally, Rosov argues, somewhat disingenuously, that the report should not have been admitted because he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Bartrem. Of course, he must concede that he did not issue a subpoena for Bartrem to compel her attendance at the administrative hearing. He further asserts that he was not informed that she would not be testifying until the start of the hearing. All of that, he posits, is conclusive that the entire case was \u201cpresented by a phantom\u201d due to Bartrem\u2019s absence. His assertions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Our decision in <em>Travers v. Baltimore Police Dept., </em>115 Md.App. 395, 693 A.2d 378 (1997), is instructive. Travers, a former Baltimore City police officer, was accused of violating departmental rules and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 693 A.2d 378. He alleged that the administrative trial board erred in admitting hearsay statements of the alleged victim through the testimony of other officers, depriving him of the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>cross-examine the alleged victim. <em>Id. </em>at 407-408, 693 A.2d 378. Travers had not subpoenaed the alleged victim. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">Nonetheless, because appellant failed to exercise his right to subpoena [the victim] <em>see </em>Md. Ann.Code, art. 27 \u00a7 730(j), we conclude that he has effectively waived his right to complain about a denial of the opportunity to cross-examine [the victim]. In 1971, the Supreme Court in <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971), upheld the admission of hearsay evidence in a proceeding before the Social Security Board, noting that Perales\u2019s lawyer could have subpoenaed the hearsay declarant but did not do so. <em>Id. </em>at 404-05, 91 S.Ct. at 1428-29. Although not citing <em>Perales, </em>we held in <em>[American Radio-Telephone Serv., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>33 Md.App. 423, 365 A.2d 314 (1976) ] that the error in admitting affidavits, without subjecting the affiant to cross-examination, was harmless because the opponents \u201cmade no request for ... an opportunity to bring the affiant in for cross-examination.\u201d 33 Md.App. at 435, 365 A.2d at 320.... We read <em>Perales </em>as stanqding for the proposition that claimants who forgo their right to subpoena known, material witnesses effectively waive any objections to denial of an opportunity to cross-examine. 69 Md.App. at 264, 517 A.2d at 117. We conclude that, in light of appellant\u2019s failure to subpoena [the victim] the admission of her statements to Officer Moore and Lieutenant Henderson did not vitiate appellant\u2019s right to a fair administrative hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 693 A.2d 378 (footnotes omitted) (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Rosov was not deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Bartrem by the State or the ALJ, but by his own failure to subpoena the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On the record before us, we find the report sufficiently credible and probative to satisfy its admissibility, even to the extent that it contained hearsay. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\n<em>Police Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In December 2002, Hickman reported to the police that a theft<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had occurred in Rosov\u2019s office. She reported that she was the first to arrive at the office and discovered property missing. At the administrative hearing, Rosov\u2019s attempt to have admitted a copy of the police report of the incident was denied by the AL J on relevancy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Rosov argues that, because of the ALJ\u2019s ruling, he was prevented from effectively challenging Hickman\u2019s credibility. He, and his staff, believe that the report was false and that Hickman was responsible for the missing property. In his brief, he asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">Dr. Rosov believes that Ms. Hickman was responsible for the theft occurring in his office. What were the facts? Ms. Hickman called the police, was the only employee present because the office had not yet opened, had her children with her, was not scheduled to work that day, and had borrowed money from Dr. Rosov in the past. There were no thefts after Ms. Hickman left the job. This report was offered by Dr. Rosov for the impeachment of Ms. Hickman. Ms. Hickman was the key witness relied on by the State and yet Dr. Rosov\u2019s counsel was not even allowed to cross examine her about this incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">There was no claim that the police report was false. There was no claim that the crime did not occur. Dr. Rosov and his employees suspected Ms. Hickman. She \u201cdiscovered\u201d the crime. She was in the office with her children before the office opened and on a day she was not scheduled to work. The crime occurred around the holidays and it was known that she had financial difficulties. Further, it was later discovered that she had prior criminal allegations. This was substantial evidence that should have been permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ted into evidence to impeach Ms. Hickman and demonstrate her motivation to lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Maryland Rule 5-401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evidence that is not relevant is inadmissible. Md. Rule 5-402 (2005). Admissible evidence is evidence \u201crelevant to the issues in the case and tends to either establish or disprove them.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 252, 268, 846 A.2d 485 (2004) (citing <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 643, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)). \u201c \u2018Evidentiary rulings, particularly those hinging on relevance, are entrusted to the discretion of the trial judge\u2019; an appellate court will not second-guess a decision as to the relevancy of evidence \u2018absent a clear abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jeffries v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 322, 339, 688 A.2d 16 (1997) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Board in its Final Order found that \u201cthe [police] report did not provide a specific instance of the witness\u2019 conduct.\u201d Rather, \u201cDr. Rosov attempted to rely upon an inference to be drawn from the combination of the police report that a theft had occurred and an affidavit of another witness that employees believed that [Hickman] was responsible for this theft.\u201d Rosov cites many factors that he believes confer relevancy to the police report, and thus relevant to Hickman\u2019s credibility, including her documented history of perhaps unlawful conduct, that she was suspected of being involved with the theft from the office, and that she had a documented history of financial irresponsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In the end, there is no proof that Hickman was involved in the theft, only speculation among employees. No charges were ever brought against her lor the theft. Rosov failed to provide any foundation that would have justified the admission of the police report to impeach Hickman\u2019s credibility. His assertions are no more than rank speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Rosov\u2019s argument that every charge against him was based on the underlying claims of Hickman is inaccurate. Clearly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the Bartrem report, the testimony and observations of Dr. Mulreany, and other expert and lay testimony indicate otherwise. And, we reiterate, appellant fails to address the other, abundant, charges that he was called to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\n<em>Personnel Records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Rosov sought to obtain, and to admit, personnel records from Hickman\u2019s employment with another doctor. The thrust of his argument is that, \u201cupon information and belief,\u201d Hickman was terminated from that employment for dishonesty, and therefore, the records were relevant to her credibility. Rosov provided no support for his argument, other than his speculation that the records contained proof of an alleged termination for dishonesty. He admitted that he had never viewed the record. The ALJ committed no error in denying the admissibility of the proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The Case Sub Judice</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Section 4-315 of the Health Occupations Article governs license denial, suspension, or revocation, and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">(a) Subject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 4-318 of this subtitle, the Board may deny a general license to practice dentistry, a limited license to practice dentistry, or a teacher\u2019s license to practice dentistry to any applicant, reprimand any licensed dentist, place any licensed dentist on probation, or suspend or revoke the license of any licensed dentist, if the applicant or licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">(6) Practices dentistry in a professionally incompetent manner or in a grossly incompetent manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">(11) Permits an unauthorized individual to practice dentistry under the supervision of the applicant or licensee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>(16) Behaves dishonorably or unprofessionally, or violates a professional code of ethics pertaining to the dentistry profession;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">(18) Violates any rule or regulation adopted by the Board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(20) Willfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice of dentistry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">(28) Except in an emergency life-threatening situation where it is not feasible or practicable, fails to comply with the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s guidelines on universal precautions;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Rosov was charged with violations of all of the provisions indicated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">The Board ultimately held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">Dr. Rosov has had many opportunities to learn, and successfully overcome, what can only be described as a somewhat cavalier attitude toward compliance with CDC protections for the benefit of his patients and staff. The Board has tried incremental discipline and found that it has not achieved salutary results. Dr. Rosov has been subject to prior Board discipline: In 1998, he entered into a Consent Order in which he was placed on probation for 3 years for conduct that included the failure to record treatments properly; he was summarily suspended in October 2002, as detailed above, and was summarily suspended again in July 2003. Even in the absence of such a dismal history, the facts adduced at the hearing on the instant charges would be sufficient bases for revocation of a license to practice dentistry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">The Board notes that this case involves not just the double stick incident. Although that incident is disturbing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the Board finds even more distressing the conduct of Dr. Rosov subsequent to the incident. Despite his latter day \u201cinsight\u201d that perhaps the needle stick incident never occurred, he acknowledges that he believed for a significant period that it <em>had </em>occurred just as [Hickman] stated, and it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Nonetheless, he failed to act appropriately, as set out above in the Proposed Decision. He failed to contact Patient A\u2019s mother expeditiously, failed to give her accurate information regarding the incident, did not maintain appropriate records, and in fact still could not produce them almost 3 months later at the time of Dr. Mulreany\u2019s inspection. He misrepresented to the Board his attempts to contact Patient A\u2019s mother, and the outcome of [Hickman]\u2019s blood tests. In short, regardless of the facts surrounding the events of February 26, the Board simply cannot countenance Dr. Rosov\u2019s actions related to the incident in the days, weeks, and months thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">In addition, the Board has taken into consideration Dr. Rosov\u2019s failure to document his treatment properly, as well as the sheer breadth and repetitive nature of Dr. Rosov\u2019s failure to comply with CDC guidelines regarding universal precautions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">Finally, the Board has considered Dr. Rosov\u2019s lack of direct supervision of his dental assistants in the placement and exposure of radiographs when the assistants were not certified by the Board as dental radiation technologists and were not acting in accordance with an educational program approved by the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">The inescapable conclusion is that the Board must take action to remove Dr. Rosov from the practice of dentistry for protection of the public health. Nothing in the record mitigates this conclusion. Nothing in the record suggests that the Board should accept, once again, Dr. Rosov\u2019s assurances that he will improve and thus should be given yet one more opportunity to demonstrate his willingness or ability to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\n<em>The Needle Stick</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We have earlier summarized the needle stick incident, and pointed out that Rosov\u2019s brief focuses almost solely on that event, to the exclusion of the other charges. We shall now provide more detail of that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Rosov argues that his first notice of the needle stick came the day after the incident when Hickman informed him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No communication between Rosov and Patient A\u2019s mother occurred until nearly one week later, when she received a letter from him, dated March 4, 2003. In that letter, Rosov advised the mother that, after treating Patient A, the disposable needle that he had previously used on Patient A had inadvertently pricked the leg of his dental assistant. Specifically, he advised that Patient A \u201cwas at absolutely no risk, this happened well after she was injected and then the needle was disposed.\u201d Indeed, Patient A\u2019s mother testified that her first notice of the incident was one week after it occurred when she received a letter suggesting that her daughter should be tested as a safeguard to Hickman.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The mother telephoned Rosov\u2019s office and read the letter to Hickman, who explained that the needle stick had actually occurred the other way around, that is, the needle stuck Hickman <em>first, </em>and then Patient A. Understandably upset, the mother spoke with Rosov, who informed her that it was \u201ca possibility\u201d that the needle stuck Hickman first and then the child. Rosov then arranged for Patient A to receive lab referrals for the appropriate blood tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The matter came to the Board\u2019s attention on April 16, 2003, as the result of a newspaper article that reported the incident. The Board then acted to initiate a complaint and referred the case for investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Curiously, in Rosov\u2019s exceptions to the findings of the ALJ, he claimed the needle stick had never occurred. The Board found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">In objecting to this Finding Dr. Rosov argues somewhat inconsistently that the needle stick of employee [Hickman] never occurred and that he was unaware of the incident. The Board rejects both assertions based on a review of the testimony of all witnesses as well as other record evidence. A comprehensive analysis of the evidence supports the credibility assessments made by the ALJ, particularly with regard to the testimony of [Hickman], Dr. Rosov, and another dental assistant, [Howard]. As noted below, the Board adopts the discussion and analysis of the ALJ regarding the circumstances surrounding this incident. Dr. Rosov\u2019s allegation that the needle stick of [Hickman] never occurred is simply too implausible to credit. It is wholly inconsistent with his own actions, including writing two different letters to Patient A\u2019s mother on March 4 and March 6 [The handwritten letters provide two different accounts of the incident, but neither questions that assistant Hickman was stuck with the same needle used on the minor patient], calling his wife for advice on the proper precautions to follow in seeking treatment and testing for Patient A and employee [Hickman], and advising CDC consultant Dr. Mulreany of the event. His subsequently developing theory that perhaps the incident never occurred at all is simply not consistent with his behaviors or those of his employees, [Hickman] and [Howard]. The apparent inconsistencies in the testimony of [Howard] offer Dr. Rosov no solace. Taken as a whole, the various statements of [Howard] amount to, even when considered in the light most favorable to Dr. Rosov, hedging by the employee as to whether Dr. Rosov actually knew of the needle stick at the time it occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">After the incident came to the attention of the Board, Dr. Mulreany, on May 5, 2003, inspected Rosov\u2019s office. Rosov was unable to produce records from the February 26, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>needle stick incident, including records regarding notification to or testing of either Patient A or Hickman. Rosov later sent Dr. Mulreany copies of his letters, and lab reports for Hickman and Patient A. Although Rosov\u2019s records were subpoenaed by the Board on May 15, 2003, he did not submit a copy of the March 4, 2003, letter that had been sent to Patient A\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Even though Hickman\u2019s blood tests revealed \u201cREPEATEDLY REACTIVE\u201d for Hepatitis C Virus, Rosov wrote to the Board on May 21, 2003, that \u201che had negative test results\u201d from his assistant. Additionally, Rosov wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">After being informed the next day about Miss Hickman\u2019s needle stick, we jointly referred to our OSHA manual and I advised Miss Hickman to get a blood test for possible HIV/Hepatitis. I called the patient\u2019s mother and similarly informed her of the incident and requested that her daughter also have the precautionary blood tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In fact, as noted by the ALJ in reviewing the mother\u2019s testimony, Rosov did not speak to the mother of Patient A before his letter of March 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The ALJ\u2019s finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the needle stick occurred was based, in part, on the testimony of Howard, Rosov\u2019s dental assistant. She saw Rosov pull the needle away from Patient A\u2019s mouth as she began to struggle, lowering it to his right side. As this occurred, she heard Hickman say \u201couch,\u201d and assumed Rosov knew he had stuck Hickman. Howard also recalled that when Hickman came out of the bathroom later that day, she informed Howard that she had a red mark on her leg. Howard did not see the mark. The ALJ concluded that Howard\u2019s testimony alone supported a finding that the needle stick occurred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The corroboration of the facts by Hickman added to the weight of Howard\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rosov himself later admitted he remembered \u201cbrushing\u201d Hickman\u2019s leg, but he did not hear her say \u201couch,\u201d explaining that he is deaf in one ear, and the room was noisy at the time. We find no error in the AL J\u2019s factual finding that the needle stick occurred. We also note that the ALJ had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, to judge their credibility, and to make demeanor-based credibility assessments in view of the conflicting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Rosov\u2019s conduct after the needle stick is also at issue. We concur with the ALJ\u2019s finding that, after learning of the incident, Rosov should have taken appropriate steps to ascertain the facts, make required chart entries, file appropriate reports, and fully and adequately explain the situation to those involved. His actions in response to the incident were not appropriate, nor did they follow proper post-exposure procedure. There was sufficient evidence that Rosov\u2019s behavior failed to comply with CDC guidelines regarding disease transmission and blood-borne pathogens, in violation of \u00a7 4-315(a)(28) of the Health Occupation Article. <em>See also </em>29 C.F.R. 1910.1030. Further, there is more than sufficient evidence that Rosov violated \u00a7 4-315(a) by providing misleading information to both Kimberly Hickman and Patient A\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>The Remaining Violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Rosov claims that the Board\u2019s investigation was based entirely on the statements of Kimberly Hickman, which, as we have explained, he claims to be not credible. He places significance on the fact that neither Patient A nor her mother filed a complaint with the Board against him. We fail to discern how the basis of the Board\u2019s initial knowledge would attenuate the violations, in view of the substantial evidence of his inappropriate management of his professional obligations. Neither does it render insignificant Rosov\u2019s continuous violations of the Maryland Dentistry Act and CDC guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Rosov further asserts that the Board was predisposed to revoke his license throughout the investigation, \u201ctwist[ing] employee and expert statements\u201d to find support for their intentions. Those assertions, while perhaps suitable for closing argument to a jury, were lost on the ALJ, as they are lost on this Court. The record is devoid of evidence that supports his assignment of enmity by the Board as the basis for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Rosov also places significance on the fact that, at the time of this investigation, he was no longer on probation. Nonetheless, he was under a continuing order requiring inspections. Those inspections and the findings were a basis of the charges against him, in addition to the needle stick incident. The current charges were no doubt spurred by the needle stick incident, but the investigation disclosed evidence to sustain the myriad of other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In arguing that admission of Rosov\u2019s prior charges would prejudice the fact finder, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">[COUNSEL FOR ROSOV]: I would ask counsel to articulate to Your Honor what it is, which of these orders does she contend that he violated in these charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">[ALJ]: It\u2019s my understanding that after looking at the charges that a violation of a prior order is not one of the bases for the \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">[THE STATE]: The State is not charging the respondent with, quote, a violation of a prior order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">[ALJ]: The basis is, and again, I\u2019m not making a finding but here\u2019s the allocation, that is based on conduct from the October 2 consent order up to the charging document in this case. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">[THE STATE]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor. In fact, [counsel for Rosov] has indicated that following the October summary suspension that he had no restrictions on his license, albeit he was no longer on probation but he was under an order requiring ongoing inspections. And those inspections and its findings are a basis of these charges so clearly it\u2019s relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR ROSOV]: I don\u2019t have any objection to\u2014 those are in the final order of November 20, 2002, final decision and order, that the inspections and unannounced visits and that had \u2014 I\u2019m not objecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">What I\u2019m objecting to is everything that came before that, 1998, 1996, the termination' of his probation, the summary suspension in October, and the transcript of the Show Cause hearing in October.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">We do not find it necessary to repeat, in exquisite detail, the factual findings of the ALJ, and adopted by the Board, as to the charges unrelated to the needle stick. Nowhere in his arguments to this Court has Rosov contradicted the findings of the ALJ to any of the other charges. The record is replete with evidence that Rosov knowingly made false reports, provided misleading information to the Board, violated numerous CDC guidelines, and continued irresponsible and unsanitary practices for which he had previously been disciplined. His dramatic accusatory language, demeaning the motives of the Board, is factually unsupported, and gives no basis for favorable appellate review of his license revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">We find, as did the circuit court, that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and that a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the agency\u2019s factual conclusion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\">. Md.Code Ann., Health Occ. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 Repl.Vol. &amp; 2004 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\">. The CDC Guidelines are incorporated into the regulation of the practice of dentistry in Maryland. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Health Occ. \u00a7 4-205(a)(6)(\"On receipt of a written and signed complaint, including a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>referral from the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, [the State Board of Dental Examiners may] conduct an unannounced inspection of the office of a dentist ... to determine compliance at that office with the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s guidelines on universal precautions[.]\u201d); Code of Maryland Regulations (\"COMAR\u201d) 10.44.19.08(11) (2005) (Penalties for Violations of These Regulations \u2014 \"Subject to the hearing provisions of this chapter, the Board [of Dental Examiners] may reprimand any certified radiation technologist ... if the holder of the certificate ... Except in an emergency life-threatening situation where it is not feasible or practicable, fails to comply with the Center for Disease Control's guidelines on universal precautions^]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">. Both the ALJ and the Board refer to the minor patient as \"Patient A\u201d throughout their reports and opinions. We shall do likewise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Amez\">. Rosov did not clearly record the type or amount of the anesthetic used during the treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">. Data about the attempted extraction was not recorded in Patient A\u2019s chart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b133-13\">. Appellant, we think misleadingly, refers to the document as a \"300 page report\u201d when, in fact, the report itself consisted of only 12 pages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b133-14\">. Bartrem was no longer an employee of the Board at the time of the hearing and did not testify. Rosov\u2019s claim that Bartrem was \"mysteriously\u201d no longer employed by the Board at the time of his hearing is no more than unfounded speculation, and is not supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b134-15\">. The AL1 did allow Rosov's license history to be admitted. Also admitted was the consent order signed by him pertaining to the 1996 charges, although the 1996 charging document was not admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">. Those witnesses include Dr. Melissa Mulreany, reviewer of Rosov's infection control practices in conjunction with a previous order of the Board; the mother of Patient A; Kimberly Hickman; Stephanie Howard; Joyce Burke, instructor of an X-ray course taken by Hickman; and Lori Loveridge, Rosov\u2019s office receptionist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\">. In his brief, appellant characterizes the event as a \"robbery.\u201d Since there is no suggestion that the property was taken from a person by the use of force, or under threat of force, we assume that the offense was, in fact, a theft, perhaps occurring in the course of a statutory burglary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. Rosov takes issue with Hickman's failure to inform Patient A's mother at the time. This argument is irrelevant, as Rosov\u2019s responsibilities to his patient, not an assistant\u2019s, are at issue. Additionally, Rosov's claim that Hickman \"did not act like someone who had been stuck with a contaminated needle\u201d is self-serving.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\"><em>. </em>The ALJ acknowledged that Howard offered a contradictory account of the incident in a later affidavit provided to Rosov\u2019s counsel. However, the ALJ noted that this account was tainted, because it was given after Howard received a $1,000 bonus from Rosov, in addition to a paid Caribbean cruise and diamond earrings as a Christmas gift.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">. Hickman testified that after being stuck she fell to one knee, in addition to saying \"ouch.\u201d Howard disputed that testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
