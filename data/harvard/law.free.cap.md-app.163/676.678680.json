In this appeal from an order requiring Sweet to register as a sexually violent predator (\u201cpredator registration\u201d) pursuant to former Md.Code (1957, 2001 RepLVol.), Art. 27 section 792(a)(12),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are asked to decide whether the State sufficiently proved that Sweet is \u201cat risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense\u201d by presenting statistical studies predicting Sweet\u2019s risk of recidivism to be in the \u201cmedium to low range.\u201d Sweet complains that the court erred in relying on two such assessments in determining that he is \u201cat risk.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">In <em>Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 806 A.2d 265 (2002), the Court of Appeals reversed Sweet\u2019s convictions for second degree assault and third degree sexual offense against a minor and remanded the case for a new trial. With respect to the sentencing court\u2019s order that Sweet must register as \u201ca sexually violent predator,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe trial court erred in failing to find, on the record, the factual predicate necessary for finding that petitioner was a sexually violent predator as defined by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 806 A.2d 265. Vacating the judgment, the Court remanded for, <em>inter alia, </em>a new hearing on the issue of whether Sweet should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ordered to register as a sexually violent predator or as a lesser degree of sexually violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">After remand, Sweet pleaded guilty to a third degree sexual offense and was sentenced to a seven-year term of imprisonment. The State filed a memorandum in support of its request that Sweet be required to register as a sexually violent predator. That memorandum included the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">The defendant was convicted of Sexual Offense in the Third Degree in case number 81278. In that case, the defendant sexually molested a 6-year-old girl by climbing on top of her, simulating intercourse and ejaculating on her clothing. He told her they were playing \u201cthe slobber game.\u201d On May 28, 1998, the defendant was sentenced to ten years suspend all but one year plus special conditions during the five years of probation imposed. On November 14, 2000, the defendant was sentenced to nine years back-up for violating his probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">The defendant violated his probation by committing another offense against another child. In that case, the defendant, a 40-plus-year-old man, sexually molested an eleven-year-old girl[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] by repeatedly rubbing his penis up against her buttocks and commenting on the size of her breasts while playing video games.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">On December 5, 2003, a hearing was conducted on the State\u2019s registration request. Dr. Ronald Weiner, executive director of Clinical and Forensic Associates, which \u201cdoes assessments and treatment for convicted sex offenders,\u201d testified at the hearing, explaining the results and reliability of three statistical risk assessment tests he consulted in evaluating Sweet\u2019s risk of re-offending. The defense stipulated that Weiner was an expert in the use of risk assessment evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Dr. Weiner explained that \u201coffense risk assessment instruments\u201d are \u201cstandard tools that are used in the sex offender assessment field[.]\u201d They are \u201clarge-scale, meta analyses .... that have been done on convicted sex offenders nationally here in the United States and in Canada[.]\u201d These \u201cstudies have come up with a series of factors ... identified as the factors that predict risk for re-offending.\u201d Although such studies are \u201cnot clinical\u201d in that they do not reflect information obtained from the individual offender, Weiner stated that \u201cthey have the best validity. In other words, they\u2019re better than clinical judgment in predicting whether someone is likely to re-offend sexually and violently.\u201d Consequently, to evaluate risk of recidivism, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to have the individual present[,]\u201d but \u201cyou do need to have a pre-sentence investigation report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Weiner testified that, of the three risk assessment instruments he used,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cStatic 99\u201d had \u201cthe strongest empirical evidence of predicting risk for re-offense sexually and violently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The Static 99 assessment for Sweet was admitted into evidence without objection. Sweet was assigned a score of three out of five, which Weiner explained in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">What that means is that the individuals that scored a three, that 12 percent of the individuals sexually recidivated in five years, and 22 percent of individuals scoring a three re-offended in a violent way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">Over a 10-year period of time, 14 percent of individuals scoring a three sexually recidivated, and 27 percent who scored a three committed a violent offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">Over a 15-year period of time, a person who scored a three, 19 percent of them re-offended sexually and 34 percent of them re-offended violently. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Also admitted into evidence were results of the Rapid Risk Assessment of Sexual Offense Recidivism (RRASOR), which Dr. Weiner observed were \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d to the Static 99 results, even though it \u201cdoes not include ... predictions of sexual violence and violence in general, just sexual recidivism.\u201d The RRASOR results indicated that the risk that persons like Sweet, who received a score of two (out of a maximum five), will commit another sexual offense within a five-year period is 14.2% and the risk that the same person will commit another sexual offense within a ten-year period is 21.1%.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Asked by the court whether he was able to form an opinion as to whether Sweet is at risk for committing a subsequent sexually violent offense, Dr. Weiner replied: \u201cI do have an opinion. The opinion is that based upon his score, there is evidence of risk for re-offense, both sexually and in terms of possible violence.\u201d That risk was in the \u201cmedium to low range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The State argued that Sweet qualifies as a sexually violent repeat offender who should be ordered to register as a sexually violent predator for several reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">One is the commonsense argument that the defendant molested a little girl, a six-year-old girl. He was caught for doing that, he was prosecuted, he was convicted, and he was sentenced in that case. After he got out of jail in that case, he went again and molested another little girl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">The commonsense argument is that he did it once, he got caught, and he was even sent to jail, he got out of jail, and he went and did it again and he got caught. There is no reason to believe that he would not do it again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Furthermore, the prosecutor emphasized, the statistical risk assessment made by Dr. Weiner supported that conclusion. Pointing to the scores explained by Dr. Weiner, she argued that Sweet \u201cis at risk, in fact, of re-offending and to a significant degree, as is indicated in these risk assessment tools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Defense counsel conceded that Sweet\u2019s molestations of both the six and the nine year old victims fall within the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>definition for sexually violent offenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Asked by the court whether he was arguing that there was \u201cno basis\u201d for the court to find that Sweet was \u201cat. risk because of what [Weiner] said,\u201d defense counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\">No, ... I am not saying that at all. I am saying that clearly he is at risk. I don\u2019t think I could look you in the eye and say he is not at risk, because clearly he is at risk if for no other reason than the fact that he re-offended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Counsel posited that, notwithstanding that Sweet\u2019s crimes are defined by the registration statute as \u201csexually violent,\u201d neither should be treated as \u201cviolent,\u201d given the lack of evidence that he used a weapon, threat, or other force. Based on that distinction and the \u201cmedium to low\u201d risk predicted by the Static 99 and RRASOR studies, he vigorously disputed that Sweet could be characterized as \u201cat risk for committing a subsequent <em>sexually violent </em>offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel acknowledged that \u201cthere is [no] question\u201d that Sweet is properly classified \u201cas a sex offender\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">[h]e is at risk of violating probation or re-offending. That is \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t argue that he is not at risk, because I can\u2019t predict the future and neither can the State. He might not re-offend; he might.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">What the statistics that they have presented to you say is he is at 14.2 percent by one study and 12 percent on another study.....I think there is a reason for the distinction [in the statutory classifications]. Not every sex offender is a sexually violent predator, and ... that is the point I am trying to make to Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Yes, he is a sex offender, but no, he is not a sexually violent predator. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Ultimately, defense counsel agreed with the court that the issue of whether the State proved that Sweet is a sexually violent predator turns on the meaning of \u201cat risk\u201d as that phrase is used in the registration statute. The debate then focused on what level of risk warrants such an at-risk finding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUM\">THE COURT: The legislature didn\u2019t say \u201cis likely to do this again.\u201d The legislature said \u201cis at risk to do it again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8T\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right. And I don\u2019t believe 14 percent or 12 percent is that level of risk necessary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANH\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014 that allows Your Honor to make that classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">THE COURT: Is that the heart of your argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYr\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">After considering the evidence and argument, the court granted the State\u2019s motion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">because ... it is clear that he has been convicted of a subsequent sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">So, the only arguable issue is whether or not I should conclude based on what is before me that he is at risk for committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">For two reasons, I find that he is at risk: first, from the testimony of the witness, the expert witness, who said what he said; and second, from the fact that ... the commonsense argument has appealed to me.... [T]hose two factors cause me to conclude that there is a risk of him committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">Sweet noted this timely appeal, which challenges only the order to register as a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">Sexually Violent Predator Registration</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">When this case was initiated, the registration of sexual offenders was governed by section 792 of Article 27 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Maryland Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Orders to register as a sexual offender \u201care tailored to protect the public[.]\u201d <em>Young v. State, </em>370 Md. 686, 712, 806 A.2d 233 (2002). Such registration orders serve the \u201cgoal of alerting law enforcement officers and the community to the presence of sexual predators who may reoffend[,]\u201d by requiring \u201cregistrants to supply basic information [that] apprise[s] law enforcement officials about an offender residing or working in the area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 715, 806 A.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Registration requirements apply to persons convicted of different degrees of sexual offenses. Relevant to this appeal is that there are distinct obligations for \u201cchild sexual offenders,\u201d \u201csexually violent offenders,\u201d and \u201csexually violent predators,\u201d although all are defined as \u201cregistrants\u201d who must comply with the specific registration requirements applicable to them. <em>See </em>Art. 27 \u00a7 792(a)(7). For example, all registrants are required to register with their supervising authority, but sexually violent predators are also required to register with the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services \u201cevery 90 days throughout the individual\u2019s life,\u201d whereas other registrants register only annually, for a period of from 10 years to life depending on the offenses. <em>See </em>Art. \u00a7 792(c)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">It is the classification of an offender as a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d that triggers heightened registration requirements. This classification is governed by section 792, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u00a7 792 Registration of sexual offenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">(a) Definitions.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">(1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">(12) \u201cSexually violent predator\u201d means an individual who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">(i) Is convicted of a second or subsequent sexually violent offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>(ii) Has been determined in accordance with this section to be <em>at risk </em>of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">(b) <em>Determination; procedure. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">(3) In making a determination [whether an individual is a sexually violent predator], the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">(i) Any evidence that the court considers appropriate to the determination of whether the individual is a sexually violent predator, including the presentencing investigation and sexually violent offender\u2019s inmate record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">(ii) Any evidence introduced by the individual convicted; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">(iii) At the request of the State\u2019s Attorney, any evidence presented by a victim of the sexually violent offense. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Sweet\u2019s Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Sweet argues that the State failed to prove the predicate facts for registration as a \u201csexually violent predatorf.]\u201d Specifically, he argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">[t]here are a number of defects in the State\u2019s evidence at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">First, the assessment tools known as RRASOR and Static 99 both estimate the risk of re-offending as: low, medium or high. There is no such thing as \u201czero\u201d risk. Therefore, if the legislature actually intended any \u201crisk,\u201d whatsoever, to be enough, then all candidates automatically qualify for the status of \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d and the entire hearing procedure is a meaningless exercise in futility. Such a legislative intent cannot be presumed. <em>See [Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 806 A.2d 265 (2002) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">Second, the State\u2019s expert readily conceded that two of the three \u201cessential\u201d components of \u201crisk assessment\u201d require: (a) \u201cclinical interviews\u201d with the defendant and (b) \u201ca series of psychological tests.\u201d Neither of these two \u201cessen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tial\u201d components was present, at all, in this case.... [T]he sole remaining \u201ccomponent\u201d is merely based upon statistical probabilities, not on expert evaluation of this particular defendant\u2019s history or psychological profile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">Third, both of the statistical \u201cassessment tools\u201d used rated the risk of re-offending at less than \u201cmedium\u201d and above \u201clow.\u201d Only 14.2 percent of persons in that category re-offended within five years, according to the RRASOR assessment. The \u201cStatic 99\u201d assessment estimated the risk even lower, at \u201c12 percent\u201d within five years; the risk rose to an insignificant degree, to only \u201c14 percent\u201d over ten years, under the same assessment tool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">Fourth, Dr. Weiner characterized Static 99 as \u201cthe instrument\u201d that has the strongest empirical evidence of predicting risk for re-offense sexually and \u201cviolently.\u201d Yet, under Static 99, of the small minority of those with Sweet\u2019s score who re-off\u00e9nded, at all, only \u201c22 percent\u201d of that minority \u201cre-offended in a <em>viole?d </em>way.\u201d ([E]mphasis added). That is merely a small minority of a small minority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">There is nothing in the legislative history or in the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Sweet </em>to suggest that this sort of hearing is intended to be an exercise in futility. Nothing as ambiguous as an estimate of \u201crisk\u201d can ever truly be characterized as \u201czero;\u201d there is always some minority of a minority that will be at risk of re-offending, violently. Surely, any ambiguity in the statute should be resolved in favor of not imposing onerous, lifetime registration requirements and the severe stigma of not only having to register as a sex \u201coffender\u201d but as a sexually \u201cviolent predator,\u201d where the risk is so low.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Statistical Evidence Of Risk</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The statute requires the court to consider all evidence it finds \u201cappropriate to the determination of whether the individual is a sexually violent predator,\u201d whether offered by the defendant, the State, or the victim. <em>See </em>Art. 27 \u00a7 792(3). These statistical risk assessments were properly considered in accordance with that statutory direction. Indeed, Sweet\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>challenge does not appear to be directed at the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of the RRASOR and Static 99 assessment in terms of admissibility, but rather to the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of the weight given by the court to that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In one respect, Sweet\u2019s argument may be understood as a complaint that the statute does not define \u201cat risk\u201d or otherwise specify a qualifying level of risk to serve as the benchmark for the court to determine whether a particular defendant is at risk of committing another sexually violent crime. In the absence of a statutory definition of \u201cat risk,\u201d we give that phrase its plain and ordinarily understood meaning. <em>See Rouse-Fairwood Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Supervisor of Assessments of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>120 Md.App. 667, 687-88, 708 A.2d 19 (1998). In doing so, we may consult the dictionary and we may consider whether the literal or usual meaning of the words is consistent with the context, objectives, and purpose of the statute. <em>See id.; Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995); <em>Rouse-Fairwood Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>120 Md.App. at 687-88, 708 A.2d 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\u201cRisk\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cthe possibility of suffering harm or loss,\u201d a \u201cdanger,\u201d or a \u201chazard.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(4th ed.2000); <em>see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1236 (unabr,1976)(risk means \u201cexposure to the chance of injury or loss; a hazard or dangerous chance\u201d). More specifically, to be \u201cat risk\u201d is to be \u201c[i]n an endangered state[.]\u201d <em>Am. Heritage Dictionary. </em>Applying this meaning in light of the overall registration scheme and its public safety purpose, we construe section 792 to mean that a defendant is \u201cat risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense\u201d when the court finds, based on the facts as shown by the preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant presents a level of danger that makes registration a reasonably prudent measure for the protection of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We reject Sweet\u2019s suggestion that sexually violent predator registration cannot be ordered unless the court finds that the risk of the defendant committing a sexually violent offense in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the future exceeds a specified level. There is nothing in the language or history of the statute to suggest that the court must use a quantitative yardstick to measure such risk; nor do we discern any legislative intent to establish a minimum \u201cqualifying\u201d level of risk. To the contrary, the General Assembly\u2019s use of a generalized \u201cat risk\u201d standard indicates its intent to leave to the trial court the task of evaluating whether the evidence shows that the public threat of future sexual assaults by the defendant is serious enough to warrant imposing the heightened registration requirements of section 792. In practical terms, the salient question is whether the State met its burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the public will be in \u201can endangered state\u201d if the defendant is required to register only once every 365 days as opposed to every 90 days.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We also reject Sweet\u2019s complaint that the sexually violent predator hearing is a meaningless exercise in futility because there is always some risk that a repeat offender will commit yet another sexually violent crime. This argument rises and falls on the incorrect premise that the existence of even the slightest risk that the defendant will commit another sexual offense necessarily requires the court to find that the defendant is \u201cat risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense\u201d for purposes of section 792. That is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">To prevail on its request for predator registration, the State must persuade the circuit court that the danger of <em>sexually violent </em>recidivism is high enough in the defendant\u2019s case that the lesser registration requirements for other types of sexual offenders will not adequately protect the public. The hearing provides the defendant an opportunity to challenge the evidence and argument offered by the State. The court may find, based on a preponderance of all the evidence, that the risk of the defendant committing <em>any sexual offense </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>is not high enough to warrant predator registration, or, alternatively, that the demonstrated risk of the defendant committing <em>another violent sexual offense </em>has not been shown to be high enough to warrant such registration. In either case, the court\u2019s decision necessarily would be that the defendant is not \u201cat risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense\u201d within the meaning of section 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Indeed, that is precisely what counsel for Sweet urged the court to find. He argued that the \u201clow to moderate\u201d risk assessments under the RRASOR and Static 99 tests, and the \u201cnon-violent\u201d nature of Sweet\u2019s offenses, did not support an at-risk finding for purposes of predator registration. The fact that the court did not weigh the evidence in the manner advocated by Sweet does not mean that the outcome of the hearing was a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Ultimately, then, we view Sweet\u2019s appeal as a sufficiency of the evidence challenge. We frequently have observed that \u201c[i]t is not our role as an appellate court to re-evaluate or re-weigh the testimony and other evidence presented at trial and substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>Deyesu v. Donhauser, </em>156 Md.App. 124, 136, 846 A.2d 28, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 Md. 685, 856 A.2d 721 (2004). Instead, we ask whether the evidence, \u201cincluding all inferences that may permissibly be drawn therefrom, ... if believed and if given maximum weight, could logically establish\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence that Sweet is \u201cat risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.\u201d <em>See generally Starke v. Starke, </em>134 Md.App. 663, 678, 761 A.2d 355 (2000)(discussing sufficiency of the evidence challenges).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Sufficiency Of The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">We find evidence sufficient to support the court\u2019s at-risk determination. Significantly, the court did not rely solely on the statistical risk assessments, nor did it rely solely on Sweet\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Instead, the court considered and credited Dr. Weiner\u2019s testimony that these assessments do not reflect personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>interviews with or evaluations of Sweet, and that the purely statistical analyses upon which the two assessments are premised predict the risk of \u201csexual re-offense\u201d by Sweet as \u201cmedium to low[.]\u201d Given these limitations, the court made it clear that it was viewing that evidence in light of the undisputed \u201ccommon sense\u201d evidence that Sweet \u201cmolested a ... six-year-old girl,\u201d \u201cwas caught for doing that,\u201d \u201cconvicted\u201d and \u201csentenced\u201d for that crime, and then, when \u201che got out of jail in that case, he went again and molested another little girl.\u201d The record shows that within a matter months after Sweet was released from prison for ejaculating on a six year old victim pinned beneath him while he simulated intercourse, he repeatedly pressed his erect penis against a nine year old girl in his care. The court emphasized that it was evaluating the quantitative risk data from the Static 99 and RRASOR assessments in light of these two assaults against young girls within such a short period, and giving significant weight to the fact that Sweet molested the second child while he was still on probation for molesting the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Collectively, the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that Sweet is already among the \u201cminority of a minority\u201d from whom he attempts to distinguish himself, in that he is undisputedly a member of the 22 percent who commit a subsequent sexually violent crime within five years of the prior crime. We hold that this evidence is sufficient to support the court\u2019s determination that Sweet is \u201cat risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
