Appellee is the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Appellants allege that, because of amendments to a Division of Correction (\u201cthe DOC\u201d) regulation, they are unlawfully being denied diminution of confinement credits for doublecelling. After pursuing administrative remedies pursuant to the inmate grievance procedure, each appellant petitioned for judicial review by the circuit court for the county in which he was incarcerated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants Quint\u00edn Demby, Jesse Baltimore, and Earl F. Cox, Jr. each filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Somerset County. Appellants Kenneth E. Woodall and Daniel Falcone each filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Washington County. The trial courts entered judgment in favor of the Secretary in all five cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Appellants then separately tiled applications for leave to appeal to this Court. We granted the applications and consolidated the appeals for briefing and argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now reverse the judgments of the Circuit Court for Somerset County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>as to appellants Demby and Cox, and the judgments of the Circuit Court for Washington County as to appellants Woodall and Falcone. We remand the cases to the respective courts with instructions to reverse the decisions of the Secretary and remand the cases for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We dismiss appellant Baltimore\u2019s appeal as moot. Prior to argument before this Court, Baltimore was released to mandatory supervision. As appellants acknowledge in their reply brief, if they prevail on appeal, \u201cBaltimore [will] have no remedy in damages.\u201d To the extent that Baltimore\u2019s appeal may present an unresolved issue of important public concern, or may present an issue that is capable of repetition yet evading review in his particular case, we are confident that our determinations as to the remaining four appellants will resolve those issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">APPLICABLE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The General Assembly has provided that \u201can inmate committed to the custody of the Commissioner is entitled to a diminution of the inmate\u2019s term of confinement as provided under [Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the Correctional Services Article].\u201d Md.Code, Corr. Serv\u2019s \u00a7 3-702 (1999). With respect to the type of diminution credit involved in this case, the legislature has further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u00a7 3-707. Same \u2014 Special Projects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">\u25a0 (a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 In addition to any other deductions allowed under this subtitle, an inmate may be allowed a deduction of up to 10 days from the inmate\u2019s term of confinement for each calendar month during which the inmate manifests satisfactory progress in those special selected work projects or other special programs designated by the Commissioner and approved by the Secretary [of Public Safety and Correctional Services].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>(b) <em>Method of calculation. </em>\u2014 A deduction described in subsection (a) of this section shall be calculated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">(1) from the first day that the inmate is assigned to the work project or program; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">(2) on a prorated basis for any portion of the calendar month during which the inmate participates in the work project or program.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u201cThe Secretary and Commissioner have designated double celling as a special project by adopting regulations providing that a double celled inmate serving what we shall refer to as an \u2018eligible sentence\u2019 is a special project.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 458, 780 A.2d 1199 (2001). As originally adopted effective April 1, 1990, former Md. Regs.Code (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) tit. 12, \u00a7 02.06.05 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">N. Special Project Credit for Double-Celled Inmates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">(1) Inmates who meet the eligibility criteria in \u00a7 N(2) are in a special project pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 700(f), Annotated Code of Maryland[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>], except inmates who are serving a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">(a) Sentence for murder, rape, sex offenses, child abuse, drug trafficking or distribution, or use of a firearm in the commission of a felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">(b) Mandatory sentence for the commission of a felony; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">(c) Sentence as a repeat offender under Article 27, \u00a7 643B, Annotated Code of Maryland.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">(2) Inmates eligible for special project credits under this section are inmates who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-14\">(a) Have agreed to be voluntarily double-celled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>(b) Are double-celled in an institution which is required by court order to be single-celled or by court order has a population cap and the population cap is exceeded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">(c) Are double-celled in an institution which is not under court order but where the number of double cells exceeds the single-cell design capacity of the institution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">(d) Are housed in a dormitory or dormitory-type housing and the housing area where the inmates are confined does not provide 55 square feet of living space per inmate exclusive of dayrooms, toilets, and showers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">(3) Inmates who meet the criteria described above shall receive 5 days credit for each calendar month, and on a prorated basis for any portion of a calendar month, beginning on the date and ending on the date the Secretary determines appropriate, based on the demand for inmate housing and services in the Division of Correction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">(4) An inmate may not, under any circumstances, be entitled to earn from all sources, including this regulation, more than the statutory maximum of 15 credit days per month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">(5) The Commissioner shall revoke all special project credits earned under this section if, within 30 days before the inmate\u2019s release on mandatory supervision, an inmate is found guilty of an institutional rule violation for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">(a) Assault;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">(b) Possession of contraband;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">(c) Escape; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-13\">(d) Attempted escape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">(7) This regulation may not be interpreted, understood or construed to mean that inmates who are eligible to receive the credits described in this section have any right to those credits or that inmates will continue to receive those credits in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">17:8 Md. Reg. 972-74 (Apr. 20, 1990). The DOC interpreted the regulation to prohibit any award of double-celling credits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to an inmate if any sentence in his or her term of confinement is ineligible, regardless of whether the inmate\u2019s term of confinement also included a non-concurrent eligible sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">On September 10, 2001, this Court filed <em>Smith v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 780 A.2d 1199 (2001). In <em>Smith, </em>we interpreted former COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N and held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">when an inmate\u2019s term of confinement includes both a sentence that is not eligible for the special project credits in question and a consecutive sentence that is eligible for those credits, the two sentences must be considered separately, so that the inmate may reduce his or her term of confinement by earning special project credits against the eligible sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">140 Md.App. at 461, 780 A.2d 1199. As a result of <em>Smith, </em>the DOC was required to award retroactive double-celling credits to an unknown number of inmates. The appellants in this case were included in that broad sweep.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Effective January 1, 2002, at least in part in response to this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Smith, </em>the Commissioner of Correction amended, by \u201cemergency action,\u201d the regulations regarding diminution of confinement credits for double-celling. <em>See </em>29:4 Md. Reg. 413-14 (Feb. 22, 2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">F. Special Projects Credit for Housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">(1) Except as provided in \u00a7 F(3) of this regulation, an inmate may be awarded special projects credit for housing under Correctional Services Article, \u00a7 3-707, Annotated Code of Maryland, if the inmate is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">(a) Assigned to a cell containing two beds and is not serving a period of disciplinary segregation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">(b) Housed in a dormitory or dormitory-type housing and the housing area where the inmate is confined does not provide 55 square feet of living space per inmate, exclusive of dayrooms, toilets, and showers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>(2) An inmate may be awarded a maximum of five special projects credits for housing for each calendar month, and on a prorated basis for any portion of a calendar month, beginning on a date and ending on a date the Secretary determines appropriate, based on the demand for inmate housing and services in the Division, subject to \u00a7\u00a7 F(3) and G of this regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">(3) An inmate may not be awarded special projects credit under this section during the inmate\u2019s term of confinement if the inmate is serving a term of confinement that includes a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">(a) Sentence for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">(i) Abduction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">(ii) Arson in the first degree;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">(iii) Carjacking or armed carjacking;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">(iv) Kidnaping;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">(v) Manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">(vi) Mayhem and maiming, as previously proscribed under Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 384-386, Annotated Code of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">(vii) Murder or attempted murder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">(viii) Use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or other crime of violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-15\">(ix) Child abuse, abuse or neglect of a vulnerable adult, or child sale, barter, or trade under Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 3-601, 3-602, or 3-603, Annotated Code of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-16\">(x) Assault on a Division inmate or employee under Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 3-205, Annotated Code of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-17\">(xi) A drug crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-18\">(xii) [ (a) ] An offense which would cause the offender to be defined as a child sexual offender, offender, sexually violent offender, or sexually violent predator under Criminal Procedure Article, Title 11, Subtitle 7, Annotated Code of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-19\">(b) Mandatory sentence for the commission of a felony; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(c) Sentence as a repeat offender under Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 14-101, Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">(4) This section may not be interpreted, understood, or construed to mean that an inmate who is eligible to receive the credits described in this section has a right to these credits or that an inmate will continue to receive these credits in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Relevant to this case, the list of ineligible offenses has been expanded to include, <em>inter alia, </em>kidnaping and carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The four remaining appellants were convicted of offenses that occurred at some point after April 1, 1990. All four were committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction prior to September 10, 2001, when this Court decided <em>Smith. </em>The appellants are presently incarcerated in various institutions within the DOC. All have apparently been double-celled within the meanings of the former and current regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The complete commitment records of the four appellants are not included in the trial record or the record extract. Appellants inform us in their brief, and the Secretary does not dispute, that Demby, Cox, and Woodall are serving terms of confinement that include both eligible and ineligible sentences under former COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Falcone\u2019s term of confinement apparently did not include an ineligible sentence until January 1, 2002, when the regulation was amended and the list of ineligible offenses was expanded. As of that date, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>moreover, another sentence in Woodall\u2019s term of confinement became ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Neither the record nor record extract reflect, and appellants do not inform us of, the particular offenses that underlie Demby\u2019s term of confinement. We are told only that during a particular portion of his term of confinement \u2014 that is, from January 1, 1992 until June 29, 1998 \u2014 Demby was <em>not </em>serving an ineligible sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Appellants inform us that, in April of 1995, Cox began serving a 15-year sentence for assault with intent to disable and a concurrent five-year sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The 15-year sentence was eligible for double-celling credits under the former regulation; the five-year sentence was not. That has not changed with the amendments to the regulation. Thus, since his completion of the five-year sentence for the handgun offense, Cox has been serving a sentence for an eligible offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Appellants assert that Woodall\u2019s term of confinement includes sentences for theft, possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute, robbery with a deadly weapon, and kidnaping. Possession with intent to distribute was the only ineligible offense under former COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N. With current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F, kidnaping became ineligible as well. We are unable to decipher the particular dates of Woodall\u2019s various sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In May of 1996, Falcone began serving a term of confinement that consisted of a 15-year sentence for robbery with a deadly weapon and a consecutive 20-year sentence, with all but three years suspended, for carjacking. The sentences for both offenses were eligible for double-celling credits under the former regulation. Carjacking became ineligible with the January 1, 2002 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">As we have explained, until September 10, 2001, when this Court filed <em>Smith, </em>the DOC interpreted former COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N to prohibit any award of double-celling credits to an inmate if any sentence in his or her term of confinement was ineligible, even if the inmate\u2019s term of confinement also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>included a non-concurrent eligible sentence. Thus, the DOC did not award any double-celling credits to Demby, Cox, or Woodall, but did award credits to Falcone. After <em>Smith </em>was decided, the DOC retroactively awarded Demby, Cox, and Woodall double-celling credits for those portions of their terms of confinement when they were serving sentences only for eligible offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The DOC continued to award appellants double-celling credits for such time served until January 1, 2002, when current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F took effect. At that point, the DOC determined that because all four inmates had ineligible sentences in their terms of confinement \u2014 albeit, only a newly ineligible sentence in Falcone\u2019s case \u2014 none of them were entitled to continue earning double-celling credits. The DOC did not rescind any of the double-celling credits already awarded to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Each of the appellants then separately pursued an inmate grievance in an effort to continue earning double-celling credits beyond January 1, 2002. They argued that, because they had committed their offenses prior to the amendment of the regulation, the application to them of the new language stating that an inmate could not earn double-celling credits for <em>any </em>sentence if <em>one </em>sentence in his or her term of confinement was ineligible constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Woodall and Falcone also argued that the application to them of the language in the regulation making kidnaping and carjacking ineligible offenses constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">As we have indicated, appellants\u2019 arguments were consistently rejected at the administrative level and in the trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">In appeals from inmate grievance proceedings, \u201can appellate court reviews the agency decision under the same statutory standards as the circuit court[; thus,] we reevaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the decision of the agency, not the lower court.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Serv\u2019s, </em>377 Md. 34, 45-46, 831 A.2d 1079 (2003). We give \u201c \u2018appropriate deference to the decisions of prison administrators and appropriate recognition to the peculiar and restrictive circumstances of penal confinement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell v. Cushwa, </em>133 Md.App. 519, 538, 758 A.2d 616 (2000) (citation omitted). This deference does not extend to cases where the agency has made an error of law, however.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">[W]e \u201cmay always determine whether the administrative agency made an error of law.\u201d ... Typically,' such a determination requires considering \u201c(1) the legality of the decision and (2) whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the decision.\u201d ... Moreover, in cases that involve determining whether a constitutional right has been infringed, we make an independent constitutional appraisal....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 46, 831 A.2d 1079 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\"><em>\u2014Ex Post Facto </em>Prohibition\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Appellants argue that the application to them of the amended regulation constitutes an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. As the Court of Appeals has summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">The federal prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws can be found in Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of the United States, which states in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall ... pass any <em>... ex post facto Law....\u201d Ex post facto </em>laws are also prohibited under Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which states \u201c[t]hat retrospective Laws, punishing acts committed before the existence of such Laws, and by them only incompatible with liberty; wherefore, no <em>ex post facto </em>Law ought to be made; nor any retrospective oath or restriction be imposed, or required.\u201d Maryland\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>clause has been viewed generally to have the \u201csame meaning\u201d as its federal counterpart.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-10\"><em>Watkins, </em>377 Md. at 47-48, 831 A.2d 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">\u201cAlthough the Latin phrase <em>\u2018ex post facto\u2019 </em>literally encompasses any law passed \u2018after the fact,\u2019 it has long been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>recognized ... that the constitutional prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws applies only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them.\u201d <em>Collins v. </em>Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 41, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990). This includes \u201c \u2018[e]very law that <em>changes the punishment </em>and inflicts a <em>greater punishment, </em>than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 110 S.Ct. 2715 (quoting 3 Dall. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798) (emphasis in original)). It is well settled that \u201cany statute ... which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, ... is prohibited as <em>ex post facto.\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Beazell v. Ohio, </em>269 U.S. 167, 169-70, 46 S.Ct. 68, 70 L.Ed. 216 (1925)).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><em>\u2014Regulations as </em>Laws\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u201c[I]n the context of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause, the \u2018concept of \u201claw\u201d ... is broader than a statute enacted by a legislative body, and may include some administrative regulations----\u2019 \u201d <em>Watkins, </em>377 Md. at 49, 831 A.2d 1079 (quoting <em>Lomax v. Warden, Maryland Corr. Training Ctr., </em>356 Md. 569, 576, 741 A.2d 476 (1999)). The Supreme Court has long regarded the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition \u201cas reaching every form in which the legislative power of the state is exerted, whether it be a constitution, a constitutional amendment, an enactment of the legislature, a by-law or ordinance of a municipal corporation, or a regulation or order of some other instrumentality of the state exercising delegated legislative authority.\u201d <em>Ross v. Oregon, </em>227 U.S. 150, 162-63, 33 S.Ct. 220, 57 L.Ed. 458 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The Court of Appeals has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">whether an administrative provision qualifies as a \u201claw\u201d for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes depends in large part on the manner and extent that it limits an agency\u2019s discretion. If the provision \u201cdo[es] not have the force and effect of law\u201d but simply announces how an agency is likely to exercise its discretion, the <em>ex post facto </em>clause does not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-9\"><em>Watkins, </em>377 Md. at 49, 831 A.2d 1079 (citation omitted). The Court stated in <em>Watkins </em>that the \u201cdiscretion to which <em>ex post </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>facto </em>analysis attaches\u201d is that of the Commissioner and not that of \u201cthe individuals carrying out the Commissioner\u2019s policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 831 A.2d 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has determined whether former COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N was, or whether current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F is, a \u201claw\u201d for purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. Our independent constitutional appraisal convinces us, however, that both the former and the current regulations <em>are </em>such laws, and that application of the current regulation to appellants violates the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In <em>Smith, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 780 A.2d 1199, we determined that the DOC was violating its own regulation \u2014 and thus was violating the <em>\u201cAccardi </em>doctrine\u201d \u2014 by interpreting former CO-MAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N to bar awards of double-celling credits to inmates who had any ineligible sentences in their terms of confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 780 A.2d 1199 (citing <em>U.S. ex rel Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954)). In doing so, we \u201cfollow[ed] the rule that governs good conduct credits\u201d and held that \u201cwhen an inmate\u2019s term of confinement includes both a sentence that is not eligible for the special project credits in question and a consecutive sentence that is eligible for those credits, the two sentences must be considered separately, so that the inmate may reduce his or her term of confinement by earning special project credits against the eligible sentence.\u201d 140 Md.App. at 461, 780 A.2d 1199. <em>See generally Sec\u2019y of Pub.

Lanham, </em>895 F.Supp. 750 (D.Md.1995), <em>aff'd sub nom. Worsham v. Lanham, </em>76 F.3d 377 (4th Cir.1996), the United States District Court for the District of Maryland was faced with a situation similar to that now before this Court. An inmate committed to the custody of the Commissioner to serve a life sentence challenged a new DOC directive<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that prohibited inmates serving life sentences from progressing to minimum security or work release status. The inmate argued that the directive was a law and that, when combined with a Maryland Parole Commission policy of refusing to recommend parole for prisoners who were not on work release, it constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. The federal court agreed. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">[T]he new [DOC directive] ... is a \u201claw\u201d for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause. First, it is a rule promulgated pursuant to legislatively delegated authority.... Second, the rule is not merely a guide that leaves discretion with classification teams, wardens, or the Parole Commission, in the security classification of lifers. The new [directive] ... may not be \u201cdiscarded where circumstances require,\u201d but is an inflexible rule that a lifer \u201cshall not be reduced below medium security.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 756. <em>Compare Lomax, </em>356 Md. 569, 741 A.2d 476 (where the Court of Appeals held that the Governor\u2019s policy of denying parole to inmates serving life sentences was discretionary and was not a law for purposes of <em>ex post facto </em>analysis); <em>Campbell, </em>133 Md.App. 519, 758 A.2d 616 (where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>this Court did not address whether new DOC directives limiting the ability of inmates serving life sentences to attain a minimum security or work release status were \u201claws,\u201d but held that the directives alone did not constitute <em>ex post facto </em>punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In <em>Watkins, </em>377 Md. 34, 831 A.2d 1079, three inmates committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction argued that amendments to several DOC directives concerning security classification, work release, and family leave for inmates serving life sentences were laws and violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. The Court of Appeals rejected the arguments and observed that the legislature has delegated to the Commissioner discretion to \u201cestablish policy for guidelines\u201d regarding security, work release, and family leave \u201cwithout legislative ratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 831 A.2d 1079. The Court concluded that the directives in question \u201cmerely communicate the Commissioner\u2019s intended use of discretion, they do not have the \u2018force and effect of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 831 A.2d 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The Court by no means implied in <em>Watkins, </em>however, that the legislature has given the Commissioner discretion to make a prisoner\u2019s punishment more burdensome than it was at the time the offense was committed. As we shall discuss in detail, <em>infra, </em>the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition is designed to prevent any such action. Indeed, the <em>Watkins </em>Court rejected the implicit argument that the challenged amendments to the DOC directives somehow enhanced the inmates\u2019 punishments. The Court made clear that the Commissioner may \u201celect[ ] to change his intentions and discard or alter\u201d the DOC directives, but in no event may he \u201c \u2018augment [a prisoner\u2019s] punishment, either actually or potentially.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\"><em>\u2014Application of Amendments as Enhancement of </em>Penalties\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">We are convinced that application of current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F to appellants alters their punishments by increasing the lengths of their sentences. As we have explained, the federal and state prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws apply to \u201c \u2018[e]very law that <em>changes the punishment </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>inflicts a <em>greater punishment, </em>than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. at 42, 110 S.Ct. 2715 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). In the context of this case, the critical question is whether such application \u201cincreases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.\u201d <em>California Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 506 n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995) (regarding statute amending parole procedures). That is, we must look to \u201cwhether [the amendment] produces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the ... crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 115 S.Ct. 1597. A mere \u201cspeculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect if increasing the measure of punishment\u201d will not rise to the level of an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">As the Supreme Court has summarized, \u201ca prisoner\u2019s eligibility for reduced imprisonment is a significant factor entering into both the defendant\u2019s decision to plea bargain and the judge\u2019s calculation of the sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 32, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981) (citing, <em>inter alia, Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). The Court has further explained that any argument that \u201crests on the notion that overcrowding-gain time is not \u2018in some technical sense part of the sentence\u2019 ... is foreclosed by [the] precedents\u201d of the Supreme Court. <em>Lynce v. Mathis, </em>519 U.S. 433, 445, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997) (where the Supreme Court determined that a Florida statute that cancelled provisional release credits already awarded to inmates due to prison overcrowding violated <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions) (quoting <em>Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 32, 101 S.Ct. 960).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In <em>Weaver, </em>the appellant inmate was confined to a Florida institution. He challenged a state statute that reduced the number of good conduct credits that inmates could earn. The appellant argued that, when applied to prisoners such as himself who were serving sentences for crimes committed prior to the statute\u2019s enactment, the statute constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The Supreme Court agreed. It reversed and remanded the ease with instructions to the Florida court to \u201capply, if possible, the law in place when [the appellant\u2019s] crime occurred.\u201d 450 U.S. at 36 n. 22, 101 S.Ct. 960. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMl\">The critical question is whether the law changes the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date. In the context of this question, this case can be recast as asking whether [the Florida statute] applies to prisoners convicted for acts committed before the provision\u2019s effective date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 31, 101 S.Ct. 960. The Court answered the question in the affirmative and reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">For prisoners who committed crimes before its enactment, [the statute] substantially alters the consequences attached to a crime already completed, and therefore changes \u201cthe quantum of punishment.\u201d ... Therefore, it is a retrospective law which can be constitutionally applied to petitioner only if it is not to his detriment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 33, 101 S.Ct. 960. The Court determined that application of the new statute to inmates such as the appellant <em>was </em>to their detriment. It observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">On its face, the statute reduces the number of monthly gain-time credits available to an inmate who abides by prison rules and adequately performs his assigned tasks. By definition, this reduction in gain-time accumulation lengthens the period that someone in [appellant\u2019s] position must spend in prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\"><em>Id. </em>The Court added: \u201c[T]he new provision constricts the inmate\u2019s opportunity to earn early release, and thereby makes more onerous the punishment for crimes committed before its enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 101 S.Ct. 960.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Former COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N(7) provided, and current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F(4) provides, that the regulation \u201cmay not be interpreted, understood or construed\u201d to mean that an inmate who is eligible to receive double-celling credits has \u201cany right\u201d to the credits or will \u201ccontinue to receive [such credits] in the future.\u201d The Secretary points to this language as proof that she and the Commissioner retain discretion to terminate the special program as to any inmate at any time. The Supreme Court has pointed out, however, that \u201c[t]he constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws cannot be avoided merely by adding to a law notice that it might be changed.\u201d <em>Miller v. Florida, </em>482 U.S. 423, 431, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987). As this Court explained in <em>Smith, we </em>will not interpret the language in question as \u201creserving unlimited authority in the DOC.\u201d 140 Md.App. at 462, 780 A.2d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u2014Conclusion\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">To be sure,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">the Secretary and Commissioner have authority to abolish, to revoke, or to revise the eligibility standards for double celling. Under section 3-707 [of the Correctional Services Article], they may determine whether any special project credits are available, what projects earn such credits, how may credits may be earned, and who may earn them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 462, 780 A.2d 1199. We likewise conclude that the regulations adopted by the Commissioner attain the status of laws, for the purpose of our <em>ex post facto </em>analysis, by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the legislative discretion granted to the Secretary and the Commissioner pursuant to Corr. Serv. \u00a7 3-707.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">With this opinion, we do not suggest that once doublecelling credits are established they must remain unchanged and available to all inmates in perpetuity. Clearly, current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F may lawfully be applied to inmates who committed their offenses after it took effect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nor do we suggest that an inmate who is serving a sentence for an offense that is eligible for double-celling credits may not be removed to a single cell in accordance with DOC policies and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We hold only that an inmate serving a term of confinement for an offense committed prior to January 1, 2002(i) may not be denied double-celling credits, for periods of time during which he or she was or is serving only an eligible sentence, for the sole reason that another sentence in his or her term of confinement is ineligible, and (ii) may not be denied doublecelling credits on sentences for offenses that were eligible under the former regulation but are ineligible under the current regulation. We reverse the judgments of the trial courts and remand all four cases to the respective courts with instructions to reverse the decisions of the Secretary and to remand the cases for further proceedings. The trial courts shall instruct the Secretary to recalculate, under former CO-MAR \u00a7 12.02.06.05N, the number of double-celling credits to be awarded to each appellant. The courts shall further instruct the Secretary to conduct those proceedings necessary to facilitate the recalculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR SOMERSET COUNTY IN CASE NOS. 1230 AND 1741 AND <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY IN CASE NOS. 1490 AND 1491 REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE DECISIONS OF THE SECRETARY AND REMAND FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">CASE NO. 1408 DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-10\">. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Corr.
