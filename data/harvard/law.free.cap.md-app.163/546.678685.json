The Circuit Court for Baltimore County dismissed a complaint for limited divorce, custody, and child support filed by Deepa Garg, appellant, against Ajay Garg, appellee, because it concluded that the court lacked jurisdiction under the Maryland Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (the \u201cUCCJA\u201d), \u00a7 9-201 <em>et seq. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (1999 Repl. Vol.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court awarded travel costs and attorney\u2019s fees to Mr. Garg.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On appeal, Ms. Garg poses the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">I. Was the trial court in error in applying the international application of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act to dismiss mother\u2019s complaint for custody where the foreign nation had not issued an order or decree concerning custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">II. Was the trial court in error in dismissing mother\u2019s complaint for custody in contravention of the Family Law Article l-201(a)(5) and (b)(1) and 2-503(d) granting the trial court jurisdiction over the issue of custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">III. Was the trial court in error in dismissing Wife\u2019s complaint for divorce for alleged insufficient service of process[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">IV. Was the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses entered in error an abuse of discretion?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The parties were married in India on July 19, 1991. Mr. Garg is a citizen of India, where he now resides. At one time, however, he was a permanent resident of the United States. Ms. Garg claims she came to the United States as a \u201clawful permanent resident\u201d in October 1991, and she became a naturalized United States citizen in 1997. The couple\u2019s only child, Chaitanya, was born in India on September 23, 1995. Appellant claims that Chaitanya is an American citizen, pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ant to the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431(a) (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">According to appellant, Mr. Garg remained in the United States when the couple\u2019s child was born. Ms. Garg and the baby returned to this country in January 1996. The family then resided in Massachusetts until 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The parties separated in March 2002, while they were again in India. In April 2002, Mr. Garg initiated custody proceedings in Indore, India, pursuant to the Guardians and Wards Act. In the same month, appellant filed an action for \u201cmaintenance\u201d in Mumbai, India, pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Code. In May of 2002, when Ms. Garg left India with the couple\u2019s son, no custody order had been issued by an Indian court. The pair arrived in Maryland on May 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Nine months later, on February 24, 2003, appellant filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a \u201cComplaint for Limited Divorce, Child Custody, Child Support and Appropriate Relief.\u201d She alleged that appellee\u2019s \u201cconduct frequently included ... assault and battery,\u201d spanning approximately ten years of marriage. Moreover, appellant claimed that she was \u201cunaware of any other action pending in this or in any other state, territory, country or jurisdiction for the divorce, separation, annulment or dissolution of the marriage of the parties .... \u201d She also alleged that it was in the best interest of the child to remain in her custody, because of the physical and emotional harm inflicted on him by appellee, and because Chaitanya did not want to return to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Two weeks later, on March 7, 2003, Ms. Garg filed an \u201cEx Parte Motion For Emergency Custody.\u201d She advised the court that appellee \u201cfiled for custody [of Chaitanya] in his home country (India)\u201d and that \u201cthe Indian court has accepted jurisdiction over the matter....\u201d However, she asserted that the Indian court \u201cdoes not have personal jurisdiction\u201d of appellant or the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">On the same date, the court (Levitz, J.) issued a \u201cRuling\u201d denying the motion \u201cbecause notice was not provided as required under Rule 1-351.\u201d But, the court also ruled that appellee \u201cis prohibited from removing the minor child, Chaitanya Garg, from' the jurisdiction of [the] court before such time as a hearing is held regarding [the] matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Appellant filed an amended ex parte emergency custody motion on March 18, 2003, claiming that she notified appellee in accordance with Md. Rule 1-351. Appellant asked the court to award her sole legal and physical custody of Chaitanya, \u201cwith a prohibition that the minor child not travel domestically or abroad without the [appellant\u2019s] written permission, or that of [the] Court.\u201d Appellant included a copy of an \u201cIntimation of Ex Parte Order\u201d from the Family Court in Indore, dated February 1, 2003, addressed to Deepa Garg. It advised that appellee\u2019s custody matter \u201cproceeded Ex-Parte against you\u201d because Ms. Garg\u2019s \u201cadvocate,\u201d Shri Gangwal, \u201cpleaded \u2018No Instructions\u2019 on 26.8.2002.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In response to appellant\u2019s complaint and ex parte custody motion, on April 11, 2003, appellee filed a \u201cVerified Emergency Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Maryland Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act Because Custody Proceedings Are Pending in India.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He alleged that appellant \u201cabducted\u201d Chaitanya from India to Maryland, and complained that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u201cfraudulently concealed\u201d from the court that custody proceedings were already pending in India. In his view, appellant\u2019s conduct constituted a \u201creprehensible attempt to forum shop improperly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">According to appellee, the court in Indore had jurisdiction of the custody dispute as of April 8, 2002, when he sought an expedited hearing pursuant to Section 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act. In support of his contention, appellee attached a translated copy of his \u201cApplication [to the Indian court] for Early Hearing in Case No. 8/02.\u201d He also attached a copy of the Indore court\u2019s decision of July 11, 2002, denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss his custody action on the ground that the Indore court lacked jurisdiction because Chaitanya lived in Mumbai. Further, Mr. Garg asserted that, \u201con August 26, 2002, Ms. Garg\u2019s [Indian] counsel advised the court that he was without instructions from his client as to how to proceed,\u201d and the Indore court thereafter \u201cinitiated ex parte proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">According to appellee, on October 23, 2002, \u201c[t]he Indian court ... issued an order that Ms. Garg be informed that the case would proceed ex parte against her and continued the proceeding to December 19, 2002.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellee also alleged that \u201che pursued all legal notices ordered by the Indian court,\u201d and Ms. Garg was served in Baltimore with the ex parte order and documents from the Indore court on February 25, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In addition, appellee attached a copy of a letter dated April 6, 2002, from the child\u2019s Indian school, stating that appellant had removed Chaitanya from the school on March 22, 2002. He also appended a copy of a letter dated April 12, 2002, from appellant to Chaitanya\u2019s school in Indore, in which appellant stated that she took her son to Mumbai \u201cin an emergency\u201d and that she planned to \u201creturn back to Indore soon; but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>fell sick.\u201d In the letter, appellant also asked the school to issue a \u201cschool leaving certificate.\u201d Appellant enclosed a \u201cmedical certificate\u201d with the letter, signed by Dr. Bharat Shah, stating that Chaitanya \u201cwas suffering from fever, gastro-enteritis, [and] dehydration since\u201d March 26, 2002. Appellee alleged: \u201cUpon information and belief, at some point thereafter, Ms. Garg removed the child from India and Mr. Garg then spent months looking for the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In view of the custody proceedings pending in India, and appellant\u2019s \u201cwrongful removal and wrongful retention of [the] child ... in this state,\u201d appellee urged the court to dismiss Ms. Garg\u2019s action pursuant to the UCCJA. He argued that appellant could not \u201cassert jurisdiction in Maryland because she has already appeared in Indian court, was represented by counsel there and is in the middle of custody litigation in that forum.\u201d Appellee insisted that India was the more appropriate venue because it was Chaitanya\u2019s \u201chome state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In addition, appellee maintained that, \u201cbecause of the Indian court\u2019s insistence on substantive and procedural due process and notice to Ms. Garg and because Ms. Garg abducted the child during the pendency of the proceedings, there is no existing decree in India.\u201d Under \u00a7 9-208(a) of the UCCJA, however, he asserted that the circuit court was permitted to decline jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Among other things, appellee requested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADT\">b. an Order directing that courts of the sovereign nation of India have exclusive personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties and the child and that Mr. Garg not be impeded from repatriating the child to India; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">d. an Order directing Ms. Garg to pay Mr. Garg\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees;----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>On April 28, 2003, appellant filed a request for an emergency custody hearing and a motion to strike appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. She asserted \u201cthat there is an emergency because Mr. Garg has a history of violence against Ms. Garg and Chaitanya.\u201d Further, appellant averred that appellee had been \u201cserved with process on March 7, 2003,\u201d in East Hartford, Connecticut, where he \u201cmaintains an address\u201d to receive \u201ctax and brokerage statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Significantly, appellant agreed with appellee that she received a \u201cSummons from Family Court, Indore, India with intimation of ex-parte order and notice on next hearing date\u201d on February 25, 2003. However, she maintained that this date was one day after she filed her complaint in the circuit court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, appellant alleged that appellee \u201cabandoned\u201d her on March 21, 2002. She also claimed that, on March 28, 2002, she and Chaitanya traveled from Indore to Mumbai, and she then filed an action against appellee on April 1, 2002, seeking \u201cmaintenance\u201d for herself and Chaitanya. However, she was unable to serve the \u201c[sjummons\u201d on Mr. Garg.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">According to appellant, she took steps to leave India beginning on April 1, 2002 (i.e., before appellee filed his custody case in India), when she sent an e-mail to the United States consulate \u201crequesting help.\u201d Appellant visited the consulate on April 21, 2002, and received a duplicate United States passport on May 8, 2002. Several weeks later, she obtained for Chaitanya a \u201cduplicate copy of Permanent Residents Card (Green Card) from the U.S. Consulate.\u201d Claiming that, at the time she left India, \u201cshe was not under any legal compulsion to remain in India or to relinquish custody of Chaitanya,\u201d appellant \u201cvehemently object[ed] to Mr. Garg\u2019s characterization of her escape to safety as an attempt to forum shop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Appellant attached as an exhibit a \u201cCertificate\u201d from her attorney in India, V.K. Gangwal, dated April 23, 2003. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>stated: \u201c[I]n April 2002 Mrs. Deepa Garg had contacted me at Phone for my professional help in the matter of her having been deserted by her husband on 21/3/2002.... \u201d Mr. Gangwal indicated that, on April 1, 2002, appellant filed a maintenance action against appellee \u201cunder the Criminal Procedure Code Section 125 in the family court at Mumbai....\u201d According to Gangwal, because appellee had not received a summons in that action, the case had not \u201cstarted.\u201d Notably, he represented that appellant left India in May 2002, without knowledge of appellee\u2019s pending custody action in India.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Therefore, appellant urged the court to assume \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over the parties and the child, on the ground that \u201cMaryland is Chaitanya\u2019s home state and ... the most convenient forum to litigate this dispute.\u201d She insisted that the court was entitled to decide whether it had jurisdiction, given the strong evidence that it could be physically and emotionally harmful to the child to surrender him to appellee. In support of her argument that Maryland is Chaitanya\u2019s home state, appellant reiterated that Chaitanya is a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The docket reflects that on April 28, 2003, the same date that appellant filed that motion, the request was denied by \u201cJGT.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, on May 2, 2003, appellant filed a Motion to Appoint Counsel for Minor Child. Citing F.L. \u00a7 1-202, she expressed concern for the child\u2019s \u201chealth, safety and welfare.\u201d Appellee opposed that motion, arguing that, in view of the conflicting motions concerning jurisdiction, \u201cit would be premature ... for this Court to consider the appointment of counsel for the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">On May 6, 2003, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-322(a)(4), appellee moved to dismiss appellant\u2019s action \u201cin its entirety for insufficiency of service of process.\u201d Claiming that he has never resided in Connecticut or Maryland, appellee argued that service of process was improper under both Maryland and Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Shortly thereafter, appellee filed an opposition to appellant\u2019s motion to strike his motion to dismiss, reiterating that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because the Indian court had already assumed jurisdiction. According to appellee, because appellant was represented by counsel in the Indian court, she could not attempt to evade jurisdiction in India by bringing an action in Maryland. Appellee asserted that India was Chaitanya\u2019s home state, and appellant could not \u201ccreate home state jurisdiction through her own illegal actions,\u201d such as \u201cabduct[ing]\u201d the child from India and bringing him to Maryland. In his view, the Indian court was a more appropriate forum to hear the parties\u2019 disputes, because \u201call of the substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present and future care, protection, training and personal relationships is more readily available in India than in Maryland.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Mr. Garg also alleged that appellant was aware of pending custody proceedings in India when she filed her complaint in Maryland. He claimed that she initiated suit in Maryland \u201cwhen she realized that her concealment of the child in this State had been discovered.\u201d Further, he alleged that appellant fabricated \u201callegations of abandonment, neglect or abuse ... to usurp the proper jurisdiction of the Indian court and conceal her own illegal actions before this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">On June 17, 2003, appellant filed \u201cPlaintiffs Opposition to Defendant Ajay K. Garg\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiffs Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Not Appoint Counsel for Minor Child.\u201d Appellant renewed her request for the appointment of legal counsel for Chaitanya, and reiterated that Maryland is the child\u2019s home state. She also contended that, in an Order of March 21, 2003, \u201cthe Family Court in Indore, India, itself has objected to Mr. Garg\u2019s claimed submission for want of jurisdiction.\u201d In support of appellant\u2019s challenge to the jurisdiction of the Indian court, she submitted a copy of her \u201cApplication of the Defendant [i.e., appellant here] Raising Preliminary Objections on the Maintainability and the Jurisdiction filed on May 21, 2003 in the Family Court, Indore, Guardian Case No. 8/2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>In addition, appellant reiterated that she and the child were abused by appellee, and claimed that she fled India only \u201cafter repeated pleas to relevant authorities went unanswered.\u201d In support of her abuse allegations, appellant submitted affidavits from her parents, Veejay Kumar Govil and Adarsh Govil.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In response to appellee\u2019s claim that appellant had engaged in forum shopping, appellant noted that her action in India was only for \u201cmaintenance,\u201d which \u201cis akin to a living allowance,\u201d while the action in Maryland was for divorce and custody. She characterized appellee\u2019s allegations of improper service as \u201cspurious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On July 7, 2003, the court (Fader, J.) issued a \u201cMemorandum to Assignment\u201d with regard to scheduling a hearing on appellee\u2019s two motions to dismiss (one submitted April 28, 2003, claiming lack of jurisdiction, and one submitted May 6, 2003, claiming improper service of process). The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZj\">First, there is no emergency. This is because Judges Levitz and Turnbull have said there is no emergency though everything both parties have filed cry \u201cemergency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">Second, in the Motion to Dismiss, there are all sorts of allegations of removal from the jurisdiction, concealment of facts, etc. which, in a contested domestic case, must be subject to in-court testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">Third, the Motion to Appoint Counsel for Minor child (5/03/03) just sits until the attorney filing the motion complies with the procedural responsibility to have the matter directed to the Judge of the Family Division assigned to hear these motions regarding appointment of counsel on a rotating basis as the Bar [h]as so been informed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Thereafter, on September 3, 2003, the court (Dugan, J.) issued a \u201cRuling\u201d stating that appellant\u2019s motion to appoint counsel for Chaitanya would \u201cbe held in abeyance by the court until after Judge John F. Fader, II rule[d] on the issue of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The court (Fader, J.) held an evidentiary hearing on September 23, 2003, at which numerous witnesses testified. At the outset of the hearing, the court stated: \u201cWe are here today just on the jurisdiction issue, namely whether or not a court in India should have jurisdiction of this case or whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore County will have jurisdiction of this case.\u201d During the parties\u2019 opening remarks, the court set forth its understanding of the UCCJA as it applied to the case at bar. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">[COURT]: <em>Well, here is my understanding of the law. The Uniform Child Custody Act is applicable not only between states but with regard to foreign countries. Is there any disagreement with that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>There is no disagreement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASC\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">[COURT]: <em>Number 2, the state where the action is first filed is the one that gets to determine first whether it has or it will keep jurisdiction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>That is comet, Your Hon- or, assuming that due process was indeed followed in that state when it was filed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">[COURT]: Let me say this. Number 3, the only time that I can take jurisdiction is number 1, if there is an emergency then without them determining that they will take jurisdiction first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">Now, there is a second exception to that and that second exception is is this a country with laws that parallel those of the State of Maryland? In other words, can that court or will that court be on the same basis with regard to the law or substantially the same law? In other words, we are not going to have much reciprocity with Islamic countries because Maryland says there is no preference for a parent where Islamic law says there is. So we are not going to honor them. We know daggone well they will not honor us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Once again, I state to you my understanding of the law is that India has the right, first of all, to determine whether it shall keep jurisdiction and there are only two exceptions applicable here: Exception Number 1 is an emergency power, is this child in danger because of the fact that there has been abuse by the father or something; or secondly, because the laws of India do not substantially comport with the laws of that State of Maryland so as to allow them to exercise jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">Let me stop there and ask you do either of you have a problem with that? That is the only two exceptions I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj4\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there is also another exception, which may not be an exception.... The home state of this child has been here for over fifteen months, he has established relationships here, and has been registered in school, all the health care records of the child \u2014 the child has spent\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlC\">[COURT]: That is the second step. The first step is that the jurisdiction where it is first filed is the one that determines whether it has and will keep jurisdiction first.... The home state doesn\u2019t come into that at this time because that jurisdiction would be the jurisdiction to decide whether it is the home state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Appellant testified that appellee returned to India in May of 2000. Prior to that time, he worked in Northboro, Massachusetts as a senior research officer for Norton Company.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She claimed that she left India, in part, because she was not allowed to work there, in light of her status as a United States citizen. Ms. Garg also maintained that Mr. Garg \u201crepeatedly\u201d abused and mistreated her and Chaitanya.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Now, can you recall any specific instances of this abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir. Right from the beginning of the marriage from 1991, there was a history of abuse from Mr. Ajay Garg and his parents towards me right after the marriage and it was regarding dowery. And this just kept on escalating. It was there in '91, the abuse was there in '98, the abuse was there in '95 and then my son was born. After my son was born it was in front of my little son. My son was so little, he could hardly speak. But at that time he had to witness all the beatings, the spittings where I was subject to the verbal abuse I was put through and whatever. I was put in such a position that each day I was put down saying that you ought to be a true Hindu wife, stay at home, go nowhere and just be at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">After I got back to India .... for a month or two everything seemed fine, but then things started going wrong. His parents would take fault with everything I and my son did. They wanted us there it seemed but it didn\u2019t show. They lacked emotion towards me; they lacked emotion towards my son....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So there were instances where the child was physically beat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Secondly, you also are saying there were instances where that child was starved on purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir, he was starved on purpose. Suppose if they didn\u2019t like anything I said to them or if they did not agree with me, they know the only thing that could get back to me was through this child of mine. They would starve him. I was in such emotional \u2014 first of all, I am in a foreign country; I did not have access to the money, did not have access to the telephone there. My parents, though they were in India, I could not see them; I was not allowed to. It was a very isolated situation. And my son being with me could not go anywhere. I had to protect my son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>When they knew that my son was my weakness, I would do anything to protect that little boy. That day and every day, they knew anything they did to him, they could get to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Did you report any of this abuse to Indian authorities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">[MS. GARG]: I did, sir, later, but they seem not to care of the fact that I was not an Indian citizen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">With regard to appellee\u2019s \u201cabandonment,\u201d appellant stated: \u201cI was totally in fear of my and our son\u2019s life.... He had threatened to kill both of us. He said, T don\u2019t come back. I have left you, I have dropped you, I don\u2019t want you, you are not my wife.\u2019 And he put us there as if we were like a dirtbag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Appellant also claimed that when Chaitanya wet his bed, appellee \u201cthreatened to burn him the next time he would do that.\u201d Appellant also testified that, on another occasion when Chaitanya wet his bed, appellee \u201ctook a big lock and tied it up with the draw strings [to Chaitanya\u2019s shorts] and [Chaitanya] was so small at that time he couldn\u2019t walk because of the weight of the lock and he came to me and said that daddy has done this.\u201d On cross-examination, appellant admitted that she did not have any police records of domestic complaints in regard to her husband\u2019s alleged abuse, either in the United States or in India.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Appellant testified that she initiated a suit against appellee in Mumbai for maintenance, for which she retained Gangwal, because she \u201cneeded money.\u201d Appellant explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">I was in a foreign country, I had needs to take care of that little child, I had my own needs to take care, I had passport fees, other fees; I had transportation costs. So I filed a suit in Bombay and I retained Mr. Gangwal only to liason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>between the Bombay Court. I thought it would facilitate me getting money in my suit from my husband because he is from Indore too. That is what my understanding was....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">We were both hungry. We had our needs daily. Life had to go on in spite of everything. So I needed money in a foreign country. I had to feed that child. I could not allow him to suffer. I could not see him be 'without his basic needs of food, clothing and shelter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Appellant maintained that she \u201conly became aware\u201d of appellee\u2019s custody suit \u201cwhen [she] was issued an ex parte order on the 25th February [of 2003].... \u201d The Indore court held a hearing on the same day that appellant received notice in the United States, i.e., February 25, 2003. Appellant\u2019s testimony established, however, that by the time she was served on February 25, 2003, it would have been February 26, 2003, in India. In effect, then, appellant received notice <em>after </em>the hearing in India.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Moreover, appellant testified that she notified the circuit court of the pending custody action in India when she learned about it. She referred to a letter from her counsel in India, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">Mrs. Deepa Garg had left India on Indian dates 24/5/2002 [i.e., May 24, 2002] and up to that time there was no case known to Mrs. Deepa Garg filed by Mr. Ajay Garg against her. Later on I learned Mr. Ajay Garg had filed a case number NJY-8-2002 dated in Indian dates 8-4-2002 in Indore District Court, M.P., India against Mrs. Deepa Garg for obtaining the custody of child Chaitanya Garg. Summons is published in newspaper on 9-6-2002 Indian dates. <em>I was unable to contact Mrs. Deepa Garg. I told the Indore M.P. Cornt about no instruction on Indian da,tes 26/8/2002 and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>the Court passed an order to proceed ex parte. I had not been [able to] communicate to Mrs. Deepa Garg because her address was not known to me.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Appellant denied that Gangwal was her attorney in regard to the Indore proceedings in July 2002. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]:.... Now, after April 2002 and after you were in Mumbai, the Indian case had a hearing in July 2002 where you had an attorney representing you, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">[MS. GARG]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Let me show you joint Exhibit Number 1 [a certified copied of Indian court orders] and specifically in the translation, the 11th of July, 2002. Do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: If you go to the 11th of July, 2002, it has \u201cShri Prasanna Bhatnagar for the Plaintiff;\u201d do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-14\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u201cShri Gangwal, Advocate for the Defendants;\u201d do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-15\">[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-16\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Mr. Gangwal is your attorney in India, isn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-17\">[MS. GARG]: I did not tell him. I asked him to liason between the Mumbai Court and since he was from Indore and my husband is from Indore, so I asked him to be a liason between the files in Mumbai and I do not know what advantage he took of that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-18\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: So you are not denying that on July 7th \u2014 July 11th, 2002, Mr. Gangwal appeared on your behalf in the Indian Court in Indore, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>[MS. GARG]: I don\u2019t know what he did, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">The following exchange is also pertinent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Now, last question relates to Joint Exhibit Number 1 [certified copies of Indian court orders] again. You see we are back to July 11, 2002; do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: You will see that there is an argument made by Mr. Gangwal in this court hearing where he says that \u201cit is clear that the minor, Chaitanya, ordinarily resides in Mumbai[,\u201d] do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">[MS. GARG]: I do see that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: If you didn\u2019t have any communication with Mr. Gangwal, how could he possibly know that you were in Mumbai?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">[MS. GARG]: When I was in Mumbai, I told him the case I started in Mumbai and I asked him to act as a liaison. I don\u2019t know what he did from there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">Appellant explained that she was unaware of an \u201congoing custody case\u201d in India when she filed her circuit court case. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-13\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Tell His Honor, please, where in that paragraph [of the Complaint] do you identify for the Court that there is an ongoing custody case in India? [MS. GARG]: There was no ongoing custody case at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. So your testimony, so we are clear, is that you had no knowledge of the proceedings in India started in April 8, 2002 where Mr. Gangwal appeared as your attorney on the 11th of July, 2002, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-15\">[MS. GARG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">Appellant added: \u201cI have rectified the mistake in my later pleadings.... At no point in India did I ask for limited divorce, child custody; the case in Mumbai was for maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Appellee testified that he works for a software company doing \u201cquality assurance.\u201d He acknowledged that, without appellant\u2019s \u201cpermission\u201d or her participation in the decision, he surrendered Chaitanya\u2019s green card in August of 2002 to the U.S. Embassy. When asked about the \u201csignificance\u201d of that decision, he responded that it meant that the \u201cchild does not have immigration status at this time in USA.... [T]he status has been abandoned and he is out of status in this country.\u201d Appellee added: \u201cIn my opinion he is illegally in this country....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Mr. Garg also voluntarily surrendered his \u201cgreen card\u201d to the U.S. Consulate on September 10, 2003.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Previously, he came to the U.S. on January 2, 2003. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: If you were in the United States in general in 2003, having known where your child was, what effort did you make to see your child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">[MR. GARG]: I[am] patiently waiting for the due process of law and the Indian court to give me some sort of order of relief so I can meet my son. And I have taken the law in my hand to initiate any contact with my my son even though it breaks my heart.... It breaks my heart not having seen my son for eighteen months....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Further, appellee described the demise of his marriage and his poor relationship with Ms. Garg\u2019s parents. He denied that he made any dowry demand on Ms. Garg or her family. He also acknowledged that he drove appellant from their family home to her relative\u2019s house, and claimed that he visited with her and Chaitanya at the relative\u2019s home.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>In his portion of the case, Mr. Garg offered additional testimony detailing his frustration with his inability to procure Ms. Garg\u2019s presence at the court proceedings in India. He also described the steps that the Indian court took to provide Ms. Garg with notice of the custody action in that court. Appellee acknowledged, however, that Ms. Garg was not represented by \u201can advocate\u201d at the \u201cinitial\u201d hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Mr. Garg vigorously denied that he ever abused his wife or child. He stated: \u201cI never threatened to burn my son. I love him with all my heart and all my life.\u201d The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: On how many occasions have you threatened to kill your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">[MR. GARG]: Zero.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: How any times have you spat in your wife\u2019s face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">[MR. GARG]: Zero.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: How many times have you locked your child\u2019s pants together with a padlock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">[MR. GARG]: Zero.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Chandra Kumari Krishna Chellappan, an Indian lawyer, testified on behalf of appellant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> She stated that because appellant and appellee are both Hindus, Mr. Garg\u2019s custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>action in the Indian court should have been filed under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956. Ms. Chellappan also opined that appellant did not receive due process in appellee\u2019s custody action in the Indian court, because \u201cthese notice [sic] was not posted at all for the services concerned and it was not filed under the proper act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">With regard to parental preferences under the Hindu Marriage Act, the following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">[COURT]: Ma\u2019am, here is the question. We have in the State of Maryland an equal protection clause. Now, that means by constitutional law there can be not be [sic] when there is a custody dispute any preference for the mother as opposed to the father or father as opposed to the mother. Does India have a law indicating that or is it as the Islamic law, that there is a preference for one parent or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOG\">[MS. CHELLAPPAN]: Here I can just say that act evidently doesn\u2019t say anything. But of course the Hindu Minorities and Guardianship Act, when it is enacted it says that the welfare of the child is the paramount importance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AML\">[COURT]: So it doesn\u2019t matter whether it is tried under the Hindu Act or the Marriage Act, it is the best interests of the child and there is no preference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">[MS. CHELLAPPAN]: No. The preference comes later. When you are taking the welfare of the child, take into consideration in Hindu marriage, the reason I said that is it should be properly filed under Hindu Marriage Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">[COURT]: Let me put it to you this way. If these two people were both living in Virginia and they tried this case before me and I said I\u2019m giving a preference to the mother, the Court of Appeals would reverse me and say you can\u2019t do that. If they would say I\u2019m giving a preference to the father, they would say you can\u2019t do that; is there any preference in Indian law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">[MS. CHELLAPPAN]: No, there is no such thing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcZ\">[COURT]: Is there any preference in Hindu law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">[MS. CHELLAPPAN]: No, there is no such preference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Appellant\u2019s brother, Manind Govil, a Maryland resident, testified that he witnessed appellee abusing Chaitanya by pinching and shaking the child to stop him from crying. Veejay Govil, appellant\u2019s father, testified that he observed appellee abusing appellant \u201con many occasions.\u201d He also stated that appellee frequently called appellant \u201cnaukrani,\u201d which means \u201cslave.\u201d Further, he claimed that he witnessed appellee pinching the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Shashikala Warrier, a licensed attorney in India with a Master\u2019s degree obtained in the United States in the field of international human rights, testified for appellee regarding Indian law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> She stated that she was familiar with the custody action that appellee filed in India. In her view, he properly proceeded under the Guardians and Wards Act. According to Ms. Warrier, the statute has \u201c[n]o paternal preference.... The test is the paramount interest of the child. There is no other preference that is given.\u201d The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">[COURT]: ... Does India Common Law or statutory law as it exists today have any provision for deferring to a religious \u2014 in other words, suppose he would go back to the court and he would say I\u2019m claiming under Hindu law. Does Indian law then say, okay, we defer to Hindu?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[MS. WARRIER]: Not under the Guardians and Wards Act. Well, unless he has proceedings that are totally separate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">[COURT]: But you see, he can dismiss these proceedings and start all over again under the Hindu law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">[MS. WARRIER]: No. Even as it is today, it does not have any preference for the father or the mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">[COURT]: How can you prove that for us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">[MS. WARRIER]: Because we have a whole container of judgments that are not favoring anyone except for the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Ms. Warrier also opined that Indian law provides parties with adequate notice to satisfy due process. Further, she testified that appellant\u2019s known address was \u201cpasted\u201d by the Indian court authorities with a notice of pending custody proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court said: \u201c[T]he issue as far as is there a preference, maternal or paternal, the answer is no. Both experts have testified there is none.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[THE COURT]: Look, the long and short of it is I\u2019m not convinced there has been any abuse. I have looked at this lady and listened to her testimony. She is cool, she is calculating, she makes up her mind what she wants to say when she wants to say it and I believe \u2014 I don\u2019t believe her; I believe that most of the stuff she has made up to get her way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">As far as the father is concerned, there may have been a little pinching. I don\u2019t know what the custom is back in India, but if I catch you while you are in this country pinching that child, you are dead meat. Do you understand that, in American and in Indian?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">[MR. GARG]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The court then \u201cdismissed\u201d the entire case, adding: \u201cAny costs are to be paid by the mother of the child.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">First of all, as I said previously, I am not convinced that there was any abuse of any magnitude except the pinching because I do not accept her testimony or any of her witness\u2019 testimony to that effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">Second, I am convinced, because the witness for the mother and the witness for the father both say there is no maternal or paternal preference under Indian law, whether it be from Indian Common Law or either the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 or the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 pursuant to Maryland\u2019s recognition of Foreign Law Act.... So there doesn\u2019t seem to be that out there to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>cause Maryland to say that the laws of another country are so far against its public policy that we will not enforce them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">Thirdly, the Indian court seems to feel it has jurisdiction. It says that implicitly in its rulings. From what I see, the service aspects comport with due process of this country and, more importantly, an attorney has entered his appearance for her submitting the attorney and her to the jurisdiction of the Indian court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">[Tjhere certainly has been no testimony to overcome that presumption that she has submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the Indian court and has in fact also been properly served there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">Fourth, I am not convinced that there is any neglect or failure by the father to support his child in India or to care for his child in India as has been testified to by the mother of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">Fifth, I hear time and time again that she has overwhelming fear. If she does, she has manufactured that fear herself based upon a base of disappointment with the man she married and the man her father agreed she would marry. Her fear, not based on any other facts other than disappointment, is not something that I can or should consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">Sixth. As to the Uniform Custody Act, which is not only applicable among the states who have co-signed that act but also between the United States of America and I don\u2019t know what the proper term is for the Indian government, the Government of India....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">The evidence is clear that somehow there was problems fsic] in this case while these people were in India over this child so much so that the father files suit on 4-6-02 to have India adjudicate that. India never had a chance to because she spirited that child out of India for no reason. And even though she indicates now that this country is the home state for six months or more and <em>it is true that that child has been a resident of America for longer than six months, her </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>spiriting the child away, her committing a fraud on the Court by removing the child means that that home state preference and designation is not to be given.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">Everything before me indicates that India and their laws and the procedure in the court was at least as good to adjudicate this matter as the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The court subsequently signed an Order on September 29, 2003 (docketed October 1, 2003), dismissing \u201cthe above-captioned case ... for the reasons stated on the transcript attached hereto.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On October 3, 2003, appellee filed a \u201cMotion to Charge [Appellant] for Necessary Expenses and Trial Fees Following Dismissal of Case.\u201d He argued that, under the UCCJA, the court may assess appellant \u201cwith necessary travel and other expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by Mr. Garg or his witnesses.\u201d Appellee claimed travel expenses of $2,114.51, $1,200 in expert witness fees, and $2,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, for a total of $5,314.51. Appellee also attached copies of pertinent receipts and invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">On October 9, 2003, appellant noted an appeal to this Court from the court\u2019s Order of October 1, 2003. On the same day, she filed a Motion to Alter, Amend or Revise Order of Dismissal, seeking to prevent appellee from removing Chaitanya from Maryland during the pendency of her appeal, along with a request for a hearing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Then, on October 16, 2003, appellant responded to appellee\u2019s motion to recover costs and expenses. She argued that, \u201c[e]ven without determining if [appellee\u2019s] application to the court would be governed by statute or case law,\u201d the court should deny the motion because appellee \u201cdid not produce any evidence during the proceedings of the financial status and needs of the parties.\u201d Further, appellant argued: \u201cIt smacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of litigation sandbagging for a party to seek fees and expenses <em>after the fact </em>when the required criteria must be adduced at the evidentiary hearing ... not after the conclusion and following the finality of judgment, especially when the case is on appeal.\u201d Moreover, appellant argued that appellee\u2019s motion \u201cis beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUR\">In response, appellee argued that, in light of the court\u2019s Order dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint, the court should not \u201center any further orders with respect to the child until such time as any Indian custody order is registered for enforcement in this State.\u201d Furthermore, appellee contended: \u201cAny order with respect to the exercise of further jurisdiction by this Court would be contrary to the substance and spirit of this Court\u2019s September 29, 2003 Order and contrary to the intention of the UCCJA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On November 24, 2003, the court (Fader, J.) entered a \u201cMotions Ruling,\u201d in which it denied appellant\u2019s revisory motion, without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Appellee submitted an affidavit on January 9, 2004, attesting to the expenses outlined in his motion of October 3, 2003. On January 22, 2004, appellee\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit attesting to his services and the calculation of his fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Appellant filed another opposition to appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses on January 20, 2004. She asserted that the term \u201cstate,\u201d as it is defined in F.L. \u00a7 1-101 (e), does not include a foreign nation, and asserted that the Maryland UCCJA permits fees \u201cunder any section except Section 9-203, the International Scope of the sub-title.... \u201d Appellant averred: \u201cSince the statutes of UCCJA permitting attorney\u2019s fees, section 9-207(g), 9-208(c) and 9-215(h), apply only when state action is implicated, not that of a nation, none of these apply directly and therefore no attorney\u2019s fees are permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Appellant also maintained that, \u201cunder Family Law Article 9-203, attorney\u2019s fees are permitted ... if there is a proceeding \u2018to the recognition and enforcement of <em>custody decrees </em>\u2014 of \u201cother nations!.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). Because \u201cthere is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u2018custody decree\u2019 in India, the \u2018other nation,\u2019 in this case,\u201d asserted appellant, \u201cthere is no proceeding to recognize or enforce the yustody decree of the other nation.\u201d Moreover, appellant argued: \u201cUnder fee shifting statutes, the load star test [sic] is now required [and] the Movant must prove several items which are lacking in his Motion and, therefore, no award can be made for fees and expenses.\u201d She also argued: \u201cUnder the Family Law Article applicable to custody or visitation, before an award of fees can be made, the financial status of each party has to be determined as well as the reasonableness of maintaining or defending an action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On February 23, 2004, the court (Cox, J.) held a hearing regarding the issue of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees. According to appellee, appellant was incorrect that the UCCJA was inapplicable with regard to attorney\u2019s fees because, under F.L. \u00a7 9-203, the UCCJA was intended to apply to \u201cthe international area.\u201d Appellee also contended that F.L. \u00a7 9-208, on which the court relied, specifically provided for attorney\u2019s fees upon dismissal of a case for lack of jurisdiction under the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Further, appellee argued that <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 (2003), only applied the lodestar analysis to wage and hour law cases, not the UCCJA. Alternatively, he argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">So, assuming the lodestar would apply, and given that the Court has reviewed the transcript, or Judge Fader\u2019s ruling in this case, Your Honor, the Court would be aware that this is a highly complex evidentiary hearing involving two experts who testified, and the parties and counsel and the Court had to understand the intricacies of the Hindu Minority Act and the Guardianship and Wards act of 1890 from India.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">I would submit, Your Honor, seeking fees for the solid day that we were in Court, is appropriate, given the matters that I have set out in my affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Appellant argued that the definition of \u201cstate\u201d in F.L. \u00a7 1-101(e) does not apply to foreign nations. Therefore, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>argued that India cannot be a \u201cstate,\u201d as that term is used in the UCCJA. Further, she claimed that, for purpose of an award of fees, in order for F.L. \u00a7 9-203 to apply, \u201cyou need a custody decree of the appropriate institution of the other nation. Here, there is no decree.\u201d Appellant also suggested that the court could not award a fee under another section of the Family Law Article, such as F.L. \u00a7 12-103(b), because \u201c[t]here was no claim for this. And secondly, there is no evidence of it in the case----even if there were, we have no evidence of financial status of a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Ruling from the bench, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">I\u2019ll start with the fact that Judge Fader specifically mentions costs to be paid by the mother of the child. Whether he means sort of the usual costs versus the costs that were initially pled, it is not totally clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">But I\u2019ll note in the original petition that there was a claim for these specific travel and other necessary expenses litigated here on the \u2014 when the motion to dismiss was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">Judge Fader made the ruling under [F.L. \u00a7 ] 9-208(a), based upon the removal of the child and conduct he described in his memo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">And really, in my mind, the legal issue boils down to whether 9-203, whether that expands the provisions of this statute so that it applies not just to actions between states, or is limited in the way [appellant\u2019s counsel] argues, to actions seeking to recognize or enforce a custody decree of a foreign nation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">Given that, I think that 9-203 allows this Court to allow generally the provisions of the subtitle. I think that the provisions of payment for cost [sic], or assessment of expenses and fees, under 208(c), do apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-14\">Therefore, I will enter a judgment in the amount that is set forth in the petition, because the travel expenses have been documented; and, while they were lengthy, very lengthy and very interesting and complex proceedings that took place in the United States, only the petition for fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>related to the days spent in Court, and I find those to be reasonable, so judgment would be entered for the costs and fees that were pled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">On February 24, 2004, the court issued a \u201cMoney Judgment Order\u201d in the amount of $5,314.51 against appellant, granting appellee\u2019s motion for costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Thereafter, appellant noted a second appeal to this Court from the judgment awarding costs and attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">Appellant, a Maryland resident and a United States citizen, filed an action in circuit court seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a divorce as well as custody of the parties\u2019 son. When appellant filed suit, no divorce proceedings were pending in India.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">At the outset of the hearing on September 23, 2003, the court said: \u201cWe are here today just on the jurisdiction issue, namely whether or not a court in India should have jurisdiction of this case or whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore County will have jurisdiction of this case.\u201d After the court determined that India had jurisdiction of the custody case, the court dismissed appellant\u2019s entire case, including the divorce claim. Quite apart from any dispute as to custody, appellant was entitled to pursue her divorce action in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Because the court erred in dismissing the divorce action, we shall vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings. Upon remand, the court should resolve, <em>inter alia, </em>appellee\u2019s claim that he was not properly served with process.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">We turn to the custody dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">As noted, appellant asked the court to appoint a lawyer to represent Chaitanya\u2019s interests. However, the court failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">F.L. \u00a7 1-202 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u00a7 1-202. Appointment of counsel for minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">In an action in which custody, visitation rights, or the amount of support of a minor child is contested, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">(1) appoint to represent the minor child counsel who may not represent any party to the action....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">In light of the motion for appointment of counsel, the importance of the custody issue, and the recent enactment of the UCCJEA, we shall remand the case to the court for appointment of an attorney for the child. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">The custody issue is a complex one, because the court must determine whether it is to be decided by an Indian court or a Maryland court. Moreover, the custody determination is of paramount importance, because resolution of the dispute will determine whether the child resides in India or the United States. In view of the gravity and complexity of the custody issue, we cannot characterize the hearing as a mere \u201cearly stage\u201d of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">The relevance of the child\u2019s position and the fundamental importance of counsel\u2019s role are underscored by the function of the child\u2019s counsel in an acrimonious custody dispute. To that end, Md.Code, F.L. \u00a7 1-202 authorizes the circuit court to appoint counsel for a child to provide the court with an \u201cindependent analysis\u201d of the child\u2019s position. <em>John O. v. Jane O., </em>90 Md.App. 406, 436, 601 A.2d 149 (1992). Indeed, \u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 1-202 is to afford the court an opportunity to hear from someone who will speak on behalf of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 601 A.2d 149 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The statute thus recognizes that the interests and positions of the parents in these cases are not necessarily congruent with those of the children, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>child is entitled to an advocate who will champion the child\u2019s position. <em>See Levitt v. Levitt, </em>79 Md.App. 394, 403-04, 556 A.2d 1162 (concluding that trial court should have appointed counsel for child in custody modification proceeding, although no party had apparently ever moved for appointment of counsel), <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 549, 560 A.2d 1118 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">To be sure, Chaitanya was not a casual bystander in these proceedings. Yet, without the presence of counsel, his voice was not clearly heard. Through the questioning of witnesses, the introduction of evidence, and argument, a lawyer for the child would have had an important role in regard to the question of whether Maryland was a \u201chome state,\u201d whether the circuit court was required to defer to the court of a foreign nation, whether other provisions of the Family Law Article applied, such as F.L. \u00a7 1-201, the best interests of the child, and the status and nature of the various proceedings in India.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Given that Chaitanya will be profoundly affected by the outcome of the case, fundamental fairness suggests that he should have had a lawyer to articulate his interest and to assist on the critical and complex issues that were determinative of his future. Because Chaitanya\u2019s interests were not represented below, and the outcome of the case will have a colossal impact on his life and that of his parents, we cannot overlook the failure to appoint counsel for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">For the benefit of the court and the parties on remand, we shall address appellant\u2019s claim that the court erred in concluding that the UCCJA (now the UCCJEA) applies to foreign countries under certain circumstances. We discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">At the time the court ruled on the custody claim, the Maryland UCCJA was in effect. However, the UCCJA, F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 9-201 to 9-224, was repealed effective October 1, 2004, i.e., one week <em>after </em>the evidentiary hearing was held in this case on September 23, 2003. It was replaced by Title 9.5 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Family Law Article, the \u201cUniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act\u201d or UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The appellate briefs focus solely on the UCCJA, because that was the statute that was in effect when the custody issue was decided.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, because the UCCJEA will apply on remand, we shall primarily focus on the revised statute. We begin with a review of some of the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Title 9.5, Subtitle 1 pertains to \u201cGeneral Provisions.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 9.5-101 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">\u00a7 9.5-101.

F.L. \u00a7 l-101(e) defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u201cState\u201d to mean \u201c(1) a state, possession, or territory of the United States; (2) the District of Columbia; or (3) the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cThe purpose of the UCCJA is to resolve issues between sister states and not between a state and a foreign nation.\u201d She adds that \u201cthe use of the word state can only mean a state of the United States,\u201d because any other construction would render redundant F.L. \u00a7 9-203, pertaining to \u201cInternational Scope.\u201d Moreover, appellant points out that while a proceeding was pending in India, the foreign. court had not issued an order, judgment, or decree.

He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">This Court should therefore reject Appellant\u2019s argument that the Court reverse course and change its definition of \u201cstate.\u201d To do so would run contrary to the purposes of the UCCJA, as recognized by this Court, and encourage the type of child snatching and forum shopping in which Appellant engaged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Every state enacted the UCCJA in some form. 9 U.L.A. 115 (1988); <em>see also </em>Lara Cardin, Comment, <em>The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction as Applied to Non-signatory Nations: Getting to Square One, </em>20 Hous.

To our knowledge, however, no Maryland appellate case has addressed the issue of whether a foreign nation is considered a state under the UCCJA for purpose of a ease such as this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">To be sure, numerous other states have concluded that the UCCJA applies to international custody disputes. <em>See, e.g., In re Stephanie M., </em>7 Cal.4th 295, 27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706, 713 (1994) (finding California version of UCCJA applies \u201cto international custody disputes\u201d in holding that juvenile court was not required to enforce Mexican decree granting custody to child\u2019s grandmother); <em>Bliss v.

Koons, </em>161 Misc.2d 842, 615 N.Y.S.2d 563, 567 (N.Y.Sup.1994) (\u201cNotwithstanding the language of [the New York version of the UCCJA], which extends the general policies of the UCCJA to the international arena, the specific sections of the UCCJA ... do not apply in an international custody adjudication, because a foreign country is not a \u2018state\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d); <em>In re Horiba, </em>151 Or.App. 489, 950 P.2d 340, 345 (1997) (concluding that \u201cgeneralized policy concerns\u201d cannot alter the explicit definition of \u201cstate\u201d in Oregon\u2019s version of the UCCJA).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Moreover, in their respective UCCJA statutes, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, and South Dakota did not include section 23 of the UCCJA, titled \u201cInternational Application,\u201d which corresponds to F.L. \u00a7 9-203. Cardin, <em>supra, </em>20 Hous. J. Int\u2019l L. at 170 n. 244. Consequently, it seems likely that these states would conclude that the term \u201cstate\u201d does not include a foreign country. <em>See State ex rel. Rashid v. Drumm, </em>824 S.W.2d 497, 503 (Mo.Ct.App.1992) (\u201cSince Missouri has not adopted [the international application provision] of the UC-CJA, it is clear that the legislature did not intend the word \u2018state\u2019 as used in the [jurisdictional provision] to include a foreign country.\u201d); <em>Schroeder v. Vigil-Escalera Perez, </em>76 Ohio Misc.2d 25, 664 N.E.2d 627, 637 (Ct.Com.Pl.1995) (\u201cWhile some states have extended the general policies of the UCCJA to the international arena, Ohio has not promulgated similar provisions in its adoption of the UCCJA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In 1995, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws appointed a drafting committee to revise the UCCJA. Robert G. Spector, <em>International Child Custody Jurisdiction and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, </em>33 N.Y.U.J. Int\u2019l L. &amp; Pol 251 (2000) (\u201cSpector\u201d). The revision, promulgated in 1997, resulted in the UCCJEA. <em>Id. </em>at 257. As we noted, in Maryland the UCCJA was recently replaced by the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">With respect to proceedings in foreign courts under the UCCJA, Spector has stated, <em>id. </em>at 258-59:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">Section 23 of the UCCJA provided that the general policies of the Act applied to foreign custody determinations.1 ] <em>Foreign custody determinations were to be recognized and enforced if they were made consistently with the UCCJA and there was reasonable notice and, opportunity to be heard. </em>There were two types of issues that arose under this section. The first was whether a United States court would defer to a foreign tribunal when that tribunal would have jurisdiction under the UCCJA and the case was filed first in that tribunal. The second issue was whether a state of the United States would recognize, under this section, a custody determination made by a foreign tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHV\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">According to Spector, who was on the drafting committee, \u201cthe UCCJA was ambiguous\u201d as to the matter of deferring to a foreign jurisdiction, and \u201conly required application of the \u2018general policies\u2019 of the Act.\u201d He added, <em>id. </em>at 259:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">Frequently, courts in the United States would apply the same jurisdictional principles to international cases that they would apply in interstate cases.... <em>Most US. states enforced foreign custody orders </em>if made consistently with the jurisdictional standards of the UCCJA and reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard were afforded all participants.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Spector explains that the UCCJEA has resolved the ambiguity about which we are concerned. He states, <em>id. </em>at 260:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Section 105 of the UCCJEA provides that a court of the United States <em>shall treat a foreign country as if it were a state of the United States </em>for the purposes of applying the jurisdiction and cooperation sections of the Act.[ <em>1 </em>It further provides that <em>a court of the United States shall enforce a foreign custody determination </em>if it was made under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional provisions of Article 2 of the UCCJEA.[ ] However, a court need not apply this section if the foreign custody law would violate fundamental principles of human rights.1- ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APZ\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The well honed principles of statutory construction support Spector\u2019s view. The interpretation of a statute, such as the UCCJA or UCCJEA, is a judicial function. <em>See Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt.

Our primary goal in construing a statute is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Consol. Constr. Services, Inc. v.

State, </em>356 Md. 622, 628, 741 A.2d 1088 (1999); <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996).

State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128 (1998). If the statute is free of ambiguity, we generally will not look beyond the statute to determine legislative intent. <em>Kaczorowski v.

On the other hand,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>where a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment. In such circumstances, the court, in seeking to ascertain legislative intent, may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em>Tucker v.

Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. 514, 551, 814 A.2d 469 (2002). But, we may not read a meaning into the statute that is not expressly stated or clearly implied, or embellish a statute to expand its meaning. <em>Dep\u2019t of Econ. &amp; Employment Dev. v.

Put another way, courts may \u201c \u2018not invade the function of the legislature\u2019 by reading missing language into a statute\u201d to correct \u201c \u2018an omission in the language of the statute even though it appeared to be the obvious result of inadvertence.\u2019\u201d <em>Graves v.

State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981) (stating that presumption that the Legislature agrees with the Court of Appeals\u2019s interpretation of statute \u201cis particularly strong whenever, after statutory language has been interpreted by this Court, the Legislature re-enacts the statute without changing in substance the language at issue\u201d); <em>Hoffman v. Key Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc., </em>286 Md. 28, 37, 416 A.2d 1265 (1979) (explaining that \u201crecodification of statutes is presumed to be for the purpose of clarity rather than change of meaning and, thus, even a change in the phraseology of a statute by codification will not ordinarily modify the law unless the change is so radical and material that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law appears unmistakably from the language of the Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">With these principles in mind, we believe the plain meaning of the UCCJEA makes clear that the term \u201cstate\u201d applies to foreign nations, so long as the foreign custody law does not offend our public policy. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that India is deemed a state for purposes of this custody case, so long as its child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>custody law does not violate \u201cfundamental principles of human rights.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 9.5 \u2014 104(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">For the benefit of the parties and the court on remand, we shall also briefly address the matter of a child\u2019s \u201chome state.\u201d Under the prior statute, \u201cThere are four bases for jurisdiction ....: (1) home state, (2) significant connections, (3) abandoned children or emergency situation and (4) other state jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Malik v. Malik, </em>99 Md.App. 521, 525-26, 638 A.2d 1184 (1994), <em>appeal after remand, Hosain v. Malik, </em>108 Md.App. 284, 671 A.2d 988 (1996); F.L. \u00a7 9-204. We discern no change under the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The UCCJA (F.L. \u00a7 9-204(a)(l)(i)) and the UCCJEA (F.L. \u00a7 9.5-101(h)) define \u201chome state,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>as the state in which the child lived \u201cfor at least 6 consecutive months.... \u201d When appellant filed for custody, the child had been living in Maryland for six months. Therefore, the court below was clearly erroneous to the extent that it found that Maryland was not a home state of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In this regard, <em>Malik, </em>99 Md.App. 521, 638 A.2d 1184, is instructive. In that case, we considered whether the circuit court properly denied comity to a Pakistani custody order. The mother (appellee) took the parties\u2019 child with her when she left the marital home in Pakistan. The father (appellant) then filed suit in Pakistan to obtain custody. After appellee learned of the suit, she fled with the child to this country. Shortly thereafter, she moved into the home of another man and continued to live with him. She gave birth to his son in 1991. <em>Id., </em>at 524, 638 A.2d 1184. Although the mother was represented by counsel in the Pakistani custody proceeding, she refused to appear or to produce the child, as ordered. The Pakistani court awarded custody to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">After appellant obtained legal custody of the couples\u2019 daughter, he \u201cset out to find her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the father located the child and appellee in Baltimore County, the mother filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, requesting custody of the child. At the conclusion of an emergency hearing, the trial judge determined that the circuit court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>jurisdiction to determine custody; that the Pakistani custody order was not entitled to comity; and that temporary custody should be granted to the mother. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Of import here, we were \u201cpersuaded that the Circuit Court for Baltimore County does have home state jurisdiction over this dispute,\u201d within the meaning of F.L. \u00a7 9 \u2014 201(f). <em>Id. </em>at 525, 638 A.2d 1184. We said, <em>id. </em>at 528-29, 638 A.2d 1184:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201cHome state\u201d as defined in FL \u00a7 9-201(f) \u201cmeans the state in which the child, immediately preceding the time involved, lived with the child\u2019s parents (or) a parent ... for at least six consecutive months.\u201d As the child has lived in Maryland for the past two years, Maryland qualifies as her \u201chome state\u201d under the U.C.C.J.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">In <em>Mainster v. </em>Mainster, 466 So.2d 1228 (Fla.App. 2 Dist.1985), a child who had been living with her mother in Florida was removed to Virginia by her father and remained in Virginia for almost a year before her mother took her back to Florida. On the day the child was taken from Virginia, her father filed an emergency petition for temporary custody in a Virginia state court. He was awarded custody and attempted to enforce the award in Florida. A Florida trial court dismissed his petition because the child had been kidnapped to Virginia. The appellate court reversed, explaining that the Virginia court did have home state jurisdiction to grant custody because \u201cregardless of the circumstances under which [the child] had been taken to live in Virginia, she had lived there for the requisite six months preceding the father\u2019s filing his action.\u201d 466 So.2d at 1229.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\n<em>We hold that Maryland has home state jurisdiction under the statute because the child has lived here for longer than the requisite six months.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Also of note, we determined that the child could simultaneously maintain \u201chome state\u201d jurisdiction in both Pakistan and Maryland. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The \u201chome state\u201d provision of the U.C.C.J.A. was introduced to provide protection for a parent who remains in the home state after the other parent has taken the child away. In enacting that provision, the drafters of the act were attempting to mitigate the advantage enjoyed by the party who has physical possession of the child. Jeff Atkinson, Modern Child Custody Practice \u00a7 3.12, 192 (1986). The Commissioners\u2019 Note to the U.C.C.J.A \u00a7 3 states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">The main objective [of the six month home state window] is to protect a parent who has been left by his spouse taking the child along. The provision makes clear that the stay at home parent ... may start proceedings in his own state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">Nothing in the U.C.C.J.A. provides that there can only be one \u201chome state.\u201d In this case, there are two. Appellant sued for custody in Pakistan shortly after appellee vacated the marital home. While the Pakistani court had jurisdiction to do so, it conducted a full trial on the merits before awarding custody to appellant. Pakistan was the child\u2019s original \u201chome state.\u201d <em>Maryland has become the child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d only because appellee, in disobedience of the Pakistani court, hid the child from appellant for over two years.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 529-30, 638 A.2d 1184 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, we cautioned: \u201cRare are the occasions on which a second home state should exercise jurisdiction acquired by disobedience of a custody order issued in the child\u2019s original home state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 638 A.2d 1184.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Our consideration of the parties\u2019 ties to Maryland and Pakistan was central to our decision. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">The parties to this case were married in Pakistan. They are both citizens of that country. The minor child was born and raised there until she was wrongfully removed. When appellant originally filed for custody, Pakistan was the only home the child had ever known. Under these circumstances, the assumption of jurisdiction by a Maryland Court would appear to offend the controlling principles behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>U.C.C.J.A. Absent the most extraordinary circumstances, <em>a party should not be permitted to obtain relief from a Maryland court by acting until unclean hands in violation of another court\u2019s order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 525, 638 A.2d 1184 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In holding that the circuit court was required to decline jurisdiction over the child custody matter <em>unless </em>it was persuaded that the Pakistani court failed to apply the best interest of the child standard in awarding custody to the father, this Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 534-35, 638 A.2d 1184:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8Q\">If the Pakistani court\u2019s custody order was founded on principles of law that are repugnant to Maryland public policy, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County must exercise its jurisdiction. If the Pakistani court\u2019s determination was made without giving primary consideration to the best interest of the child, the circuit court must resolve this dispute by applying that standard. If the Pakistani court\u2019s determination was made on the basis of a rule of law or evidence or procedure so contrary to Maryland public policy as to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial, the circuit court must exercise its jurisdiction and resolve this dispute by applying Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We concluded that we could not uphold \u201cthe circuit court\u2019s refusal to grant comity to the Pakistani custody order,\u201d and remanded \u201cfor further proceedings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 525, 638 A.2d 1184, with the following direction, <em>id. </em>at 536, 638 A.2d 1184:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">On remand, the circuit court must first determine whether the Pakistani court applied law that is in substantial conformity with Maryland law. That determination requires the presentation of evidence.... The Pakistani court\u2019s custody order is presumed to be correct, and this presumption shifts to appellee the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that (1) the Pakistani court did not apply the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard, or that (2) in making its decision, the Pakistani court applied a rule of law or evidence or procedure so contrary to Maryland public policy as to undermine confidence in the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the trial. If either (1) or (2) is proven, the circuit court must conclude that the law of Pakistan is so lacking in conformity with the law of Maryland that comity cannot be granted to the Pakistani custody order. Unless either is proven, however, the Circuit Court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction and shall grant comity to the Pakistani custody decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>See also Telnikoff v. Matusevitch, </em>347 Md. 561, 574, 702 A.2d 230 (1997) (citing <em>Malik </em>and stating that \u201c[ajlthough foreign judgments are entitled to a degree of deference and respect under the doctrine of comity, courts will nonetheless deny recognition and enforcement to those foreign judgments which are inconsistent with the public policies of the forum state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">As we noted, <em>Malik </em>makes clear that, even if a child is improperly removed to Maryland, in violation of a court order, Maryland may still become a \u201chome state.\u201d In other important respects, however, <em>Malik </em>is readily distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Malik, </em>the parents and the child were all citizens of Pakistan. Here, the mother is a United States citizen, and she claims that the child is as well.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Further, in <em>Malik </em>the Pakistani court had issued an order on the merits, awarding custody to the father. At the time this matter was heard, however, the Indian court had not issued an order granting custody to appellee, nor had appellant violated a court order when she left India with the child. Indeed, it is not entirely clear that the Indian court had personal jurisdiction over appellant until well after she filed the custody case here. Furthermore, unlike in this case, the child in <em>Malik </em>never had contact with this country prior to the mother\u2019s relocation to this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">We have found no support in the UCCJA for the court\u2019s determination that home state jurisdiction is lost when a child has been impermissibly removed from one jurisdiction to another. As this Court explained in <em>Malik, </em>despite a parent\u2019s improper removal of a child from a foreign country to Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>land, this State may nonetheless serve as the child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d under the UCCJA.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We observe that F.L. \u00a7 9.5-204(d) and \u00a7 9.5-206(b)(2) obligate the court to communicate with the court of a state in which a custody proceeding is already pending. In this respect, on remand, the court must comply with the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">At the fee hearing on February 23, 2004, Judge Cox entertained argument regarding appellant\u2019s contention that fees should not be awarded because of the inapplicability of the UCCJA. Ultimately, Judge Cox determined that Judge Fad-er\u2019s ruling on September 23, 2003, was made under F.L. \u00a7 9-208, and she found that the provision conferred discretion on the court to assess fees and costs. Therefore, Judge Cox determined that she would \u201center a judgment in the amount that is set forth in the petition,\u201d because the fees were \u201creasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Appellant complains, inter\u2022 <em>alia, </em>that the court erred in awarding legal fees and other costs to appellee, because foreign nations are not states under the UCCJA. Therefore, says appellant, the UCCJA provisions awarding fees are not applicable. For the reasons advanced previously, we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The sole purpose of the hearing on February 23, 2004, was to determine the <em>amount </em>of the award for expenses and fees, pursuant to the court\u2019s ruling on September 23, 2003. Even assuming, as appellee claims, that appellant waived her right to challenge the entitlement to fees and costs under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>UCCJA, she certainly did not forego her right to attack the legitimacy or reasonableness of the fee petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In view of our decision to remand, however, we shall vacate the award of fees and costs, pending the outcome of the custody case. If the court determines that an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is appropriate under the UCCJEA, it should determine whether a lodestar analysis applies in light of <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 (2003), and <em>Manor Country Club v. Flaa, </em>387 Md. 297, 300, 874 A.2d 1020 (2005) (concluding that, \u201cwhen attorney\u2019s fees are permitted by statute or ordinance, the lodestar approach to the calculation of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is generally the correct approach, <em>except </em>in instances where other criteria for the calculation of such fees are provided ... in the fee-shifting statute\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY VACATED.
