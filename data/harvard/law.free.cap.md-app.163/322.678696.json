MOYLAN, JR., Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A0e\">(retired, specially assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">The appellant, Damont Isaiah Giddins, went on trial on July 6, 2004, before a Worcester County jury for the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. In the course of the direct examination of the State\u2019s first witness, the trial judge granted the appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">On July 8, the State requested that the case be docketed for retrial. On July 23, the appellant interposed the plea in bar of double jeopardy. Argument was held on the appellant\u2019s dou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ble jeopardy plea before Judge Thomas C. Groton, III, on September 13. On September 16, Judge Groton issued an Opinion and Order, denying the double jeopardy plea. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Setting the Doctrinal Stage</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As we affirm Judge Groton, answering the appellant\u2019s single contention is easy. What is more problematic is putting the question itself into an intelligible context. We are dealing with an esoteric nuance of double jeopardy law. What we said, as we examined very thoroughly this same nuance a quarter of a century ago in <em>West v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 624, 625, 451 A.2d 1228 (1982), is equally pertinent as we take up the present appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">We are here called upon to explore a secluded but exotic corner of the double jeopardy <em>garden </em>\u2014 prosecutorial <em>and judicial overreaching. </em>In life, it <em>is seldom seen except as an imagined possibility in the most painstakingly thorough of footnotes. </em>As a contention, however, it is in luxuriant vogue and is being resorted to promiscuously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">There are layers of double jeopardy law that must be peeled away before we can get to the arcane little problem of the permissibility of a retrial following the declaration of a mistrial at the request of a defendant. An initial hurdle is that there are four widely divergent forms of double jeopardy law and that what is before us is the rarest and most recently evolved of these. In <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 722, 725, 626 A.2d 1037 (1993), we looked initially at the larger genus.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">When dealing with a generic category or <em>portmanteau </em>phenomenon such as double jeopardy, <em>it is indispensable </em>at the outset <em>to identify the particular species of double jeopardy being invoked. </em>There are no less than four such species within the genus \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d Each carries with it a different history; each serves a different purpose; each has different implementing rules. <em>The broad umbrella term we call \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d </em>today <em>embraces </em>(in its federal manifestation) four distinct species: 1) classic for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>mer jeopardy, arising out of the common law pleas at bar of <em>autrefois convict </em>and <em>autrefois acquit; </em>2) simultaneous jeopardy, involving largely issues of merger and multiple punishment and lying on the at-times blurred boundary between constitutional law and statutory construction; 3) <em>the problem of retrial following mistrial; </em>and 4) collateral estoppel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Tabbs v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 20, 21, 403 A.2d 796 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Zooming in more closely, the particular species of the larger genus that is before us is that of retrial following mistrial. This species was brought into the double jeopardy fold late in the day in an essentially haphazard way. In a scholarly dissenting opinion in <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 40-53, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978), Justice Powell traced perceptively the history of what had once been \u201ca separate rule of English practice,\u201d 437 U.S. at 41, 98 S.Ct. 2156, through its \u201crather unreflective incorporation ... into the guarantee against double jeopardy.\u201d 437 U.S. at 46, 98 S.Ct. 2156. Justice Powell attributed this aspect of English practice to Lord Coke and demonstrated that \u201cthis rule arose as an aspect of jury practice, rather than as an element of the guarantee against double jeopardy.\u201d 437 U.S. at 41, 98 S.Ct. 2156. He cited the leading English cases and reported that they had \u201crefused to import the rule into the realm of pleas in bar, and it was the latter which informed the framing of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d 437 U.S. at 43, 98 S.Ct. 2156. Justice Powell also pointed out how the seminal decision of <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824), wherein the Supreme Court first employed Lord Coke\u2019s rule of English practice, did not remotely suggest that the procedural protection was based upon any double jeopardy consideration. He characterized <em>\u201cPerez </em>as [an] independent rule barring needless discharges.\u201d <em>Crist, </em>437 U.S. at 44, 98 S.Ct. 2156.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">In searching for the source of the uncritical doctrinal leap, Justice Powell showed how some American state courts during the 19th century placed Lord Coke\u2019s rule \u201cunder the rubric of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d but that they did so \u201cwith no apparent awareness of the novelty of their action.\u201d <em>Crist, </em>437 U.S. at 46, 98 S.Ct. 2156. After tracing this \u201cunreflective incorporation of a common-law rule of jury practice into the guarantee against double jeopardy\u201d in the state courts, <em>id., </em>Justice Powell pinpointed 1949 as the moment the Supreme Court fell into the same unthinking error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">It was after more than a century of development in state courts that the \u2018defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal\u2019 appeared in the decisions of this Court for the first time, also without analysis, as an element of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Crist, </em>437 U.S. at 47, 98 S.Ct. 2156. Justice Powell observed that the Supreme Court did this \u201calmost without articulated thought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>West v. State, </em>52 Md.App. at 628, 451 A.2d 1228 (\u201c[This] expansion of double jeopardy law occurred late in the evolution of that law and occurred largely subconsciously, as an historic accident.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 727, 626 A.2d 1037, this Court appraised what Justice Powell had shown to be the Supreme Court\u2019s 1949 mistake and the danger of confusion flowing from it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">For better or for worse, it is done. \u201cThe moving finger writes and, having writ, moves on.\u201d However shadowy its constitutional pedigree may be, Lord Coke\u2019s rule dealing with retrials following mistrials is now inextricably ensconced in the federal family of protections known generically as \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d <em>It 'will nonetheless be prudent not to intone too readily generalized pronouncements about double jeopardy law but to remember carefully that many of the incidents of this discrete branch of it are unique to this species alone.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Initial Jeopardy As the Sine Qua Non of Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">A tell-tale characteristic of just how unique the mistrial/retrial variety of double jeopardy actually is can be found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>its total nondependence on the traditional double jeopardy concept that initial jeopardy only attaches with the actual rendering of a verdict. There cannot, by definition, be second or double jeopardy until there has been first or initial jeopardy. See <em>West v. State, </em>52 Md.App. at 626, 451 A.2d 1228 (\u201cBefore we can even consider double jeopardy, we must first establish single jeopardy.\u201d). At the common law, there was no jeopardy until the moment that a verdict was rendered. In <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 727-28, 626 A.2d 1037, we explained how the other three varieties of double jeopardy are still only triggered by the rendering of a verdict and the resulting attachment of initial jeopardy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\"><em>In classic double jeopardy law, the triggering event of jeopardy occurred only as a verdict was rendered. </em>Only then had the historic event taken place which could support a plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>or <em>autrefois convict. </em>The plea in bar to a second or subsequent jeopardy was, by definition, contingent upon the happening of the earlier jeopardy, to wit, the rendering of the earlier verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">In what is now the second species of double jeopardy law, that prohibiting multiple punishment for the same offense in the context of simultaneous jeopardies, <em>the danger of multiple punishment does not arise, even </em>potentially, <em>until the rendering of the verdicts </em>and does not arise, actually, until the imposition of sentence. <em>There is no possibility of merging convictions for lesser included offenses into convictions for greater included offenses until verdicts of conviction have been rendered.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">In the case of the fourth species of double jeopardy law, collateral estoppel, <em>the very issue of estoppel cannot arise until there has been a verdict on the ultimate merits necessarily litigating a particular issue of fact. That necessary finding of fact manifested by a verdict is the estopping instrumentality. </em>Until that moment, there is no predicate for collateral estoppel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">It is still the firm position of the common law, both in England and in Maryland, that jeopardy only attaches with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the rendering of a verdict. <em>Queen v. Charlesworth, </em>1 B. &amp; S. 460, 500, 121 ER 786, 801 (QB 1861); <em>Winsor v. Queen, </em>LR 1 QB 289, 390 (1866); <em>Hoffman v. State, </em>20 Md. 425, 433-34 (1863); <em>State v. Shields, </em>49 Md. 301, 303-04 (1878); <em>Gilpin v. State, </em>142 Md. 464, 121 A. 354 (1923). It is for this reason that mistrial/retrial law, albeit now a part of the federal constitutional law of double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment, has never been included within the coverage of the Maryland common law of double jeopardy. As Judge Eldridge stated for the Court of Appeals in <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 316 n. 2, 322 A.2d 880 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">The view <em>in this state </em>was that, under the common law\u2019s double jeopardy prohibition, <em>jeopardy did not attach until the rendition of a verdict </em>and that, therefore, <em>a retrial following the declaration of a mistrial did not give rise to a double jeopardy problem.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Kyle v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 159, 250 A.2d 314 (1969); <em>Boone v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 11, 23-25, 237 A.2d 787 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The declaration of a mistrial, of course, occurs before the jury has rendered its verdict. Under the Maryland common law of double jeopardy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> such a mistrial could not (and still cannot) trigger a double jeopardy issue. There never having been initial jeopardy in Maryland, a retrial cannot represent double jeopardy. Once <em>Wade v. Hunter, supra, </em>uncritically treated mistrial/retrial law as an aspect of double jeopardy, therefore, it became logically compelling to move the attachment of jeopardy back to an earlier stage. That aberra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tional relocation of initial jeopardy was a federal phenomenon alone and has nothing to do with Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">It is, however, now the unquestioned federal law, and the controlling law in the present case, that the magic moment when jeopardy begins is the instant in which the jury is sworn. <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 U.S. at 37-38, 98 S.Ct. 2156.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case, Fifth Amendment jeopardy had attached when the trial judge declared the mistrial. The issue before Judge Groton, therefore, was legitimately one of constitutional double jeopardy. However questionable its pedigree, the mistrial/retrial issue is properly before us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Marching to a Different Drum</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In yet another respect has mistrial/retrial law been a unique member, indeed a foundling, within the double jeopardy family. It serves a different purpose than those served by its latter-day siblings. <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), is the standard statement of the multiple purposes served by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">That guarantee has been said to consist of three separate constitutional protections. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">That is an articulate statement of the purposes served by the former jeopardy species of double jeopardy law, with respect to both its former acquittal subdivision and its former conviction subdivision. The third of <em>North Carolina v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Pearce\u2019s </em>stated purposes also well expresses the end served, both in a sequential jeopardy setting and a simultaneous jeopardy setting, when we carefully parse the elements of two or more nonidentical offenses, after conviction and before sentencing, to make certain that we do not subject a convicted defendant to multiple punishments for the \u201csame offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">That statement of purpose from <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>and its regular incantation in virtually every double jeopardy case that has followed, has nothing remotely to do with the very different purpose served by mistrial/retrial law. In <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 731, 626 A.2d 1037, we examined the origin and the very different purpose of mistrial/retrial law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">The purpose of the mistrial/retrial species of double jeopardy law is certainly not to preserve the finality of an acquittal or a conviction because there is no acquittal or conviction to be afforded finality. Nor is it the purpose of this species of the law to avoid multiple punishment for it applies with full vigor to the trial of a single count of a single indictment. <em>The full flowering of the purpose of this rule of English practice was a reaction to the excesses of prosecution-minded Royalist judges, </em>such as the legendary \u201cBloody Jeffreys,\u201d during the period of the \u201cBloody Assizes,\u201d as the Crown relentlessly pursued the rebels involved in the ill-fated Duke of Monmouth\u2019s Rebellion. <em>The particular excess to be guarded against was the tendency of the Crown, acting either through the prosecutor or the judge or both, to sabotage a trial that was going badly for the Crown so the prosecuticm could regroup and live to fight another day.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Justice Stevens explained, in <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 507-08, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), the historic abuse to which the law was a reaction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">[Tjhere was a time when English judges served the Stuart Monarchs by exercising a power to discharge a jury whenever it appeared that the Crown\u2019s evidence would be insufficient to convict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The original problem, ironically, had been not so much prosecutorial overreaching as it was judicial overreaching. See Friedland, <em>Double Jeopardy, </em>13-14, 21-25 (1969); Sigler, <em>Double Jeopardy, </em>87 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The evil represented by a mistrial 1) requested by the prosecutor or 2) declared, <em>sua sponte, </em>by the judge is that it takes away from the defendant the decision of whether to let the trial go forward. Even in the face of reversible error, the defendant, for a variety of reasons, may wish to go forward. It is the protection of this right to keep the tribunal together that is at the very heart of mistrial/retrial law. In <em>West v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. at 637, 451 A.2d 1228, we explained how, even in the face of reversible error, this is a valuable right.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">Even after error has been injected into a case, <em>a defendant may prefer </em>not to abort the trial, but <em>to wait and see whether he may not achieve an acquittal even in the teeth of prejudicial error. An appeal is still available if the gamble fails. </em>The defendant still maintains control. <em>A skillful, </em>counterpunching defense <em>tactician may, </em>moreover, <em>turn flagrant prosecutorial misconduct to his advantage and wrest from an outraged jury an acquittal precisely because of that misconduct. </em>There is a significant defense interest in keeping the trial upon the tracks quite apart from the interest in receiving a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 484-85, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971), the Supreme Court explained the advantages of being able to keep a tribunal, once empaneled, together to the sweet or bitter end.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">[T]he crucial difference between reprosecution after appeal by the defendant and reprosecution after a <em>sua sponte </em>judicial mistrial declaration is that <em>in the first situation the defendant has not been deprived of his option to go to the first jury and, perhaps, end the dispute then and there with an acquittal. </em>On the other hand, where the judge, acting without the defendant\u2019s consent, aborts the proceeding, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>defendant has been deprived of his \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">If that right to go to a particular tribunal is valued, it is because, independent of the threat of bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor, <em>the defendant has a significant interest in the decision whether or not to take the case from the jury </em>when circumstances occur which might be thought to warrant a declaration of mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">It is precisely because of this energizing purpose of mistrial/retrial law \u2014 the purpose of keeping the decision of whether to abort the trial in the control of the defendant, even in the face of error \u2014 that a pivotal question is always that of: \u201cWho asked for the mistrial?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Who Asked for the Mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The key to the analysis of any mistrial/retrial problem must begin with the critical question, \u201cWho asked for the mistrial?\u201d As we round up the usual suspects, there are only three \u2014 the prosecuting attorney, the defense attorney, and the trial judge. Because the energizing purpose of mistrial/retrial law is to protect a defendant\u2019s right to have the trial completed by the tribunal that was originally empaneled to try him, the traditional villains have always been 1) the prosecutor who requests the mistrial and 2) the judge who, <em>sua sponte, </em>declares a mistrial. Most of mistrial/retrial law concerns situations wherein the mistrial has been sought by the prosecutor or declared, <em>sua sponte, </em>by the judge, with the critical inquiry being whether there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the resulting mistrial. <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 733-34, 626 A.2d 1037, explained this familiar posture of most mistrial/retrial questions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">There are three key players involved in every trial: the judge, the prosecutor, and the defendant (directly or through his agent, the defense attorney). <em>In terms of the Machiavellian employment of the mistrial device deliberately to sabotage a trial perceived to be going badly for the prosecution, the historic culprits were the judge and the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>prosecuting attorney. When, </em>therefore, <em>a mistrial is declared, over the objection of the defense, </em>either at the request of the prosecutor or <em>sua sponte </em>by'the judge, the rule provides that <em>no retrial will be permitted unless there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial. </em>When that is the posture of the mistrial analysis, a substantial body of law is available exploring every nuance of what is and what is not \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824); <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949); <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 6 L.Ed.2d 901 (1961); <em>Downum v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 734, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1963); <em>United States v.

Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A Horse of a Different Color</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In a situation wherein, by contrast, the mistrial is requested by the defendant, the analysis is radically different. In <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 672, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982), the Supreme Court highlighted the difference.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">But <em>in the case of a mistrial declared at the behest of the defendant, quite different principles come into play. </em>Here the defendant himself has elected to terminate the proceedings against him, and the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d standard has no place in the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">In <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 607, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976), the Supreme Court had earlier noted, \u201cDifferent considerations obtain, however, when the mistrial has been declared at the defendant\u2019s request.\u201d The <em>Dinitz </em>Court went on to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The distinction between mistrials declared by the court <em>sua sponte </em>and mistrials granted at the defendant\u2019s request or with his consent is wholly consistent with the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">424 U.S. at 608, 96 S.Ct. 1075. See also <em>Lee v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 23, 32-33, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 53 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In <em>West v. State, </em>52 Md.App. at 630-31, 451 A.2d 1228, this Court contrasted the two very different analytic perspectives, depending upon the identity of the moving party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">[T]hose situations appear in two essential postures. The first is where the mistrial has been declared by the judge <em>sua sponte </em>or at the request of the State, either over the objection of the defendant or at least without the explicit acquiescence of the defendant. In those situations, the rule is that if there was a manifest necessity for the mistrial, retrial will not be barred. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824); <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978).

The notion of a limited exemption from that otherwise foreclosing effect of waiver first appeared in several Supreme Court cases as a tender shoot of dicta. A footnote in <em>United States v. Tateo, </em>377 U.S. 463, 468 n. 3, 84 S.Ct. 1587, 12 L.Ed.2d 448 (1964), observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">If there were any intimation in a case that prosecutorial or judicial impropriety justifying a mistrial resulted from a fear that the jury was likely to acquit the accused, different considerations would, of course, obtain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Also by way of dicta, <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971), and <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 607-08, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976), made reference to the earlier footnote in <em>Tateo </em>but elaborated on it to the extent of characterizing the exemption from waiver as something arising out of a defense mistrial request necessitated by \u201cprosecutorial or judicial overreaching.\u201d The phrase was instantly contagious.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Even though there had never been a holding touching on the subject, let alone the reversal of a conviction, the appellate mills were soon glutted with issues of what varieties of judicial or prosecutorial misconduct might constitute \u201coverreaching.\u201d The term \u201coverreaching\u201d became a mantra. This Court, in <em>Tabbs v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 20, 403 A.2d 796 (1979), was at the very front of the national curve in moving to contain what was threatening to become a doctrinal epidemic. Our analysis in <em>Tabbs </em>was picked up and became the heart of the State of Oregon\u2019s ultimately successful brief in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\n<em>Oregon v. Kennedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The prosecutorial error that provoked the defense motion and the ultimate declaration of a mistrial in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>was infinitely more egregious and more prejudicial than the pallid error, if error it was, in the case at bar. Kennedy was on trial for the theft of an oriental rug, with commercial deception as a key issue. On the redirect examination of an expert witness, the prosecutor tried repeatedly to show why the witness distrusted the defendant, but the trial judge sustained a series of defense objections to the entire line of inquiry. The critical exchange then followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">Prosecutor: Have you ever done business with the Kennedys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Witness: No, I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">Prosecutor: <em>Is that because he is a crook?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">456 U.S. at 669, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (emphasis supplied). Without waiting for the answer, the judge immediately granted the defense motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">When the prosecution later sought to retry Kennedy, the defense interposed the plea in bar of double jeopardy. The trial judge, however, found that \u201cit was not the intention of the prosecutor in this case to cause a mistrial\u201d and refused to bar a retrial. The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, buying into Kennedy\u2019s double jeopardy claim. The Supreme Court of the United States summarized the reasoning of the Oregon Court of Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">The Court of Appeals accepted the trial court\u2019s finding that it was not the intent of the prosecutor to cause a mistrial. Nevertheless, <em>the court held that retrial was barred because the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case constituted what it viewed as \u201coverreaching. \u201d </em>... This personal attack left respondent with a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice-either to accept a necessarily prejudiced jury, or to move for a mistrial and face the process of being retried at a later time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">456 U.S. at 670, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">Dealing for the first time with mistrial/retrial law as a square holding, the Supreme Court slew the many-headed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Hydra of \u201coverreaching.\u201d For the sake of convenience, we will conf\u00edne our present analysis to the case of prosecutorial overreaching. The Supreme Court made it very clear that, as an exemption from waiver by a defendant who asks for a mistrial, prosecutorial overreaching is a necessary condition, but it is by no means a sufficient condition. Although it is necessary, as a threshold matter, that the prosecutor do something both erroneous enough and prejudicial enough to justify the declaration of a mistrial, the very happening of the mistrial is ordinarily a sufficient sanction for such prosecutorial error. The barring of a retrial adds an entirely new dimension to the sanction, one that is available only in the rarest of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">What is critically necessary for the imposition of that additional sanction is not error and prejudice, but a particular intent or purpose. The Supreme Court pointed out that trial error is a commonplace and that, ordinarily, it can be handled by appellate reversal or by the mistrial itself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\"><em>Every act on the part of a rational prosecutor </em>during a trial <em>is designed to \u201cprejudice\u201d the defendant </em>by placing before the judge or jury evidence leading to a finding of his guilt.

Kennedy </em>should not have been barred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">[W]e do hold that <em>the circumstances under which such a defendant may invoke the bar of double jeopardy </em>in a second effort to try him <em>are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">Since the Oregon trial court found, and the Oregon Court of Appeals accepted, that the prosecutorial conduct culminating in the termination of the first trial in this case was not so intended by the prosecutor, <em>that is the end of the matter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">456 U.S. at 679, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (emphasis supplied).

As trial began on July 6, 2004, a sensitive nerve was touched early in the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement to the jury. The multi-count indictment charged, <em>inter alia, </em>1) possession with intent to distribute and 2) simple possession. From the outset, the appellant essentially admitted his guilt of simple possession, but strongly denied the incremental charge of commercial distribution. That distinction brought into prominence the search warrant that had authorized the August 8, 2003 search of the Set It Off store, owned and operated by the appellant in Ocean City.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The prosecutor began his opening statement by attempting to describe, \u201cbriefly,\u201d the provenance of the case. Delivering an opening statement, however, can be as daunting as writing an epic. It is the age-old literary problem of how best to tell a story.

That\u2019s denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">At long last, the State was allowed to finish its opening statement. The defense opening statement was, more gallantly, uninterrupted. After the jury was given a brief recess, the judge called before him all prospective police witnesses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">Folks, there was a motion in limine made. There\u2019s also a motion for a [mistrial]. <em>The Defense Counsel is concerned that when you testify that you\u2019re going to go beyond more than saying that you were doing an investigation in Ocean City, and you applied for or [were] granted a search and seizure warrant and served it. </em>What he specifically doesn\u2019t want you to say is anything that\u2019s within the confines of that search warrant. Bear in mind, I haven\u2019t seen it at all. But I assume there\u2019s something in there about either some informant or a controlled buy or something \u2014 usually there\u2019s something like that in there. None of that is to come in during this trial because that person is not here. And if it does, of course it will be the subject of a motion for a mistrial. Does that satisfy you, [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Yes, it does, Your Honor. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7L\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">The judge turned finally to the assistant state\u2019s attorney. Before the jury is brought back in, I just want to make it clear on the search warrant. I don\u2019t see where it\u2019s necessary to say \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if this was a major one or not, but \u2014 a drug investigation. But <em>just simply say, his investigation, he applied for a search and seizure warrant, and then you went in and served it and take it from there.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">The very first State\u2019s witness was Detective Jeffrey Heiser. The direct examination began.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>[Prosecutor]: Detective Heiser, would you state your name and employment please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">[Witness]: Detective Heiser. I\u2019m currently assigned to the Ocean City Vice Narcotics Unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">[Prosecutor]: How long have you been so assigned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azi\">[Witness]: Two an a half years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">[Prosecutor]: And pursuant to those duties, <em>did you begin a drug investigation in June of last year?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">[Witness]: Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">[Prosecutor]: <em>Who was the target of that investigation?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax6\">[Defense Counsel]: <em>Objection, </em>Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">[The Court]: <em>Sustained.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, may we approach, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGc\">[The Court]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">At the bench conference that followed, the overarching mood was one of almost uncomprehending judicial exasperation with, to put it most gently, the lack of prescience on the part of the prosecutor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-13\">[The Court]: <em>I thought we went through this.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-14\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, <em>I asked him this in opening statement and the objection was overruled.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-15\">[The Court]: <em>Not about him being the target of the investigation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">Although the assistant state\u2019s attorney may, indeed, have failed to grasp the larger message, he was, we note, literally correct about having used, in opening statement, the word \u201ctarget,\u201d just before the first objection was made and then overruled. Immediately prior to the objection, his truncated sentence had begun, \u201cThe <em>target </em>of that investigation.... \u201d (Emphasis supplied). This will become important when we come to evaluate whether the prosecutor deliberately did something wrong, even before turning to the follow-up issue of whether the prosecutor deliberately did something wrong for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the specific purpose of goading the defense into asking for a mistrial in order to sabotage a trial that was going badly for the State. An innocent mistake, even a stupid mistake, does not so much as jiggle the mistrial/retrial seismograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">As the defense motion for a mistrial was granted, however, it was the assistant state\u2019s attorney who was in the unfortunate position of having been the deck officer who had failed to spot the iceberg.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, <em>I\u2019m going to renew my motion for a mistrial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">[The Court]: <em>I\u2019m going to grant it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">[The Court]: I\u2019m granting it. <em>That is ridiculous what you just did. Jesus, we\u2019ve had now three discussions over this.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADU\">(Emphasis supplied). The jury was dismissed. Even as we described a similar catastrophe in <em>West v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. at 630, 451 A.2d 1228, \u201cHard by the bow at 11:58 a.m., the initial jeopardy went to the bottom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">A Ruling Must Abide An Issue To Be Ruled Upon; All Else Is Only Comment</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">In the lifeboats, accusations and recriminations may abound. Notwithstanding the inevitability of a spirited post-mortem, however, there is at such a moment no double jeopardy issue before the court. As an issue, it is not yet ripe and, indeed, may never become ripe. The termination of initial jeopardy does not necessarily presage the imminence of double jeopardy. The court, therefore, may not make an anticipatory ruling on a hypothetical double jeopardy plea any more than it may make anticipatory rulings on what evidence may come in or on what jury arguments will be permitted at some purely hypothetical future trial that may never come to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">There is no double jeopardy issue before the court unless and until the State\u2019s Attorney actually decides to retry the case and then moves officially to put that decision into operation. There is always a very real possibility that he might choose not to do so. Even then, there is no double jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>issue before the court unless and until the defendant actually interposes the plea in bar of double jeopardy. It is conceivable that, for a variety of reasons, he might choose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The actual issue of double jeopardy in this case arose only 1) when the State, on July 8, 2004, requested that the case be docketed for retrial; and 2) when the appellant, on July 23, then interposed the plea in bar of double jeopardy. The issue of double jeopardy was argued before Judge Groton on September 13 and ruled on by him on September 16. That is the only ruling that concerns us on this appeal. It is, moreover, the only actual ruling that was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The post-mortem thoughts of the trial judge, by contrast, although having no legally binding significance, may nonetheless have very real evidentiary significance. They were offered before Judge Groton as pertinent evidence <em>on </em>the critical question of prosecutorial purpose. Considered by Judge Groton was the July 8 letter of the trial judge to both the appellant\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">1 thought I should write this letter to avoid any confusion regarding my comments concerning \u201cprosecutorial misconduct.\u201d <em>My comments were not meant to be an Order of this Count or the equivalent of an Order. It is my opinion that the State can set this case back in for trial and that the Defendant can raise this issue before the judge hearing the case, once it is reassigned. </em>I believe the State and the Defendant are both entitled to a hearing on the issue of \u201cprosecutorial misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">I have reviewed the transcript and <em>the issue of the Defendant being the \u201ctarget\u201d of the investigation. This was mentioned by /the prosecutor] and I did overrule the Defendant\u2019s objection. </em>However, after several bench conferences, <em>I thought I made it clear </em>on page 18 of the transcript, beginning at line 11, <em>the expected limits of the testimony regarding the search warrant. If this was misunderstood by [the prosecutor] (and it may have been) it would not be prosecutorial misconduct, barring further prosecution.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>I, by copy of this letter to the Assignment Clerk, -will direct that this case be calendared for another judge, in the event the State seeks to retry the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The Double Jeopardy Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In denying the appellant\u2019s double jeopardy plea, Judge Groton found, at the threshold, that it was not clear that the prosecutor had even made a mistake.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\"><em>[I]t is unclear to this Court that </em>when questioning Detective Heiser, <em>the prosecutor knew his questions were objectionable. </em>Indeed, <em>even the presiding judge, </em>Judge Eschenburg, <em>clarified </em>in a letter to the parties, <em>that </em>under the circumstances, <em>the prosecutor may have misunderstood the boundaries that the Court established </em>regarding testimony about the search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">More significantly, the Opinion and Order of Judge Groton found that there was no evidence of goading on the part of the prosecutor or of any intent to sabotage a losing effort.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">[Tjhis Court finds that <em>there is an absence of any evidence </em>tending <em>to indicate that the prosecutor in the case sub judice acted so as to \u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial. </em>As Judge Moylan explained in <em>West v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 624, 634, 451 A.2d 1228 (1982), the prosecutor must not only have the general intent to do an act (such as asking a prohibited question) but, \u201cknowing it to be error,\u201d <em>he must act with the desire \u201cto \u2018sabotage\u2019 a probable loser </em>either 1) by snatching an unexpected victory from probable defeat if not caught, or 2) by getting caught, thereby provoking the mistrial, averting the probable acquittal and living to fight again another day.\u201d As Judge Moylan summarized, <em>there must be a \u201ccalculated sabotaging of a perceived \u2018lost cause\u2019 </em>in either event; an indifference to whether he [the prosecutor] is caught or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">In the case at bar, the Court finds that <em>the defendant has failed to reveal any evidence </em>or fact <em>indicating that the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>\u25a0prosecutor possessed this intent. </em>Preliminarily, the Court notes that the trial had just begun and it was not evident that the prosecutor\u2019s defeat was probable. Accordingly, <em>his case could not be fairly characterized as a \u201clost cause.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3z\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Indeed, at the hearing before Judge Groton, the prosecutor had pointed out what was self-evident in any event.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">At that point, Your Honor, I didn\u2019t think I was going to lose. <em>The trial hadn\u2019t even hardly started yet.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">Judge Groton\u2019s final ruling was unequivocal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">Thus, because <em>the defendant has failed to convince this Court that the prosecutor\u2019s acts amounted to \u201ca, calculated, sabotaging\u201d of the defendant\u2019s case; </em>and because the Court is not convinced the prosecutor even acted with the knowledge that his acts were in error, this Court finds that <em>the defendant\u2019s retrial is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Materiality of Prosecutorial Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">In denying the motion, Judge Groton relied on the \u201cabsence of any evidence\u201d that the prosecutor \u201cacted so as to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d In challenging the ruling, the appellant wanders back and forth across and badly blurs the line between two completely different arguments. We have some difficulty pinning down precisely the argument that we are called upon to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">In one breath, the appellant seems to accept, as he must, that \u201cprosecutorial intent [by definition, a subjective thing] is the determinative issue.\u201d He then argues that that prosecutorial intent may not be proved by the testimony of the prosecutor as to his subjective state of mind, but must be deduced from the objective conduct itself, to wit, from the behavior that caused the mistrial. Such an argument is not about the materiality of prosecutorial intent as the thing to be proved, but only about the modality of how to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In virtually every alternate sentence, however, the appellant segues into an entirely different argument. He seems to question the very materiality of prosecutorial intent as the critical criterion to be proved. He argues that the trial' circumstances must be viewed from the perspective of the defendant and the defense attorney, stressing that they cannot be expected to read the subjective state of mind of the prosecutor. The appellant argues that only the objective actions of the prosecutor are discernible to the defendant or defense attorney as they are called upon to respond to the prosecutor\u2019s misfeasance. This argument, in contrast to the first, has nothing to do with the method of proof, but calls into question the very materiality of the thing to be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">This second argument, however, we have already exhaustively disposed of in tracing the evolution of mistrial/retrial law. Mistrial/retrial law does not view the prosecutor\u2019s conduct from the perspective of the defendant or the defense attorney, however fervently the appellant might wish it were otherwise. Mistrial/retrial law is not concerned with WHAT the prosecutor did, but only with WHY he did it. This does not mean, of course, that the law itself is indifferent to trial error generally. It may be sternly redressed, but in other ways. As we explained in <em>West v. State, </em>52 Md.App. at 636, 451 A.2d 1228:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">The redress is the declaration of the mistrial itself or the appellate reversal of the conviction. Many of the prosecutorial errors that trigger mistrials and reversals consist of grossly negligent and even deliberate conduct. <em>The law has never looked upon the declaration of a mistrial and the appellate reversal as mild slaps upon the wrist, but has treated them as rigorous means for redressing even grossly negligent and deliberate misconduct. </em>For weighty considerations that need not here be reiterated, <em>our constitutional law has always permitted a retrial following such mistrial or reversal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The incremental sanction of barring a retrial, however, is reserved for the unique situation in which it is the subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>intention of the prosecutor to goad the defendant into requesting a mistrial, the deliberate effort by the prosecutor to derail or to sabotage the trial in progress. We explained in <em>West v. </em>State, 52 Md.App. at 636, 451 A.2d 1228, why this unique sanction is reserved for this unique prosecutorial <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">When the prosecution suffers a mistrial or an appellate reversal, it is considered to have suffered a stern rebuke in terms of lost days, lost dollars, lost resources of many varieties and the lost opportunity to make the conviction stick. <em>It is only </em>in the Machiavellian situation <em>where the prosecutor deliberately courts a mistrial, that the 'normal sanctions are self-evidently inadequate. A scheming prosecutor cannot be rewarded by being handed the very thing toward which he connives.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">A defendant may well ask what difference it makes to him why the error was committed, since he suffers all the same. The answer is that <em>from the parochial viewpoint of the defendant, it 'may make very little difference; but the defendant is not the only factor in the equation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The defendant and the defense attorney, therefore, do not need to know WHY the prosecutor did what he did, because it is not their job to make that call. The determination of whether to impose the incremental sanction of barring a retrial is reserved exclusively for the judge who is called upon to make the ultimate ruling on the double jeopardy plea. What matters to him is not WHAT happened, but WHY it happened. In <em>West v. State, </em>52 Md.App. at 637, 451 A.2d 1228, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\"><em>Even at the extreme end of the reprehensibility spectrum, </em>however, where the prosecutor has committed the deliberate foul, <em>there is still this pivotal distinction </em>between (1) seeking to win the game unfairly and (2), knowing the game is going awry, deliberately causing it to be cancelled and rescheduled. <em>If the prosecutor wins the game unfairly, we make him replay it. When the prosecutor deliberately </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>causes the game to be cancelled unfairly, we do not permit him to reschedule it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Relevant Evidence of Prosecutorial Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Having established, hopefully, that prosecutorial intent is, indeed, the material criterion, we turn to the modality of its proof. The intent of the prosecutor in asking a question or in making an argument is a fact, which, like any other fact, may be established by relevant evidence. All of the circumstances surrounding the asking of the question or the making of the argument are relevant evidence of prosecutorial purpose. Also obviously relevant is the testimony or statement by the prosecutor himself as to precisely what, if anything, his intent may have been. His testimony, of course, may be taken with a grain of salt, but its relevance, as evidence, is not to be doubted. In an effort to convince us that Judge Groton\u2019s finding in this regard was clearly erroneous, the appellant argues that it was error <em>per se </em>for Judge Groton to have considered and partially to have relied upon the prosecutor\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Out of a significant body of caselaw on this subject, the appellant has culled a single instance in which the adjective \u201cobjective\u201d was used. From the unremarkable observation that intent may be inferred \u201cfrom objective facts and circumstances,\u201d the appellant seeks to establish the converse principle that it may not be proved in any other way and that a statement from the prosecutor as to his subjective intent should not even be considered by the court in making its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The appellant ascribes to this Court, in <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 742, 626 A.2d 1037, a definitive statement as to the controlling standard of review that this Court is completely oblivious of ever having articulated. What the appellant reads into our thought process is, to say the least, truly Orwellian. In his brief, he attributes to us what he calls \u201cthe rule in Fields,\u201d a rule that ostensibly establishes an exclusively \u201cob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>jective standard for judging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d We, however, remain blissfully unaware of ever having announced any such rule. Although a work of art may arguably have meaning that the artist never consciously intended, this is definitely not so with judicial opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Figuring out how the appellant could attribute to us a rule of law that we never remotely promulgated (and would, indeed, affirmatively reject) sheds interesting light, however, not so much on the legal phenomenon of opinion writing, as on the complementary phenomenon of opinion reading. Because of the peculiar nature of a legal system heavily based on court-made law, the very first semester of the first year of law school drums in the A, B, C\u2019s of how to read an opinion. Fundamental to the process is the distinction between an opinion\u2019s holding and its dicta (or, in this case, the random use of a word not even amounting to dicta). Every word of an opinion is not chiseled in marble. In <em>State v. Wilson, </em>106 Md.App. 24, 36-37, 664 A.2d 1 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997), we attempted to explain the difference.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">The precedential weight of a holding is predicated in large measure on its status as the deliberate and considered judgment of an entire collegiate court, including the opinion writer, on the issue before it that must be decided. <em>Each member of an appellate court peers in with painstaking scrutiny not only on the decision itself but on the framing of the holding that announces the decision. </em>The articulation of the holding passes through a stern editorial process that insists that every \u201ci\u201d be dotted, every \u201ct\u201d be crossed, every word be carefully chosen, and every far-flung repercussion be sagely anticipated. <em>A holding, therefore, has earned the authoritative weight we give it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\"><em>The holding, however, consists of no more than a few sentences or, at most, a few paragraphs, generally located near the end of what may be a twenty or thirty-page opinion. </em>When it comes to the composition of the opinion leading up to the holding, the collegiate editorial reins are, although not totally relaxed, far looser. There is a wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>stylistic range within which the opinion writer may freely express a particular legal philosophy; a special analytic approach to problem solving; possibly idiosyncratic reactions to certain arguments; or, above all, an individualistic writing personality. <em>The active collegiate participation in the formulation of a holding retreats to gentle stylistic suggestion when it comes to the writer\u2019s modality of expression. </em>It is not uncommon for a panel member to subscribe to an opinion, notwithstanding an occasional wince of pain or smile of indulgent tolerance along the way. <em>The point is that everything said in an opinion </em>\u2014 the <em>dicta </em>\u2014 is <em>not entitled to the same weight as is the holding of the Court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADH\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In crediting this Court with a rule of law that was never contemplated by us, the appellant confected such a rule from even less than dicta, from the appearance of a single word in a quotation from someone else. In pointing out that <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>had \u201cmade it clear that the exclusive focus was not on the fact of prosecutorial (or judicial) error or on the impact of such error upon a defendant but only on the intent of the prosecutor (or judge) in committing the error,\u201d this Court, in <em>Fields, </em>96 Md.App. at 742, 626 A.2d 1037, had quoted the following passage from <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 675, 102 S.Ct. 2083:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">By contrast, a standard that examines the intent of the prosecutor, though certainly not entirely free from practical difficulties, is a manageable standard to apply. It merely calls for the court to make a finding of fact. <em>Inferring the existence or nonexistence of intent from objective facts and circumstances is a familiar process </em>in our criminal justice system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">One simply cannot extract from that statement a rule of law, as the appellant would have us do, that a trial judge\u2019s finding as to the prosecutor\u2019s subjective purpose is immaterial and should not be considered on appellate review. In the section of the opinion from which the quotation was lifted, <em>Oregon v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Kennedy </em>was not even contrasting modalities of proof. It was contrasting, rather, 1) the narrow exception to the waiver rule, based on prosecutorial goading, with 2) a broader exception, being urged by Kennedy in that case, based on prosecutorial overreaching generally. The Supreme Court was explaining that a standard looking to prosecutorial intent was a workable standard because it was based on a mental fact that was capable of being proved. That was the only purpose for which we quoted that particular passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>itself, moreover, testimony as to the prosecutor\u2019s subjective intention was accepted both by the trial judge and by every level of appellate review, the very thing the appellant now asserts that <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>forbade.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\"><em>After a hearing at which the prosecutor testified, the trial cowrt found </em>as a fact <em>that \u201cit was not the intention of the prosecutor </em>in this case <em>to cause a mistrial. </em>\u201d On the basis of this finding, the trial court held that double jeopardy principles did not bar retrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">456 U.S. at 669-70, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (emphasis supplied). That finding of fact as to the prosecutor\u2019s subjective intent became the predicate for the Supreme Court\u2019s ultimate holding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\"><em>Since the Oregon trial court found,, and the Oregon Court of Appeals accepted, that the prvsecutorial conduct culminating in the termination of the first trial </em>in this case <em>was not so intended by the prosecutor, that is the end of the 'matter </em>for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">456 U.S. at 679, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">In his concurring opinion, Justice Powell also took specific note of the same testimony as to subjective intent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">Finally, at the hearing on respondent\u2019s double jeopardy motion, <em>the prosecutor testified, </em>\u2014 and <em>the trial found </em>as a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>fact <em>and the appellate court agreed </em>\u2014 that <em>there was no \u201c \u2018intention ... to cause a mistrial.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">456 U.S. at 680, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The appellant\u2019s entire line of argument hinges on the single appearance in <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 742, 626 A.2d 1037, of the word \u201cobjective.\u201d The argument\u2019s conclusion is that we, therefore, should ignore Judge Groton\u2019s finding as to prosecutorial intent and should proceed to make our own <em>de novo </em>finding on that question, ignoring as we do so, pursuant to our own ostensible mandate, any statement by the prosecutor with respect to his subjective intent. The linchpin of the argument is not that we, even if only in passing and in a totally different context, ourselves used the word \u201cobjective.\u201d We did not. It is that we quoted from the opinion of another court that, also only in passing and in another context, used the word \u201cobjective.\u201d In rejecting this strained and attenuated argument, we can only re-echo our earlier observation in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>106 Md.App. at 39, 664 A.2d 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\"><em>[SJtare decisis </em>is ill served if readers hang slavishly on every casual or hurried word as if it had bubbled from the earth at Delphi.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">An Ineluctable Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Even if there had been no statement by the prosecutor as to the total absence on his part of any subjective intent to goad the appellant into asking for the mistrial, the objective circumstances alone scream out the ineluctable conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s arguably inept questioning of his very first witness was not an effort to \u201csabotage a probable loser.\u201d Judge Groton\u2019s finding was self-evident and unavoidable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASB\">Preliminarily, the Court notes that the trial has just begun and it was not evident that the prosecutor\u2019s defeat was probable. Accordingly, his case could not be fairly characterized as a \u201clost cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Detective Heiser was the State\u2019s very first witness. When the offending question was asked, he had not gotten beyond giving his name, rank, and serial number. Far from going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>badly, the trial had barely begun. The State was ready to produce a warranted search of and seizure from the appellant\u2019s store that was not even contested. The search had produced \u201capproximately 39 grams of cocaine, both crack and powder.\u201d The appellant was not even challenging the confession in which he told the searching officers, \u201cI want to be adult about this. There\u2019s a bag of cocaine and a bag of crack in my bag under the counter.\u201d The State was ready to offer the expert testimony of a seasoned narcotics detective, who would have testified 1) that the street value of the recovered cocaine was approximately $4,000 and 2) that the amount of cocaine far exceeded that indicating personal use and, instead, indicated the intent to distribute. Far from being a probable loser, this case was a \u201clead-pipe cinch\u201d as a probable winner. There would have been no conceivable reason to sabotage the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">This was precisely the sort of circumstance that Judge Orth found to have been decisive in <em>Bell v. </em>State, 286 Md. at 206, 406 A.2d 909.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">At the time the mistrial was declared, the State had presented a strong case; there was no reason apparent in the record why it would want the trial aborted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>the concurring opinion of Justice Stevens took note, 456 U.S. at 692, 102 S.Ct. 2083, of a decisive circumstance indistinguishable from the one before us in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">The isolated prosecutorial error occurred early in the trial, <em>too early to determine whether the case was going badly </em>for the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">In <em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 756, 626 A.2d 1037, a similar circumstance was held to be decisive in the decision not to bar a retrial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\"><em>[TJhere was no compelling motivation for the assistant state\u2019s attorney to seek to sabotage the trial. This was not a case that was \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d for the State. </em>The robbery victim made an unequivocal identification in the courtroom of the appellant as one of the robbers. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>police stopped the automobile occupied by the appellant and his codefendant, it bore the tag number that had been observed at the crime scene by the victim and provided to the police. Both the appellant and his codefendant were wearing clothing similar to that described by the victim. <em>Although victory can never be guaranteed, this was not a case that the State was likely to lose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">It is also worthy of note that when the trial judge granted the mistrial, the prosecutor objected and argued strenuously against the granting of the motion. This was a circumstance that Justice Powell deemed to be significant in his concurring opinion in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 680, 102 S.Ct. 2083.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">Moreover, it is evident from a colloquy between counsel and the court, out of the presence of the jury, that <em>the prosecutor not only resisted, but also was surprised by, the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Self-evidently in this case, there was on the part of the assistant state\u2019s attorney no goading of the appellant into asking for a mistrial and no deliberate effort to sabotage a trial that was going badly in the hope of doing better the next time around. The appellant\u2019s request for the mistrial, therefore, operated as a foreclosing waiver of any subsequent double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT. ^</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\">.
