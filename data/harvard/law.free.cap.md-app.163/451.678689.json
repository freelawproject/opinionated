He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the first degree premeditated murder conviction and to a concurrent twenty-year term for the burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Appellant presents two questions for our review, which we have reworded slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">I. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in precluding appellant from presenting an expert witness who would have testified to appellant\u2019s psychological profile and its relationship to the <em>mens rea </em>of the crimes charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">II. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in allowing the State to introduce into evidence communications that were privileged and irrelevant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">On July 20, 2002, appellant\u2019s ex-wife, Donna Martin, was fatally stabbed at her townhouse located on Merust Lane in Gaithersburg. The victim sustained numerous stab and cutting wounds, and was pronounced dead soon after she was transported to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">Appellant and Ms. Martin had two children together, who were three and four years of age at the time of trial in May 2003. Ms. Martin also had a third child with another man; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the baby was approximately six months old at the time of Ms. Martin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The State presented evidence that appellant had threatened Ms. Martin a year before she was killed. Specifically, at a court proceeding held on April 9, 2001, Ms. Martin was speaking to a judge in the presence of appellant. A tape of appellant\u2019s comments was admitted in evidence, and showed that he made threatening comments to Ms. Martin at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Cynthia Sargeant, a registered nurse, came into contact with appellant on April 9, 2001, during an intake medical screening at the Montgomery County Detention Center. Sargeant testified: \u201cHe [i.e., appellant] indicated that he had a definite plan to kill her. He indicated that he enjoyed seeing her blood. He indicated that he was obsessed with killing her and that she messed with him.\u201d Sargeant added that appellant also stated that the \u201c[tjhought of killing her won\u2019t go away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The State also showed that, in the period prior to her death, Ms. Martin sought to conceal her whereabouts from appellant. Dorothy Ann Troup, who lived on Topfield Drive in Gaithersburg, testified that she came to know Ms. Martin through Ms. Martin\u2019s mother, who lived in Troup\u2019s neighborhood. According to Troup, Ms. Martin and appellant stopped living together shortly before Christmas of 2000, when Ms. Martin moved in with Troup and filed for divorce. Troup claimed that Ms. Martin attempted to conceal her location from appellant. For instance, even when Ms. Martin was not living with Troup, she had her mail sent to Troup\u2019s residence. Ms. Martin also used a post office box and Troup took telephone calls for her. At one point, appellant came to Troup\u2019s home, but Troup did not tell him that Ms. Martin was living with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">At the time of Ms. Martin\u2019s murder, appellant was required to have supervised visitation with his children, which was coordinated by Betty Wages, who worked for the Family Trauma Service. Wages recalled that, at approximately 9:00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>a.m. on July 20, 2002, appellant telephoned her office in Wheaton Plaza concerning a visit he believed had been scheduled for that day. Wages informed appellant that she had been unable to set up visitation for that day. Because appellant was in the area, Wages told him to come to her office and she would call Ms. Martin to set another date for visitation. When appellant entered Wages\u2019s office, she was on the telephone with Ms. Martin. Wages described appellant as having \u201cjust sort of a flat demeanor.\u201d Eventually, a visit was scheduled for the following Saturday at 10:30 a.m. Appellant was in Wages\u2019s office for about ten minutes and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Several witnesses from the victim\u2019s neighborhood testified that they saw a man, not specifically identified as appellant, near the victim\u2019s home on July 20, 2002. For example, Mary Freekleton testified that on July 20, 2002, between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., she was visiting her sister, who lived in an apartment on Merust Lane in Gaithersburg, when she looked out the window and noticed a man \u201cwalking back and forth.\u201d Freekleton, who visited her sister nearly every day, did not recognize the individual as someone who lived in the neighborhood. Later, between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m., Freekleton again saw the man. Thereafter, between 3:30 p.m and 4:00 p.m., Freekleton saw the man \u201csitting on the side of the embankment looking down at the apartments[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">When asked to describe the man, Freekleton responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">He was brown skin, short hair. I remember his lips was full. 1 say he was maybe six, five feet, something and he weighed about 200 and some pounds. He had real short close \u2014 short close hair. His hair was cut real close. He was brown skin....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">When I seen him the first time, he had a tee-shirt on. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was not white. If it was white, it was dirty. It was dirty, dirty. It wasn\u2019t white. He had ... I don\u2019t if it was jeans. I can\u2019t recall if it was blue jeans or black jeans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Derrick Hall, who was twelve years old at the time of trial and who had lived next door to Ms. Martin, testified that on July 20, 2002, he was playing football with some friends when an African-American man, whom Hall had never seen before, approached them to ask where a woman lived. Hall described the man as \u201clike short\u201d with \u201ca little bit of hair.\u201d According to Hall, the man described the lady as \u201cbig boned,\u201d short, with two children and a baby. Hall pointed to Ms. Martin\u2019s residence. Later, after Hall went inside his house, he saw the man \u201cwalking around back and forth\u201d behind Ms. Martin\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Tee Martin, who was fifteen years old at the time of trial, testified that he lived on Merust Lane, \u201ctwo houses over\u201d from Ms. Martin. On the date in question, he arrived home around 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. After arriving home, Mr. Martin\u2019s attention was drawn to the back of his townhouse, where he saw an African-American man \u201cpacing.\u201d Mr. Martin had never seen the man before and estimated that he walked back and forth about ten times. Later, Mr. Martin heard the sound of shattering glass and, a few minutes after that, he noticed that the police were in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Loretta Payne testified that, on the date in question, she was staying with her mother, Brenda Cooper, who lived in a townhouse on Merust Lane two houses down from Ms. Martin. Payne recalled that at noon or 1:00 p.m. she was sitting at the kitchen table and \u201ckept seeing somebody walk back and forth behind the houses.\u201d Payne stated that she had never seen the man before and described him as African-American, at least 5'8\" tall, with short hair, and wearing a pull over shirt. Payne testified that the man she saw was not the father of Ms. Martin\u2019s youngest child.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Stanley Bradley testified that, at 5:00 p.m. on the date in question, he was working with Joseph Hammond, a friend, on Hammond\u2019s car, which was parked on Merust Lane. At that time, he noticed a woman with a baby in her arms and a little boy walking toward the door to a townhouse. When the woman was at the door, Bradley heard a bang followed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>woman \u201chollering.\u201d Upon looking toward the house, Bradley saw the arm of an African-American male grab the woman by the hair and he also \u201cvaguely\u201d saw a knife. The woman yelled: \u201cSomebody help me. He is going to kill me.\u201d He saw a man drag the woman, who was still holding the baby, into the house, leaving the boy outside. Bradley also heard yelling coming from inside the house. A woman went to the door and took the child, who had been left outside. The police were called and, when they arrived approximately five minutes later, Bradley related what had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Kristie Sykes lived on Merust Lane and recalled that she was at the playground with her two children at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the date in question, when she noticed a woman standing beside a car with three children in the car. Sykes watched the woman walk toward her house, then saw \u201can arm come out and grab her.\u201d The woman \u201cended up in her house\u201d with one of the children, while one child was left outside. Sykes heard screaming coming from the house. Later, Sykes saw a man running. She described him as \u201ca big black male ... about 5'10\", just a little over 200 pounds[.j\u201d He was carrying a 40 ounce bottle of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Montgomery County Police Officer Sean Wade responded to Merust Lane for the report of a woman being stabbed. When he arrived on the scene, two other officers were already present, but were unable to enter the townhouse through the front door. Officer Wade ran to the rear of the residence where he found a \u201cbroken out rear window.\u201d The back door was unlocked so the officer opened the door, stepped inside, and identified himself as a police officer. A small girl approached the officer and he carried her outside and asked where her mother was. The girl pointed at the house. The officer entered the house and found Ms. Martin on the floor in a pool of blood. An infant was found in the house crying and \u201ccovered with blood.\u201d On the staircase, the officer found a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Captain William Wells, an EMT, responded to Ms. Martin\u2019s residence, where he found an infant \u201ccovered from head to toe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>in blood and ... screaming.\u201d The infant had a \u201clarge amount of blood\u201d in his nose and mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Ms. Martin sustained multiple stab and cutting wounds. She was flown to Suburban Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. An autopsy performed by Dr. Zabiullah Ali revealed that Ms. Martin received eight stab wounds and nine cutting wounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two of the stab wounds injured Ms. Martin\u2019s left lung and one of them injured her heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">From a path through woods near Ms. Martin\u2019s townhouse, the police recovered a pair of tan pants with what appeared to be blood on them. Also recovered from the trail in the woods were two latex gloves and a bandana hanging on a branch. The tan pants and latex gloves appeared to have been recently deposited in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In Ms. Martin\u2019s residence, there were two telephones on the ground floor. The cord to one telephone had been cut and the cord for the second phone was missing. From underneath the love seat, a metal sharpening stick, which matched a set of knives found in the house, was recovered. Suspected bloody shoe impressions were found in the floor tiles of the foyer. The police believed that the broken window was the point of entry and found suspected blood on the window. The knife located by Officer Wade was recovered from the stairs and a second knife was found near the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">On the morning of July 24, 2002, appellant was arrested in an apartment on North Summit Drive in Gaithersburg. The police found him sitting in a bedroom closet behind a closed door. A wristwatch that appeared to have dried blood on it was recovered from appellant\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Michael Fontes testified that he had lived in the apartment from which appellant was arrested for approximately five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>years. In July 2002, Fontes had given appellant permission to live there. Fontes stated that he had met appellant a few weeks prior to appellant\u2019s arrest. A woman Fontes identified only as \u201cChocolate\u201d introduced them and appellant asked for a place to stay. Appellant told Fontes that \u201che was having trouble with his wife, and he was having custody problems.\u201d Fontes gave appellant a key to the apartment and he estimated that appellant had been living there one week prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Fontes recalled that he had returned from a trip the evening before appellant\u2019s arrest. After his return, he noticed that, in the bathroom appellant used, \u201cthere were cleaning supplies and scouring powder all over the floor, and like 409 on the top of the toilet, and nobody had cleaned the bathroom; it was just all over the bathroom.\u201d The police searched Fontes\u2019s apartment and, among the items seized, were appellant\u2019s shoes, two of his shirts, and a personal bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Police Officer Bill Bickle, who testified as a forensic expert in the field of shoe and tire identification analysis, compared the shoe impressions recovered from the foyer of Ms. Martin\u2019s residence with appellant\u2019s shoes. Officer Bickle explained that there are three levels of conclusiveness in shoe wear examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">You have either a positive identification, or you can have an elimination which totally eliminates the known shoe, or you can have what\u2019s referred to as a non-conclusion or an inconclusive examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">The inconclusive is broken down into three other categories, possibly made, could have made, and highly unlikely that another shoe could have made that based upon the presence of design, shape, and size as well as the random characteristics that were present in that particular shoe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">According to Officer Bickle, two impressions recovered from the scene were positively identified as having been made by appellant\u2019s right shoe, and one impression was positively identified as having been made by appellant\u2019s left shoe. Regarding two other impressions, the officer opined that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>highly unlikely that any shoe other than appellant\u2019s could have made the impressions. Another two impressions \u201ccould have been made\u201d by appellant\u2019s shoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Charles Heurich, who testified as an expert in forensic biology, stated that Ms. Martin could not be excluded as the source of the blood found on appellant\u2019s right shoe, the two knives that were recovered, appellant\u2019s shirt, and the pants found in the woods. In addition, Ms. Martin could not be excluded as a major contributor to the DNA profile in the blood found on appellant\u2019s watchband, appellant\u2019s shirt, the pants recovered from the woods, and appellant\u2019s right shoe. The victim was Caucasian and, according to Heurich, the frequency with which Ms. Martin\u2019s DNA profile is found in the Caucasian population is one in 52 sextillion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In addition, appellant could not be excluded as the source of the blood found on the broken rear window and the latch of Ms. Martin\u2019s house. Heurich testified that the frequency of appellant\u2019s DNA profile in the African-American community is one in 3.3 sextillion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In the defense case, counsel read the following statement to the jury: \u201cOn February 14th of 2002, the defendant made the following statement to a physician, quote: T don\u2019t have the urge to kill any more like before.\u2019 \u201d Appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In closing argument, defense counsel pointed out that no one had identified appellant as the perpetrator. He told the jury: \u201c[Yjou\u2019re going to have to decide, in your good conscience, who committed this homicide.... \u201d He added that, if the jury decided that appellant killed the victim, the jurors would then have to consider the degree of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Prior to trial, defense counsel provided the State with reports from its two experts, Susan Fiester, M.D., and Michael O\u2019Connell, Ph.D. On April 28, 2003, at a motions hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the State informed the court that it had received the reports, but alleged that they were not relevant to any issue before the court. Further, the State argued that the defense had not indicated whether it intended to \u201cpresent psychiatric testimony that ... relates to the ability of the defendant to form the necessary intent or premeditation for a particular crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Appellant\u2019s attorney responded that the defense experts would testify that Bryant suffers from an impulse control disorder. According to defense counsel, that testimony was relevant to the element of premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The prosecutor countered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">If the defendant has an impulse control disorder, and if that\u2019s what their opinion is, the problem with it, as I read the letters, he hasn\u2019t admitted he did the crime. Therefore, what is the relevance of someone having an impulse control disorder unless they\u2019re going to say, well, I was the one who met her at the door, and I\u2019m the one who murdered her in front of her three children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">And if they\u2019re going to say it was because of this impulse control disorder he did it, and it was that psychological profile that in some way affects his ability to premeditate to intent, that\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Defense counsel alleged that the impulse control disorder \u201cis relevant because it is probative of whether he had [the required] mental state in existence at that time. It makes the existence of that mental state more or less likely, so it\u2019s relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Thereafter, the State filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the proposed testimony of the defense expert witnesses. The State alleged that the experts\u2019 reports do \u201cnot go beyond an attempt to generally inject vague references to a laundry list of potential psychiatric conditions none of which rise to the level of negating the defendant\u2019s competency or responsibility.\u201d The State continued: \u201cWithout an acknowledgment by the defendant that he was in fact responsible for Ms. Martin\u2019s killing, allowing a psychiatric portrait of the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>explain his mental state at the time of the crime would be meaningless, irrelevant, and confuse the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On May 12, 2003, the court held a hearing on the motion, at which the State argued: \u201cThe defendant has not raised ... any issue relative to competency or criminal responsibility. It is the State\u2019s position that nothing in these reports in light of that would be admissible substantively at trial.\u201d In its view, the \u201claundry list of various psychiatric conditions\u201d referenced in the reports should only be considered at sentencing. Further, the State reiterated: \u201c[Tjhere is no nexus between the information or the psychiatric conditions that are alluded to by these doctors and the conduct of the defendant on July 20th of last year when he ended the life of Donna Martin, because he\u2019s never admitted he did the crime, and specifically denies that he did the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Defense counsel responded that the State had to prove appellant\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>and that the defense could challenge that with the reports, without confessing to the crime. Defense counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">He [i.e., appellant] has impulse control problems. Now, that\u2019s relevant because the State is making it relevant, because they\u2019re saying ... he didn\u2019t just kill Donna Martin, he deliberated about it, he considered it and he premeditated it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">And what we\u2019re saying is, jury, when you deliberate about this, you should have the evidence that is relevant to the mental issues that the State has put into play. One of those is what the defendant\u2019s psychological profile is, as evidenced by O\u2019Connell\u2019s report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">The fact that the defendant hasn\u2019t confessed to O\u2019Connell I just don\u2019t [think] is relevant, and I don\u2019t think the defendant should be forced to have to take the stand to confess to a crime to be able to introduce a defense, or to challenge the State\u2019s burden of beyond a reasonable doubt on the mens rea that they have to establish for a first-degree murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The trial court stated: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens at trial. If they [the defense] can\u2019t lay a better foundation, well, there may be some problems. We\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the court revisited the issue of the admissibility of the defense\u2019s expert witnesses. The State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">They keep talking about this impulsive psychiatric profile that he has. But there is a huge missing piece in between. There is no evidence before the trier of fact here that this crime occurred as the result of an impulsive act of the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">The evidence seems to show quite the contrary. It\u2019s a long premeditated act. Even on the day in question, there were hours in which this event took place. The Defendant, in his conversations with his two doctors, appeared to have denied his involvement in the crime. There is no indication in the reports that he has admitted to a crime. What is the possible scenario within which their testimony relative to his ability to form premeditation or intent is relevant if there is no factual scenario that is in evidence to which that testimony is relevant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney asserted that he sought to offer evidence of appellant\u2019s psychological profile, including evidence about his impulse control disorder, to explain the two statements from 2001, which the State sought to attribute to appellant, and to address the element of premeditation. Further, he argued that the State put in issue the matters of premeditation and appellant\u2019s mental state, which the defense was entitled to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Before ruling, the trial court agreed to hear the defense expert testimony outside of the presence of the jury. Dr. Fiester was then received as an expert in the field of forensic psychiatry.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The defense asked Dr. Fiester whether she had formed any diagnostic conclusions about appellant. She responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>He reported symptoms of a conduct disorder during his adolescence. He reported psychotic symptoms including some paranoia and mildly delusional thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">He had symptoms of impulse control disorder, symptoms of a major depressive disorder, a life-long history of dysthymia, which is a disorder which involves chronic low level depressive symptoms that are intermittent over the course of years. That dysthymia had its onset during his early years, probably adolescence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">He also reported symptoms of panic attack since the age of 21 and some symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. I also felt, although it can\u2019t be a definitive diagnosis because of the presence of the other major disorders that he had some traits of borderline personality disorder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Defense counsel also questioned Dr. Fiester about appellant\u2019s impulse control disorder. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: In terms of the impulse control disorder, could you explain what that is to the Court as it relates to Mr. Bryant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">[DR. FIESTER]: Impulse control disorder, yes. Again, I\u2019d like to be able to [refer] to the DSM-IVTR, which is the really gold standard diagnostic manual for the psychiatric disorders. An impulse control disorder is a disorder which has an essential feature which involves the occurrence of discrete episodes of a failure to control or resist aggressive impulses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">That failure can result in serious assaultive acts towards persons or property. The other important aspect of that is that the aggressiveness expressed is grossly] out of proportion to provocation or the precipitating factors. So, if you look at a situation, you might wonder why an individual was reacting that profoundly and aggressively to a particular situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When you talk about an impulse control disorder, could you explain how that is relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>any allegation that there is planning [of] activities, or deliberations, or consideration, or premeditation of a violent act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvD\">[DR. FIESTER]: Yes. It\u2019s directly relevant because in that type of situation ... it may be a sort of unpredictable situation that precipitates this kind of reaction. The individual really is not able to control their behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">In fact, that\u2019s part of the definition of an impulse control disorder in the diagnostic manual. It is described actually, the description of the disorder as intense impulses to be aggressive prior to the aggressive acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">It may be associated with affective symptoms such as rage, increased energy, racing thoughts, and also some physical symptoms. There are symptoms somewhat similar to panic type symptoms, palpitations, chest tightness, hearing an echo, pressure in your head. Then the individual essentially explodes. That\u2019s essentially what the disorder involves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is it a fair statement that not all individuals are equally capable of forming and possessing the same types and degrees of intent to commit a violent act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">[DR. FIESTER]: You know, that is correct, yes. In addition, the ability to have that intent and the ability to control one\u2019s behavior can vary from moment-to-moment, day-today, month-to-month, or year-to-year in any given individual, even with a baseline set of personality or psychiatric symptoms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, if I understand your testimony, in determining the nature of, say, for example Mr. Bryant\u2019s intent, it is very relevant to consider whether he has this impulse control-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: I object. That\u2019s leading. I mean, who is testifying here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is it relevant to consider impulse control disorder in determining Mr. Bryant\u2019s intent to commit a particular violent act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>[DR. FIESTER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If you could, again, just explain that for the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">[DR. FIESTER]: Again, it is a failure to contain what can be overwhelming, immediate aggressive impulses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7h\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Have you had an opportunity to view any of the charging documents in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">[DR. FIESTER]: I\u2019ve viewed some of the Police documents. Certainly, by no means have I seen them all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMa\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What police documents did you review?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">[DR. FIESTER]: I have the pre-sentence investigation, the event report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The event report. The event report was for the incident that occurred on July 20, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aer\">[DR. FIESTER]: Let me just verify that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">(Pause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">Yes, 07/20/02. I have other documents as well. I believe there are sev\u00e9ral renditions. There might be several renditions of that. I guess I have a media report. There are several event reports, I believe, by different people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoV\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is there a connection or a nexus between an impulse control disorder of the type that you have determined that Mr. Bryant suffers from and the allegations that you have reviewed in the statement of events or summary of events?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">[DR. FIESTER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">[DR. FIESTER]: That my understanding is that Mr. Bryant has been charged with murder, essentially, and that the nexus between the two is that an impulse control disorder can lead an individual in certain circumstances to experience overwhelming aggressive urges that could result in them acting out those urges, and could result in an assaultive act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Again, when you\u2019re saying \u201cimpulsive,\u201d when I think of impulsive, that means sudden, spontaneous, without planning, and deliberation. Is that an accurate way to define impulse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">[DR. FIESTER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Dr. Fiester, the question is, if the Defendant is in a Court proceeding and there is a voice speaking, and the Defendant appears agitated by that voice, and then interrupts that voice, and then has a verbal outburst and makes threats, is that evidence of an impulse control disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">[DR. FIESTER]:.... I can say yes, that information is consistent with an impulse control disorder. In fact, if you look at the associated features of the disorder as described in the DSM-IVTR, it says that signs of general impulsivity or aggression may be present between explosive episodes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">Let\u2019s not forget the impulse control disorder means physically assaultive acts. So, it says that individuals with this disorder may report problems with chronic anger and frequent sub-threshold episodes. In other words, they don\u2019t lose it and attack someone, but they experience aggressive impulses, but either manage to resist acting on them or engage in less destructive aggressive behavior, such as screaming, punching a wall without damaging it, et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">So, a verbal tirade instead of actually acting out the aggressive impulse by beating someone up or harming them seriously is completely consistent with the features of this intermittent explosive disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">During cross-examination, the following occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">[PROSECUTOR]: My question is you testified earlier that intermittent explosive disorder from month-to-month or from day-to-day it in fact can be different, isn\u2019t that true, in terms of its impact on an individual? Just because you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>diagnose someone with impulse disorder or intermittent impulse disorder, the effect of that disorder can be different from day-to-day or month-to-month, to use your words. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">[DR. FIESTER]: No. I believe that\u2019s not quite accurate. I said that each state of the individual and their degree to which they can resist an impulse, aggressive impulse can vary from time-to-time, but the key core characteristic of the disorder is having episodes where you are unable to resist that aggressive episode.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: So, the effect of the disorder does vary from day-to-day. The effect of the disorder varies from day-to-day and month-to-month by degree. Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">[DR. FIESTER]: I\u2019m not exactly sure I would say it is the effect of the disorder.... The disorder is present all the time, but the ability of the individual to resist those impulses can vary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Following the State\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Fiester, the trial court inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">THE COURT: You are not saying, are you, that every person or even this person who has impulse control disorder isn\u2019t capable of controlling his actions, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">THE WITNESS: At all points in time, no. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3n\">THE COURT: So, anyone with this disorder is capable of planning a future action. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">THE WITNESS: Yes. Just the presence of the disorder itself, without further information, would [lead] me to say that it\u2019s possible an individual that carries this diagnosis could plan a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Questioning by defense counsel and the State continued, followed by argument from counsel. Ultimately, the trial court declined to admit Dr. Fiester\u2019s testimony and commented. It ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">I am holding that [Dr. Fiester\u2019s] testimony is not competent and is not relevant to this case. There is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>that there was an absence of a particular mental element of the crimes charged in this case. At the most, we have testimony from Dr. Fiester that the defendant suffers from impulse control disorder, which affects him from time-to-time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">Whether that disorder affected him at the time of the crimes committed here would be completely speculative. This testimony would not assist the jury, but would rather confuse them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to admit Dr. Fiester\u2019s testimony. He maintains that the testimony was \u201cdirectly relevant to the issue of premeditation.\u201d Moreover, he asserts: \u201cThis error precluded Appellant from presenting any defense and reversal is clearly warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Bryant explains that the doctor\u2019s testimony would make it \u201cmore probable\u201d that the crimes were not the result of premeditation, because he was suffering from an impulse control disorder at the time of the murder. Moreover, he contends that \u201cthe factual predicate\u201d for the testimony was established \u201cin the State\u2019s own case.\u201d Therefore, he insists that his own \u201ctestimony was not required to establish the relevancy of his psychological profile testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Further, appellant claims that the doctor\u2019s testimony was relevant in light of Sargeant\u2019s testimony about appellant\u2019s comments during the routine medical screening at the Detention Center. Additionally, appellant contends that the testimony was relevant because \u201cit was never established at trial that the individual seen in [Ms. Martin\u2019s] neighborhood was in fact Appellant.\u201d As a result, the jury might have believed, as argued by defense counsel in closing argument, that appellant was not agitated when he left the visitation coordinator\u2019s office, which \u201copens the possibility that the acts were impulsive and not premeditated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Moreover, while recognizing the discretion of the trial judge in regard to \u201cpsychological profile evidence,\u201d Bryant notes that the discretion is not \u201cunfettered.\u201d He asserts: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>right of a defendant to call witnesses in his behalf is protected by both the confrontation clause and the due process clause of the federal constitution.\u201d In his view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATB\">the exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion effectively denied Appellant his right to present a defense. In fact, the entire theory of the defense and cross examination of witnesses was tailored to present a defense of mitigation, as opposed to denial. This was made clear even by the defense closing, which spent a <em>de minimis </em>amount of time on denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The State responds: \u201cContrary to Bryant\u2019s argument, the trial court, after hearing the argument of counsel and testimony of one of the experts outside the presence of the jury, correctly determined that the testimony was irrelevant, speculative, confusing, and of no assistance to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Maryland Rule 5-702 provides for the admissibility of expert testimony. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The admissibility of expert testimony is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>370 Md. 191, 200, 803 A.2d 1034 (2002); <em>Deese v. State, </em>367 Md. 293, 302, 786 A.2d 751 (2001). The' court\u2019s action in admitting or excluding such testimony seldom constitutes ground for reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 302-03, 786 A.2d 751; <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 659, 612 A.2d 258 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993); <em>Diaz v. State, </em>129 Md.

State, </em>350 Md. 633, 714 A.2d 864 (1998), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">According to Md. Rule 5-702, which codified the modern common-law rule regarding expert testimony, a trial court must determine whether the evidence to be presented is a proper subject of expert testimony. The inquiry turns on whether the trier of fact will receive appreciable help from the expert testimony in order to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. The trial court need not consider whether the trier of fact could possibly decide the issue without the expert testimony. Nor must the subject of the expert testimony be so far beyond the level of skill and comprehension of the average layperson that the trier of fact would have no understanding of the subject matter without the expert\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">In ascertaining whether expert testimony will be helpful to the trier of fact, a trial court must instead determine whether certain requirements have been satisfied: (1) the proposed witness must be qualified to testify as an expert; (2) the subject matter about which the witness will testify must be appropriate for expert testimony; and (3) there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>must be a legally sufficient factual basis to support the expert\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 649, 714 A.2d 864 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Here, appellant sought to admit expert testimony concerning the relationship of appellant\u2019s mental disorder to the <em>mens rea </em>of premeditation. The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXX\">[EJvidence demonstrating a lack of <em>mens rea </em>serves a different purpose from evidence demonstrating that the defendant was insane at the time of the crime and hence not criminally responsible. The first type of evidence is offered to negate an indispensable element of the crime and bears on culpability (i.e., guilt or innocence). The second type is offered to establish insanity and impacts not upon culpability but rather upon the appropriateness <em>vel non </em>of criminal punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">[WJhere a particular mental element of a crime must be proved to establish the commission of a crime, evidence that it did not exist, whether due to mental impairment or some other reason relevant to that issue, is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\"><em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 494, 495, 536 A.2d 622 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\"><em>Hoey </em>was followed by <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988). In that case, the Court also addressed the admissibility of such expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Simmons was accused of murder and raised the defense of imperfect self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 542 A.2d 1258. At trial, Simmons sought the admission of expert testimony concerning his state of mind at the time of the offense. He proffered that he would testify that, at the time of the homicide, he believed that the use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury. The defense\u2019s expert, a psychiatrist, would then testify that her examination of Simmons revealed that he did, in fact, have such a subjective belief. <em>Id. </em>at 36, 542 A.2d 1258. The trial court ruled that the expert\u2019s testimony would usurp the jury\u2019s function. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Simmons then made <em>a </em>second proffer. He claimed that the psychiatrist would testify only that the defendant\u2019s subjective belief would be consistent with his psychiatric profile. The trial court would not allow testimony as to Simmons\u2019s thought processes at the time of the homicide. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, Simmons never called the psychiatrist as a witness, and was convicted of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the trial court\u2019s ruling was \u201ctoo broad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 542 A.2d 1258. The Court commented: \u201cAs we see it, the proffered testimony tended to prove an element of imperfect self-defense.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 542 A.2d 1258. The Court added: \u201cIn light of <em>Hoey v. State, </em>Simmons is permitted to present evidence of his mental state in support of his defense of imperfect self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39 n. 3, 542 A.2d 1258. Concluding that psychiatric evidence that was limited to the psychological profile of the defendant was admissible, <em>id. </em>at 46, 542 A.2d 1258, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">[T]he proffered testimony has some relevance in that consistency between the specific subjective belief testified to by Simmons and Simmons\u2019s psychological profile tends to make it more likely that Simmons in fact held that subjective belief.... Here the judge did not purport to exclude the evidence by the exercise of discretion so that no issue of discretion is before us. The judge erroneously ruled, as a matter of law, that the evidence could not, under any circumstances, be admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">As the evidence sought to be admitted may have been sufficient to convince the jury that the defendant, if guilty, was guilty of a crime less than murder, its exclusion constitutes reversible <em>error. </em>Accordingly, Simmons must be granted a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\"><em>Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 48, 542 A.2d 1258 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\"><em>White, supra, </em>142 Md.App. 535, 790 A.2d 754, is also illuminating. Writing for this Court, Judge Adkins addressed the lessons of <em>Simmons:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\"><em>Simmons </em>established two categories of psychiatric expert testimony, one which is inadmissible as a matter of law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>one which is admissible at the discretion of the trial court. The first category of testimony, under which the expert testifies that the defendant was <em>in fact </em>suffering from a specific psychiatric disorder on the date in question, is inadmissible as a matter of law because it usurps the jury\u2019s function and because a psychiatrist \u201ccannot precisely reconstruct the emotions of a person at a specific time.\u201d <em>[Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 48, 542 A.2d 1258]. In the trial court\u2019s discretion, however, an expert may testify as to a defendant\u2019s psychiatric profile, from which the jury might <em>infer </em>that the defendant was suffering from the symptoms of that psychiatric disorder on the date in question. \u201c[T]he proffered [expert] testimony has some relevance in that consistency between the specific subjective belief testified to by [the defendant] and [the defendant\u2019s] psychological profile tends to make it more likely that [the defendant] in fact held that subjective belief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 545, 790 A.2d 754 (emphasis and alterations added in <em>White).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We are also guided by <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 611 A.2d 581 (1992). In that case, the trial court declined to admit expert testimony with regard to Hartless\u2019s state of mind at the time of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 611 A.2d 581. After the trial court so ruled, Hartless argued that the psychiatrist should be permitted to testify to his psychological profile, claiming that such testimony was admissible under <em>Simmons. Id. </em>at 574, 611 A.2d 581. The defense proffered that the profile would include: \u201cThat the defendant was under a tremendous amount of stress from his father and the background of the defendant in relating to that....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 611 A.2d 581. During discussions with the prosecutor and defense counsel, the trial court insisted that, in order for the psychological profile to be admissible, it must have more relevance than merely \u201c \u2018narrating the social history of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 611 A.2d 581 (citation omitted). The trial court excluded the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony because it lacked an adequate factual basis and was not relevant to a material issue in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 611 A.2d 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Concluding that the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony was properly excluded with respect to state of mind, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL4\">[Psychiatrists have not been shown to have the ability to precisely reconstruct the emotions of a person at a specific time, and thus ordinarily are not competent to express an opinion as to the belief or intent which a person in fact harbored at a particular time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 573, 611 A.2d 581 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Court of Appeals also determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion with respect to the ruling pertaining to psychological profile. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">We hold that the exclusion of [the expert witness\u2019s] psychological profile testimony did not amount to a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court. The record reflects that the court did not believe the psychological profile testimony was relevant to any issues in the case or to any defense generated by the defendant, or would be of appreciable help to the jury. This holding does not appear to be clearly in error, and we disagree with Hartless that it is inconsistent with our decision in <em>Simmons. </em>As already mentioned, in <em>Simmons </em>we found the psychological profile testimony to have relevance because the defense had proffered that the testimony would come after the defendant had first testified to his mental state at the time of the crime, and the profile testimony would support the imperfect self-defense claim proffered by the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">[T]he proffered testimony has some relevance in that consistency between the specific subjective belief testified to by Simmons and Simmons\u2019s psychological profile tends to make it more likely that Simmons in fact held that subjective belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\"><em>Hartless, </em>327 Md. at 577, 611 A.2d 581 (quoting <em>Simmons, supra, </em>313 Md. at 48, 542 A.2d 1258).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In the <em>Hartless </em>case, the psychological testimony, standing alone, \u201chad little or no rational nexus to the issues of premeditation and intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was thus unclear how a jury could have found the profile helpful in resolving those issues. The Court explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The absence of a nexus between a psychological profile of the defendant that [the expert] might have been able to relate and the issues before the jury resulted, at least in part, from the absence of an adequate evidentiary foundation. As the trial judge noted, the defendant failed to produce admissible evidence of some facts that [the psychiatrist] wished to rely on in determining the defendant\u2019s psychological background, and failed to produce evidence of particular facts relating to the occurrence of the criminal event, <em>i.e., </em>the defendant\u2019s version of what happened, that were essential, not only to the formation of the expert\u2019s opinion but to the relevance of that opinion to the issues in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>State v. Smullen, supra, </em>380 Md. 233, 844 A.2d 429, is also instructive. In that case, the defendant, a teenager, was accused of murdering his adoptive father. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 844 A.2d 429. Claiming he had been abused by his father, the defendant asserted that he acted in self-defense, and sought to rely on the Battered Child Syndrome. <em>Id. </em>However, the trial court refused to allow him to present expert psychiatric evidence concerning the syndrome. Moreover, concluding that the issue of self-defense was not generated by the facts, the trial court refused to instruct the jury as to self-defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals unanimously held that Battered Spouse Syndrome, as recognized in C.J. \u00a7 10-916, \u201capplies as well to battered children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 844 A.2d 429. However, a divided Court concluded that the defense was not relevant, because the issue of self-defense had not been \u201csufficiently generated ...\u201d by the facts. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 844 A.2d 429. Among other things, the majority observed that \u201cthe <em>objective </em>evidence demonstrated a classic first degree premeditated murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 844 A.2d 429 (emphasis in original). Moreover, it pointed out that \u201c[t]here was no evidence ... of the kind of repetitive cycle of violence that lies at the heart of [battered child] syndrome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 273-74, 844 A.2d 429:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">When a defendant claiming self-defense offers foundational evidence which, if believed, would establish the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>pattern of abuse sufficient to provide a base for an expert opinion as to the battered spouse/child syndrome, it should be admitted, so that it can be followed by the expert testimony. The syndrome evidence would then play its proper role in explaining why and how, in light of that pattern of abuse, the defendant could honestly, and perhaps reasonably, perceive an imminent threat of immediate danger. To permit that kind of evidence in a case such as this, however, would detach the syndrome from its proper mooring and allow the jury to find that random and undefined acts of abuse perpetrated at undefined times in the past, none of which apparently caused serious physical injury, or required any medical attention, or attracted the notice of anyone in a position to notice them, can reduce a classic premeditated murder to manslaughter or acquittal. If used in that setting, the syndrome would, indeed, constitute an independent defense and assume a significance unsupported by the psychological pillars upon which it properly rests. We recognize the doctrine, but there was no evidentiary basis for it in this case.11</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>See also CSX Transp., Inc. v.

In that case, the defendant shot the victim and was convicted of second degree murder. On appeal, he claimed the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, on the ground that the evidence \u201cfairly generated the question of whether the shooter, 1) acted in hot-blooded response to legally adequate provocation or, 2) was entitled to claim imperfect self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 573 A.2d 1317. The Court of Appeals found \u201cno fault with the defendant\u2019s attempt to interpose inconsistent theories of defense and mitigation,\u201d <em>id., </em>but held that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a manslaughter instruction. <em>Id.; see id. </em>at 548, 573 A.2d 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In <em>Sims, </em>the defendant testified in his own defense. He argued that the jury was entitled to consider his \u201csubjective state of mind,\u201d despite the lack of any evidence concerning the beliefs of the assailant. <em>Id. </em>at 554, 573 A.2d 1317. What the Court said is noteworthy here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">As we pointed out above, the defendant has the burden of presenting some evidence sufficient to reasonably generate the issue. The issue in this instance involved the honestly held subjective feelings of the perpetrator at the moment of the shooting. <em>When the defendant maintains that he was not the perpetrator, this becomes a very difficult, though probably not </em>impossible,[1 <em>burden to meet. </em>In this case, the defendant did not meet that burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 573 A.2d 1317 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Drawing on the cases and treatise cited above, it appears to us that there was no factual predicate for the expert testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ny; there was no nexus between Dr. Fiester\u2019s proffered testimony and the particular facts of this case. Among other things, appellant never acknowledged that he murdered Ms. Martin. Therefore, it is not clear how testimony about an alleged impulse disorder would have been relevant to explain conduct that appellant denied. Put another way, appellant did not intend to present any evidence that would make the testimony that he suffered from the impulse control disorder relevant to his ability to form the requisite <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Moreover, the objective evidence clearly showed that the murderer acted with premeditation. We note, for example, that an individual was seen pacing near Ms. Martin\u2019s residence for hours before the murder, and the same person questioned a boy to learn where Ms. Martin lived. Inside Ms. Martin\u2019s residence, the cord to one telephone was cut and the other was missing. Two knives were found, as was a stick used to sharpen knives. This conduct is the antithesis of an impulsive act. Therefore, Dr. Fiester\u2019s testimony would not have made it more likely that the murderer acted without premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In addition, although appellant sought to admit expert testimony that he suffered from an impulse disorder, Dr. Fiester indicated that, even with the disorder, appellant was still sometimes able to control his impulses and he would be capable of planning a crime. Accordingly, the effect of the disorder on appellant\u2019s ability to form the requisite <em>mens rea, </em>and in explaining his earlier threats against Ms. Martin, was speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The trial court was of the view that evidence of appellant\u2019s impulse disorder or his psychological profile would not assist the jurors and would serve to confuse them. As we see it, the court did not err, because there was no factual predicate for the expert testimony. Nor did the court abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Fiester\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Appellant further claims that, by excluding Dr. Fiester\u2019s testimony the trial court prevented him from calling a witness on his behalf. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>In <em>Redditt v. State, </em>337 Md. 621, 655 A.2d 390 (1995), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">The right of criminal defendants to call witnesses on their behalf is protected by the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">The right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies. Just as an accused has the right to confront the prosecution\u2019s witnesses for the purpose of challenging their testimony, he has the right to present his own witnesses to establish a defense. This right is a fundamental element of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 655 A.2d 390 (quoting <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Here, as discussed <em>swpra, </em>Dr. Fiester\u2019s testimony was not relevant to the issues in the case. The doctor\u2019s testimony would merely have presented evidence that appellant suffered from an impulse control disorder, which sometimes prevented him from controlling his aggressive impulses. There was simply no evidence that Ms. Martin\u2019s murder was the result of an impulsive act. Appellant\u2019s due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the statements he made to Sargeant on April 9, 2001, during the medical intake screening at the Montgomery County Detention Center. Appellant alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the statements were privileged under Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 9-109 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), because they were made to a professional for the purpose of diagnos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ing or treating the mental or emotional disorder of a patient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant also claimed that the statements were irrelevant as they were made more than a year prior to Ms. Martin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">At a hearing on the motion, Arthur Wallenstein, the Director of the Montgomery County Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, testified that the detention facility conducts a routine intake medical screening of every inmate entering the system and that their \u201csole and only focus was health care delivery.\u201d He added that the purpose of the screening is diagnostic and evaluative, is \u201cconducted by a qualified medical professional,\u201d and includes mental health screening. The intake screening is then maintained as part of the inmate\u2019s medical record. On cross-examination, Wallenstein was asked if there could be any referrals as a result of the screenings. He responded: \u201cMost likely not to the psychiatrist. The initial screening in our system would be to our crisis intervention unit or to an intake mental health screener ... to someone who is trained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Cynthia Sargeant, a registered nurse \u201cspecializing in psychiatric nursing,\u201d stated that she had \u201cno advanced practice degree in psychiatric nursing.\u201d She explained that a medical intake screening is done for every inmate who comes into the detention center, stating: \u201cThe purpose of our meeting is for medical screening and obtaining medical information.\u201d She maintained, however, that she \u201cwas not doing medical care and treatment.\u201d Rather, she was simply doing an \u201cintake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">According to Sargeant, if she believed during the screening that a mental health referral was necessary, she would \u201cfill out a mental health referral form[.]\u201d Indeed, she completed a referral for appellant to the \u201cCIU staff.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Sargeant sometimes worked with the psychiatrist, she only transcribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>orders for medications and did not take part in any therapy with the patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Sargeant\u2019s notes indicated that appellant used the word \u201cobsession\u201d during the intake. He also stated that, as a result of his obsession, he was requesting mental health treatment. Sargeant believed that appellant thought his statements were related to mental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">After the testimony, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">Judge, I\u2019m going to renew my objection to the nurse testifying in this matter. It\u2019s apparent, based on this witnesses] testimony, that this is part of a delivery of medical services to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">And if you look at the Courts and Judicial Proceedings 9-109 A-3, based on this witnesses]; testimony, we have a nurse with some \u2014 we have a health care professional that is doing an intake here in this case of the defendant who is an inmate for a diagnostic, and evaluative purposes who then passes this information along for purposes of medical disposition of inmate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">Now, this couldn\u2019t more clearly fall within the privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Moreover, defendant counsel argued that the statements were irrelevant and lacked probative value. He based this contention on the fact that the statements were made over a year before Ms. Martin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Two days after the hearing, in a written Opinion and Order, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">Defendant\u2019s ... claim of privilege is that the Defendant\u2019s statements to the medical intake screener at the Montgomery County Detention Center (\u201cMCDC\u201d) qualify as \u201cCommunications between patient and psychiatrist or psychologist\u201d as defined in Section 9-109 of the Courts Article. Under Section 9-109(b), a \u201cpatient\u201d has the privilege and the right to prevent disclosure of \u201c(1) [cjommunications relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient; or (2)[a]ny information that by its nature would show the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>medical record of the diagnosis or treatment.\u201d The term \u201cpatient\u201d is defined under Section 9-109(a)(3):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cPatient\u201d means a person who communicates or receives services regarding the diagnosis or treatment of his mental or emotional disorder from a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, <em>or any other person participating directly or vitally with either in rendering those services in consultation mth or under direct supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Initially, the court must take notice of the fact that \u201c \u2018[privilege statutes must be narrowly construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shady Grove Psychiatric Group v.

The Court must also \u201crecogniz[e] that a patient\u2019s interest in privacy must always be balanced against the judicial system\u2019s goal of ascertaining the truth ... [and] that the appropriate application of the privilege should be resolved on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Shady Grove v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 163 at 177, 736 A.2d 1168 (citing <em>Weisbeck v. Hess, </em>524 N.W.2d 363).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">The Court finds that the Defendant is not a \u201cpatient\u201d as defined under Section 9-109(a)(3). The Defendant communicated information to a medical intake screener at MCDC who is an RN. The intake screener\u2019s duties are to take information from recent inmates concerning their whole medical condition. Information concerning their mental health status is one of ma[n]y topics about which the inmate is queried. Based upon the responses to the questions the intake screener will make appropriate referrals to health professionals. The intake screener at MCDC cannot be construed as <em>\u201ca person participating directly or vitally with [a psychiatrist or psychologist] in rendering ... services in consultation with or under direct supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist </em>\u201d as defined in Section 9-109(a)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAe\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We begin our analysis with C.J. \u00a7 9-109, entitled \u201cCommunications between patient and psychiatrist or psychologist.\u201d It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>(b) <em>Privilege generally. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise provided, in all judicial, legislative, or administrative proceedings, a patient or the patient\u2019s authorized representative has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent a witness from disclosing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">(1) Communications relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">(2) Any information that by its nature would show the existence of a medical record of the diagnosis or treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The definition of \u201cpatient\u201d in C.J. \u00a7 9-109(a)(3) is also pertinent.

He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">The Montgomery County Detention Center is required as a matter of Maryland Statute and constitutional law to provide an inmate with the appropriate level of care, including mental health treatment. The routine medical intake screening, conducted by Nurse Sargeant in the present case, is one of the means to provide that care. The fact that part of the screening is for the purpose of obtaining a diagnosis and treatment for a mental health disorder makes the communication privileged and the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce those privileged communications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent. <em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 57, 862 A.2d 419 (2004); <em>Consolidated Construction Svcs. v. Simpson, </em>372 Md. 434, 456, 813 A.2d 260 (2002). \u201cThe starting point in statutory interpretation is with an examination of the language of the statute. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written,\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994); <em>see Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003); <em>Gillespie v.

State, </em>98 Md.App. 348, 368, 633 A.2d 455 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>As we noted, appellant argues that his statements to the nurse were privileged because he was a \u201cpatient\u201d during the medical screening. Under the principles of statutory construction, we generally ascribe to the legislative terminology the \u201c[o]rdinary and popular understanding\u201d of a particular term. <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484 (2004). In deciding the meaning of a statutory term or phrase, we may consult the dictionary. <em>Dep\u2019t. of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l. Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n., </em>348 Md. 2, 14, 702 A.2d 690 (1997); <em>Rouse-Fairwood Limited Partnership v. Supervisor of Assessments of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>120 Md.App. 667, 687, 708 A.2d 19 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Applying the principles of statutory construction outlined above, we conclude that appellant\u2019s statements to Sargeant were not privileged. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The common definition of the word \u201cpatient,\u201d when used as a noun, is \u201can individual awaiting or under medical care and treatment.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, at 908 (11th ed.2003). In light of the testimony of both Wallenstein and Sargeant, appellant was not a patient at the relevant time. Rather, he was an inmate undergoing routine screening at the Detention Center. By responding to Sargeant\u2019s questions during the screening, Bryant was not transformed into a patient; Sargeant did not provide \u201ctreatment or services\u201d to appellant under C.J. \u00a7 5-609(a)(2)(ii). That appellant might later become a patient, based on Sargeant\u2019s subsequent referral, does not alter the fact that he was not a patient within the meaning of C.J. \u00a7 9-109(a)(3) when Sargeant completed the screening form.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In any event, under C.J. \u00a7 5-609(b), if Sargeant were a mental health care provider, she would have been required \u201cto provide protection from a patient\u2019s violent behavior\u201d if she \u201cknew of the patient\u2019s propensity for violence and the patient indicated ... by speech, conduct, or writing, of the patient\u2019s intention to inflict imminent physical injury upon a specified victim.... \u201d C.J. \u00a7 5 \u2014 609(c)(2)(iii) provides that the duty is \u201cdischarged\u201d if the mental health care provider \u201cmakes rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>sonable and timely efforts to ... [ijnform the appropriate law enforcement agency\u201d about the \u201cthreat\u201d or the \u201cspecified victim....\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Further, the trial court found that while Sargeant was gathering information for the purpose of possible treatment or diagnosis, she was not participating \u201cdirectly or vitally\u201d with a psychiatrist or psychologist in rendering treatment services to appellant. To the contrary, the nurse testified that she was not involved in inmate therapy and did not work with any psychiatrist or psychologist in connection with such treatment. And, even if appellant was eventually treated by a psychiatrist, Sargeant played no role in his therapy. Thus, the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellant also maintains that the trial court failed to address his relevancy argument. In his view, there was no relevance to appellant\u2019s statement, made on April 9, 2001, that he had \u201cdefinite plans to kill [Ms. Martin] today,\u201d in that Ms. Martin was not killed until July 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We reject appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence of his statements in court and to Sargeant on April 9, 2001, were not relevant to the issues in the case. Bryant denied that he killed Ms. Martin. His statements on that date, to the effect that he intended to kill Ms. Martin and enjoyed seeing her blood, were probative of whether Bryant was, indeed, the one who killed Ms. Martin. They were also probative of the element of premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">To be sure, one of the statements appellant made referred to his plans to kill Ms. Martin \u201ctoday,\u201d but it was one of many threatening statements that included no time frame. Moreover, that appellant had plans to kill Ms. Martin \u201ctoday\u201d did not mean that he abandoned those plans when the day passed without appellant following through on his plan. In addition, the evidence demonstrated that there was no abating of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>animosity between appellant and Ms. Martin. The victim sought to prevent appellant from discovering her whereabouts, and appellant was still required to have supervised visitation with his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The admissibility of evidence is generally vested in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 176, 729 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999); <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231 (1998); <em>Blair v.

State, </em>332 Md. 456, 472 n. 7, 632 A.2d 152 (1993) (\u201cEvidence is relevant (and/or material) when it has a tendency to prove a proposition at issue in the case\u201d). \u201cClearly, the question of whether a given fact is \u2018material\u2019 and thus relevant, depends on the underlying facts of the case. \u2018Evidence is material if it tends to establish a proposition that has legal significance to the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v.
