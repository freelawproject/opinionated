Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 442(d). This subsection makes it unlawful for a person, who is not a regulated gun dealer, to \u201csell, rent, transfer, or purchase any regulated firearm\u201d until seven days after submission by the prospective purchaser or transferee of an application to purchase or transfer the firearm. We are asked to decide in particular whether the verb \u201ctransfer,\u201d as it is used in this subsection, includes a temporary exchange \u2014 a loan \u2014 of a firearm by its owner to another person. For the reasons we shall explain, we hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The statutory provisions at issue in this case are found within then Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 441 et seq. of the Maryland Code, the \u201cRegulated Firearms\u201d subheading. Specifically at issue are \u00a7\u00a7 442(d) and 449(f) of the subheading.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 442(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\"><em>Sale by other than regulated firearms dealer. </em>\u2014 (1) A person who is not a regulated firearms dealer may not sell, rent, <em>transfer, </em>or purchase any regulated firearm until after 7 days shall have elapsed from the time an application to purchase or transfer shall have been executed by the prospective purchaser or transferee, in triplicate, and the original copy is forwarded by a regulated firearms dealer to the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Section 449(f) establishes the penalty for violation of \u00a7 442(d) and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Knowing participants in sale, rental, etc. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this section, any dealer or person who knowingly participates in the illegal sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt of a regulated firearm in violation of this subheading shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more that 5 years, or both....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Appellant, Todd Lin Chow, a District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department officer, was tried at a court trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, on charges that he violated \u00a7 442(d) for having transferred a gun he owned by lending it to a friend. Over appellant\u2019s objection that \u00a7 442(d) does not proscribe this conduct because it does not come within the meaning of the term \u201ctransfer,\u201d the court found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Appellant\u2019s friend, Man Nguyen, was the State\u2019s main witness at trial. Nguyen testified that, while driving his car on April 1, 2003, he was stopped by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department for a broken taillight. At that time, the police searched Nguyen\u2019s vehicle, and discovered a Glock semi-automatic pistol (not the weapon that is the subject of this appeal). The pistol was properly registered in Nguyen\u2019s name, but he did not have a permit to carry it. The police confiscated it in connection with their investigation of a recent murder of one of Nguyen\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The following day, Nguyen contacted appellant. Nguyen explained to appellant that this gun and other guns at his home had been confiscated by the police, and he was \u201canxious\u201d to buy another gun. He told appellant that he needed to purchase a gun for protection, by which he meant \u201c[hjome security,\u201d \u201c[s]o, [appellant] offered me his gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The two men arranged to meet later that day for lunch at a restaurant in Bowie, Maryland. Sometime during this meeting, appellant gave Nguyen a nine millimeter, semi-automatic handgun that he had owned since 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Nguyen told appellant that he wanted to test fire the weapon before purchasing it. The pair got into Nguyen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>vehicle and headed to a firing range in Upper Marlboro. En route, Nguyen received a business call on his cellular telephone, requiring that he abort the trip to the firing range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nguyen drove appellant back to the restaurant where appellant\u2019s car was parked and dropped him off. Appellant\u2019s weapon remained in Nguyen\u2019s car. No money was exchanged between Nguyen and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Soon thereafter, Nguyen contacted appellant by telephone. Nguyen testified: \u201cI was interested in buying it and I called him, and, you know, I told him I\u2019d give it back to him but he said, that\u2019s cool, just keep it in the house and he\u2019ll pick it up.\u201d Nguyen further testified that he anticipated the weapon would be returned to appellant \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Detective Donnie Judd testified as a State\u2019s witness. He reported that, on April 4, 2003, he and other members of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department stopped Nguyen on a warrant to arrest him for having illegally carried the gun that was found in his car three days earlier. In the ensuing search of Nguyen\u2019s car, the police discovered appellant\u2019s loaded handgun in the car\u2019s center console. Detective Judd ran an NCIC<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> check and determined that the handgun had not been reported stolen. The gun was test fired and determined to be operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Nguyen was arrested and taken to the police station, where he gave a four-page statement. The first paragraph of the statement addressed how he had obtained appellant\u2019s handgun, and that portion of the statement was admitted into evidence. It varied from Nguyen\u2019s trial testimony. Nguyen wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">I know [sic] [appellant] for 2-3 [years]. I was detain [sic] on 4-1-03 and PGPD took all my guns. Next [d]ay, I called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>[appellant] and asked him if I could hold on to his gun until I can get my guns back in a week or two because I felt uncomfortable without a gun[.] We then met at Olive Garden att [sic] 4pm in Bowie and had lunch and after that he give [sic] me his 9mm, out of a bag in the front Passengers [sic] seat[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Sergeant William Szimanski, of the State Police Licensing Division, Firearms Registration Section, performs background checks on persons purchasing regulated firearms in Maryland and deals with records concerning firearms purchases. He testified that the records related to appellant\u2019s handgun reflect that appellant bought the handgun in November 1996, and it was formally transferred to him on the 27th of that month, after completion of the weapon registration process. The records show no subsequent transfer of the handgun, and no application for a transfer of the gun from appellant to Nguyen.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Sergeant Guillermo Rivera, of the Office of Internal Affairs of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, also testified. He stated that appellant had not filed a stolen weapon report between November 17, 2001 and November 17, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, appellant made a motion for judgment of acquittal. Appellant argued that \u00a7 442(d) does not cover his conduct, which was simply a temporary exchange of the handgun. In the alternative, appellant argued that he did not \u201cknowingly\u201d violate the statute, as required by \u00a7 449(f), because the State did not prove that he knew the transferee, Nguyen, had not filed the application required by \u00a7 442(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The State countered that appellant\u2019s leaving the gun with Nguyen was a \u201ctransfer\u201d of it, and therefore was covered by \u00a7 442(d). The State further argued that appellant was aware of the requirements for transferring a handgun, because he had fulfilled those requirements himself when he purchased the gun in 1996. The State finally argued that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of transfer does not necessarily include the conveyance of title, and encompasses a mere loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>After hearing from counsel on both issues, the court denied the motion. Appellant then rested without putting on any evidence, and the court issued its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">The Court having reviewed the statute and now the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court finds based upon the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses that there was in fact a transfer in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">The Court also finds that based upon the facts that it was a temporary transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">It is the Court\u2019s assessment of the testimony of the State\u2019s witness that it was in fact a loan, although he has testified to two totally opposite things; he testified that it was in fact an anticipated purchase, and on the other hand, there was testimony or at least \u2014 yeah, there was testimony that it was in fact a loan. So, we have two inconsistent statements by the State\u2019s witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">And the State asks the Court or states to the Court\u2014 argues to the Court that under either theory, that there was an illegal transfer in this case. The Court agrees that there was an illegal transfer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The court then found appellant guilty of the charge and proceeded immediately to sentencing. The court imposed a $200.00 fine and a 60-day suspended sentence. On appeal, appellant challenges the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 442(d) and its finding that he \u201cknowingly\u201d violated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Appellant\u2019s first question is a purely legal one: What is meant by the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in the phrase in \u00a7 442(d) that makes it unlawful for a person to \u201csell, rent, transfer or purchase\u201d a regulated firearm without there first being compliance with the required application process? Appellant takes the position that the term does not contemplate a loan of a regulated firearm. Without directly stating what he believes the term means, he seems to argue that \u201ctransfer\u201d must mean \u201cgift,\u201d i.e., something that is not a sale or rental, and also is not a loan. The State disagrees, arguing that, by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>plain terms, \u00a7 442(d) prohibits <em>all </em>exchanges of regulated firearms: sales, rentals, and other transfers that are made without consideration, including both gifts and loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In deciding which position is correct, we must engage in statutory construction, the chief goal of which is to ascertain the actual intent of the Legislature when it enacted the statute. <em>See, e.g., Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 57, 862 A.2d 419 (2004). We begin our analysis by examining the plain language of the statute. <em>Hackley v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 1, 11, 866 A.2d 906 (2005). \u201cIn fact, all statutory interpretation begins, and usually ends, with the statutory text itself, for the legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through the statute\u2019s very words.\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003) (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018We view the words of a statute in ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hackley, </em>161 Md.App. at 11, 866 A.2d 906 (quoting <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426 (2002)). And we are cautioned not to add or delete language in a way that reflects an intent not reflected by the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. Price, 378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d 1221. \u201c[N]or may [we] construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018If the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends and we need investigate no further, but simply apply the statute as it reads.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hackley, </em>161 Md.App. at 11, 866 A.2d 906 (quoting <em>Gillespie, </em>370 Md. at 222, 804 A.2d 426).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Only when the statutory text is ambiguous do we resort to the rules of statutory construction. The Court of Appeals reemphasized this as recently as several months ago, in <em>Pete:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbM\">\u201cIn some cases, the statutory text reveals ambiguity, and then the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal. However, before judges may look to other sources for interpretation, first there must exist an ambiguity within the statute, i.e., two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>statute. Where the statutory language is free from such ambiguity, courts will neither look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent nor add to or delete words from the statute. Only when faced with ambiguity will courts consider both the literal or unusual meaning of the words as well as their meaning in light of the objectives and purposes of the enactment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">384 Md. at 58, 862 A.2d 419 (quoting <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We bear these principles in mind as we turn to the statutory provision at issue in this case. As we have mentioned, \u00a7 442 is part of the \u201cRegulated Firearms\u201d subheading of Article 27. Neither \u00a7 442 nor any other section within that subheading defines the word \u201ctransfer.\u201d Nonetheless, \u201c[ojrdinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation.\u201d <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484 (2004). Consequently, \u201c[w]e may consult a dictionary to discern the generally understood meaning of a word.\u201d <em>Hackley, </em>161 Md.App. at 14, 866 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The first definition of the verb \u201ctransfer\u201d in The Random House Dictionary of the English Language is \u201cto convey or remove from one place, person, etc., to another[.]\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 2009 (2nd ed. 1987) (\u201cRandom House\u201d). A similar first definition of the verb \u201ctransfer\u201d is found in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary: \u201cTo convey or remove from one place or one person to another; to pass or hand over from one to another, esp. to change over the possession or control of.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1536 (8th ed. 2004) (\u201cBlack\u2019s\u201d). These definitions are broad and both include a loan of the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">To be sure, other subsequently listed dictionary definitions of the verb \u201ctransfer\u201d are more in keeping with the construction given to it by appellant. Random House includes as the third definition of the verb: <em>\u201cLaw. </em>to make over the possession or control of: <em>to transfer a title to land.\u201d </em>Random House, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>supra, </em>at 2009. And Black\u2019s lists, as its second definition, \u201cTo sell or give.\u201d Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 1536. Similarly, Random House defines the noun form of the word \u201ctransfer\u201d as, <em>inter alia, \u201cLaw. </em>a conveyance, by sale, gift, or otherwise, of real or personal property, to another.\u201d Random House, <em>supra, </em>at 2009. And \u201cconveyance\u201d is defined, <em>inter alia, </em>as <em>\u201cLaw. </em>a. the transfer of property from one person to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We nevertheless decline appellant\u2019s invitation to ascribe to the verb \u201ctransfer,\u201d in \u00a7 442(d), a definition suggestive only of a permanent exchange of title or possession. There are several reasons why such a definition is inappropriate. First, it would run afoul of the rule that \u201c[o]rdinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation.\u201d <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Second, the context in which \u201ctransfer\u201d appears does not comport with the narrow definition appellant would have us give the word. Section 442(d) refers to three forms of firearm exchange: \u201csell [or purchase]\u201d, \u201crent,\u201d and \u201ctransfer.\u201d \u201cRent\u201d is defined in \u00a7 441(t) as the \u201ctemporary transfer of a regulated firearm for consideration where the firearm is taken from the firearm owner\u2019s property.\u201d \u201cSell\u201d and \u201cpurchase\u201d are not defined in the subheading, but we assume they carry their ordinary and popular meaning, and contemplate a permanent transfer for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u201cTransfer,\u201d then, must contemplate something different from \u201csell\u201d or \u201crent\u201d; otherwise, those terms would be surplusage. We strive to \u201cread statutes \u2018so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>See State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 134, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996) (quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 524, 636 A.2d 448 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Third, in context, \u201ctransfer\u201d cannot simply mean \u201cgift.\u201d Elsewhere in \u00a7 442 itself, the General Assembly used \u201cgift\u201d to exclude (with certain conditions) those forms of exchange from the prohibitions against straw purchases. <em>See </em>\u00a7 442(b)(2), (3) (providing that \u201c[t]he prohibitions <em>of </em>this [straw purchase] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>subsection do not apply to a person purchasing a regulated firearm as a gift,\u201d so long as there is compliance with the application requirement). Had the General Assembly intended to limit its meaning of the verb \u201ctransfer\u201d in \u00a7 442(d) to making a gift, we expect that the Legislature would have used that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">If transferring a regulated firearm is not limited to making a gift of the regulated firearm, as we have concluded it cannot be, then \u201ctransfer\u201d has a broader meaning that includes (even if not limited to) both the permanent exchange of title of the property without consideration (gift), and the temporary exchange of possession without consideration (loan). That \u201ctransfer\u201d includes, at the least, both gifts and loans is bolstered by the General Assembly\u2019s reference to \u201ctemporary transfer\u201d elsewhere in the firearms subheading. We have noted that rent is defined, in \u00a7 441(t), as a form of \u201ctemporary transfer.\u201d The same phrase is repeated in \u00a7 445(e)(2)(i), (iv). Those subsections permit the \u201ctemporary transfer\u201d of firearms in certain circumstances to persons under 21 years of age. It can be inferred from the General Assembly\u2019s use of the term \u201ctemporary transfer\u201d in the subheading that \u201ctransfer,\u201d without its modifier of \u201ctemporary,\u201d includes both temporary and permanent transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">It is also telling that the General Assembly repeated the word \u201ctransfer,\u201d in either its verb or noun form, elsewhere in \u00a7 442 itself and throughout the subheading, in a manner suggesting that the Legislature intended the word to be interpreted broadly. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 442(b)(3) (referring in general terms to \u201cpurchase or transfer a regulated firearm\u201d); \u00a7 442(d)(2) (referring to the \u201cprospective seller or transferor\u201d of a regulated firearm); \u00a7 445(a) (providing that all restrictions imposed by local laws on \u201cpossession or transfers by private parties of regulated firearms are superseded\u201d); \u00a7 445(e)(2)(ii) (permitting \u201c[t]he transfer [to a minor] by inheritance of title\u201d). In light of this, we cannot ascribe to the term, as it is used in \u00a7 442(d), a narrow meaning restricted essentially to \u201cgift,\u201d without contravening the tenet that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Legislature is presumed to have \u201c \u2018intended statutes that affect the same subject matter to blend into a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 65, 862 A.2d 419 (quoting <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Appellant declares that, if the General Assembly wanted to include loans in the proscriptions of \u00a7 442(d), it knew how to do so. He directs us to the section of the law requiring that every machine gun manufacturer keep a register of all machine guns manufactured or handled by him, including the \u201cdate of manufacture, sale, <em>loan, </em>gift, delivery, and reeeipt[.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 4-403(a)(2)(ii) of the Criminal Law Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The General Assembly, for reasons not evident from the legislative history of the Regulated Firearms subheading, has never used the word \u201cloan\u201d to describe firearm exchanges that come within the regulatory purview of that subheading. It does not follow, however, that \u201ctransfer\u201d in \u00a7 442(d) excludes a loan simply because the General Assembly has chosen to use one term in connection with machine guns, and another in connection with regulated firearms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>To accept appellant\u2019s proposed construction would mean that all regulated firearms could be freely lent by an owner to another person without complying with the strictures of regulation, but machine guns cannot. Indeed, a construction of \u00a7 442(d) that does not include the loan of a regulated firearm could result in a complete end-run around the statute. The General Assembly could not have intended such an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We conclude that attributing to the verb \u201ctransfer\u201d its ordinary meaning and reading the word in context makes plain the intent of \u00a7 442(d). The statute prohibits, among other forms of transfer, a loan of a regulated firearm without there first being compliance with the statute\u2019s requirement of an application and seven-day waiting period.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Finally, we understand that the rules of construction come into play only when a statute or portion of it is ambiguous. <em>See Price, </em>378 Md. at 388, 835 A.2d 1221. Yet, even when it is determined, as it has been here, that a statute is plain, we sometimes, \u201c[i]n the interest of completeness,\u201d examine \u201cthe purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d <em>Hackley, </em>161 Md.App. at 11, 866 A.2d 906 <em>(quoting Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946 (1993)); <em>accord Chilcoat v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>State, </em>155 Md.App. 394, 405, 843 A.2d 240, <em>cert. denied, </em>381 Md. 675, 851 A.2d 594 (2004). Our review of the legislative history of \u00a7 442(d) confirms our construction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Subsections (d) and (b) (the latter, proscribing, with certain exceptions, straw purchases) were added to \u00a7 442 in 1996. These additions to the law regulating the sale or transfer of firearms were a feature of the \u201cMaryland Gun Violence Act of 1996\u201d (\u201cAct\u201d), cross-filed as Senate Bill 215 and House Bill 297. These bills were \u201cAdministration\u201d bills, proposed by Governor Parris N. Glendening as \u201ca comprehensive proposal aimed at reducing the epidemic of gun violence\u201d in Maryland. Briefing Statement Before the Senate Judicial Proceeding Committee and the House Judiciary Committee (1996) (statement of Bonnie A. Kirkland, Chief Legislative Officer, Governor\u2019s Legislative Office, and Colonel David B. Mitchell, Superintendent of State Police), at 2 (\u201cBriefing Statement\u201d). The Briefing Statement explains: \u201cTo help accomplish this goal, the Maryland Gun Violence Act focuses on reducing the availability of handguns and assault weapons, which are defined in the bill as regulated firearms, to prohibited persons by diminishing the proliferation of illegal sales and transfers of firearms.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 564, 727 A.2d 947 (1999) (Raker, J., concurring) (recognizing that the regulated firearms provisions are part of an \u201celaborate statutory scheme[] designed to regulate the transfer of handguns[,]\u201d which, like the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act passed by Congress in 1968, has the purpose of \u201ccontrolfling] and, if possible, eliminating] gun violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Maryland\u2019s legislative scheme restricts possession of regulated firearms to persons who meet certain qualifications. The application that must be filed before taking possession of a regulated firearm includes, for example, a sworn statement by the applicant that he has never been convicted of a crime of violence, a felony, or certain misdemeanors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u00a7 442(h)(2)(i). Further, a regulated firearm cannot be transferred until seven days have elapsed from the filing of the application, presumably to allow time for the necessary \u201cbackground check.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 442(d), (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Section 442(d) in particular has the purpose of \u201cdisrupting] established gun trafficking patterns by reducing the supply of regulated firearms to the illegal market.\u201d Briefing Statement, at 5. To read \u00a7 442(d) as exempting the loan of a regulated firearm would undermine the laudable purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the legislative scheme. One cannot imagine that the General Assembly intended the unrestricted shifting of possession of a regulated firearm from one who lawfully possesses it to one who might not satisfy the requirements for gun possession laid out in \u00a7 442(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We also consider the nature of \u00a7 442(d) itself. The section is penal in the sense that a significant maximum penalty, of five years\u2019 imprisonment and a $10,000.00 fine, is prescribed for one who is convicted of \u201cknowingly participating\u201d in its violation. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 449(f); <em>see also Reisch v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 464, 478-79, 668 A.2d 970 (1995) (explaining that a significant penalty is indication that a statute is penal, even though it may also have remedial features), <em>cert. denied, </em>842 Md. 332, 675 A.2d 993 (1996). Yet, insofar as concerns the conduct that the General Assembly sought to regulate \u2014 the possession of a regulated firearm without the requisite permit \u2014 the statute is also remedial. <em>See Reisch, </em>107 Md.App. at 478-79, 668 A.2d 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">To serve its remedial purpose of \u201creducing the supply of regulated firearms to the illegal market,\u201d Briefing Statement, at 5, the terms of \u00a7 442(d) should be given a broad construction. <em>See Shade v. State, </em>306 Md. 372, 379, 509 A.2d 664 (1986) (stating that the remedial portions of a statute may be construed liberally, even though \u201cthe penal provisions must be strictly construed in favor of the accused\u201d). Broadly construed, the verb \u201ctransfer\u201d is not limited to \u201cmaking a gift\u201d but includes \u201clend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">For all of these reasons, we hold that plainly included within the meaning of \u201ctransfer\u201d of a regulated firearm, in \u00a7 442(d), is lending a firearm. The plain construction of the term is confirmed by an examination of the general purpose of the regulated firearms, and by the rule that the remedial portions of a statute are to be liberally construed. Therefore, a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>violates \u00a7 442(d) by lending a regulated firearm to another person without there first being compliance with the application process and seven-day waiting period set forth in that section.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Appellant next argues that the evidence presented by the State failed to establish that he possessed the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for a finding of guilty on the charge that he violated \u00a7 442(d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">When reviewing a conviction resulting from a court trial, we \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(c); <em>accord Taylor v. State, </em>346 Md. 452, 457, 697 A.2d 462 (1997); <em>Bryant v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 604, 622, 791 A.2d 161, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 179, 798 A.2d 552 (2002). There is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction if, \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 457, 697 A.2d 462 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cFurthermore, \u2018[wjeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whiting v. State, </em>160 Md.App. 285, 305, 863 A.2d 1017 (2004) (quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998)). \u201c[Circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to support a conviction, provided the circumstances support rational inferences from which the trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Painter v. State, </em>157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Md.App. 1, 11, 848 A.2d 692 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Tt is well settled that crimes generally require a particular <em>\u201cactus </em>reus[,] or guilty act[,]\u201d and a particular <em>\u201cmens real,] </em>... or mental state accompanying a forbidden act.\u201d <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 578, 632 A.2d 797 (1993). The <em>mens rea </em>that is required for conviction under \u00a7 442(d) is provided in \u00a7 449(f), which makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, imprisonment of not more than five years, or both, to <em>\u201cknowingly </em>participate! ] in the illegal sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt of a regulated firearm in violation of this subheading.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">No case of which we are aware discusses what is meant by the word \u201cknowingly,\u201d in \u00a7 449(f). Yet, as we shall discuss, it is plain that, in the context of the phrase \u201cknowingly participates in the violation\u201d of \u00a7 442(d), \u201cknowingly\u201d simply means that it must be shown that the defendant had knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense. Such is the meaning generally attributed to \u201cknowingly\u201d (or its variations) when used in this fashion in criminal statutes. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.2(b) (2d ed. 2003). This meaning of \u201cknowingly,\u201d moreover, comports with that given the same term elsewhere in the Criminal Law Article of the Maryland Code. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 ll-201(c) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d) (defining \u201cknowingly\u201d as meaning \u201chaving knowledge of the character and content of the matter\u201d); CL \u00a7 7-102(b) (defining knowing conduct in the theft statute, and stating that \u201c[a] person acts \u2018knowingly!,]\u2019 \u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwith respect to conduct or a circumstance as described by a statute that defines a crime, when the person is aware of the conduct or that the circumstance exists ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision of <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998), is particularly instructive. In that case, the Court was presented with the task of construing what is meant by the term \u201cwillfully,\u201d in the section that sets forth the penalty for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>violating certain provisions of the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act. <em>Id. </em>at 186-89, 118 S.Ct. 1939. <em>See generally </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(D). That act, incidentally, was enacted in part \u201cto protect law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms for lawful purposes.\u201d <em>Bryan, </em>524 U.S. at 187, 118 S.Ct. 1939. By the act, Congress amended certain provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to \u201cadd a scienter requirement as a condition to the imposition of penalties for most of the unlawful acts defined in \u00a7 922.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187-88, 118 S.Ct. 1939. Congress enacted, <em>inter alia, \u00a7 </em>924(a)(1), which at the time provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, subsection (b), (c), or (f) of this section, or in section 929, whoever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">(A) <em>knomngly </em>makes any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records of a person licensed under this chapter or in applying for any license or exemption or relief from disability under the provisions of this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">(B) <em>knowingly </em>violates subsection (a)(4), (f), (k), (r), (v), or (w) of section 922;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">(C) <em>knomngly </em>imports or brings into the United States or any possession thereof any firearm or ammunition in violation of section <em>922(1); </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">(D) <em>willfully </em>violates any other provision of this chapter, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\"><em>Bryan, </em>524 U.S. at 187, 188-89 n. 6, 118 S.Ct. 1939 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Of relevance to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the <em>Bryan </em>Court construed \u201cwillfully\u201d by reference to the term \u201cknowingly,\u201d in the same section. Bryan argued that a more particularized <em>mens rea </em>must be established in cases charging a violation of acts listed in \u00a7 924(a)(1)(D), because, <em>inter alia, </em>Congress otherwise used the word \u201cknowingly.\u201d The Court said in response: \u201cThis argument is not persuasive because the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u2018knowingly\u2019 does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law.\u201d 524 U.S. at 192, 118 S.Ct. 1939. Rather, \u201cunless the text of the statute dictates a different result,\u201d a statute that prohibits the \u201cknowing\u201d participation in an illegal act simply requires proof that the participant has \u201cknowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The Supreme Court came to the same conclusion, but in a different context, in <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980). In that case, the Court held that the government fulfills its burden of proving a knowing violation of the escape statute \u201cif it demonstrates that an escapee knew his actions would result in his leaving physical confinement without permission\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 100 S.Ct. 624. In other words, \u201c[t]he knowledge requisite to [a] knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.\u201d <em>Bryan, </em>524 U.S. at 192 n. 14, 118 S.Ct. 1939 (quoting with approval <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v.

The State, then, need only prove that the defendant participated in a transfer of a regulated firearm with the knowledge that a firearm (as opposed to some other item) was being intentionally (as opposed to accidentally) transferred. <em>Cf. Dawkins v.

We disagree with appellant that the State must also prove that the defendant knows that the transfer is being made without compliance with the application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Proof of knowledge \u201cmay be inferred as a matter of fact from the actor\u2019s conduct and the attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Young v. State, </em>303 Md. 298, 306, 493 A.2d 352 (1985). In this case, Nguyen wrote in his statement for the police that he asked appellant if he, Nguyen, \u201ccould hold on to [appellant\u2019s] gun until I can get my guns back in a week or two because I felt uncomfortable without a gun.\u201d And he testified at trial that appellant gave him the nine millimeter handgun so he could test fire it, as a precursor to a possible purchase. Nguyen also testified that, when he called appellant to remind him that he still had the gun, appellant said, \u201cthat\u2019s cool, just keep it in the house[,]\u201d and told Nguyen that he would pick it up in the near future. Further, as the State points out, there was evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5t\">[appellant] obviously knew that he was transferring the weapon to Nguyen. As a police officer, [appellant] also knew what needed to occur in order for Nguyen to gain possession of the gun. As testified to by Sergeant Szimanski, [appellant] himself had fulfilled those same requirements when he purchased his gun, filled out the necessary application, and then obtained possession of the gun after the necessary waiting period. These factors support the conclusion that [appellant] knew what was required in order to effect the transfer of the weapon and chose to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">As we have said, it is not required for a conviction of knowingly violating \u00a7 442(d) that appellant knew that the application process had not been completed, much less that it is illegal to transfer his handgun in the manner he did. Even so, there was presented in this case evidence that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>knew precisely what the law required and that he and Nguyen were circumventing it, making this a particularly egregious violation of the statute. Because the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the court\u2019s finding that appellant knowingly violated \u00a7 442(d), we shall not disturb that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\">.
