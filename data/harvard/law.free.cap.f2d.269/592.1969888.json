This is nothing new. Indeed, by answers to topical questions 1, 2 and 3 posed by the Court, at pages 722-723, we so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">But in attacking our holding that Nardelli had coverage (at least to the extent of the seller's security interest) as charterer under the Running Down Clause, note 3, an entirely new position is taken. Below and on initial submission here, coverage was denied, not because Nardelli was not a charterer, or that the Running Down Clause did not cover him generally as a charterer. It was denied because as to this collision, Wilson, the named Assured, had no personal liability so that the claim was not within the proviso <footnotemark>c</footnotemark> of the Running Down Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The Institute, speaking with the persuasive, if not authoritative, voice of one largely responsible for the drafting and promulgation of policy forms, with great candor disavows any such interpretation. The purpose of the proviso is merely to make certain that the liability be that of a shipowner and of a kind generally inhering in the ownership, operation, management and navigation of vessels. If the liability asserted against the charterer is of the kind for which an owner, in like position, would have a liability then the obligation to indemnify the charterer under the Running Down Clause exists.<footnotemark>d</footnotemark> Since a vessel owner, operating the M/V Narco would have a liability for a collision of the kind between M/V Narco and the Lolita, the policy applies if Nardelli was a charterer as used in the Running Down Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">This is made doubly clear by the acknowledgment that \u201cthe Collision Clause of the AITH 1951 policy form <em>standing alone </em>by its terms <em>insures any charterer </em>of the insured vessel against collision liability.\u201d<footnotemark>e</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied) And to this should be added the equally forthright statements immediately before and after the decisive conclusion set forth above, note d, supra. There it is frankly stated, \u201cWe do not believe that this proviso has any bearing on the main question which is whether in view of the specific limitations in the policy as to persons whose interests are covered, a charterer in the position of Nardelli * * * can claim to be insured under the general language of the Collision Clause.\u201d <footnotemark>f</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>This brings us to the <em>new </em>position. Now liability is denied because it is claimed that the term \u201ccharterer,\u201d broad enough generally to cover Nardelli and his liability for collision damage, must be restricted to those persons described in Clauses III(A) (B) (C), note 5. The reasoning behind this is quite unusual. The argument starts with provisions of the usual AITH form, admittedly absent here, followed by a transposition of them onto this mixed policy seeking to conglomerate an installment-purchase-property risk policy with hull and marine coverage. It is pointed out that the sweeping undertakings to a charterer in the Running Down Clause are limited in the regular use of the AITH form since that form provides for <em>termination </em>(cancellation) of the <em>whole </em>policy in the case of a charter not expressly approved by underwriters.<footnotemark>g</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Because this is so in the orthodox use of the Running Down Clause as a part of the AITH 1951 form,-it is then argued that such limitations must be imported into this hybrid policy, otherwise the insurer has no means of knowing of the reliability \u2014 moral, financial or practical \u2014of these unknown beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"> But this predicament is not a creature of the law. It is the result of the underwriter\u2019s own handiwork, subjecting it to all of the uncertainties inherent in such a process of policy \u201cdraftsmanship.\u201d Schmutz v. Employees\u2019 Fire Ins. Co., 2 Cir., 1935, 76 F.2d 119, 122, 1935 A.M.C. 1067, 1072; see also Calmar Steamship Corp. v. Scott, 1953, 345 U.S. 427, 432, 73 S.Ct. 739, 97 L.Ed. 1125, 1953 A.M.C. 952. To circumvent its self-made problem, the underwriter insists that Clause III (A) (B) (C) is the equivalent of the missing cancellation provision, note g, of the AITH 1951 form. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of Clause III refer by terms to single interest or double interest and obviously relate to the unique hazards of the installment-sales-lease-purchase arrangement. The term \u201ccharterer,\u201d used in the Running Down Clause, is not confined to any one of these, and is therefore an extension of insurance to persons other than those mentioned in (A) and (B) provided only that such person is a \u201ccharterer.\u201d Nor does the 30-day reporting requirement of Clause VI, note 5, and the terms of Clause III(C) extending the policy upon application to cover \u201cfor the account of others and not provided for in paragraphs III (A) and (B)\u201d offer any assistance. These terms are a part of the blended policy which states without restriction that \u201cif the * * * Charterers * * * in consequence of the insured vessel being at fault shall become liable to pay * * * damages * * * we, the Underwriter, will pay the Assured <em>or Charterers </em>* * Note 3. The undertaking is in no way restricted to those charterers as to whom application and notice has been made under Clause III(C) and VI. Nor can this limitation be implied on the analogy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>missing AITH provision, note g, supra. That is a cancellation clause of the <em>whole </em>coverage. Here Clause VI is not stated in the form of a condition subsequent respecting liabilities covered in the policy. Rather it requires application and 30-day reporting only for coverage <em>not </em>provided on the face of the policy. Of course, the face of this policy in the plainest terms states that it is for the benefit of the charterers to whom underwriters will make payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Of course, we are dealing with this policy as it comes to us. We are not dealing with the AITH 1951 form whose introductory provisions, note g, are obviously relevant to \u201ccharterer\u201d in the Running Down Clause. We allay the apprehensions that \u201cthe Institute is concerned because this Court\u2019s decision, if unexplained, may be regarded by other courts, or may be cited by counsel, for the proposition that the specific limitations on coverage at the beginning of the policy, which are intended to apply to the entire policy and to preclude claims by unknown and unapproved charterers, are for some reason not applicable to the Collision Clause and do not affect the extent of the coverage of charterers under the general language of that clause.\u201d The interpretation of that policy will be for another day unaffected by anything done or not done, said or unsaid in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">But while we hold that the briefs, either in the role of amicus curiae or as one taking up the cause as an interested advocate, fail on the points urged, we are of the view that the arguments demonstrate that our original opinion was erroneous in part and should be corrected. In it we applied the proviso, see note c, indirectly to allow the charterer to recover only to the extent of the security interest of the \u201cowners,\u201d i. e., the named assureds, Gibbs Corporation, C.I.T. Corporation and Robert A. Wilson. From the discussion here, it now appears that once we determine that Clauses III(A) (B) (C) do not restrict the term \u201ccharterer\u201d so as to obliterate liability altogether, the proviso does not exclude this claim because Wilson (or the other \u201cowners\u201d) had no personal liability. The Running Down Clause extends the insurance to Nardelli as charterer for this collision and up to the full amount of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">To this extent our previous opinion is. modified but otherwise the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b638-15\">.

The amicus curiae brief described the Institute as \u201ca non-profit, voluntary trade association of approximately 150 marine insurance companies, * * *. One of its activities is the preparation * * * of marine insurance policy forms and clauses which it approves and recommends to its member companies for their convenience and use in the writing of such business.

The Syndicate normally uses the Institute form of hull policy, at present the AITII 1951. form.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"c\">\n<p id=\"b639-14\">. See note 3, last 12 lines at page 721 and quoted at page 724.

The brief states, at page 17: \u201cThe purpose of this provision is to protect the underwriters in the event that the coverage granted by the Collision Clause extends to any other than the owner, against any liabilities which might arise in respect of the charterer which would be different in type or greater in amount than would have been incurred if the charterer had been in the position of an owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"e\">\n<p id=\"b639-20\">.

The proviso relates only to the nature of the liabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>for which the underwriter must make good, not the question of who is an additional assured as a \u201cCharterer\u201d under the Running Down Clause. The brief further states: \u201cThe final proviso of the Collision Clause is also relevant only after it has been determined whether the party claiming under the Collision Clause is otherwise eligible to protection against collision liability under the provisions of that clause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"g\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">. This record contains a copy of the AITH 1951 form. Its opening provisions, lines 3-13, provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">\u201cIn the event of any change, voluntary or otherwise, in the ownership of the Vessel or if the Vessel be placed under new management <em>or be chartered on a bareboat basis </em>or requisitioned on that basis, <em>then, unless the Underwriters agree thereto in writing, </em>this Policy shall thereupon become cancelled from the time of such change in ownership or management, charter or requisition; * * \u00bb. <em>This insurance shall not inure to the benefit of any such charterer or transferee of the Vessel, </em>* * *. The foregoing provisions with respect to cancellation in the event of change in ownership or management, charter or requisition shall apply even in the case of insurance \u2018for account of whom it may concern.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied in ami-cus brief pages 6-7)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b641-10\">TUTTLE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A0Su\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">With deference I dissent. The effect of the Court\u2019s decision here is to hold that where, in a policy of insurance, there is a section (III) entitled \u201cInterests Insured,\u201d which section purports to specify those who are beneficiaries of the policy but where there is subsequently in the policy an agreement of indemnity in the event of collision, and where such agreement includes the statement that the underwriters \u201cwill pay the assured or charterers,\u201d such subsequent provision known as a Collision or Running Down clause enlarges the group of beneficiaries of the policy. This Court held unanimously in the original opinion that none of the provisions of Section III could be construed to cover Nardelli. The opinion of the Court on this motion for rehearing, without modifying that construction, simply construes the Running Down clause of the policy as adding other beneficiaries to those which the parties to the contract agreed would be protected. This, it is to be noted, is done for the benefit of one who was not a party to the contract. I think the class of insured persons, as plainly spelled out under Section III, cannot be enlarged by the addition of the Running Down clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
