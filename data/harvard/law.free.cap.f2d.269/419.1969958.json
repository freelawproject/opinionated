The petition alleged that in a psychiatric-examination report dated May 1, 1957, made in connection with Arizona state criminal proceedings, the following description of appellant appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-16\">\u201cMentally deficient, Sociopathi-cally disturbed, persecutory perceptions, paranoid ideas, History of concussions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">In an affidavit attached to the petition appellant set forth additional excerpts from the alleged report. According to these excerpts the examination disclosed that appellant\u2019s \u201corientation is vague and there are present vague persecutory perceptions,\u201d although he was not psychotic. Hospitalization for mental treatment was recommended. The only other pertinent evidence in the record before the District Court was the transcript of the proceedings of November 18, 1957, at which he waived counsel and pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">The District Court treated the petition for writ of error coram nobis as a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1952) and denied relief without a hearing. We think the court properly treated the petition as a motion under section 2255 but that it erred in denying relief without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-19\">The issue of competency to stand trial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is reviewable by collateral attack under section 2255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That section requires the court to hear and determine the issue and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in respect thereto \u201cunless the motion, files and record conclusively show the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [223 F.2d 586.]</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">We think this exception to the hearing requirement is inapplicable since it does not appear either (1) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>issue of appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial has previously been determined in a proceeding under section 4244 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or section 2255 or in habeas corpus,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or (2) that his present claim of incompetency is plainly frivolous. We therefore reverse the order denying relief and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-13\">.

The obvious purport of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bishop v. United States, supra, is that the conclusive showing, required for the exception to the hearing requirement of section 2255, may not be established solely on the basis of affidavits on the issue of trial competency. Accord, Gregori v. United States, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-14\">.
