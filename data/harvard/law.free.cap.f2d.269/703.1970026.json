On the same day, it filed a Declaration of Taking, all pursuant to the laws of the Territory (now State) of Alaska. Thereafter, petitioner filed motions to dismiss the complaint, to quash the service of summons and to strike the Declaration of Taking, all of which motions were denied by the district judge on August 22, 1958. On September 12, 1958, an order was entered by the district judge granting possession of the property to the Authority. A motion by petitioner to set aside said order was denied by the district judge on the 10th day of February, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-16\">Petitioner refused to surrender and deliver up possession of the real property and thereafter a Writ of Assistance was issued out of the district court directing the United States Marshal to secure physical possession of the property on b\u00e9half of intervenor. Petitioner then moved to quash the Writ of Assistance, which motion was denied on April 28, 1959. Petitioner thereafter sought leave of this court, under Section 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(b) to appeal from the order denying petitioner\u2019s motion to quash the Writ of Assistance. On May 7, 1959, this court denied petitioner\u2019s application to appeal from said interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-17\">Hearing on the Order to Show Cause why the petition for Writ of Prohibition should not be granted and intervenor\u2019s Petition to Dismiss the Petition for Prohibition were heard by this court on the 13th day of August, 1959, and, this court being fully advised in the premises,</p>\n<p id=\"b750-18\">Now, Therefore, It Is Ordered:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-19\">(1) The motion of Alaska Housing Authority to intervene in the proceedings before this court is granted and the clerk of this court is directed to file the Motion to Intervene as well as the Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>tion of Intervener to Dismiss Petitioner\u2019s Petition for Prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">(2) Petitioner\u2019s Petition for Writ of Prohibition is denied for lack of jurisdiction of this court to entertain the petition. See Parker v. McCarrey, 9 Cir., 268 F.2d 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">(3) The Order to Show Cause issued by this court is discharged and the order staying all proceedings in the district court is vacated and set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
