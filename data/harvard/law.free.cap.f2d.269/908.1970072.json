Final decisions of Puerto Rico and Hawaii Supreme Courts \u2014 The courts of appeals for the First and Ninth Circuits shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the supreme courts of Puerto Rico and Hawaii, respectively in all cases involving the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States or any authority exercised thereunder, in all habeas corpus proceedings, and in all other civil cases where the value in controversy exceeds $5,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Appellee has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Hawaii was not final. Says appellee: \u201cAppellant had not even filed an answer and no trial of the case had been held. Thus, the order of the Supreme Court of Hawaii was neither in form nor in fact a final disposition of the case. Accordingly, the order appealed from does not fall within the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 and the appeal must be dismissed. (Cases cited.) This rule is applicable whether the order of reversal expressly commands further proceedings or whether the necessity for further proceedings merely appears from the record in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">It is true that the judgment of the Hawaii Supreme Court did not, on its face, end the litigation. Local procedure would permit appellant, on remand, to file an answer and interpose some other defense. But appellant has no other defense to interpose. It expressly so concedes here, and appellee does not assert otherwise. Under these circumstances this court has held that the test of whether such a decision is final is whether by it the rights of the parties have been so determined that nothing remains for the trial court but to perform mechanical acts. The question is, whether any further proceedings could be had \u201cpertaining to the merits of the controversy\u201d, Hawaiian Pineapple Co. v. Saito, 9 Cir., 270 F. 749, 750, or whether there remained any occasion for \u201cexercise of any judicial function\u201d, De Fries v. Scott, 9 Cir., 268 F. 952, 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">The test of finality to be applied here is the same as that employed by the Supreme Court of the United States in determining when judgments of state supreme courts are final and hence reviewable there. In Pope v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 345 U.S. 379, 73 S.Ct. 749, 97 L.Ed. 1094, that court dealt with a situation similar to the one before us. Said the court (345 U.S. at page 382, 73 S.Ct. at page 751): \u201cThe finality problem arises in this case because the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court did not, on its face, end the litigation. Both parties agree that Georgia procedure would permit petitioner to return to the Superior Court of Ben Hill County and interpose some other defense to respondent\u2019s suit for an injunction. But petitioner has no other defense to interpose. He has been both explicit and free with his concession that his case rests upon his federal claim and nothing more. If the court below decided that claim correctly, then nothing remains to be done but the mechanical entry of judgment by the trial court. Thus, as the case comes to us, the federal question is the controlling question; \u2018there is nothing more to be decided.\u2019 Under these particular circumstances, we have jurisdiction over the cause. Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board of Equalization, 1946, 329 U.S. 69, 67 S.Ct. 156, 91 L.Ed. 80 * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Here, as in the case of Clark v. Wil-liard, 292 U.S. 112, 118, 54 S.Ct. 615, 618, 78 L.Ed. 1160, there is \u201cnothing more to be decided.\u201d The judgment was \u201can effective determination of the litigation\u201d and \u201cthe final word of a final court.\u201d Market Street R. Co. v. Railroad Comm., 324 U.S. 548, 551, 65 S.Ct. 770, 773, 89 L.Ed. 1171. We hold that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Hawaii was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Some, though not all, of the appellant\u2019s contentions as to invalidity of the Hawaii Fair Trade Act are based upon Hawaii\u2019s status as a territory. With respect to these, appellee argues that the appeal is bound to become moot on admission of Hawaii as a state. Hence, it argues, the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\"> We must reject this contention for three reasons: First, it does not affect all contentions made by appellant, (see, e. g., items (5), (6), (7) and (8) in footnote la, supra); second, we know of no rule permitting dismissal for prospective mootness, and third, it is at least arguable that the status of territorial laws would not automatically be changed as <em>to </em>their validity, by statehood.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-12\">. The Act contains the following provisions : <em>\u201cUnfair competition map be actionable. </em>Wilfully and knowingly advertising, offering for sale or selling any commodity at less than the price stipulated in any contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, whether the j)erson so advertising, offering for sale or selling is or is not a party to such contract, is unfair competition and is actionable at the suit of any person damaged thereby.\u201d ft.L. 1955, \u00a7 205-25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1a\">\n<p id=\"b955-13\">. The contentions made in this respect were summarized by the Supreme Court of Hawaii as follows: \u201c(2) the Hawaii Fair Trade Act was illegal at the time of its enactment for the reason that it was in violation of Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act [15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3]; (3) assuming the power of the legislature of the Territory of Hawaii to enact such a fair-trade act, following the amendment to \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act by the Miller-Tydings Act no such reenactment has been accomplished; (4) the Hawaii Fair Trade Act, and more particularly the so-called \u2018nonsigner\u2019 provision thereof, is unconstitutional for the reason that the same is a price-fixing statute and the legislature is without power to <em>fix </em>prices at which commodities may be sold unless the business or property involved is affected with a public interest; (5) assuming the power of the legislature to fix prices and its authority to delegate that power, any such delegation to be valid must provide a primary standard or general rule to be followed in discharging the delegated power, and the Hawaii Fair Trade Act provides no such standard or rule; (6) the Hawaii Fair Trade Act is unconstitutional because it interferes with the right of the seller and the purchaser to freely contract and agree upon a price of their choice, and that this right to contract is a property right protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; (7) the Hawaii Fair Trade Act is void as an invalid exercise of a police power, being an attempt to use that power for a private and not a public purpose; (8) the Hawaii Fair Trade Act is invalid and inoperative in so far as it purports to authorize the enforcement of minimum fair-trade resale prices against any person who is not a party to the contract by which the minimum resale prices were established.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b955-19\">. Also from the opinion: \u201cWe deem it unnecessary to review at length the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>many decisions upholding the constitutionality of Fair Trade Acts as to non-signers and those holding to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b957-15\">. See \u00a7 15 of the Hawaiian Statehood Act, Public Law 86-3, 86th Congress, March 38, 1959: \u201cAll Territorial laws <em>in force </em>in the Territory of Hawaii at the time of its admission into the Union shall continue in force in the State of Hawaii * * <em>73 </em>Stat. 11.
