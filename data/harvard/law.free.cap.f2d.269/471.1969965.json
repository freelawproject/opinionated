The complaint alleged that the taxes were due under the provisions of the Alaska Property Tax Act, Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949, as amended by Chapter 88, S.L.A.1949. The Alaska Property Tax Act was repealed in March, 1953, Laws 1953, c. 22. The Territory of Alaska, appellant herein, contended that the taxes levied under the Act prior to its repeal remained due and owing after the repeal and could be enforced by personal action in the nature of debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">The United States District Court ordered the dismissal of the complaints in all of the actions, holding that no personal action would lie against the defendants therein for the recovery of the taxes involved, and that the plaintiff had not sought the proper remedy for foreclosure of the tax lien in the manner provided by law. The Court further held that the taxes levied for the years in question did not survive the repeal. It did not pass upon whether the actions were barred by the statute of limitations, although that question had also been raised by the defendants in the actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">Appellant appealed to this Court from the order dismissing the complaints. This Court (Judge Healy dissenting) held that the taxes in question did not survive the repeal of the statute, and that it was therefore unnecessary to pass upon the question of whether or not a personal action could be maintained (Territory of Alaska v. American Can Co., 9 Cir., 246 F.2d 493). Certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court of the United States, and that Court held that the taxes <em>did </em>survive the repeal of the statute (Territory of Alaska v. American Can Co., 1959, 358 U.S. 224, 79 S.Ct. 274, 276, 3 L.Ed.2d 257). The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">\u201cThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and, as there are other questions which were raised by the appeal but not reached by that court, the cause is remanded to it for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">The questions now before this court are those set forth in appellant\u2019s brief, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-18\">1. Whether the Property Tax Act is a tax upon the appellees for which they are personally liable, or is merely a tax upon their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-19\">2. Whether the appellant is without a remedy to collect and enforce taxes due under the Property Tax Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-20\">The Alaska Property Tax Act provided in Section 3 thereof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-21\">\u201cFor the calendar year of 1949, and each calendar year thereafter there is hereby levied, and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>shall be assessed, collected and paid, a tax upon all real property and improvements and personal property in the Territory at the rate of one per centum of the true and full value thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akk-dedup-0\">Various other pertinent sections of the Act are set out in the margin.1 The Act provides, in \u00a7 12, for the annual assessment on property and that real property and personalty shall be separately assessed.

It provides in \u00a7 14 for the preparation of an annual assessment roll by the assessor, and in \u00a7 15 it provides that the assessor, before the completion of the assessment roll, shall give to every person named thereon a notice of assessment.

All taxes payable under this Act shall be paid in lawful money of the United States or its equivalent, at the office of the collector in the judicial division in whichi same are due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Section 42 is the only section of the Act which prescribes any method of collection of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">No section of the Act specifically authorized the bringing of an action in the District Court against individuals or corporations for personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">An examination of \u00a7\u00a7 22-2-8 to' 22-2-18 of the Alaska Compiled Laws Annotated 1949 discloses only a method for the foreclosure of liens against <em>real property. </em>The procedure for the \u201cforeclosure of land registration liens\u201d which is provided in said sections seems to provide in detail for the foreclosure of liens against real property for unpaid taxes,, but appears to us to be wholly incompatible with an attempt to foreclose any liens upon personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">In this connection, it might be noted that while the validity of the Alaska <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Property Tax Act was upheld by this court in Hess v. Mullaney, 9 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 635, 640, the Court there said that the Act was \u201cnot only unique but wanting in evidence of good legislative workmanship.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201cSection 34. Lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">\u201c(a) The taxes assessed upon property, together with interest and penalty,, shall be a lien thereon from and after assessment until paid, and no sale or transfer of such property shall in any way affect the lien of such taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">\u201c(b) Liens for taxes hereunder shall be first liens and paramount to all prior and subsequent encumbrances, alienations, and descents of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-17\">$$$$$$ 51*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">\u201cSection 42. Recovery Of Unpaid Liens. On or after the first day of April of any year, the Tax Commissioner may, with the .assistance of the Attorney General, file in the office of the clerk of the district court in the division in which property subject to delinquent taxes is situated, a list of all parcels affected by unpaid liens. Thereafter the Tax Commissioner shall, unless the matter be otherwise resolved, proceed to foreclosure of said liens in substantially the manner prescribed in Sections 22-2-8 to 22-2-18, both inclusive, of Alaska Compiled Laws Annotated 1949, for the foreclosure of land registration liens, and all pertinent provisions of said sections are hereby adopted as applicable hereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>As an illustration of the unworkability of the method provided for the collection of taxes upon personal property, it might be noted that in \u00a7 22-2-8 it is provided that on August first of each year there shall be filed \u201cin the office of the Clerk of the division of the District Court in which the property subject to such liens is situated, a list of all parcels of property affected by unpaid liens, which on such date have been unpaid for a period of at least four years or more after the date the penalties and other legal charges represented thereby became due and payable. Such parcels shall be numbered serially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The inadequacy of such a remedy for the collection of taxes on personal property is plain to be seen. Could all individual pieces of personal property be listed? Whether the property had been moved during the four-year period, whether it was still in existence after that time, whether it was within the Territory or out of it, or by whom it was owned, are all questions which readily present themselves. No provisions for these contingencies are found in \u00a7 22-2-8 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The method, however, provided in the above-mentioned sections of the Alaska Compiled Laws appears to bo detailed and entirely adequate for the foreclosure of liens upon real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">It is apparent that the adequacy of the statutory remedy is, in large measure, dependent upon whether the collection of real or personal property taxes is being sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Section 5 of the Alaska Property Tax Act simply provides that the tax levied under Section 3 \u201cshall be assessed, collected and enforced as provided in this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">There was no allegation in any of the complaints filed by appellant segregating the amount claimed for taxes due upon real property from the amount claimed for taxes due upon personal property. The complaints contained a typical general allegation, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">\u201cThat the said defendant between the years 1949 and 1952, inclusive, had certain taxable real and personal property within the Territory of Alaska. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">\u201cThat by reason of the fact that this property was in the Territory of Alaska during the years 1949 through and including 1952, defendant owes plaintiff * * * the sum of $31,712.67 plus interest, the same being property taxes due the plaintiff under the provisions of Chapter 10, S.L.A. 1949.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">There are many conflicting rules in the various jurisdictions concerning the method of collecting taxes levied on real and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">At the outset it must be remembered that it has generally been held that at common law a tax is not a debt, and therefore no personal action would lie for its collection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">However, in some jurisdictions, a personal action may bo brought for the collection of real property and personal property taxes.

Bennett, 1944, 181 Tenn. 196, 180 S.W.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">In Alaska, the District Court held in City of Yakutat v. Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby, D.C.1951, 98 F.Supp. 1011, that in the absence of statute, a personal action for the recovery of <em>real property </em>taxes did not lie against the owner. In that case, the Court cited the case of Marion County v. Woodburn Mercantile Co., 1911, 60 Or. 367, 119 P. 487, 41 L.R.A. N.S., 731, for the rule that a tax upon real property creates no personal liability for the payment of which a judgment <em>in personam </em>may be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Furthermore, in the statute presently under consideration in this case, a detailed and adequate method is provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ed for the foreclosure of liens upon real property, and we hold that such procedure must be followed and that a personal action for the recovery of real property taxes may not be successfully brought. Thus, in Alaska, no personal action may be brought for the collection of real property taxes where the statutory remedy provided for such collection is adequate \u2014 to this extent, the statutory remedy is deemed exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">However, as to the collection of the taxes upon personal property, we reach a different conclusion. We believe that the better-reasoned rule is as stated in <em>Cooley on </em>Taxation, Volume 3, \u00a7 1331:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIx\">\u201cThe general rule is that if the statutory remedy is inadequate or ineffectual, a personal action to recover the tax will lie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">See United States v. Chamberlin, supra, 219 U.S. at page 262-263, 31 S.Ct. at page 159, where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">\u201cA tax may or may not be a \u2018debt\u2019 under a particular statute, according to the sense in which the word is found to be used. But whether the Government may recover a personal judgment for a tax depends upon the existence of the duty to pay, <em>for the enforcement of which another remedy has not been made </em>exclusive.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">See Shriver v. Woodbine Sav. Bank, 1932, 285 U.S. 467, at pages 478-479, 52 S.Ct. 430, at page 434, 76 L.Ed. 884:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cIt is true that, where a statute creates a liability and provides a remedy by suit specially adapted to its enforcement, other less appropriate common-law remedies are impliedly excluded. * * * Here the remedy provided is * * * summary and only partially effective * * * for enforcing the obligation to pay a sum certain * * * declared to be due and owing. <em>The very fact that the remedy is on its face inadequate to compel full performance of the obligation declared is- persuasive that it was not intended to be exclusive </em>of applicable common-law remedies, by which complete performance might be secured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\"><em>\u201cAdministrative remedies for the collection of taxes, if noi made exclusive by statute, do not preclude the recovery of the tax by a common-law action of debt.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">Again, in Milwaukee County v.

We have alluded above to some of the problems that might arise in trying to collect taxes due for personal property by using a method which was unquestionably set out as a method to collect taxes upon real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">We therefore hold that the statutory method provided for the collection of personal property taxes being inadequate, a personal action for the collection of such taxes under the Alaska statute in question may be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">In the eight actions consolidated herein, the District Court [137 F.Supp. 186] granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss \u201cfor failure * * * to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\u201d and did not consider the other ground of defendants\u2019 motions which raise the question of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">The judgments of the District Court are reversed, with directions that the claims of the appellant for personal property taxes and real property taxes be separately stated, and for a ruling there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>on by the District Court not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We express no opinion as to the statute of limitations question, as that matter was not considered by the District \u25a0Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-16\"><em>. </em>See, generally, 84 C.J.S.

In those jurisdictions where a personal action may be brought for the collection of real property taxes, it is most often the result of a constitutional provision (see, e.g., City of Richmond v.
