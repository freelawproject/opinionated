As his sole ground for appeal he urges that the Juvenile Court improperly waived its jurisdiction and, therefore, that he could not be tried in the District Court because he had been previously placed in jeopardy in the Juvenile Court. The District Court held there was no double jeopardy. The record in the Juvenile Court shows as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-21\">\u201cDate Court Clerk\u2019s Memorandum Judge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A60\">8-15-58 Complaints filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5N\">8-21-58 Petition filed, sworn to by A.

Those proceedings ended with the boy\u2019s denial of involvement, and no further proceedings were commenced to determine whether or not he was so \u201cinvolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"AXK\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-28\">.
