Table of Television Channel Assignment. The amendment assigned VHF Channel 2, Springfield, Illinois, to St. Louis, Missouri, and Terre Haute, Indiana, accompanied with the assignment of UHF Channels 26 and 36 to Springfield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-16\">\u201cPetitioner, applicant for Channel 2 at Springfield, attacks the decision as illegal because inconsistent with Section 307(b) of the Communications Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-17\">\u201cWe are unable to sustain this attack. Upon the basis of a full hearing the Commission weighed the various factors involved and reached a reasoned decision within its competence. We find nothing arbitrary, capricious or otherwise illegal in the decision, and it accordingly is Affirmed.\u201d<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-18\">Sangamon Valley Television Corporation petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. The government\u2019s brief in opposition concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-19\">\u201cWe believe it proper, however, to call the Court\u2019s attention to certain testimony given before the Subcommittee of Legislative Oversight of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on May 22, 26, and 28, 1958, and Jun\u00e9 9, 10, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>11, 1958, subsequent to the decision by the court of appeals affirming the Commission\u2019s order. The testimony indicates that after the rule-making proceeding here had been initiated by Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and while it was under consideration by the Commission, representatives of the St. Louis operator of a UHF station who was interested in having a new VHF channel assigned to St. Louis, and representatives of the petitioner and the other applicant for VHF Channel 2 in Springfield, who were interested in retaining that channel in Springfield, made <em>ex parte </em>presentations with respect to merits of the rule-making proceeding to various members of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cThese matters were not presented to the court below and are not presented by the petition. For this reason, the respondents do not and would not regard denial of certiorari as foreclosing appropriate consideration thereof by the court of appeals.\u201d (pp. 7-8)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In granting Sangamon\u2019s petition the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201cIn view of the representations in the Solicitor General\u2019s brief on pages 7 and 8, concerning testimony given before the Subcommittee of Legislative Oversight of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce subsequent to the decision by the Court of Appeals in this case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for such action as it may deem appropriate.\u201d 358 U.S. 49-50, 79 S.Ct. 94, 3 L.Ed.2d 47.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">While the proceeding involved here was pending before the Commission it gave notice to the parties, on October 12, 1956, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u201cAny interested person who is of the view that the proposals herein should not be adopted, or should not be adopted in the form set forth herein, may file with the Commission on or before November 15, 1956, written data, views, or arguments setting forth his comments. Comments in support of the proposals may also be filed on or before the same date. Comments or briefs in reply to such original comments as may be submitted should be filed within 15 days from the last day for filing said original comments or briefs. <em>No additional comments may be filed unless (1) specifically requested by the Commission or (2) good cause for filing such additional comments is established. </em>The Commission will consider all such additional comments submitted before taking further action in this matter, and if any comments appear to warrant the holding of a hearing, oral argument, or demonstration, notice of the time and place of such hearing, oral argument or demonstration will be given.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Several parties filed comments. The Commission extended the time for filing reply comments until December 28, 1956. The parties, including intervenor Signal Hill Telecasting Corporation, filed timely reply comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">On March 1, 1957, the Commission issued the order under review. It shifted VHF Channel 2 from Springfield to St. Louis, shifted UHF Channels 26 and 36 to Springfield, and modified Signal Hill\u2019s outstanding authorization for Channel 36 in St. Louis to permit temporary operation on Channel 2 subject to certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">Harry Tenenbaum, president of inter-venor Signal Hill, admitted to the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee that while the proceeding before the Commission was pending he spoke to its members individually \u201cin privacy in their offices, not while they were sitting in a body as the Commission\u201d, of his desire to have Channel 2; \u201cknowing, of course, or expecting, that if Channel 2 went to St. Louis [he] would have good opportunity to get it.\u201d He was \u201cin all the Commissioners\u2019 offices\u201d and went \u201cfrom Commissioner to Commissioner\u201d. He \u201cprobably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>discussed\u201d with every Commissioner his desire to have Channel 2. He testified that he had every Commissioner at one time or another as his luncheon guest, and that he gave turkeys to every Commissioner in 1955 and in 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Finally, on February 20, 1957, seven weeks after the cut-off date, as extended, for filing reply comments and ten days before the Commission decided the case, Tenenbaum sent each Commissioner a letter in which he contended and tried to prove that \u201cChannel 2, based in St. Louis, would reach 166,700 more homes in the state of Illinois than if it were based in Springfield, Illinois.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These letters did not go into the public record. The parties who were opposing the transfer of Channel 2 from Springfield to St. Louis could not question Tenenbaum\u2019s contention, since they did not know he was making it. Its importance was great and perhaps critical, for the principal contention of the opposing parties was that the transfer would deprive Illinois of the \u201cfair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service\u201d to which the Communications Act entitles each state and community.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Interested attempts \u201cto influence any member of the Commission * * * except by the recognized and public processes\u201d go \u201cto the very core of the Commission\u2019s quasi-judicial powers</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">* * Massachusetts Bay Telecasters, Inc., v. Federal Communications Commission, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 261 F.2d 55, 66, 67. That case involved licensing, not rule-making. Ordinarily allocation of TV channels among communities is a matter of rule-making, governed by \u00a7 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1003, rather than adjudication governed by \u00a7 5, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission and the intervenor contend that because the proceeding now on review was \u201crule-making\u201d, <em>ex parte </em>attempts to influence the Commissioners did not invalidate it. The Department of Justice disagrees. On behalf of the United States, the Department urges that whatever the proceeding may be called it involved not only allocation of TV channels among communities but also resolution of conflicting private claims to a valuable privilege, and that basic fairness requires such a proceeding to be carried on in the open. We agree with the Department of Justice. Accordingly the private approaches to the members of the Commission vitiated its action and the proceeding must be reopened.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\"> We agree also that the Commission proceeding must be reopened for another reason. Agency action that substantially and prejudicially violates the agency\u2019s rules cannot stand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time of this proceeding the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>had no general regulations governing all rule-making, but when it proposed an allocation of TV channels to particular communities it was its usual practice, followed in this instance, to prescribe a cutoff date before which \u201cAny interested person * * * may file with the Commission * * * written data, views, or arguments setting forth his comments\u201d favoring or opposing the plan; a cut-off date for \u201ccomments or briefs in reply\u201d; and that \u201cNo additional comments may be filed\u201d without a request from the Commission or a showing of good cause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By plain implication, this rule forbade submitting material to the Commission\u2019s members after the time for filing it with the Commission had gone by. The rule cannot be interpreted to permit parties to make off the record contentions that it forbids them to make on the record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In substantial agreement with the recommendation of the Department of Justice, the Commission\u2019s Report and Order of March 1, 1957 is vacated and the case is remanded to the Commission with instructions to hold, with the aid of a specially appointed hearing examiner, an evidential hearing to determine the nature and source of all <em>ex parte </em>pleas and other approaches that were made to Commissioners while the former proceeding was pending, and any other factors that might be thought to require either disqualification of some Commissioners from participating in the reopened proceeding or disqualification of some parties from receiving any award that may ultimately result. All parties to the former proceeding and to the present review may on request participate fully in the evidential hearing. The Commission is instructed to report its progress to this court within 60 days, together with any recommendations it is then able to make. In the discretion of the Commission existing services may be maintained, and the court retains jurisdiction of this proceeding, pending further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\">. \u201cIn considering applications for licenses, and modifications and renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same.\u201d 48 Stat. 1083 (1934), as amended, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-22\">. 103 U.S.App.D.C. 113-114, 255 F.2d 191-192.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">.
