The complaint alleged infringement of copyright laws and unfair competition. The action invoked the jurisdiction of the court below on the basis of diversity and under the copyright laws, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391 (c), 1332, and 1338 (1952). The court below, after a careful review of the record, found that Hutcheon\u2019s status in its relationship to Titus was that of an independent contractor and that therefore Titus was not present in New Jersey in a sense that would support service of process. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>(1952); Rule 4, Fed.R.Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C., and Springs Cotton Mills v. Machinecraft, Inc., D.C.S.C.1957, 156 F. Supp. 372. See also Davega, Inc. v. Lincoln Furniture Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 1928, 29 F.2d 164. It appears clearly that Titus has not maintained the minimum contacts in New Jersey necessary to warrant the court below in assuming jurisdiction of the foreign corporation, Titus.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Finding no error in the judgment appealed from, it will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
