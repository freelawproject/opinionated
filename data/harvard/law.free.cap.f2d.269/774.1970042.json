Plaintiff sued both the administrator of the estate of the driver of the car in which she was a passenger and the driver of the car going in the wrong direction, and obtained a judgment against the latter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">As to the administrator <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the estate of the driver of the car in which plaintiff was riding, the trial court held, as a matter of law, that, under the circumstances of the case, the sole proximate cause of the collision was the negligence of the driver of the automobile traveling in the wrong lane. We think the trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">We have examined the other contention of plaintiff, to the effect that the court erred in holding that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>did not apply to create an inference that both drivers were negligent, and find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-12\">. That defendant is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-25\">. The driver of the car in which plaintiff was riding was killed in the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
