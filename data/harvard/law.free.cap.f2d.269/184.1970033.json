Kemper, petitioner herein, seeks review of a decision of the Tax Court of the United States whereby the Tax Court upheld a deficiency in Kemp-er\u2019s income tax in the amount of $10,-300.35 for the year 1954. Jurisdiction is invoked under \u00a7 7482(a), I.R.C., 26 U.S. C.A. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 7482(a). The findings of fact and opinion of the Tax Court are reported in 30 T.C. 546. The basic issue is whether the Tax Court committed error in denying petitioner a casualty loss deduction of $12,500.00 under \u00a7 165 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by reason of the loss of 17 trees on his residential property. 26 U.S.C.A. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 165 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\"><em>\u201c(a) General rule. </em>\u2014 There shall be allowed as a deduction any loss sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-14\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-15\"><em>\u201c(c) Limitation on losses of individuals. </em>\u2014 In the case of an individual, the deduction under subsection (a) shall be limited to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-16\">-X- * * # * -*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-17\">\u201c(3) losses of property not connected with a trade or business, if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">It is petitioner\u2019s primary contention that, as a direct result of severe drought conditions in Kansas City, Missouri, during the summer of 1954, he lost 17 trees from his residence and that such loss is a \u201ccasualty\u201d within the purview of the foregoing section. Holding that it was not necessary in this case to determine whether or not true loss by drought was a proper deduction under the statute, the Tax Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-19\">\u201cFor the purpose of deciding this case we can pass the question for we are of the opinion petitioner failed in his burden of proving that the drought killed the trees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-20\"> At the beginning, we are met with the primary question of whether the Tax Court\u2019s holding that \u201cpetitioner failed in his burden of proving that the drought killed the trees\u201d is clearly erroneous. This is a fact determination so that the jurisdiction of this as a reviewing court is strictly limited. 26 U.S.C.A. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 7482, giving the Courts of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Tax Court, provides that such review shall be \u201c * * * in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district court in civil actions tried without a jury; * * Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-22\">\u201cFindings of facts shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">It is beyond cavil that we, as a reviewing court, may not retry issues of fact, that we are not the judges of the credibility of the witnesses, that the findings of the Tax Court are presumptively correct, and that the burden rests with the petitioner to show that such findings are \u201cclearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>erroneous\u201d before this court may set them aside. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394-395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746, rehearing denied 333 U.S. 869, 68 S.Ct. 788, 92 L.Ed. 1147; Joe Balestrieri &amp; Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 867, 873; Grace Bros. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 1949, 173 F.2d 170, 173-174.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The record indicates as follows: Petitioner purchased his home in Kansas City, Jackson County, Missouri, in 1930, at a cost of $100,000.00. Up until 1954, the year in question, he had added an additional $100,000.00 in improvements. His residence is of the mansion type located in an exclusive residential neighborhood of Kansas City and occupies about five acres of land. The house has 30 rooms, a four-car garage, a swimming pool and locker rooms, a patio and two formal gardens. The property was landscaped by numerous trees, including elms, maples, oaks, larch, spruce, pine and walnut. There is an ornamental fence along the front of the property and the remainder is enclosed in a chain-link fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In 1952 and 1953 drought conditions existed in Missouri and other western states. On August 2, 1954, the President of the United States recognized the severity of the continued drought and designated Missouri a drought disaster area.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">During the year 1954 petitioner suffered the loss of the following trees on his property: 2 American elm, 1 Austrian pine, 1 Dwarf pine, 1 Scotchpine, 1 Colorado spruce, and 11 Norway spruce. For these trees petitioner claimed a $12,-500.00 casualty loss on his 1954 income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The fact question revolves mainly about the testimony of two witnesses, Norman Klein, who testified in behalf of petitioner, and L. J. Gier, whose testimony was introduced by the respondent. Klein is an arborist and the owner of a company called Midwest Tree Experts, whose work consists of pruning and spraying trees. For approximately 20 years he had been employed by the petitioner \u201cto care for his trees and do anything which would keep them in best, condition\u201d. He was familiar with petitioner\u2019s trees in 1954 and prior thereto.. In connection with the testimony of the-witness Klein, the Tax Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201cThe only witness who testified the trees died of drought was Norman Klein, who testified that he was an arborist and that he had been employed by petitioner for about 20 years \u2018to take care of his trees.\u2019 He said he usually inspected them three times a year and that he had inspected them \u2018several times during 1954/' He could not recall when he had inspected the trees in 1954 prior to the time he was called to petitioner\u2019s home to examine the dead trees and determine the cause of death. The record shows he was called to examine 14 dead trees in June of 1954, and three dead trees in August,. 1954.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201cThere was evidence to the effect that there had been a drought in. this area, not only in 1954, but also-in the years 1952 and 1953. Without giving any basis for his conclusion, Klein gave it as his opinion, that the-trees died of drought. Later he said drought was the \u2018primary\u2019 cause. He said he examined some, but not all of the dead trees, and he found some separation of the bark, indicating phloem necrosis and some tunneling around in the bark indicating-some beetle activity, and there were some borers. He said the other trees on petitioner\u2019s property were not affected by the drought but he added, they were growing in lower places. Many of the pictures of the stumps that are in evidence show growing trees nearby. Petitioner testified he had watered the trees abundantly in the year 1954. Klein\u2019s examination of the trees to determine the cause of death was most superficial. He made no microscopic or laboratory examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">\u201cPetitioner argues that because Klein said drought was the cause of death and there is no evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>any other cause, then we must determine that drought was the cause of death of the trees. But Klein\u2019s testimony was opinion evidence. It was admissible but its probative value rests on the facts upon which it is based. He gave nothing to support his conclusion and much of his testimony as to the facts he found, weakened his conclusion. It appears to rest on no more than knowledge that the area was suffering drought conditions. He found 17 dead trees and examined some of them and he found them infected with beetles, borers and phloem necrosis, and testified all 17 trees died of drought, even though neighboring trees were unaffected by drought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">L. J. Gier, respondent\u2019s expert witness, is a professor of biology and head of the Department of Biology of William Jewell College. Of Gier\u2019s testimony, the Tax Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s expert witness, L. J. Gier, a botanist with graduate study in plant pathology, said it would take a drought of several years to kill a tree adapted to the Kansas City area. He told of the necessity for a miscroscopic examination and detailed analysis of the trunk and roots in order to determine the cause of death of a tree. He said that before trees were to die in a drought \u2018you must have a lowered water table, which we do not have.\u2019 There was some evidence that the water table was lower in 1954 than 1953, but no evidence that it had sunk below the reach of the roots of trees adaptable to the Kansas City area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The record amply supports these statements with reference to the two expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">In addition to the testimony of Klein and Gier, the petitioner himself testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201cIn 1954, I watered my trees, and my shrubbery, and used a good deal of water on them. I am not a tree expert but I know this from the little experience I have had in connection with the lumber company that I was interested in that trees can die here from a drought or from other cause and the trees right next to it will keep on living. I don\u2019t keep a diary or record of my trees and shrubbery and I don\u2019t know on what date my first tree died. I don\u2019t know what kind of tree was the first one that died. I know the trees started fading. It was a terribly hot summer, about the worst one I had experienced. I don\u2019t know on what date the last tree died.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Pointing out that Gier had never seen petitioner\u2019s home nor the 17 trees involved, that if he had had the advantage of personal observation his testimony might have been different, and that his testimony was theoretical in nature, petitioner claims that it could not be considered by the Tax Court. Petitioner states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">\u201cThis is true since the appellee\u2019s counsel failed to ask any hypothetical questions upon which Gier could express an opinion. Just because he might be considered an expert does not permit him to testify \u2014 with acceptance by the court \u2014 unless he has <em>personal knowledge of the facts </em>in the case, or unless the <em>facts are presented as a foundation for a hypothetical question. </em>Neither situation existed in this case. He knew not the facts, nor was he asked a single hypothetical inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">With reference to Klein\u2019s testimony, petitioner contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">\u201cIt is clear that when the only direct evidence is given by one side, and such evidence is not impeached by any other witness or by cross-examination, then the Court must find for the party producing such evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">First, with reference to Dr. Gier; he testified that watering trees would prevent drought damage; that in order to determine and identify the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>death of a tree one must make a complete examination, microscopic and otherwise, of all the parts thereof; that insects and disease might well attack a tree with or without the presence of drought, the former being more likely to cause the death of a tree than drought in the Kansas City area; that \u201cif trees were properly watered, a drought would not kill them\u201d and that \u201cif we had a drought damage it can be avoided by proper watering\u201d. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">\u201cI am familiar with the trees of this area and with the environmental condition in which the trees in this area grow. The water table and the soil, the temperature, and humidity are important in determining the effect of drought on trees as well as the lack of rainfall. In my opinion, a drought of several months or a year is not likely to kill a tree which is adapted to this area. It would take a drought of several years to kill such a tree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We think the testimony of Dr. Gier was sufficiently related to the prior testimony to justify the court\u2019s receipt of his expert opinion. Additionally, there was no objection to his testimony at the time of trial. We think it was properly received and that the Tax Court was entitled to give it consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The testimony of the two main witnesses here is conflicting. Each was an expert testifying in a field in which he had prepared himself to render expert advice. Klein saw the property in question, including the 17 trees, before and after their destruction but the Tax Court found that his examination was not extensive and that his expert opinion lacked sufficient basis for them to accept it fully. Gier\u2019s testimony was general in nature, having to do with the drought of 1952, 1953 and 1954 and the trees in the general vicinity of petitioner\u2019s. He could not and did not attempt to testify to the cause of the destruction of the trees. For the finder of the facts, an expert\u2019s testimony is purely advisory. The Tax Court could accept it or reject it. The Tax Court here, as the finder of the facts, was also the judge of the credibility of the witnesses and it was its prerogative to determine the weight that should be given the testimony of the petitioner himself and the two experts. Considering the record as a whole, we cannot say that the findings of the Tax Court are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d, nor reviewing \u201cthe entire evidence\u201d are we \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 365, 395, 68 S.Ct. 542, rehearing denied 333 U.S. 869, 68 S.Ct. 788. The Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner failed in his burden of establishing that his trees were killed by a severe drought in 1954 may not be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Petitioner also urges that the Tax Court failed to rule on his \u201calternative contention\u201d set forth in paragraph 2(aa) of the amendment to his original complaint, contending that the court might find the death of his trees due to the sudden effect of disease and/or insects and that such constitutes a casualty loss within the meaning of \u00a7 165(c)(3), I.R.C. 1954. We do not agree. The Tax Court did rule on the alternative contention. It stated at the outset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">\u201cThe issue before us is whether the petitioner is entitled to a casualty loss deduction under section 165 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the loss of 17 trees on his residential property which were destroyed in 1954.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The opinion then proceeds to discuss the evidence, to include that which the petitioner contends supported his primary contention that drought caused the destruction of his trees. Additionally, the court considered the testimony regarding disease, beetles and borers as offered by Klein, who nevertheless gave it as his expert opinion that drought was the \u201cprimary\u201d cause. The Tax Court then concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">\u201cFrom a study of all of the evidence in the case we hold it is insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>cient to warrant a determination that petitioner\u2019s trees were killed by a drought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\u201cThe result of our determination is that petitioner has failed to establish his loss was due to <em>any </em>casualty entitling him to the deduction allowed by section 165(c) (3), I.R.C. of 1954.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The Tax Court then states:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u201cThis decides the issue * the issue being, as stated in the beginning of the opinion, whether or not the petitioner was entitled to a casualty loss deduction. We think it clear, therefore, that the Tax Court did decide the alternative contention. An examination of the evidence convinces us that their conclusion must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">It must not be overlooked that the burden here was upon the petitioner to establish his right to the deduction. The Supreme Court, in Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1943, 319 U.S. 590, 593, 63 S.Ct. 1279, 1281, 87 L.Ed. 1607, rehearing denied 320 U.S. 809, 64 S.Ct. 26, 88 L.Ed. 489, referred to \u201c * * * the now familiar rule that an income tax deduction is a matter of legislative grace and that the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer. New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 435, 440, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790, 78 L.Ed. 1348; Deputy v. Du Pont, 308 U.S. 488, 493, 60 S.Ct. 363, 366, 84 L.Ed. 416\u201d, and stated in Deputy v. Du Pont, 1940, 308 U.S. 488, 493, 60 S.Ct. 363, 366, 84 L.Ed. 416, that the \u201c * * * allowance of deductions from gross income does not turn on general equitable considerations.\u201d We must conclude here that the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the petitioner failed to establish his loss was due to <em>any </em>casualty was not clearly erroneous and we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. The Tax Court arrived at permissible conclusions and must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
