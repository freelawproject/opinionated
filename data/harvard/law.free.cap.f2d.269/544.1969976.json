Miller, Washington and Bast\u00edan, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b591-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">This is an appeal from a conviction of manslaughter [\u00a7 22-2405, D.C.Code (1951)] and assault with a dangerous weapon [\u00a7 22-502, D.C.Code (1951)]. Appellant urges three errors on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">First, appellant urges that the admission of a statement made by him at police headquarters one hour after arrest, in the presence of police officers and two accusers, was prejudicial in that the sole purpose of the confrontation was to elicit a confession rather than for the purpose of identification. The statement involved was not introduced in the government\u2019s case in chief but was brought out in rebuttal after appellant\u2019s attorney, on cross examination of a prosecution witness, delved into the chain of events occurring at police headquarters on the evening of appellant\u2019s arrest. However, since no objection was made to the introduction of this evidence at the trial, we are not required here to rule on its admissibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor, after the examination of the entire record, do we feel it incumbent upon us to reach that question under our discretionary authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">Secondly, appellant urges that an instruction on self-defense was improper, claiming that self-defense was not an issue in the case. An examination of the record clearly shows that such a defense was in fact raised. In the course of the trial, counsel for appellant requested a bench conference, at which time he stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-21\">\u201cThe defense is self-defense, your Honor * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-22\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-23\">\u201cI don\u2019t think this particular line of questioning is beyond the scope, if your Honor please. I will ask you to put the question directly if your Honor feels it would expedite the matter. I feel it is entirely admissible because self-defense is a proper defense, and we can show the reputation for violence, disorderly conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">Further, no objection to the instruction was raised at trial. In material part, Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, 18 U.S.C.A., reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-25\">\u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-28\">Since appellant failed to raise objection at the trial, he is precluded from so doing now; and we find it unnecessary to reach this question under our discretionary authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-29\">Finally, appellant urges that the trial court erred in failing to give a requested instruction involving equal hypotheses of guilt and of innocence. Prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>to the charge to the jury, the court had refused to give this instruction, stating that it would \u201ccover the idea,\u201d which in effect was done in the court\u2019s instruction on burden of proof and reasonable doubt. Under the circumstances of this ease, the requested instruction would have led to confusion in the minds of the jurors, and its denial was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-11\">.
