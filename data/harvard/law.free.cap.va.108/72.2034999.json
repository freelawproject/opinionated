Specific <em>Pebfoemance </em>\u2014 How <em>and When Enforced </em>\u2014 Effect <em>of Complainant\u2019s Default </em>\u2014 Case <em>in Judgment. </em>\u2014 Specific performance of a contract may frequently be enforced either by a direct decree to that effect, or by an injunction restraining a party from doing what he has agreed not to do; but whether sought in one way or the other, a court of equity will not, as a general rule, specifically enforce a contract at the suit of a party who is himself in default in respect thereto, or has himself violated its terms and obligations. The remedy does not exist as a matter of right, but rests in the sound discretion of the court upon all the circumstances of the ease; and when the party seeking performance is himself in default, it depends in a great measure upon how far the default goes to the essence of the contract whether he can have performance or not. In the case in judgment the complainants refused to perform their part of the contract in a matter which went to the essence of the contract. They purchased of defendants an insurance agency business, and, as a consideration therefor, agreed to pay them a <em>per cent, </em>of the first renewal premiums, which renewals they promised to use reasonable diligence to secure. After the purchase, they were unwilling to incur the usual and customary labor and expense incident to the renewal of policies of insurance, and they refused to pay the usual <em>commissions </em>to sub-agents formerly employed by defendants to solicit insurance, with the result of a transfer of such renewals to other companies, and the loss to the defendants of the stipulated compensation. Under such circumstances the complainants are not entitled to specific performance.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Loudoun county.

From the character of the deal the utmost good faith was required to carry out this contract. And relying upon the fact that we knew it was greatly to your pecuniary interest to carry out fairly this contract, doing fairly by this business, treating it in the same manner as you would other business written through your own agency, and knowing that if you would do this our interests were safe and we would receive a fair compensation for the business which represents at least ten years of continuous hard work, we did agree to trust the same to you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">\u201cThat we are greatly interested in the renewal of these policies is patent as our compensation is fixed at 15 <em>per cent, </em>of the premiums of these renewals and we believe that you would be interested in securing these renewals in order that you might build up a large and profitable business for your agency. We have been advised by your firm, however, that inasmuch as you have agreed to pay us fifteen <em>per cent, </em>of the first renewal premiums you will not incur any expense, even though it be such as a commission to a solicitor or reasonable expense in other instances, to secure the renewals of any of this business written by us. And we are further advised that you will incur reasonable expenses of exactly similar kind in the management of the business written by your <em>our </em>agency and in securing new business, and we are told that we must secure these renewals otherwise you will produce such a condition of affairs as will bring about the necessary cancellation of a considerable number of these policies, thus defeating our right to the fifteen <em>per cent. </em>according to your contention. When this matter was brought to our attention in your letter of May 2, we wrote under date of May 8, telling you that we were entitled to credit of 15 <em>per cent., </em>in accordance with our contract, of all policies renewed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">\u201cWe understood, and so did you, that we were retiring from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the business and you were to conduct it, hearing the expense of same. By yo\u00far letter of May 3 you advised us that you declined to credit our account with- any amount on policies you renewed through solicitors, even though these policies renewed are renewals of policies issued through our agency, if the solicitor requires a commission such as is customary to be paid, and such as you say will pay on your <em>our </em>own line of business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">\u201cWhen we discovered your intention in this respect we then sent you our letter of May 4, to which you have never yet replied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">\u201cOn May 8, we called upon you again specifically to reply to our letter of May 4, and in return received your letter of May 10 in which you purposely deal in generalities and adroitly evade any reference to our letter of May 4.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-7\">\u201cFrom your conduct in this matter we see plainly that, according to a fair and reasonable construction of the contract, you do not intend to comply with its spirit and when these solicitors have to make other arrangements to place their insurance you will have lost the hold on the business and we will have lost our fifteen <em>per cent.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-8\">\u201cWe decline to submit to this kind of treatment and we simply desire to advise you how we feel in respect to it and we shall promptly take steps -to prevent a sacrifice and further loss to ourselves by having entered into an agreement with you which you have broken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-9\">\u201cVery respectfully,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-10\">\u201cGEUBB BEOS.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-11\">Moore, Clemens &amp; Oo. made no reply to the letter of Grubb Bros, of May 23, 1906, and some time afterwards Grubb Bros, engaged in the fire insurance business on their own account, contrary to the provisions of the agreement with Moore, Clemens &amp; Co. In July following, Moore Clemens &amp; Oo. filed their bill against Grubb Bros., in which they set out the agreement and the correspondence between the parties; their construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the contract, which they allege they afterwards receded from. They further alleged that Grubb Bros, had violated the agreement in re-entering the business of fire insurance agents; in refusing to surrender certain personal property named; and in collecting and retaining certain premiums to which they were not entitled; that they were insolvent, as shown by certain papers exhibited; and that if permitted to continue in the business of fire insurance agents in violation of their agreement the loss of the complainants would be irreparable. The prayer of the bill was, that Grubb Bros, \u201cbe enjoined and restrained from soliciting fire insurance for other companies than those represented by your orators, and from carrying on the business of fire insurance agents, except under their contract with your orators, within the territory designated above; and that they be required to specifically execute and perform said contract in good faith and with reasonable accuracy; and to deliver to your orators the furniture and fixtures and other articles sold them and not yet delivered; that an account may be taken of the premiums received by them\u201d of a certain character, \u201cand that they be charged with the same;\u201d and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">An injunction as prayed for was granted upon the filing of the bill. Grubb Bros, demurred to and answered the bill. Among the grounds of demurrer assigned were the following, viz.: that the bill did not make out a case for the specific execution of the agreement between the parties, because there was no averment in it that the complainants had kept and performed the agreement on their part, or that they were ready and willing to do so, and because they had a complete and adequate remedy at law. In their answer, after giving their construction of the agreement and the correspondence between the parties, they, among other things, allege that the complainants did not by their letter of May 10 agree to give them credit for the fifteen <em>per cent, </em>of the premiums on the first renewals of the policies previously issued through the defendants\u2019 agencies, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>on the contrary in interviews between the parties between that date and the 23rd of that month they expressly- refused to do so; that the complainants not only refused to credit them with said fifteen <em>per cent, </em>of the premiums but so conducted their business that much of the insurance which had been done in companies which the defendants represented was not renewed in any of those companies but was taken out in other companies, thus greatly damaging the business which the defendants had built up, and if that course of conduct was continued it would result in greatly reducing the amount they were entitled to and would have received under the agreement if it had been carried out in good faith on the part of the complainants; that in this condition of affairs the defendants wrote the letter of May 23, and receiving no reply thereto within a reasonable time, or at all, they did go into the fire insurance business again, in order to protect themselves from loss and damage which were resulting and would result from the violation of the agreement on the part of the complainants, which could not be adequately compensated in actions at law for damages, or in a court of equity for specific performance, since the policies taken out through the agency of the defendants ran through ppriods of from one to five years, and the nature of the agreement was such that unless the complainants were honestly disposed to carry it out they could not be compelled to do so. The answer denied generally the allegations of the bill, except as admitted or explained;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">Upon the hearing of the cause, the court rendered a final decree perpetuating the injunction theretofore granted, restraining Grubb Brothers from engaging in or carrying on the business of fire insurance agents in the territory named in the agreement, and directing them to deliver the said typewriter and other chattels in their possession to the complainants upon demand. To that decree this appeal was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-6\"><em>B. B.

It is not a case requiring the interposition of the courts <em>ex debito justitiae, </em>hut rests in their discretion, upon all the circumstances. He who seeks the exercise of this extraordinary jurisdiction must show a contract certain and definite in its terms; that he himself is in no default, but has performed his part of the agreement; or, in the language of the judges, that he is \u2018ready, desirous, prompt and eager\u2019 to do so * * * When the party seeking performance is himself in default, whether he can have it or not depends in a great measure upon how far the default goes to the essence of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">If the only default of the complainants had been their failure and refusal for a time to credit the defendants with the fifteen <em>per cent, </em>of the first renewal premiums in cases where the complainants had to pay commissions or a <em>per cent, </em>to solicitors of insurance who had formerly acted for the defendants, it would not have been, perhaps, under the facts of this case, such a failure to perforin on the part of the complainants as would have justified a court of equity in refusing to enjoin the defendants from establishing a fire insurance agency in violation of their agreement. But this was by no means all of their default in keeping and performing the contract. It was clearly their duty under the agreement to make reasonable efforts to renew the policies of insurance which had been issued through the agency of the defendants by the line of insurance companies which the latter did. or had represented at the time the agreement was entered into. It was of the greatest importance to the defendants that the complainants should in good faith exercise reasonable diligence in the performance of that duty, since the only consideration which the defendants were to receive for the transfer of their business as insurance agents, the hooks and records and good will pertaining thereto and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>their office furniture and fixtures was the fifteen <em>per cen\u00ed, </em>of the first renewal premiums on such policies. . The preponderance of evidence shows that the complainants were unwilling to incur the usual and customary labor and expense incident to the renewal of such policies; that they refused to pay the commissions to which certain solicitors of insurance, who were sub-agents of the defendants at the time the agreement was entered into, were entitled in having policies renewed in companies represented by the defendants; and that this refusal resulted in such policies being renewed in other companies and the loss of the fifteen <em>per cen\u00ed, </em>of such renewal premiums by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The complainants, having failed to keep and perform their contract in this respect, which went to the essence of the agreement, are not entitled to have a direct decree for specific performance nor to a decree restraining the defendants from violating the agreement on their part, but the parties should be left to -their remedies at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We are of opinion, therefore, to reverse the decree appealed from, and enter such decree as the circuit court ought to have entered, dismissing the bill with costs and without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
