Wrongful Death of <em>Infant </em>\u2014 Loss <em>of Services After Death </em>\u2014 Right <em>of Action </em>\u2014 Effect <em>of Sec. 2902 of Code. </em>\u2014 A father could not at common law recover for the loss of the services of his minor son between the time of his death and the time when he would have attained his majority, and this established rule has not been abrogated nor even modified by the statute. (Code, sec. 2902). The statute does not change the right of the parent, as such, in any manner whatever. The only effect of this statute is to change the rule of the common law which denied a right of action to the heirs, distributees or personal representatives of a deceased person for damages for his wrongful death, and to permit a revival in the name of his personal representative after his death, of an action instituted by him in his lifetime for a personal injury wrongfully inflicted on him.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b603-9\">2.

Berkshire </em>R. Co., 1 Cush. (Mass.) 475, 48 Am. Dec. 616, and note where the authorities are collated.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The opinion of the court in <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Brame, </em>95 U. S., at p. 756, 24 L. Ed. 580, says: \u201cThe authorities are so numerous and so uniform to the proposition, that by the common law no civil action lies for an injury which results in death, that it is impossible to speak of it as a proposition open to question. It has been decided in many cases in the English \u2022courts and many of the State courts, and no deliberate, well-considered decision to the contrary is to be found. In Hilliard on Torts, p. 87, sec. 10, the rule is thus laid down: \u2018Upon a similar ground it has been held that in common law the death of a human being, though clearly involving pecuniary loss, is not the ground of an action for damages.\u2019 The most of the common cases upon the subject are there referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>At common law the parent\u2019s right to recover for loss of the services of his child is, by legal fiction, predicated upon the relation of master and servant; but, as said in the opinion of the court in <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Castello, </em>14 S. C. 20, 37 Am. Rep. 719, in discussing the reasons for the doctrine that there can be no recovery for loss of services after the death of the servant, \u201cnot so much because the civil remedy is merged in the felony, as because by the death of the servant the master\u2019s right to his services is instantly abrogated, and in the eye of the law no damage is sustained by him, because no right is infringed. The justice of this rule may not be apparent, but the law will not deal with mere speculations and uncertainties. It will not determine, nor attempt to determine, the measure of human life, except for the happening of an event which has destroyed it, nor presume that the capacity to serve would have continued if the injury had not been inflicted. It stops at the outer limit of the master\u2019s rights under his contract, and as when the servant\u2019s death intervenes the master\u2019s right to his services are ended, so in like manner are all his remedies for injuries arising under the contract, except such as accrued prior to his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In a note to <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Berkshire R. Co., supra, </em>at p. 632, it it said: \u201cIt is settled, as laid down in the principal case, notwithstanding the vigorous dissent of some eminent judges, that at the common law no action will lie for damages caused by the death of a human being, by the wrongful or negligent act of another, however close may be the relation between the deceased and the plaintiff, and however grievous the loss.\u201d And at page 633 it is said: \u201cRot only is there, without the aid of a statute, no civil remedy for the death itself, but no action will lie for loss of services, etc., caused by the death, as is abundantly shown in the cases above cited. Where a child is disabled for a few days by the wrongful act or negligence of the defendant, the father may recover for the loss of services; but if the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>is killed by the injury, and the father is forever deprived of his services, he has no remedy. Various reasons have been suggested for this utterly unreasonable rule. * * * The preponderance of authority, however, is too strong to be overborne by reason, and the rule laid down in the principal case must be admitted to be firmly established in the common law courts, except so far as it has been abrogated by legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Very many more authorities in point might, if deemed necessary, be cited to show that it is too well\" settled to admit of further discussion that plaintiff in error cannot maintain this action to recover for the loss of the services of his son between the time of his death and the time when he would have attained his majority. In fact, it is conceded in the argument of the case, that the great weight of authority is against the contention that plaintiff in error can maintain this action, and the effort being made is to show that the authorities are wrong or do not apply, and section 2902 of the Code 'is cited in support of this latter view.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">That statute, modeled after the English statute known as \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act,\u201d creates a right of action where none existed before, and cannot be construed as giving the parent any right he did not have before, since this new right of action is given solely to the personal representative of the deceased person whose death was caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of any person or corporation, etc. The argument that \u201cthe terms of the statute limiting the administrator\u2019s right of recovery to what his intestate could have recovered had death not ensued, necessarily declare and protect the parent\u2019s right to his deceased minor\u2019s services until majority, notwithstanding his death and the right given to his administrator to recover for his death,\u201d is more ingenuous than sound. The statute does not change the parent\u2019s right in any manner whatsoever, and that he could not at common law recover for the loss of the services of his child after the death of th\u00e9 child we have already determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201cAn action for loss of services of a son from-the date of bis death by 'wrongful act until be would bave attained bis majority is in effect one to recover for tbe death of tbe son, and cannot be maintained by tbe father, since tbe right of tbe father to a son\u2019s services ceases at the latter\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Kentucky L. Co., </em>19 Ky. Law Rep. 1731, 47 S. W. 94; Cent. Dig. 1902 A, \u201cDeath,\u201d 1365, sec. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">It is further contended for plaintiff in error, that if a minor be hired to leave bis fhther without tbe latter\u2019s consent (perhaps against bis will), and is killed by such negligence as will make tbe employer liable to bis administrator, tbe minor being 16 years old, it is clear that such administrator could not recover for five years of that minor\u2019s time, for tbe reason that not only is it settled by tbe authorities that the- administrator of tbe minor cannot recover for tbe loss of services between tbe death of tbe minor and tbe date at which be would bave attained bis majority; but by tbe language of tbe statute \u2014 sec. 2902 of tbe Code, <em>supra </em>\u2014 the administrator is given such right of recovery \u201cas would (if death bad not ensued) bave entitled <em>the party injured </em>to maintain an action * * * and to recover damages in respect thereof,\u201d therefore, tbe statute leaves tbe right to recover for loss of services of tbe minor where it bad always been, <em>in the parent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Concede that the statute admits of this construction, still, as we bave already shown, tbe great weight of authority is that tbe parent could not at common law maintain an action for loss of services of tbe minor after tbe death of tbe latter, and this established rule was not abrogated or even modified by tbe enactment of tbe statute. Tbe only effect of tbe statute is to change tbe rule of tbe common law, that, in pursuance of tbe maxim <em>actio personalis moritur cum persona, </em>no right of action existed in favor of .the heirs, distributees, or personal representatives of a deceased person, for damages for bis wrongful death. Tbe right of action which tbe injured person bad abated with bis death and did not survive;- and no right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>existed in favor of those surviving him, because the civil act merged in the criminal act; the single change in the common law rule wrought by the statute being that the right of action is given by it solely to the personal representative of the deceased, for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent or child of the deceased. 8 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. L., pp. 854, 857-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The statute, however, does not affect the right of action for damages existing at common law in favor of a personal representative or a parent, to recover for losses between the time of an injury and the resulting death of the person injured; nor, as it would seem clear from the authorities, the right of the personal representative of a person dying as a result of an injury caused by a breach of a contractual duty on the part of the person, or corporation, inflicting the injury, to recover in an action for breach of contract, the damages to the deceased\u2019s personal estate arising in his lifetime from medical expenses and loss occasioned by his inability to attend to business; nor the right of a parent to recover in a proper case made for loss of the services of his minor child to the date of the child\u2019s death by wrongful act. The remaining question, therefore, in this case is, Does the declaration stat\u00e9 a cause of action at all ?</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Clearly, unless the declaration is good as an action to recover for the loss of the services of plaintiff in error\u2019s minor son, resulting from the wrongful hiring, between the .time of the hiring and the injury, or for loss of services for the time between the injury and death, or both, there was no error in the ruling of the circuit court, sustaining the demurrer of defendant in error and dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The declaration contains, practically, but one count, and does not allege that the hiring of the son was against the will of the father, in wrongful violation of his prohibition, hut simply says it was \u201cunlawful and without consent\u201d of the father; nor does it say that the father did not acquiesce in the employment after the act of hiring, which is a necessary allegation, since every hiring of a minor is not a wrongful act. 1 Min. Inst., p. 430; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Toledo, St. L. &amp; K. C. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Trimble, </em>8 Ind. App. 333, 35 N. E. 716. Nor does the declaration state that the defendant in error did not pay the plaintiff in error for the services rendered by his son, and no recovery is asked on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Under the familiar rule that all pleadings are to be most strongly construed against the pleader, the declaration here cannot escape the construction, that the intention of the pleader was to seek to recover only for the loss of services from the time of his son\u2019s death to the time the son would have become twenty-one years of age; the language of the declaration being: \u201cAnd the said plaintiff says, that shortly after the said defendant put the said George Everett (the son) to work at the business aforesaid, as was to be expected, the said George Everett was caught by a log and was so crushed and mangled that he died of his injuries. And the said plaintiff says, that by reason of the premises he hath been permanently deprived of the services of his said son and servant, which he otherwise would have had and enjoyed for the next five years, and damaged thereby in the sum of $2,500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Plainly, the five years meant are the five years following the death of the son, and the inference and the only inference to be drawn from the language of the declaration is that the death occurred immediately after the injury; and while it is conceded that the father had a right to recover for the loss of the services of the son between the injury and death, no appreciable time between the two events is stated, the declaration proceeding throughout upon the theory that the father is entitled to recover for loss of services up to the time when the son would have become twenty-one years of age, because of some act on the part of the defendant in error, viz., the wrongful death alleged. The language of the declaration with respect to the alleged \u201cwrongful hiring\u201d of the son and putting him at a dangerous employment, thus causing the father the loss of his services, is to be construed as by way of inducement, or merely matter of aggravation, and not as the gravamen or gist of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>We are of opinion that the declaration fails to state a cause of action upon which plaintiff in error is entitled to recover and that there is no error in the judgment of the circuit court complained of. Therefore it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
