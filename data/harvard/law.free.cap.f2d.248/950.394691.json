In 1947 appellant was convicted of the crimes of robbery and housebreaking and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of from three to eleven years. In 1954, having earned 1320 days of statutory \u25a0\u201cgood time\u201d and 297 days of industrial good time, he was released from prison on the usual conditions of parole. In 1955 the Board of Parole of the District of Columbia had appellant arrested as a conditional release violator and, after a hearing revoked his parole and remanded him to serve out the unserved portion of his sentence. Appellant contends that the Board of Parole of the District of Columbia was without jurisdiction to administer the federal statutes relating to parole and that, at all events, he could not be deprived of the \u201cgood time\u201d which he had earned or ordered to serve the unserved portion of his sentence. All of these contentions are so lacking in merit as not to warrant discussion. As to the jurisdiction of the Board of Parole of the District of Columbia, see Story v. Rives, 68 App.D.C. 325, 97 F.2d 182. As to the forfeiture of \u201cgood time\u201d for parole violation and the power of the Parole Board to require appellant to serve the unserved portion of the sentence, see the case above cited and also O\u2019Neal v. Fleming, 4 Cir., 201 F.2d 665; United States ex rel. Rowe v. Nicholson, 4 Cir., 78 F.2d 468, certiorari denied Rowe v. Nicholson, 296 U.S. 573, 56 S.Ct. 118, 80 L.Ed. 405; Industrial \u201cgood time\u201d is granted under \u201cthe same terms and conditions\u201d as commutation of time for good conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4162; Wipf v. King, 8 Cir., 131 F.2d 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
