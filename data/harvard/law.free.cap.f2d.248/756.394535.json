The court charged the jury that \u201cAs a common carrier the defendant railroad company was required by law to use the highest degree of care for the safe carrying of plaintiff as a passenger. This highest degree of care which the law places upon a common carrier does not make the common carrier an insurer of the passengers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>safety but it does require that the common carrier shall exercise extraordinary vigilance for the purpose of protecting its passengers against injury * * * We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that this imposed a higher standard of care than the Virginia rule, which is that \u201ca common carrier must exercise the highest degree of practical care for the safety of its passengers * * *\u201d Crist v. Washington, Virginia &amp; Maryland Coach Co., 196 Va. 642, 645, 85 S.E.2d 213, 215.
