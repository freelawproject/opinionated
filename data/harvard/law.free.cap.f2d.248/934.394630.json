Count I charged an unlawful sale by defendant of a narcotic drug in violation of sec. 4705(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a), and Count II charged that defendant did fraudulently and knowingly receive, conceal, buy and facilitate the transportation and concealment of, after importation into the United States, a quantity of a certain narcotic drug, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-21\">One of the contentions made in support of defendant\u2019s appeal was abandoned by his counsel in oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-22\">The only remaining contention is that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-23\">We have examined the record and find there sufficient substantial evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt </em>beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-24\">We must weigh the evidence, not as the trial court, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether it was sufficient to sustain the finding of guilty. Were we to substitute our judgment in this respect for that of the district judge we would usurp the functions of the trier of the facts. United States v. Pisano, 7 Cir., 193 F.2d 361, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-25\">For these reasons the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
