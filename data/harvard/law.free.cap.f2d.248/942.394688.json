Appellant was convicted of crime in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Subsequently he made a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 to vacate the sentence. This motion was denied and the denial was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Hall v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 235 F.2d 838. By the petition for habeas corpus he seeks to raise again the same questions decided against him on the motion. The petition was properly dismissed since there was nothing to indicate that the remedy by motion in the sentencing court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d. Rice v. Clemmer, 4 Cir., 242 F.2d 870; Gaylord v. Clemmer, 4 Cir., 242 F.2d 872; Bozell v. Welch, 4 Cir., 203 F.2d 711; Myers v. Welch, 4 Cir., 179 F.2d 707, 708; Myers v.
