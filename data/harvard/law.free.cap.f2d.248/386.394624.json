Atlanta Printing Pressmen and Assistant's Union, 5 Cir., 243 F.2d 284, followed by denial of certiorari 354 U.S. 937, 77 S.Ct. 1397, 1 L.Ed.2d 1537, defendant AFL Union, by motion to amend our judgment, seeks a fifth bite at the cherry to require a trial on liability issues as well. Formal denials in the pleadings, insufficient alone to create a genuine issue of fact where none exists, Bruce Construction Corp. v. United States for use of Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, 5 Cir., 242 F.2d 873, do controvert the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that (1) the CIO Union was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>certified, (2) the AFL Union \u201ccalled\u201d the strike, and that (3) the plaintiff\u2019s business was \u201can industry or activity affecting commerce,\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 187. But a consideration of the whole record here, below, and above is convincing that this aftermath is an afterthought as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">First, in twice moving below for a reconsideration of the earlier order granting summary judgment for the plaintiff Employer and limiting trial solely to the issue of damages, defendant AFL Union\u2019s motions related entirely to the basic question with which our decision treated and did not, in the least, suggest the existence of a controversy on these three points. Next, the stipulations stated without dispute that the CIO Union was certified and there is and can be no real doubt as to the time, form and content of this official governmental action. On issue (2) the Statute, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 187(a) (3), requires only that the Union \u201cengage in * * * a strike * * * where an object * * * \u201d is an illegal one. By admitted correspondence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pleadings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stipulation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and repeated statements by responsible Counsel in briefs,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there is no doubt that the AFL Union \u201cengaged\u201d in the strike and avowedly for the purpose which we held to be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-22\">On issue (3) the stipulated<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> facts show that the Employer\u2019s business was \u201c * * * an industry or activity affecting commerce * * thus meeting the requirement of the statute, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 187(a) (3), N. L. R. B. v. Fainblatt, 306 U.S. 601, 307 U.S. 609, 59 S.Ct. 668, 83 L.Ed. 1014, whatever might have been, as now belatedly claimed, the administrative refusal of the Board to accept jurisdiction. Cf. Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, 353 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 598, 1 L.Ed.2d 601; Amalgamated Meat Cutters, etc., Local No. 427, A. F. L. v. Fairlawn Meats, Inc., 353 U.S. 20, 77 S.Ct. 604, 1 L.Ed.2d 613; San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 353 U.S. 26, 77 S.Ct. 607,1 L.Ed.2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-24\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\">. See letter April 27, 1955 by the AFL Union\u2019s counsel to NLRB withdrawing its petition for certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201c * * * Since the employees concerned are already out on strike, my client will either win or lose the strike on an economic basis. Further proceedings therefore would be unwarranted before your agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\">. The AFL Union\u2019s initial motion to dismiss sought dismissal \u201cbecause the strike engaged in by defendant [AFL Union] and upon which this cause of action is predicated * * * did * * * not * * * violate Section 303(a) (3) * *</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">And see also first Motion for Reconsideration in trial court (R.33) : \u201cThere can be no question but the facts stipulated by the parties show * * * that movant [AFL Union] was free to strike ***.*** The unit sought by movant [AFL Union] is a unit of \u2018all apprentices * * *.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b435-15\">.
