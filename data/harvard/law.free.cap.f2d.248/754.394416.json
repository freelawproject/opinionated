Scott and Walter B. Fagan appeal. Their principal ground is that the District Court erred in refusing to suppress for use as evidence substantial sums of <em>money </em>found on their persons when they were arrested two or three hours after the robbery. We think the search and seizure were incidents of a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-22\">We have examined all other reasons for reversal advanced by appellants but regard them as insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
