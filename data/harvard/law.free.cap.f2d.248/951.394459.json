At the trial certain depositions taken in Hong Kong were received in evidence. In addition, perhaps the principal evidence for the plaintiffs consisted of live testimony, in English, by two witnesses for the plaintiffs. These two-witnesses were Wong Loy Jee and Wong Wah Jee, each of whom claimed that he is a blood brother of the other and also a blood brother of the three plaintiffs. The district court in its findings of fact gave its reasons for concluding that the stories told by these two witnesses were \u201cinherently incredible\u201d, with the result that the district court received the \u201cstrong impression that the stories stated on the stand by the two witnesses were not true\u201d; hence, \u201cthe Court does not believe either of the witnesses.\u201d Accordingly, the court entered judgments dismissing the complaints. On this appeal the sole issue is whether we can say that this finding by the district court was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under Rule 52(a), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A. After an examination of the record, we certainly cannot say that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">A judgment will be entered affirming the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
