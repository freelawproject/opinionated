BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">On facts, strikingly simple, neither complex nor conflicting, we have again the problem of an Insurer who has written the policy and taken \u25a0 the Assured\u2019s premium, urging him to go elsewhere, tentatively if not finally, because another insurer is, or ought- to, or may be, liable for the whole, half, or part a loaf. In the process the moving Insurer generally garbs itself in the appealing robes. of some assured so that, casting itself in a strange role, it asserts what it so often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>denied that the policy should be liberally construed and, by a bare toe hold manages to make itself enough of a party to force a construction of another contract made by another insurer with another assured and which, under no circumstance, was made for its benefit, Maryland Casualty Co. v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 235 F.2d 679; United Services Automobile Association v. Russom, 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 296; General Insurance Co. of America v. Western Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 289; Continental Casualty Company v. Suttenfield, 5 Cir., 236 F. 2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">So it is here. Coming as it does the accident and the assureds seem all but forgotten as the two Insurers match clause against clause, coverage against exclusion, claim against denial, in this battle between fortuitous adversaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Osborne, a contract carrier, was the leased (chartered) owner of the truck in question. Estes was his driver. American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company, Inc. (American) was Osborne\u2019s Insurer. Estes drove the truck. While the truck was being unloaded by an employee of Larsen &amp; Larsen, Inc., a consignee at its job-site, Estes was injured when the Larsen employees negligently allowed a heavy piece of the truck\u2019s cargo to fall on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">Estes sued Larsen who called on its Insurer, St. Paul-Mercury Indemnity Company (St. Paul) to undertake the defense under its Comprehensive General and Automobile Liability Policy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (ACP Form). The occurrence, the injury, the amount of the claim were clearly within the broad coverage of the St. Paul policy. Up to this stage, St. Paul had a plain obligation to defend and indemnify Larsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">By the fortuitous circumstance that the accident occurred in Alabama where the legal issue was not categorically foreclosed, Osborne had an automobile policy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with an Omnibus<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Insured clause and a pro rata, rather than excess, Other Insurance clause, and the unloading of the truck constituted a <em>use </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of it with Osborne\u2019s permission, St. Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>mad\u00e9 the now familiar, but understandably surprising announcement to its Assured Larsen that it, St. Paul, did not owe Larsen, its Assured, the obligation to defend or indemnify because someone else \u2014 a party with whom Larsen had no contractual relationship whatsoever\u2014 American was obliged to defend. St. Paul claimed the right to do this under the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d endorsement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">But at this stage, St. Paul had no rights whatever under American\u2019s policy. St. Paul was not a party to it, and American had made no agreements whatsoever with St. Paul that it would, or would not do, anything. St. Paul was a complete total stranger. St. Paul then had no subrogation rights, for by a special endorsement, as between Larsen and itself, those arose only \u201cIn the event of any payment under this policy\u201d which had not, then or now, ever been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Still an interloping stranger, St. Paul called on American to defend and this was declined. Whether St. Paul was right or American was right on the construction of the Omnibus and the Employee Exclusion clauses<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of American\u2019s policy was, as between St. Paul and American, an academic matter only. St. Paul could not then demand anything from American and on American\u2019s refusal to abide with any demand, St. Paul had no legal right to vindicate. All it had was a <em>defense </em>as between itself and its own assured, Larsen, that since American\u2019s policy was available to Larsen as an omnibus assured, the St. Paul policy did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">This did not change when St. Paul instituted this declaratory judgment action against Larsen, Osborne, American and, for good measure, under the anonymity of John Doe and Richard Roe, the four or five manual labor employees of Larsen whose negligence caused Estes\u2019 harm and brought into play St. Paul\u2019s obligation to defend those very acts. This did present a justiciable controversy between St. Paul and Larsen. But neither Larsen nor his allied John Does and Richard Roes sought any relief by answer, cross claim, or otherwise, against American (or Osborne). So, while American was in the suit and answered, as a substantive matter it was a jousting between two entirely unrelated strangers, foreign to each other, and having no common source by legal fiction or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">This posture is important for it keeps in sharp focus that in the interpretation of American\u2019s policy (and the Employee Exclusion, note 6, supra) this must be viewed entirely in the light that this is related to the <em>defense </em>which St. Paul urges against its own Assured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Larsen. The process works this way: (1) St. Paul is not obligated to defend Larsen if Larsen has other insurance; (2) Larsen has other insurance because (a) it is an Omnibus Assured and (b) the Employee Exclusion in that \u201cother\u201d policy does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In this sole controversy then pending, St. Paul neither has nor acquired (by subrogation or implied anticipatory assignment) the status of a vicarious assured under American\u2019s policy. St. Paul then fails in the effort to reap the tactical or strategic advantages which often prevail in construing the policy most favorably to the assured. And, as a complete stranger, in assaying the defense between it and its assured, Larsen, St. Paul\u2019s position is neither that of an assured (named or omnibus) who has paid a claim and seeks indemnity, or a third party judgment creditor claimant, with all of the favored status which that position may give, Maryland Casualty Co. v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co., supra, seeking satisfaction of the judgment after compliance with the no action clause of the policy. Section 12, Title 28, Alabama Code of 1940; Employers Ins. Co. of Alabama v. Johnston, 238 Ala. 26, 189 So. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">What we are saying is simply this: this is not a suit between an insurer and the assured, or one who under state statutes or procedures is deemed a third party beneficiary of the contract. Principles of construction may well be far different as to those cases, and as to those this opinion expresses none. This is simply and solely a case in which, in determining the application of one contract between the parties (St. Paul v. Larsen), it is necessary to construe another contract between entirely different parties (American \u2014 Osborne).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">This has crucial importance for there is then no basis for reading into that \u201cother\u201d contract words or clauses to make it better or more reasonable for one of the parties to it. And, on the contrary, there is every reason that it should be interpreted and applied as written, and if the words used cover, they should be applied even though the result might be less favorable to one of the parties to that contract, but who is nonetheless now quite satisfied with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">In this light, the American policy, uses language which is plain and direct. After expressly stating, note 3, supra, that the term \u201cInsured,\u201d with respect to these coverages, \u201cincludes the named insured\u201d (Osborne), the policy uses equally simple, plain language in excluding liabilities. In peremptory terms it declares, note 6, supra, that \u201cThis policy does not apply.\u201d And it then proceeds to state emphatically that it does not apply whatsoever to \u201cbodily injury to * * * any employee of the insured while engaged in the employment * * * of the insured \u2666* * \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">Estes was an employee of the insured, Osborne. Estes was subject to the Alabama Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Code 1940, Tit. 26, \u00a7 253 et seq., and received compensation under it. And Estes admittedly sustained his injuries \u201c * * while engaged in the employment * * of the insured * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">The District Judge, 146 F.Supp. 39, 43, concluded that the \u201cbetter existing authority * * * is * * * that the proper construction of the words \u2018the insured\u2019 contained in exclusion clauses (d) and (e) [note 6, supra] * * * exclude coverage only in those cases in which the injured party is an employee of the insured claiming coverage under the policy, whether such insured be the named insured or an additional insured under the omnibus clause * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">We think that as to this controversy and for Alabama<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> his conclusion was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-19\">The Erie handwriting on the wall, while leaving some for a Daniel\u2019s read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ing, reveals enough to us to indicate the probable course Alabama would take. [Erie L. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188]. The act of Erie judging requires that we pursue it. West v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 311 U.S. 223, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139; Six Companies of California v. Joint Highway Dist. No. 13, 311 U.S. 180, 61 S.Ct. 186, 85 L.Ed. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Adhering to the traditional view that as between insurer and assured, terms of doubtful, double, or ambiguous meaning are to be liberally construed, Alabama yet makes it clear that insurance policies, as any other contract, are to be interpreted to effectuate the intention of the parties as expressed by the words used. We have recently considered this at length, Ward v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 134, 137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c * * * the pole star by which we are to be guided in construing the policy is * * * the intention of the parties. The pertinent rules of construction have been well set forth by the Supreme Court of Alabama.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWn\">\u201c \u2018Insurance policies, as a general rule, should be liberally construed, and the language used in them should usually be given its ordinary common interpretation. No strained or unusual construction should be given to any of the terms of a policy of insurance, in favor of the insurer or of the insured * * * Empire Life Ins. Co. v. Gee, 178 Ala. 492, 60 So. 90, 92.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201c \u2018 * * * the words of the policy must be given the meaning which they ordinarily bear, and, where it is manifest, * * * that the intention of the insurer and the insured was that liability should attach only in given circumstances, the law will uphold the contract according to its true intent and import.\u2019 Kilby Car &amp; Foundry Co. v. Georgia Casualty Co., 209 Ala. 356, 96 So. 319, 320.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">\u201c <em>&lt; </em>* * * The true intent governs insurance contracts the same as others. * * * no strained construction should be indulged to raise doubt.\u2019 Home Loan &amp; Finance Co. v.

Hicks, 234 Ala. 451, 175 So. 258, 259.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">In McDowell v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 260 Ala. 412, 71 So.2d 64, 69, involving employee exclusions quite comparable to those here, the Supreme Court of Alabama reiterates the rule that \u201cthe contract made by the parties shall prevail, and no new contract [shall] be interpolated by construction. [and] \u2018Provisions clearly disclosing their real intent are not to be given a strained construction to raise doubts where none reasonably exist.\u2019 \u201d Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Chapman, 240 Ala. 599, 200 So. 425, 426. And the Court \u201c * * * cannot by construction do violence to the language of the policy or read into it something that is not there. The language, \u2018The insurance does not apply\u2019, can carry no other meaning.\u201d McDowell v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., supra. Of course, the words of American\u2019s policy \u201cThis policy does not apply,\u201d supra, is but a paraphrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">That there is a sharp division <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the authorities indicating arguments that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>may be made on both sides does not lessen the necessity of Alabama having to make a choice. And, for Alabama, we must-do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">When it comes to assaying intent, we are looking at the contract through the eyes of Osborne and American. They are the parties to the contract. Of course, when the facts occur as to any one incident to give him that status, an Omnibus Assured is the beneficiary of the contract and for that occasion is a party to it. But his amorphous nature, the fact that never, or seldom, is his identity known or ascertainable in advance, keeps him from being a party whose \u201cintention\u201d as of the inception of the policy may be taken into account. He enters the initial picture only insofar as the named assured and insurer determine the circumstances under and the extent to which they mutually intend that such third persons are to be extended benefits. This has wisdom for, unlike the argument made by American that the named assured cannot have intended to give the Omnibus Assured insurance without cost, there may be a substantial advantage to the assured and which the insurer takes into account as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>an underwriting factor in making the insurance available to others. One benefit is that the endless variables of the business world, the ambiguous, if not sometimes ambiguous amphibious, uncertainties of the status of employees, independent contractors, invitees, licensees, joint venturers, lessees, managing agents, or the like, frequently involve the named assured in litigation which is really not his. Often this is because of the lack of, or gaps in, insurance of these others. The omnibus coverage, like a liberal sprinkling of joint assured endorsements, eliminates the unseemly contention, strife and litigation between those engaged in a cooperative business project or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">But even here it is tested from the named assured\u2019s interests and needs. And unless words in their common, plain meaning drive one to such a construction, it is hardly to be expected that in the process of determining the circumstances under which it is advantageous to him to make insurance available to others, the named assured would be establishing insurance coverage that was increasing, not decreasing, his cost or exposure, was duplicating, not simplifying, his insurance program. Yet that is where we are in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">At the inception, a business assured, like Osborne, has two primary fields of exposure: (1) to employees; and (2) to third parties, members of the public and persons not in the status of employees. The two present different hazards of frequency and severity and traditionally are underwritten separately. The first group is cared for by Employers Liability insurance which, includes as well, if applicable, state or federal workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. This insurance is carefully limited to persons in the status of employees and excludes all others. The second group is cared for by Public Liability coverage, either for general operations as Larsen\u2019s CGL policy, or specifically in connection with automobiles as in American\u2019s automobile policy. These invariably exclude employees of the assured and, to eliminate any doubts, exclude liabilities imposed under workmen\u2019s compensation acts. The obvious result is that the prudent business man obtains two types of insurance and, of course, pays two premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Since, for business men, if not for the general public, business and law have long abandoned the naive idea that the payment of losses are \u201cfree\u201d to the assured, the purpose of an assured to integrate his program and reduce cost is thwarted if the policies, so carefully dovetailed, are construed to duplicate coverage. In this sense it is not a matter of the legal concept of liability (master-servant compared to third party), or the coincidence that an employee may be able to contrive a third party relationship on which to base a damage suit. The thing of importance is that for an injury received in the course of the named assured\u2019s employment, his employee is enabled to recover ultimately from the employer\u2019s Public Liability insurer (and \u25a0 hence him), the very kind of losses or damages which the assured has paid another to underwrite.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Of course, these payments must ultimately come from somewhere, and it is. the fact of business life that claims paid will, as they must, someday come from the assured\u2019s pocket. Especially is that so where, as both American and Osborne-so vainly<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> sought to establish as a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>here, policies today are written frequently on retrospective rating plans, direct cost of claims plus administrative overhead, or the like, in which it is the assured\u2019s money from beginning to end.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Since Osborne obtained and paid for Employers Liability coverage, is it likely that for injuries to these employees while in his service, he <em>intended </em>to provide and pay for more ? The only reason advanced here by the interloping St. Paul is that unless the policy is so construed, it produces an anomaly in <em>another </em>situation. The argument runs like this: to deny coverage for this situation means that \u201cthe insured\u201d in the Employee Exclusion clause, note 6, supra, must be interpreted to read as though the italicized words were added, \u201cthe insured, <em>named or omnibus.\u201d </em>In such event, for a suit by an employee of an omnibus assured (e.g., one of Larsen\u2019s employees) against the named assured (Osborne), there would be no coverage since such suit would be by an \u201cemployee\u201d of an \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Of course, this is a beguiling mirage. It is in fact quite different. For in the analysis of the employer\u2019s (assured\u2019s) needs, this is a case of a third party making a traditional public liability claim. This is the very purpose for the insurance. It would be surprising to interpret the language to deny altogether the coverage sought at the very time it was most needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Giving ground as common sense obviously compels on this, St. Paul then suggests that to avoid this result, it means that the term \u201cthe insured\u201d in the Employee Exclusion would have to be interpreted as though it read \u201cthe <em>named </em>insured.\u201d On that, St. Paul contrives another windmill to tilt by pointing out that this would then <em>extend </em>the coverage to a suit by an employee of an omnibus assured against the omnibus insured. Of course, no one could think that this would be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The trouble with this reasoning is that its strength lay in the claim that it is the only way consistently to avoid absurd results in other situations. We would think that to avoid absurd results, a Court could do so directly without any incidental (and accidently beneficial) excursions around Robin Hood\u2019s barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Finally, St. Paul unavoidably commits itself to the curious argument that since, to avoid the result of Kaifer<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> v. Georgia Casualty Company, 9 Cir., 67 F.2d 309, and others like it (questioned by us in Johnson v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 5 Cir., 104 F.2d 22) which produced a result so contrary to the purpose of the contract that the standard policy was modified by introducing the cross-employee exception in the Omnibus Clause, Par. III(d), note 3, supra, the amendment was actually not necessary if the policy is construed as we do. For in such a case, whether a suit by one employee against another fellow employee of the named assured, or by one employee against another fellow employee of an omnibus assured coverage would be excluded simply because of the status as such an employee. As a conceptual matter, this may be appealing. But it hardly has much impressiveness since the policy was amended to deal with the fact that from the point of view of underwriting intent apparently too many courts were too misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">In the posture of this case, we see no reason why \u201cemployee of the insured\u201d should be interpreted to take from it one (Estes) who was in fact such an employee and who, while acting as such, was injured. The policy, thus construed, gives full voice to the needs and purposes of the parties. If as suggested by St. Paul, this has now all been changed by the 1955 addition of the \u201cSeverability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Clause,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see note 9, supra, it merely re-enforces our conviction that meeting the insurance needs of the parties and indeed, at times, overcoming the effect of adverse or unsound court decisions, presents factors \"to be assayed by underwriters whether they sit at Lloyd\u2019s Coffee House,\u201d Maryland Casualty Company v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Company, 5 Cir., 235 F.2d 679, 683, or elsewhere. Courts are not to remake the contract. C. E. Carnes &amp; Co. v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., 5 Cir., 101 F.2d 739; Williams v. American Automobile Insurance Company, 5 Cir., 44 F.2d 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The declaration by the District Court that the policy of American-Fidelity and Casualty Company, Inc. covered the Omnibus Assured, Larsen &amp; Larsen, Inc., for an injury received by Estes in the course of his employment for Osborne was wrong. That declaration is reversed and here rendered to hold the American policy not applicable. The cause is remanded for such further and non-inconsistent proceedings as may be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Reversed and rendered in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\">.

Exercising the advocate\u2019s privilege of asserting what the law ought to be, rather than what it is, the authors candidly acknowledge that their thesis is followed in the Ninth Circuit and Wisconsin (and since publication Louisiana joins their ranks), but is rejected in Mississippi, New York, South Dakota and Washington with adverse indications in Kansas and Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"AH0R\">Cases either holding or indicating that the policy does not cover suits by an employee of the named insured against an Omnibus Assured: Greaves v.

Illustrating the vice of attempting to construe these policies through the rose-colored glasses of a hopeful, needy stranger (St. Paul), the District Court, presumably because he thought it was altering a written contract, declined to allow Osborne and American to prove that simultaneously with the delivery of the American policy, a retrospective claims experience premium plan was agreed to between them by which Osborne in effect bore all or a substantial part of bis own losses. As this did not involve a subsequent attempt to alter existing obligations to adversely affect tbe intervening-interests or rights then accrued of a third: party (e. g., third party injury claimant),, the parties were, of course, free to make-whatever agreements they wished as between themselves even though it might have the effect of modifying the contract (the policy; just made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">. Like McDowell v.

Our discussion, incident to the quest for the intention of the parties (that is as between Osborne and American) was to point up the undeniable fact that there was no relationship between St. Paul and American and that St. Paul neither had nor could claim any rights, as such, under American's policy. This inheres in the nature of two completely separate contracts between two sets of unrelated parties. The desirable flexibility of declaratory relief cannot, of course, make a new contract or add parties to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">The Petition for Rehearing is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
