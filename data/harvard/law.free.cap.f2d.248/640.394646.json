The statement of the case which follows is drawn from the allegations of the petition which the Government admits, either specifically or by failure to controvert, as supplemented by the original papers in the District Court\u2019s file of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-23\">Petitioner, found at the scene of a fire in a vacant house when fire and police officials responded to an alarm, was indicted for arson. An attorney appointed for him by the District Court, being assured by petitioner that he had had nothing to do with the fire, entered a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-24\">On the day set for trial, counsel learned from the arresting officers that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>his client had admitted setting the fire and had given the officers a written confession on the basis of which it was their opinion that he \u201cwas sick and needed psychiatric treatment.\u201d The account petitioner gave the officers revealed the classic symptoms of the pyromaniae who sets fires to gratify sexual urges. See Cleckley, The Mask of Sanity 288 (3d ed. 1955); Guttmacher and Weihofen, Psychiatry and the Law 57 (1952). He told them he had been starting fires since he was twelve years old; that he had started about one hundred fires; that he had set about fifteen fires in the same block of vacant houses in the past year; and that the fire at which he had been apprehended was the second he had lit in that very house that night. The pattern of his abnormalcy, as revealed in his confession, is as follows: He awakes in the night feeling a strong sexual urge. He goes out and starts a fire and then turns in an alarm. He watches the firemen put out the fire and only then obtains sexual gratification, sometimes with his wife and sometimes by masturbation. On the night in question, feeling unsatisfied after acting out his pattern, he returned to the scene and acted it out again.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">These facts, learned on April 11, 1956, the day set for trial, obviously required an altogether different preparation for defense. The petition before us alleges and the Government does not deny that defense counsel laid his predicament before the assignment judge;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the judge said that counsel\u2019s statement alone was insufficient ground for ordering a psychiatric examination of the accused; that the judge advised counsel that if he entered a plea of guilty, there would be ample opportunity, in the interval before sentencing, to investigate the possibility of an insanity defense And, if successful, to withdraw the guilty plea; and that counsel thereupon withdrew the not guilty plea and entered a plea of guilty. The case was then referred to the Probation Office for investigation and sentencing was set for June 1, 1956. To pursue the investigation of the insanity defense, counsel arranged with the probation officer for a psychiatric examination. Shortly before the sentencing date, however, counsel learned from the probation officer that it had been decided not to have petitioner examined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">On June 1, 1956, counsel orally moved before the sentencing judge, under Rule 32(d), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A., to withdraw the guilty plea and enter a plea of not guilty. The Government admits that the motion was denied solely on the ground that it was not in writing and that immediately thereafter the judge pronounced sentence. Imposition of sentence automatically imposed upon petitioner the heavy burden of showing \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d as a basis for post-sentence withdrawal of the guilty plea. Rule 37(d), F.R.Crim.P. On June 12, 1956, counsel filed a written motion to vacate the judgment and withdraw the plea. In connection with this motion, the judge ordered a psychiatric examination to be made by Dr. Thomas E. Griffin, Chief, Legal Psychitric Services, to determine whether petitioner had been mentally competent when the guilty plea was entered and when the sentence was imposed. Dr. Griffin, on the basis of an examination of petitioner conducted in his cell on June 26, 1956, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>reported that he was then and had been on the dates in question \u201cof sound mind.\u201d The judge thereupon ruled that the petitioner had failed to make such a showing of \u201cinsanity as would constitute a legal defense,\u201d a showing which the court thought necessary to establish \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d The court denied the motion without prejudice to renewal \u201cupon further showing of sufficient facts as would constitute a legal defense of insanity\u201d and then ordered Dr. Griffin \u201cto make a further mental examination of the defendant in accordance with this order.\u201d After another jail interview, Dr. Griffin reported that petitioner had probably been \u201cof sound mind\u201d when the crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">On September 26, 1956, counsel again moved to vacate the judgment and withdraw the guilty plea. Before ruling on this motion, the District Court, on December 4, 1956, ordered an examination by Dr. William G. Cushard of St. Elizabeths Hospital for the purpose of ascertaining petitioner\u2019s mental condition at the time of the crime and the guilty plea. Dr. Cushard, after a jail interview with petitioner, reported that, in his opinion, petitioner was not suffering from a mental disease when he saw him and that there was nothing to indicate mental disease at the time of the crime or the guilty plea, but that petitioner was \u201csuffering from a severe degree of mental defect.\u201d He reported also that petitioner had been admitted to the District Training School some fifteen years before as a mentally retarded person with an I. Q. of 46, subsequently determined to be 41, and that he had been a rather serious behavior problem at the school, absconding 26 times and threatening to bum the buildings or employees\u2019 automobiles. Dr. Cushard recommended that a clinical psychologist examine petitioner to \u201crecheck the degree of mental defect.\u201d On January 4, 1957, the court appointed Dr. John L. Endaeott to make the psychological examination. Dr. Endaeott examined petitioner on January 26, 1957, and reported to Dr. Cushard that he found the subject to be a \u201cborderline mental defective,\u201d rather than \u201cstrictly a mental defective.\u201d Dr. Cushard thereupon reported to the court on February 18, 1957, that he felt required to accept Dr. Endacott\u2019s findings and that, on those findings, petitioner \u201cis not suffering from mental defect of a sufficient severity to render him mentally incompetent.\u201d He added: \u201cIn view of the rather confusing and unusual psychological findings concerning the intelligence level of this man I shall be glad to discuss the case with you, if you wish.\u201d The record does not show whether such a discussion occurred. In any event, having held petitioner\u2019s motion under advisement until July 5, 1957, the court, on that date, denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">An application for leave to proceed in forma pauperis was denied by the District Court on July 11, 1957, as \u201cfrivolous, without merit and * * * not taken in good faith,\u201d in that \u201ccareful consideration [had been] given by qualified psychiatrists to any suggestion of insanity on the part of the defendant, and * * * all such psychiatrists agreed there was no evidence of such insanity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">From the admitted facts on the record before us, the conclusion is inescapable that justice required that petitioner be permitted to plead not guilty. It was, therefore, error to have denied the June 1, 1956, pre-sentence motion to withdraw the guilty plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ground upon which that motion was denied was that it was not in writing. But, since the motion was made at the sentencing hearing and since the requirement of writing does not apply to a motion \u201cmade during a trial or hearing,\u201d Rule 47, F.R.Crim.P., counsel had a right to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>his motion orally. Even if the requirement of writing were applicable, the court had discretion under Rule 47 to entertain and grant an oral motion. And, even if it were a proper exercise of discretion to have denied this oral motion, <em>e. g., </em>on a theory that the motion should be in writing in order to apprise the prosecution of its exact terms and give it an opportunity to file a reply, the court should have deferred sentencing petitioner long enough to permit preparation of a written motion. Granting leave to file a written motion gives the accused less than he is entitled to, unless sentencing is deferred, because, on a post-sentence motion, the accused has the heavy burden of showing that not to allow a change of plea would be \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d Rule 37(d), F.R.Crim.P.; cf. Bergen v. United States, 8 Cir., 1944, 145 F.2d 181, 187. The imposition upon petitioner of this heavy burden, simply because his motion was oral, cannot be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">As the judge construed the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d burden, it required the petitioner to establish a defense of insanity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under a plea of not guilty, defending on the ground of insanity, petitioner would be required only to introduce \u201csome evidence\u201d of insanity, after which the Government would have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of arson was not the product of a mental disease or defect. Davis v. United States, 1895, 160 U.S. 469, 488, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499; Tatum v. United States, 1951, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 190 F.2d 612; Douglas v. United States, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 239 F.2d 52. If the Government were to offer the bare conclusions of Drs. Griffin and Cushard that petitioner is or was \u201cof sound mind\u201d or not suffering from \u201cmental disease\u201d or from \u201cmental defect of a sufficient severity to render him mentally incompetent,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cross-examination could reveal the factual content of these conclusions, leaving it for the jury to determine, on the basis of those facts, as well as the doctors\u2019 opinions, the confession and any other evidence brought to bear, whether it had been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the act was not the product of mental disease or defect. The effect of denying petitioner\u2019s pre-sentence motion on the ground that it was not in writing and then sentencing him before his counsel could put it in writing, was to deprive petitioner of the right to bring the issue of his criminal responsibility before a jury, unless he could first prove \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d which the sentencing judge took to mean such \u201cinsanity as would constitute a legal defense.\u201d The burden of proof on the issue of insanity was thus shifted from the prosecution to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">And petitioner was required to bear this burden, not only without the financial resources to employ psychiatrists, but without the opportunity to examine the court-appointed psychiatrists to elucidate the meaning of the conclusory statements upon which the court relied. The reports of the psysehiatrists do not reveal the basis for their conclusions and there is no way of knowing whether they used the terms \u201csound mind\u201d or \u201cmental disease\u201d or \u201cmental defect\u201d in their legal or medical sense. At a trial, however, whether petitioner was suffering from such \u201cmental disease\u201d or \u201cmental defect,\u201d when he lit the fire, as to discharge him of criminal responsibility, Durham v. United States, 1954, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 45 A.L.R.2d 1430, would be determined by the trier of the facts, not by the psychiatric witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The witnesses\u2019 role would be to supply to the trier of the facts the data upon which the determination can be made. If, by testimony that the accused either was or was not suffering from a \u201cmental disease\u201d or a \u201cmental defect,\u201d a psychiatrist would be expressing a judgment that the accused should or should not be acquitted, that would be a legal rather than medical judgment and would usurp the function of the trier of the facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the state of the accused\u2019s mental health is a proper subject of medical opinion, no purpose is served by giving the fact trier a doctor\u2019s version of a legal opinion. To that end, if the psychiatrists were to testify in terms embodying legal conclusions, the lawyers, by examination and cross-examination, would seek to bring out the medical facts. The same is true if the psychiatrists were to testify in such ambiguities as \u201csound mind\u201d or \u201cunsound mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The statements of the psychiatrists in the instant case that petitioner was free from \u201cmental disease\u201d could have been intended to mean that he was of normal mental health <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 a medical judgment within the witnesses\u2019 competence and useful to the fact trier. They could also have been intended to mean that petitioner\u2019s illness, not being a psychosis, was not such a \u201cdisease\u201d as discharges of guilt \u2014 a legal judgment not within the witnesses\u2019 competence and of no use to the fact trier. With the ordinary trial processes unavailable for elucidating the psychiatrists\u2019 conclusory statements, the District Court had no way of knowing what meaning was intended. The court\u2019s conclusion that the psychiatrists\u2019 statements amounted to no \u201cshowing of sufficient facts as would constitute a legal defense of insanity\u201d is meaningful, therefore, only on the unacceptable theory that the burden of proving insanity is upon the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Judge Bast\u00edan voted to grant and Judge Miller voted to deny the petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. I joined Judge Bast\u00edan for the purpose of reaching decision. But I would go further. The facts admitted on the pleadings before us cry out for reversal of the conviction, so that petitioner may enter a plea of not guilty and have a trial<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the issue of his criminal responsibility for his confessed act of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Petitioner has already served more than fifteen months of his sentence of two to eight years. Much of that time was consumed by the District Court\u2019s conscientious and commendable efforts to provide the petitioner with the means of sustaining the burden of showing \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d by ordering one psychiatric examination after another, so long as there appeared to be some area left unexplored. The facts remain, however, that the imposition of the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d burden was error and that the process of determining whether the burden could be sustained continued until July 5, 1957, more than thirteen months after sentencing. To require that petitioner now pursue the normal appellate process may leave justice undone for many months more.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>may be eligible for release as early as May 31, 1958, it is even possible that the unjust sentence will have been served before decision of the appeal. And, since release from the penitentiary is generally based on passage of time rather than fitness for release, appellant, if he has the pyromania to which he confessed but which was not shown because he was denied a trial, would again imperil the community. While I recognize that short-circuiting the normal appellate process is an extreme measure, it is plainly required to bring to an end the extreme injustice revealed by the Government\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<author id=\"b693-4\">BASTIAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">This case came before the panel simply on a motion for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>There was no motion by defendant to reverse and, of course, no record of the proceedings in the District Court and no opportunity for the United States attorney to argue or to present the reasons for the action of the trial judge insofar as the correctness of the final judgment was concerned. We had before us only the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(not verified), affidavit of poverty, and the Government\u2019s opposition (also not verified).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">I felt that the motion for leave to file <em>in forma pauperis </em>should be granted as, from the papers, it appeared that the questions involved merited consideration by this Court. Judge Bazelon felt likewise; but Judge Miller, being of contrary opinion, dissented. Thus the only motion before us was granted by a majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Judge Bazelon, however, felt we should go further and summarily reverse. I disagree for the following, among other, reasons, and I am authorized to say that Judge Miller concurs in my views:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">First, there was no such motion before us, no complete record, and no opportunity for either side to argue. We had nothing before us but the petition for leave to appeal in <em>forma pauperis </em>and the opposition thereto \u2014 nothing else. While Judge Bazelon has made an examination of certain of the records in the District Court not formally before us, we have no means of knowing that we have <em>all </em>the records necessary to a proper consideration on the merits. It is a long road between granting leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and a reversal on the merits. While I have not had the opportunity to make a survey of this point, I think such a search would establish the fact that considerably less than a majority of the cases in which leave to file <em>in forma pauperis </em>is granted are in fact reversed. It is no argument to say that in certain cases the Supreme Court has granted a petition for writ of certiorari and reversed in the same order. In those cases, almost invariably, the entire record is before the Court, as is the opinion and decision of the Court of Appeals, as well as argument on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Secondly, the action suggested by Judge Bazelon would institute a practice which would be at variance with that now established of setting our cases by lot. Our present practice is one that is entirely free <em>from </em>criticism. Cases are not selected for argument before any panel by the Chief Judge, the Clerk, or any one else. The judges are drawn for certain days entirely by lot; and cases, on motions as well as on the merits, fall to the judges so drawn in regular order. It would do violence to our practice to permit a panel to which has been assigned a motion to take the case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>proceed to dispose of it finally.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> All motions are not as vital as the one before us; and our present practice would suffer if, on a preliminary motion, the merits of a case could be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Thirdly, here even defendant\u2019s trial counsel, who is an able practitioner assigned to the case by the District Court, and serving ably and without compensation, did not ask the extraordinary relief suggested by Judge Bazelon; and, as stated, there has been no opportunity to bring up a complete record, to file briefs on the merits, and no opportunity to argue the ultimate result urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Finally, certainly a final ruling on the appeal could be quickly accomplished by the shortening of the time to file the record, and briefs, and setting the case for final argument on an adequate record and briefs on the substantive question on appeal. No need exists for the extraordinary action suggested, even if Rules 39(c) and (d) would permit such action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\">. The Government states, in its opposition, that counsel informed the assignment judge that \u201ccounsel had recently read petitioner\u2019s confession, talked with several prospective witnesses of the Government and concluded that petitioner was of unsound mind.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\">. Counsel stated in his memorandum in support of his June 12, 1956, motion in the court below that the reason given by the probation officer for deciding not to have petitioner examined was that, in the officer\u2019s opinion, petitioner was \u201cmentally defective, but not psychotic.\u201d The assumption that psychosis is a legally sufficient mental disease and that other illnesses are not is erroneous. Whether the probation officer based it on psychiatric advice does not appear. See text 101 U.S.App.D.C.-, 248 F.2d 643, 644 infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-5\">. In this view of the case, it is unnecessary to reach the question whether the post-sentence motions of June 12 and September 26, 1956, were properly denied. Nor is At necessary to reach the question whether it was proper to have declined to commit petitioner to a mental hospital as provided in D.C.Code, \u00a7 24-301 when the petitioner\u2019s most revealing confession was first disclosed to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\">. The first post-sentence motion, made on June 12, 1956, was denied on June 29, 1950, on the ground \u201cthat defendant has failed to make a sufficient showing of insanity as would constitute a legal defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\">. Dr. Oushard\u2019s statements left open the question whether, though not so defecfive as to bo incompetent to plead to a charge, petitioner had been so defective as to justify discharging him of criminal responsibility. Competency to stand trial is, of course, not equivalent to legal sanity which imposes criminal responsibility. See Ashley v. Pescor, 8 Cir., 1945, 147 F.2d 318, 320.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b692-5\">. The Assistant Superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital, at a round table discussion at the University of Chicago, reported that, after we decided Durham v. United States, 1954, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, the hospital staff agreed that sociopathic or psychopathic personality (which may include pyromania, see Durham v. United States, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 132, 133, 237 F.2d 700, 701, note 6) should not be regarded as \u201cmental disease\u201d within the meaning of the new rule. Weihofen, The Urge To Punish 87 (1956). This inevitably en- . croaches upon the jury function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b692-12\">. If the facts revealed by petitioner\u2019s confession were available to the psychiatrists, I assume they did not mean to say be was of normal mental health. If those facts were not available to them, the reliability of their statements is obviously seriously diminished.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b692-13\">. Unless, in appropriate proceedings before trial, he should be found mentally incompetent to be tried. D.C.Code, \u00a7 24-301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b692-14\">. The median time between docketing of a criminal appeal in this court and its disposition is 5.6 months. In half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>cases, therefore, the appellate process consumes more than 5.6 months \u2014 occasionally even a year or more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">. While Judge Bazelon has personally examined certain of the records in the District Court, still these do not constitute the complete record. The stenographic record is not before us, the United States attorney has not had the opportunity to augment the records examined by Judge Bazelon, and the full and complete facts should be certified to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-21\">. Of course, sometimes the assigned motion may finally dispose of the matter, e. g., motion to dismiss or affirm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
