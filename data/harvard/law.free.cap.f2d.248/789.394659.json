Error is claimed with respect to refusal to grant a continuance, with respect to alleged refusal to require counsel for the government to turn over to defense counsel a statement made by a government witness and in denying a motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\"> The granting of a continuance was a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge and we cannot say that there was an abuse of the discretion. Continuance was asked because of the illness of local counsel who had been retained to represent appellant; but appellant, who had been indicted more than a month before the trial, was represented by other counsel, and the partner of the attorney who was ill appeared and conducted the trial in his stead. As the attorney appearing in court was a trial lawyer of ability who had served as United States Attorney of the district, and as it does not appear-that there was any failure to secure-proofs desired by appellant or that appellant was prejudiced in any other way by the refusal of the continuance, we certainly would not be justified in awarding a new trial on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">With respect to the alleged refusal of the court to require the statement of a government witness to the-F.B.I. to be furnished to counsel for the-defense, it appears that the United States. Attorney furnished to defense counsel a copy of the statement of the witness and that defense counsel accepted it and raised no question with regard thereto-at the time. This, we think, was sufficient to meet the requirement of the rule announced in the case of Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-18\">As to the sufficiency of the-evidence, the rule is well settled that on a motion for a directed verdict the evidence must be considered in the light, most favorable to the government; and, when the evidence here is so considered, there can be no real question as to its-sufficiency. The appellant was charged with a conspiracy to purchase steel from the plant manager of a corporation, knowing that it was being stolen from-, the corporation by the plant manager. There was no question as to the purchase-of the steel from the plant manager or as to its being delivered and paid for under highly suspicious circumstances. The-whole defense rested upon appellant\u2019s-denial of guilty knowledge, but this was-established by direct evidence- of the-plant manager, DeArdo, and corroborat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>ing circumstances which pointed unmistakably to appellant\u2019s guilt. As said by the trial judge in denying the motion for directed verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">\"You have the testimony of De-Ardo, and the court very distinctly understood him to say, or at least that was the court\u2019s impression of his testimony, that they were to split the proceeds from these sales <em>on </em>a fifty-fifty basis, not the commissions but the proceeds from the sales. He has testified that he received from Mr. Franken in cash on various occasions, some of it paid to other parties to be relayed to DeArdo between eight and nine thousand dollars, which would conceivably be many many times a half of the split of reasonable commissions on these sales. Even that would be a circumstance which would tend to charge this man with guilty knowledge in connection with that transaction, if property was being taken out of the plant of the Lorentzen Hardware Manufacturing Company and sold to these steel mills round over the country in a period of time, according to Mr. Brown\u2019s testimony as I remember it, when steel was very tight, it was difficult to get that grade of steel. Here\u2019s a company who is in the manufacturing business buying steel for its own manufacturing purposes. Only on one occasion, according to the testimony, was any of the steel sold \u2014 what we would term rejects; the rest of it was prime steel, and for which Sharon was paying an average of something between five and five and a half cents, or little over five cents a pound \u2014 some of it was sold in Chicago for something around seven and a half cents \u2014 but in a period when steel was scarce, and taking it out of a manufacturing plant, a plant which would ordinarily not have been selling steel at all, all of those circumstances are circumstances which, in my opinion, the jury has a right to consider in connection with DeArdo\u2019s testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">There was no error and the judgment appealed <em>from </em>will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ars\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
