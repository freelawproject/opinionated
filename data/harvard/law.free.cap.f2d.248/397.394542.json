Morris v. Prefabrication Engineering Co., 5 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The defendant complains of the admission in evidence of the last page of Government\u2019s Exhibit 1. This exhibit was a certified copy of the findings and conclusions, the cease and desist order of April .27, 1944, the registered mail return receipts of the Respondents and the certificate of the Secretary of the Federal Trade Commission certifying that no petition was served.upon the Commission to set aside the cease and desist order of April 27, 1944 \u201cissued and served by the Federal Trade Commission\u201d. It was admitted in evidence without objection with the exception of the last page consisting of the registered mail return receipts to which the defendant objected for the reason that they had nothing to do with the cease and desist order and the signatures thereon had not been identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Title 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45(f) provides, in applicable part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-13\">\u201cthe return post office receipt for said * * * order * * * registered and mailed as aforesaid shall be proof of the service of the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A72\">Substantiated by the certificate of the Federal Trade Commission, the testimony of the witness Equi and the presumption of regularity which supports the official acts of public officials, United States v. Chemical Foundation, 1926, 272 U.S. 1, 14, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131, the return registered mail receipt of Edward Lowenthal was properly admitted pursuant to this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">The undisputed evidence is that the cease and desist order against Edward Lowenthal was entered by the Federal Trade Commission on April 27, 1944 and was served on him by registered mail on May 1, 1944 and became final on June 30, 1944; that the witness, Philip Equi, an attorney-examiner for the Federal Trade Commission, interviewed Edward Lowenthal in his office on North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois on more than one occasion, and on or about December 28, 1951 he visited a building on North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois to see Edward Lowenthal and when he entered the building he looked on the directory in the lobby and saw Edward Lowenthal\u2019s name listed together with Retailers Service Bureau and Thomas Webster at room number 800; that he went to room number 800, on the door of which was printed the inscription of Retailers Service Bureau; that he entered the door and found a man who identified himself as Edward Lowenthal; that he had a conversation with Edward Lowenthal and told him he was investigating his compliance or non-compliance with the cease and desist order of April 27, 1944; that Edward Lowenthal admitted to him that he was the Edward Lowenthal named in Government\u2019s Exhibit 1, and they discussed the order and Edward Lowenthal indicated he wished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to co-operate with the Federal Trade Commission and would be willing to discuss entering into a stipulation with the Commission; and that he was the owner or was trading or doing business as Thomas Webster and Retailers Service Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">This was sufficient evidence to support the findings of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The requests for admissions and the responses thereto were not introduced in evidence and in this case the District Court was not required to give any consideration thereto on the trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">There having been sufficient evidence, exclusive of Government\u2019s Exhibit 6, to support the findings of the District Court, the admission in evidence of Government\u2019s Exhibit 6 was not reversible error. Herlihy Mid-Continent Company v. Northern Indiana Public Service Company, 7 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Finding no reversible error, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
