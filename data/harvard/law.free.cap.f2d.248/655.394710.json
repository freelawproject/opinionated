The newspaper published an account of an alleged brutal beating by \u201ctwo officers\u201d who were \u201cplainelothesmen\u201d. The news story included statements that \u201cThe accused officers are assigned to precinct 5\u201d and that \u201cThe arresting officer was listed as Det. C. A. Rudbeck, according to a spokesman at precinct 5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\"> This implied that Rudbeck took part in the alleged beating. The defendant does not contend, in this suit, that he did so. It contends among other things that it only published, in good faith, what it had been told; that the plaintiff was in fact \u201cthe arresting officer\u201d; and that the occasion was privileged. Our decision in Pittsburgh Courier Publishing Co. v. Lubore, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 311, 200 F.2d 355, shows that the occasion was not privileged. We find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
