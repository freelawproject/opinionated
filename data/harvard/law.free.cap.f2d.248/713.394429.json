The judgment also directed the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage securing the indebtedness. For reversal of the judgment, appellants rely upon only one claimed error thus stated in their brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayr\">\u201cThe Court erred in not allowing offsets in the amount of $5,097.50 usurious interest included in the $25,000.00 judgment and $6,702.30 usurious interest previously paid Appellee by Appellant Abel, *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">While the appellants have thus not specified as error the overruling by the district court of their motion to dismiss, our brother, Judge CAMERON, who originally undertook the writing of the court\u2019s opinion upon this appeal, has reached the firm conclusion that the district court lacked jurisdiction because of the absence of an indispensable party plaintiff, namely Clyde E. Brayton as an individual, whose presence would have destroyed the requisite diversity of citizenship. With that conclusion, the majority does not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Upon that threshold question of jurisdiction, as well as upon the merits, it is necessary to consider the entire written contract upon which the action was based. Because of its length, that contract dated April 19, 1955 is attached as an appendix to this opinion. The indebtedness was secured by a chattel mortgage dated April 28, 1955, naming as mortgagee the corporation, Brayton Flying Service, Inc., and covering:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-12\">\u201call furniture, fixtures, tools, equipment and personal property of whatsoever nature, located in or at or used in connection with the place of business at 3211 Love Field Drive in the City of Dallas, Dallas County, Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">The plaintiff rested after introducing the written contract and the chattel mortgage. The defendants called as their witness Clyde E. Brayton himself, who testified that he owned a majority interest in the stock of the plaintiff corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the course of Mr. Brayton\u2019s testimony, the defendants introduced in evidence the written memorials of the series of transactions recited in the \u201cwhereas\u201d paragraphs of the contract sued on, and dated respectively, September 10, October 14 and November 17, 1954, and January 17 and April 13, 1955. On their face those transactions appeared to be as recited in the contract sued on. Defendants claimed, however, that several of them were mere subterfuges to overcome the Texas usury laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">Brayton admitted that he had paid Abel only $13,000.00 for the purchase of the B-25 aircraft on September 10, 1954, and that upon its sale on January 17, 1955 he received $19,727.50. If interest, the $6,727.50 profit was more than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ten per cent permitted by the Texas statutes. (Footnote 2, supra). The answer is, however, that there was no evidence going to show that the earliest contract between Abel and Brayton, dated September 10, 1954, was anything different from what it appeared to be, namely a sale by Abel to Brayton of a \u201cB-25\u201d aircraft with an option to Abel, but no obligation upon him, to repurchase. That form of contract could very well be used as a cloak to conceal usury, but there should be some evidence to that effect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Further, the contract sued on stated in writing over the signature of both Abel and Brayton that a bona fide dispute existed and an accord and satisfaction had been reached.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of any countervailing evidence, we cannot say that it would be clearly erroneous to hold such a written statement sufficient to meet the burden resting upon a party asserting an accord and satisfaction to prove that a bona fide dispute existed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the Texas law seems to be that \u201cA party to a written settlement may not contend that there was no dispute to compromise, when the instrument clearly recites the grounds for the settlement, and he deliberately signed and acknowledged it.\u201d 1 Texas Jurisprudence, Accord and Satisfaction, \u00a7 32, p. 274, citing Ferguson v. Ragland, Tex. Civ.App,, 243 S.W. 721, see page 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Appellants urge also that there was no consideration for the alleged accord and satisfaction. Brayton had advanced to Abel $1,800.00 on April 13, 1955. On April 19th, Brayton advanced to Brayton Flying Service, Inc. an additional $18,-102.50, which in turn gave its check for that amount to Abel and the Director of Internal Revenue at Dallas. In addition, the contract of April 19th provided that in lieu of fifty per cent of the net profit from the sale of the Stearman aircraft and the 83 T-6\u2019s Brayton Flying Service, Inc. would receive $2,000.00 per aircraft plus thirty per cent of the gross sales price of those aircraft to which were added 19 other T-6\u2019s owned by Abel and certain T-6 fuselages, wings, engine mounts and parts. Actually that exchange proved advantageous to Brayton Flying Service, Inc., but there was no showing that it could not have been advantageous to Abel if the market for such things had gone differently before they were sold. In addition, Brayton Flying Service, Inc. obtained security on the 19 other T-6\u2019s and on all furniture, fixtures, tools, equipment, and personal property used in connection with appellants\u2019 business. Brayton Flying Service, Inc. further agreed that in lieu of the $125,000.00 to be paid from the proceeds of sales of aircraft and parts, it would accept the sum of $50,000.00 as full payment before November 1, 1955 or the sum of $100,000.00 before the end of the calendar year of 1955. There was no evidence to show that such agreements were actually of no value. We think that there was ample consideration for the accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">That is true also as to the other promises on Abel\u2019s part contained in the contract of April 19, 1955, including the promise to pay the $25,000.00 which formed the basis for the judgment from which this appeal is prosecuted. That $25,000.00 exceeded the $19,902.50 paid to Abel by $5,097.50, which, if interest, was more than the permissible ten per cent (footnote 2, supra). Again, however, there is no sufficient evidence to re-. quire a finding that such profit was interest or that the contract of April 19, 1955 did not speak the truth or was in any way a subterfuge. If Abel really thought so, he completely failed to explain his failure to take the stand and so testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">Several of the issues which have been discussed involved Brayton as an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>dividual. We shall hereafter point out that Brayton could have been made a cross defendant without depriving the district court of jurisdiction. While that was not done, the issues treated were argued, and apparently tried, by the implied consent of the parties and.those issues should therefore be treated as if raised by the pleadings. Rule 15(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"> For a clearer understanding of the dealings between the parties, we have thought it more convenient to reverse the logical order and to discuss the merits before expressing the views of the majority on the point raised by Judge Cameron that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the individual Clyde E. Brayton was an indispensable party plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we view the case, he was not even a proper party plaintiff. The promise to pay the $25,000.00 upon which the judgment was based ran to the corporation alone, Brayton Flying Service, Inc. As between Brayton Flying Service, Inc. and Clyde E. Brayton the contract attached as an appendix was clearly several rather than joint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The promises to pay upon which this action is based were contained in paragraph numbered III of the contract (see appendix) and ran solely to Brayton Flying Service, Inc. Similarly, the chattel mortgage securing the payment of the $25,000.00 named as the sole mortgagee, Brayton Flying Service, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The rule has been long settled that \u201cWhen a contract has been made with several persons under which a separate duty arises to each, in contemplation of law it is the same as if a separate and distinct contract had been entered into with each separately, and they must sue separately.\u201d 39 Am.Jur., Parties, \u00a7 31, pp. 894, 895.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Further, no injustice was worked on Abel by the omission of Brayton as a party plaintiff. Any relief to which Abel might have been entitled against Brayton arose out of the transactions which formed the subject matter of the suit. A counterclaim for such relief would have been auxiliary to the action of which the district court already had jurisdiction and needed no independent jurisdictional ground to support it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Abel did not avail himself of the right to file such a counterclaim and cannot now complain. Especially is that true, since, as we have seen, the really pertinent issues between Abel and Brayton were tried by implied consent and have been considered pursuant to Rule 15(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Finally, under a so-called \u201ccross-assignment of error\u201d the appellee urges</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-10\">\u201c * * * that the portion of the judgment allowing interest on $19,-902.50 of the $25,000.00 judgment at the rate of 6% from the date of the judgment be reformed and ren- ' dered for 10% interest on said $19,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>902.50 out of the $25,000.00 from April 19, 1955 until paid * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Judge Sibley called attention years ago that the Texas rule permitting an appellee to cross-assign errors without himself appealing has no application in the federal courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It has been repeatedly held that, in the absence of a cross-appeal, appellee may not attempt either to enlarge his rights under the judgment appealed from or to lessen the rights of appellants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">It results that the judgment appealed from should be and the same hereby is</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">.

Brayton, a citizen of Texas, was an indispensable party. The question was raised by a timely motion to dismiss which the Court below denied. In my opinion, the motion should have been granted and the action should have been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds which confronted the Court below and confront this Court as the first order of business at every stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">The contract sued on was an entire contract signed by Abel and his Trustees as First Parties, and by Clyde E. Bray-ton, individually, and Brayton Flying Service, Inc. (by Clyde E. Brayton, President) as Second Parties, and was in the nature of a compromise of disputes then existing between all of the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-17\">The \u201caforesaid contracts\u201d mentioned in the quotation were the contract of September 10, 1954 between Clyde E. Brayton and Frank J. Abel under which said Brayton purchased from said Trust a B-25 Airplane, and granted Abel the right to repurchase or dispose of same within a specified time <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the contract of October 14, 1954 between Frank J. Abel and the plaintiff corporation referring to the intention of the parties to purchase from one to fifteen Stearman Aircraft, and covering the purchase of one such plane for rebuilding and sale after overhauling, the corporation to furnish the money for the purchase and Abel to furnish the manpower for the overhauling, the sale to be for the equal benefit of both, and providing further that the corporation would withdraw fifty per cent of such total expenditure from the amount realized from the <em>sale of the B-25 Aircraft </em>covered by the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>first above-mentioned;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an agreement dated November 17, 1954 between Frank J. Abel and the corporation dealing with the purchase of T-6 airplane fuselages, wings and miscellaneous parts, to be handled and sold with equal division of profits. Said contract also granted the corporation the right to withdraw fifty percent of the total expenditure <em>from the B-25 transaction </em>and the Ste\u00e1rman transaction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The compromise agreement sued on recited that Clyde E. Brayton had advanced Abel $1,800.00 April 13, 1955 by' check payable to Abel and the Director of Internal Revenue and that said Brayton \u201cagrees to 'advance\u2019 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to Brayton Flying Service, Inc., which in turn agrees to pay to Frank J. Abel in addition to said $1,800.00 advanced as aforesaid * * * the sum of $18,102.50 in cash contemporaneously with the execution of this contract and the bill of sale and chattel mortgage hereinafter referred to, to be evidenced by a check payable to said Frank J. Abel \u00e1nd the Director of Internal Revenue at Dallas.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Said agreement also contained a mutual release of all obligations theretofore existing between the parties to it<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which, of course, included Brayton individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-21\">The compromise agreement sued on also obligated Abel to pay the corporation $25,000.00 within one hundred twenty days with ten per cent interest on $19,-902.50, and recited that a part of the consideration besides the money advanced was \u201cthe surrender <em>by Second </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>Parties </em>of their rights to an equal division of the profits from the sale of the said T-6\u2019s,\u201d and provided further that <em>\u201cSecond Parties </em>will execute and deliver to First Parties a bill of sale covering all of the aircraft and parts then remaining on hand.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Brayton was one of the Second Parties upon whom these obligations were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The original and amended complaints recited that defendants had breached the compromise agreement by failing to pay the $25,000.00 with interest, to furnish inventories of the T-6 aircraft and parts, to account for plaintiff\u2019s portion of the sales of said aircraft and parts, and to perform other obligations contained in said agreement. The relief asked was a personal judgment against defendants (appellants) for $25,000.00 and \u201cforeclosure of its chattel mortgage and contract lien and establishing title in plaintiff to said aircraft and parts;\u201d that defendants be enjoined from disposing of any of the mortgaged property and be required to render a full accounting for all parts sold by them, and for \u201csuch other and further relief, special and general, in law and in equity to which it may be justly entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Their motion to dismiss for absence of indispensable parties having been denied, appellants answered the amended complaint denying its charges that they had failed to furnish inventories or to account for plaintiff\u2019s portion of monies derived from sales of the T-6 aircraft parts and that plaintiff was entitled to any relief by injunction. The answer averred that the contract sued on was without consideration, was a subterfuge and an effort to cover up usurious interest in a large amount provided for in said agreement sued on and also in the contract of September 10, 1954 between Abel and Clyde E. Brayton individually; that the four contracts were a series of connected transactions between the parties and that appellants were entitled to protection with respect to a large amount of usurious interest allegedly mulcted from them by Brayton individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">In a long line of decisions <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this Court has considered the manifold phrases of the question of indispensable parties, and has established principles which apply to and furnish the yardstick by which the facts here should be measured. These may be epitomized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The question of jurisdiction arises at the threshold of the case and remains constantly before the court until final judgment. Choice of jurisdiction belongs primarily to the plaintiff and a court of equity will strain hard to sustain an invoked jurisdiction. Federal jurisdiction, being statutory and limited, must clearly appear and the plaintiff carries the burden of sustaining that jurisdiction. A precarious jurisdiction which limits the scope of decision on the merits will not be entertained. A suit upon a written contract will not be entertained in the absence of any party to it if the relief which may be granted will have a direct effect upon his interest therein; and relief will not be granted in his absence either by way of cancellation, reformation, specific performance or by enforcement in any manner, of a contract which is entire or indivisible; but the court will proceed to grant the litigant invoking its jurisdiction such relief as is separable, \u2014 as in the case of a claim to a fractional and divisible share \u2014and will not affect the rights of the absent party, provided the controversy will not be left in such a condition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>its final termination may be inconsistent with equity and good conscience. The question of indispensable parties will be decided upon fundamental equitable principles, but it embraces the question of jurisdiction when diversity is the sole basis of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">There is no prescribed formula for determining whether a party is indispensable, and the question must be determined by the facts of each individual case. One of the most cited cases on the subject is a decision rendered by the Supreme Court in 1854 in Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 129, 58 U.S. 129, 15 L.Ed. 158, and its facts bear a sufficient resemblance to those here to warrant quoting some of its language. Shields, a citizen of Mississippi, had bought a large plantation in Louisiana from Barrow, and had paid nearly half the purchase price when he defaulted on some payments due, and Barrow had sued him for and obtained foreclosure and money judgment. The proceedings were then compromised by Shields\u2019 execution of notes to Barrow with six endorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Barrow, a citizen of Louisiana, brought suit after default in payment of the new notes against two of the endorsers residing in Mississippi, but omitted four of the endorsers who were citizens of Louisiana. The two sued filed a crossbill against the other four endorsers, tendering payment of their proportionate parts. The trial court took jurisdiction of both the original action and the cross bill, rendering judgment on the merits. The Supreme Court reversed, in part because \u201cThe contract of compromise was one entire subject;\u201d [17 How. at page 138] and because the rights of those before the court were not \u201ccompletely separable from the rights of those absent * * * \u201d [17 How. at page 140]. The Supreme Court was further of the opinion that the absent endorsers had an interest in the proceedings which was \u201cof such a nature that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.\u201d 17 How. at page 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The application of the foregoing principles makes it clear that Clyde E. Bray-ton was an indispensable party to this action. The analysis of the contract sued on<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> demonstrates that the relief sought by the plaintiff was not divisible or separable from the rights belonging to Brayton under it; but that there was community of ownership and interest between him and the corporation in all of the contract provisions; and that the contract conferred upon appellants reciprocal rights which could not be enforced or protected in a suit Brayton caused to be brought by the corporation and from which he omitted himself.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">In essence, the contract sued on was the memorial of the compromise settlement of basic differences and disputes between Brayton and the corporation on the one side and appellants on the other. The three contracts giving rise to those disputes were either executed by Bray-ton alone, or by him as an officer of the corporation. He put up individually all of the money involved in all of the contracts, and he personally collected and receipted for all of the money deriving from them. In the compromise agreement, he acknowledged in effect his ownership of the rights accruing to the corporation from the old contracts by joining in a conveyance of those rights to appellants. The money theoretically advanced to the corporation under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>compromise was weighted with limitations as to what the corporation could do with it; it could be used only as directed by Brayton and for his benefit; and the security provided for was for his benefit and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Whether Brayton was using the corporation as a conduit through which his enterprises were carried out, or he was a partner or joint-venturer with the corporation in the business deals compromised in the compromise agreement, the result is the same. Moreover, one of the chief considerations moving the appellants to the execution of the compromise agreement was the release under its terms of all of Brayton\u2019s individual claims against them. By the expedient of omitting himself from the suit and directing its prosecution in the name of the corporation alone, he and his corporation created a situation under which the appellants would be forced to yield the last full measure of their obligations under the contract while being denied the chief protection which was reciprocally theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">I am unable to agree with the majority in its position that jurisdiction was conferred on the Court below either by the trial of pertinent issues between the parties \u201cby the implied consent,\u201d or because \u201cAbel did not avail himself of the right to file such a counterclaim [that is, against Brayton, individually] and cannot now complain.\u201d Of course jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, and the question of jurisdiction will be raised by the court of its own motion where the parties have not raised it.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The right of counterclaim exists only against the plaintiff who has brought the action, and Abel did not assert, and apparently did not have, any counterclaim against the corporation. What he asserted was a defense based upon want of consideration and upon usury. The pleadings and evidence do not reveal any counterclaim appellants had or desired to assert against Brayton individually. Even if they had attempted to file a counterclaim against him, the Court would not have permitted him to be brought in because the identity of citizenship between him and appellants would \u201cdeprive the court of jurisdiction of the action.\u201d Rule 13(h), F.R.C.P.; Reynolds v. Maples, 5 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 395, 399.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\"><em>A fortiorari, </em>where, as here, the absent party is not only subject to the jurisdiction and process of the court, but is the instigator of the action in the name of the party with respect to which he is indispensable, a court of equity will not proceed in his absence. Such a course of piecemeal enforcement of an entire contract would, under the authorities cited, be \u201cwholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">In my opinion, the judgment of the lower Court should be reversed and the action dismissed. Where the question involves so important a matter as jurisdiction, I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5a\">\u201cThe State of Texas,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\">County of Dallas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\">\u201cThis contract and agreement made and entered into this the 19th day of April, 1955, by and between Frank J.
