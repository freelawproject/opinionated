Moore, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, on November 13, 1956, in the proceeding for the reorganization of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, Debtor, denying the appellants\u2019 petitions for allowances out of the debtor\u2019s estate for expenses incurred and for legal services rendered by them as counsel for two members of the fifteen-member Board of Directors of the debtor, the two being called \u201cIndependent Directors.\u201d This Court has jurisdiction of this appeal by virtue of paragraph (12) of \u00a7 205, sub. c, Title 11 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The challenged order was based upon two grounds: (1) that the \u201cIndependent Directors,\u201d who were the appellants\u2019 clients, were not \u201cparties in interest\u201d within the meaning of paragraph (12) of \u00a7 205, sub. c, Title 11 U.S.C.A.; and (2) that the record in the reorganization proceeding discloses that they contributed nothing by way of benefit to a plan of reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The Interstate Commerce Commission, in conformity with paragraph (12) of \u00a7 205, sub. c, Title 11 U.S.C.A., after a hearing upon various applications for allowances for services and expenses in connection with the reorganization proceeding and the final plan of reorganization, made its report of July 31, 1956, fixing \u201cthe maximum allowances which may be allowed by the court * * as required by that paragraph. In the report, which was filed in the District Court on August 24, 1956, the Commission, after describing the expenses incurred by the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d for which they sought reimbursement, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">\u201cAt the hearing and on brief, debtors\u2019 trustee contended that the independent directors were without standing either to intervene or to appear in the proceeding in their capacity as directors of the debtor, and that to the extent that they have appeared they must bear the responsibility and expense of their activi- \u2022 ties. He referred to the per <em>curiam </em>opinion of the court of appeals of December 10, 1954, in Huston v. Thompson, 8 Cir., 217 F.2d 308, 309, where, in dismissing the motion of the independent directors for a further stay of the district court\u2019s order authorizing payment of interest and their appeal from that order, the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">\u201c \u2018The petitioners ai-e two of the fifteen members of the Board of Directors of the debtor railroad company. They have no authority to represent the debtor, its Board of Directors, or any defined or determinable group of creditors, stockholders, or others having a right to be heard in the reorganization proceedings in the District Court. That court has denied the petitioners leave to intervene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">\u201c \u2018We are convinced that the petitioners are without standing to ask for a stay of Order No. 4410 or to challenge its validity by appeal.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">\u201cOur report and order of February 12, 1951, fixed maximum limits of allowances for the independent directors and their counsel, and allowances in the maximum amounts fixed were approved by the district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">\u201cWe do not consider it necessary that we pass upon the issue now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>raised as to the legal right of the independent directors and their counsel to receive allowances from the debtors\u2019 estates. This is a matter which properly may be raised before the district court. In event the court agrees with the position of the trustee\u2019s counsel, no harm will have been done by our fixing maximum limits; on the other hand, if the court takes a contrary position, such action by us will avoid delay in final disposition of the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag7\">The maximum fee and expense allowances for the appellants as counsel for the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d were fixed by the Commission at $15,140.00 for Lucien Hilmer and at $8,406.35 for Frederick M. Myers, Jr. That clearly meant that if the Judge should determine that the appellants were eligible to receive allowances, he might, \u201cwithin such maximum limits,\u201d make them such allowances for services and expenses as he considered reasonable. Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Bankers Trust Co., 318 U.S. 163, 167, 63 S.Ct. 515, 87 L.Ed. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">This Court, as was pointed out in the report of the Commission, held in 1954 in the ease of Huston v. Thompson, 217 F.2d 308, that the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d were without standing to challenge an order for the payment of interest on the First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds of the Missouri Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In Missouri Pacific R. Co. <em>5%% </em>Secured Serial Bondholders\u2019 Committee v. Thompson, 8 Cir., 225 F.2d 761, 764, this Court in 1955 ruled, in effect, that the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d were not \u201cparties in interest,\u201d and dismissed their appeal from the order of the District Court approving the fourth Plan of Reorganization submitted to the court by the Interstate Commerce Commission. We said in that case, with reference to the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201cThe appeal in Number 15,336 was taken by Bolton Sullivan and Stewart Huston, so-called \u2018Independent Directors of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company.\u2019 They filed objections and claims for equitable treatment in the District Court and were permitted to participate in the hearing subject to the objection that they have no authority to represent the debtor, its Board of Directors, or any defined or determinable group of creditors, stockholders or others having a right to be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court sustained the objection to the participation of these appellants in the proceedings and cited our decision in Huston v. Thompson, 8 Cir., 217 F.2d 308. In that case we held that these appellants lacked power of representation exactly as stated <em>in </em>the objection. They have no authority to represent \u2018any party in interest\u2019 within the intendment of Section 77, sub. e [of the Bankruptcy Act; 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 205], or to represent \u2018any * * * interested party\u2019 within Section 77, sub. c (13). They are bound by the action of the Board of Directors of Missouri Pacific approving the plan. The court did not err in sustaining the objection against their participation and in refusing to consider their opposition to the plan. Although we heard oral argument for them and have studied their brief, we direct that their appeal be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">In 1956 in Missouri Pacific R. Co., 5J4% Secured Serial Bondholders\u2019 Committee v. Thompson, 8 Cir., 229 F.2d 898, this Court again held that the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d were not parties in interest who could appeal from the order confirming the plan of reorganization. In that case we said (at page 900 of 229 F.2d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\u201cIn No. 15,472 the Record shows that the appellants Bolton Sullivan and Stewart Huston, so-called \u2018Independent Directors of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company\u2019, were permitted to participate in the hearing on the approval of the Plan subject to the objection that \u2018they have no authority to represent the Debtor, its Board of Directors or any defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>or determinable group of creditors, stockholders or others having a right to be heard.\u2019 On the appeal in No. 15,336 we held, 225 F.2d 761, loc. cit. 764, that these appellants \u2018have no authority to represent \u201cany party in interest\u201d within the intendment of Section 77, sub. e, or to represent \u201cany * * * interested party\u201d within Section 77, sub. c (13)\u2019 and we directed \u2018that their appeal be dismissed.\u2019 On reconsidering the same matter here, we reach the same conclusion and direct that this appeal, No. 15,472, be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The appellants argue that what we have in the past held to be the status, or rather lack of status, of the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d does not preclude us from reversing the order of Judge Moore denying the appellants compensation for services rendered to the Interstate Commerce Commission and which they contend it has recognized as being compensable out of the debtor\u2019s estate. The difficulty we have with this argument is that paragraph (12) of \u00a7 205, sub. c, Title 11 U.S.C.A., provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201c(12) Within such maximum limits as are fixed by the Commission, the judge may make an allowance, to be paid out of the debtor's estate, for the actual and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees) incurred in connection with the proceedings and plan by parties in interest and by reorganization managers and committees or other representatives of creditors and stockholders, and within such limits may make an allowance to be paid out of the debtor\u2019s estate for the actual and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings and plan and reasonable compensation for services in connection therewith by trustees under indentures, depositaries and such assistants as the Commission with the approval of the judge may especially employ. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">This Court has, in effect, ruled that the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d were not \u201cparties in interest\u201d within the meaning of paragraph (12). Under that paragraph, a judge may make an allowance \u201cto be paid out of the debtor\u2019s estate\u201d for expenses incurred only by \u201cparties in interest\u201d or others specifically designated in paragraph (12). The question whether the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d were eligible for allowances either as \u201cparties in interest\u201d or as \u201crepresentatives of creditors and stockholders\u201d was, in our opinion, a question of law for the court, and not a question of fact or of administrative expertness for the Commission. Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Bankers Trust Co., supra, at page 170 of 318 U.S. at page 519 of 63 S. Ct. We are satisfied that under paragraph (12) and the decisions of this Court, Judge Moore was justified in deciding that the appellants were ineligible for allowances, despite the fact that the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d had obtained leave of the Commission to intervene before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In view of this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to consider whether and to what extent the services rendered by the appellants would have been compensable out of the debtor\u2019s estate had the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d been determined to be eligible for allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
