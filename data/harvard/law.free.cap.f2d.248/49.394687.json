Nor can we hearken to \u201cthe technical niceties and recondite distinctions of local law,\u201d Lambert v. Jefferson Lake Sulphur Co., supra [236 F.2d 547]. We look therefore to the language of the contracts, which is clear and unambiguous, to ascertain the intent of the parties who executed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">The Tax Court in its opinion quoted at length from the contract of August 29, 1947 between taxpayers and one Carruth, and we accept and copy in the margin extracts from it as typical of all of the contracts before us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>quoted language it is apparent that it would be difficult to draft an instrument more completely embodying the language of a typical lease. The parties named themselves \u201clessor\u201d and \u201clessee;\u201d they called the income \u201croyalty,\u201d using the word several times in the instrument; they provided for forfeiture if operations were suspended, and stated categorically that it was the intention of the parties that operations be commenced at the earliest practical time and carried on thereafter without undue interruption; and they stipulated that the lessors should derive income of a certain percentage of retail value of the sand and gravel removed during operations under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">It is clear, then, that the lessors retained an economic interest in the sand and gravel, conveyed to lessee only a royalty interest, derived income solely from exploitation, and called the cash payment \u201cadvanced royalty.\u201d It is manifest, therefore, under a long list of decisions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the amounts received by taxpayers from the extraction of sand and gravel from their lands were taxable as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">Taxpayers earnestly insist that this case is ruled by our recent decision in Crowell Land &amp; Mineral Corp. v. Commissioner, 1957, 242 F.2d 864, where we held that a gravel contract constituted a sale entitling the taxpayer to capital gains treatment. A reading of that case<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will demonstrate that its facts differ widely from those we are dealing with here and that the case is not authority at all for taxpayer\u2019s position in the case before us. We held there that, construing the instrument as a whole and considering it against the total background of transactions under it, the contract was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>one of sale. Applying the same tests, we hold that the contracts here are leases of the right to remove sand and gravel, yielding to the landowners nothing but royalty; and that the Tax Court correctly held the income from them liable for tax as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The quotation first appearing (supra fn 2) from the opinion of the Tax Court states that the taxpayer was entitled to use the economic interest retained in the minerals in place \u201cas the ground of a claim for depletion;\u201d and the Commissioner concedes that depletion allowance was proper if properly claimed. The taxpayers filed a motion to reopen the case so that the question of depletion could be developed and passed upon by the Court, but the Tax Court denied the motion without comment. It was based on assertions concerning lack of notice arising from change of attorneys by taxpayers. We think the application of its rules by the Tax Court was too technical and that it ought to have heard the question of depletion and to have determined the character and amount of depletion to which the taxpayers are entitled. For the purpose of such ascertainment and adjudication the judgment of the Tax Court is reversed and remanded; otherwise it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">. If our decision should be against the taxpayers we will be faced with the further question whether the Tax Court should not have permitted them to reopen the case so as to prove depletion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">. The petitioners are members of the Albritton family including two lawyers and a physician. The Tax Court determined income tax deficiencies against them for the calendar years 1948 and 1949 in the total sum of $5,053.97. In their income tax returns for these years taxpayers had returned their income from sand and gravel contracts as capital gain instead of ordinary income. The Commissioner determined in each instance that the income was ordinary income, and the petitions are for redetermination of the deficiencies resulting from the Commissioner\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The Tax Court upheld the position of the Commissioner and determined that the proceeds of the contracts were ordinary income, holding that the contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">\u201c * * * result[s] in ordinary income to the owner of the property and grant[s] a corresponding economic interest in the minerals in place which can be used as the ground of a claim for depletion * * * \u201d See Albritton v.
