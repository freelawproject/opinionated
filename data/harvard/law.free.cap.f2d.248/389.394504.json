B. Foster Company (\u201ctaxpayer\u201d) is a corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania. Its business is buying, selling, renting and dealing in rails and other railroad equipment, steel piling, pipe and allied materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-21\">In 1944, and prior thereto, all of taxpayer\u2019s capital stock was owned or controlled in equal shares by four brothers, L. B. Foster, Sydney A. Foster, Reuben A. Foster and Byron L. Foster.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-22\">In 1937 the four brothers entered into an agreement which provided that the taxpayer was to carry life insurance on their lives; the taxpayer was to pay the premiums and be the beneficiary under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the policies. Upon the death of any of the brothers his estate was obligated to sell, and the taxpayer was obligated to buy, his stock at a price determined by a formula which excluded the insurance proceeds as an asset of the taxpayer. The amount of the insurance, however, was to represent the minimum amount to be paid for the stock; it specifically provided that the insurance proceeds should not enter into the calculations of the price to be paid for the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Sydney A. Foster died on December 24, 1944. Upon his death the taxpayer received the proceeds of the insurance on his life, taken out pursuant to the agreement, in the amount of $344,422.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On audit of the estate tax return of Sydney A. Foster (November, 1946), the Commissioner of Internal Revenue proposed to include the life insurance proceeds received by the taxpayer in the gross estate of decedent and to collect an estate tax thereon. The Commissioner also proposed an increase in the value of decedent\u2019s stock in taxpayer by boosting the value of its good will, from the $125,000 provided by the formula contained in the above stockholders agreement, to approximately $235,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The executors of the estate of decedent immediately notified taxpayer of the Commissioner\u2019s position and advised it that under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in particular \u00a7 826(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a decision that the life insurance proceeds were a part of the gross taxable estate of decedent would give rise to a secondary liability of taxpayer for the amount of federal estate tax which would be attributable to such proceeds; further that the taxpayer was duty bound to aid the estate in sustaining the amount reported as the value of its stock as of the date of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">Because of the asserted contingent liability, taxpayer entered into an agreement with the executors of the estate to contest the Commissioner\u2019s proposed deficiency assessment in federal estate tax. Accordingly, its attorney, cooperating with the executors, filed a protest with the Commissioner and, after negotiations, reached an agreement by which the Commissioner withdrew his contention that the insurance proceeds were to be included in decedent\u2019s estate and taxpayer agreed to add such proceeds to its assets for purposes of evaluating decedent\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">As a result of that agreement, reached in compromise and settlement, the proposed deficiency in federal estate tax was reduced from approximately $93,000 to approximately $15,500. Earlier it was orally agreed between taxpayer and the executors of decedent\u2019s estate that if taxpayer was relieved of its contingent liability for such tax and the expense of contesting such liability, it would contribute toward the payment of any deficiency finally paid as the result of any settlement with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">The amount of taxpayer\u2019s contribution was later fixed at $12,758.80. Subsequently, pursuant to a petition filed by the executors of the estate with the Surrogate\u2019s Court of New York County, New York, which had probate jurisdiction of decedent\u2019s estate, praying an apportionment of the estate taxes, that Court entered a decree on January 4, 1949, directing that taxpayer pay $12,-758.80 to decedent\u2019s estate and the taxpayer complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">In its 1949 income tax return taxpayer claimed a deduction of the $12,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>758.80 payment as an \u201cordinary and necessary expense\u201d. The deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner and the resulting deficiency in income tax was paid by taxpayer. The Commissioner having taken no action upon the taxpayer\u2019s claim for refund, it sued to recover in the District Court. This appeal followed judgment in favor of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The sum of the taxpayer\u2019s position is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">It does not dispute that it expended the $12,758.80 in part payment of federal estate taxes in accordance with its agreement with the executors and in compliance with the Decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of New York County, but it asserts that the payment was made \u201cto buy itself off from the time, trouble and expense of protracted litigation\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and thus it came within the category of an \u201cordinary and necessary expense\u201d under the provisions of \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The Government\u2019s position may be stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">Section 23(c) (1) (D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> expressly provides that federal estate taxes are not deductible as an \u201cordinary and necessary expense\u201d; here the taxpayer paid a federal estate tax; the compromise payment which it made in return for relief from a contingent estate tax liability cannot be deducted where the contingent liability, had it been paid in full, would not have been a deductible expense ; irrespective of the foregoing, the payment was neither \u201cordinary\u201d nor \u201cnecessary\u201d to the conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s business, which was that of buying and selling rails, etc. and thus did not meet the \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d requirement for deductibility set up by \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">For the proposition that the deduction was an \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d business expense taxpayer relies on Drucker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 11 T.C.M. 680 (1952); Swaim v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1953, 20 T.C. 1022; Standard Galvanizing Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 7 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 736; C. Ludwig Baumann &amp; Co. v. Marcelle, 2 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d 459; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Pacific Mills, 1 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 177; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Macy, 2 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">The cases cited are inapposite. In each of them the taxpayer made expenditures in settlement of claims which, had they been paid in full, would have been deductible under the provisions of \u00a7 23. For example, in the Drucker and Pacific Mills cases, the taxpayer settled suits brought by the Government for overcharges in excess of ceiling prices fixed by the Office of Price Administration; in the Baumann case there was a compromise settlement by a lessee of an additional rent claim; in Standard Galvanizing legal fees were involved; in Macy, testamentary trustees made a compromise payment of a surcharge claim and in the Swaim case, taxpayer made a payment in compromise of a real estate commission claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Taxpayer\u2019s contention in the instant case is novel in its concept in that, conceding that it would not have been permitted a deduction had it been compelled to pay the estate tax in full by virtue of an asserted contingent liability under \u00a7 826(c), it nevertheless, was entitled to a deduction for a payment made in compromise. The taxpayer\u2019s contention in substance is that the part is greater than the whole, to wit, \u2014 had it paid the whole of the estate tax it would not have been permitted a deduction under the provisions of \u00a7 23(c) (1) (D), but a part of that whole, paid in compromise, is deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>It is obvious that we cannot subscribe to that ingenious proposition. Were we to do so we would enable the taxpayer to recoup in substantial measure the federal estate tax payment and thus defeat the specific legislative prohibition against deductibility of federal estate taxes. The taxpayer cannot accomplish by indirection that which it is directly prohibited from doing by legislative provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In the instant case, irrespective of its motivations in doing so, the taxpayer agreed with the executors of decedent\u2019s estate to make the $12,758.80 payment in settlement of a federal estate tax liability as to which it had been asserted there existed a contingent liability against it for the whole of the tax \u2014 \u25a0 approximately $93,000 \u2014 which had been asserted by the Commissioner. That it agreed to, and did pay, estate tax, is clearly established by the executor\u2019s petition to the Surrogate\u2019s Court of New York County, New York, and the latter\u2019s Decree. The petition recited taxpayer\u2019s agreement to contribute to the payment of estate taxes and the Decree ordered taxpayer \u201cto pay to the said Executors * * * [its] respective apportioned share of the <em>federal and state estate taxes </em>paid by the said Executors * * \" (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">It is immaterial whether there was any basis for the Commissioner\u2019s initial view that the insurance proceeds received by taxpayer were includible in the decedent\u2019s estate or whether there existed a contingent liability on taxpayer\u2019s part as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">It is settled that a payment in compromise of a suit to collect taxes will be treated as taxes even though the taxpayer is not liable. Dickinson v. United States, 2 Cir., 1933, 62 F.2d 1069. In Rippey v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1956, 25 T.C. 916, it was held that a payment of federal estate taxes in compromise is not deductible. After referring to \u00a7 23(c) (1) (D) and Regulations 111 \u00a7 29.33(c)-1-A, which provide in part: \u201cEstate, inheritance, legacy, succession, and gift taxes and Federal income taxes are not deductible from gross income\u201d, the Court stated, at page 919:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\"The statute and regulations are specific. They leave no room for construction. If the payment * * which petitioner took as a deduction was a payment of Federal estate taxes it cannot be used as a deduction from petitioner\u2019s gross income.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">To the same effect see Beck v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1950, 15 T.C. 642, affirmed 2 Cir., 1952, 194 F.2d 537, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 821, 73 5. Ct, 18, 97 L.Ed. 639.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>There remains only to be said that we are in complete accord with the principles stated in the cases cited and their holding that a payment in compromise of federal estate taxes is not deductible. That being so, it is unnecessary to discuss the Government\u2019s contention that the payment made by the taxpayer was neither \u201cordinary\u201d nor \u201cnecessary\u201d to the conduct of its business and thus did not meet the \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d requirement for deductibility provided by \u00a7 28(a) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-11\">. \u00a7 23(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (as amended by \u00a7 121(a), Revenue Code of 1942) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AomW\">\u201cDeductions from gross income.

In the Rippey case the taxpayer was the income beneficiary under two testamentary trusts created by the will of the deceased. The Commissioner determined a federal estate tax deficiency of $1,287,-973.00 against the estate. The executors thereupon notified the taxpayer that if the asserted deficiency was sustained, the payment would consume the assets of the estate to such an extent that one trust of which she was a beneficiary would be completely exhausted while the other such trust would be invaded and consumed to the extent of approximately $1,-052,973.75. A contest ensued and the Commissioner eventually agreed that the total deficiency could be compromised and settled upon payment of $28,000 plus interest thereon of $6,000. The executors advised taxpayer of this offer but indicated that they felt under an obligation to the other beneficiaries named in the will to contest even the proposed deficiency. Thereupon, taxpayer agreed with the executors that if they would pay the compromised assessment she would reimburse the estate for the amount expended. The sole question was whether the payment by taxpayer was deductible as an ordinary and necessary expense paid or incurred for the conservation or maintenance of property held for the production of income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b441-16\">. In the Beck case, pursuant to a compromise agreement made in a will contest, the trustee named in the will paid the federal estate taxes attributable to the share of the estate distributed to taxpayer and her co-heirs and was repaid for the amounts so expended by withholding designated sums from royalty pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ments payable to them. In computing her taxable income taxpayer sought to deduct the amounts so withheld as an ordinary and necessary expense for the production or collection of income under \u00a7 23(a) (2). The Tax Court disallowed the claimed deduction stating at page 664: \u201cSuch a deduction for Federal estate taxes has never been allowed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
