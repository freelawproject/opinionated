The complaint says such publication would defeat patent applications appellant plans to file in various foreign countries; that a \u201csecrecy order\u201d of the Commission formerly prohibited appellant from filing those applications; that if appellant had been able to file them within one year after he filed his patent application in. the United States, in most countries his filing would have been regarded as \u201crunning from the date of\u201d his United States application; and that the Commission has now rescinded the secrecy order and declassified the entire subject of the preparation of heavy water, including the plaintiff\u2019s patent application.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">The District Court denied an injunction on the ground that previous publications had made the plaintiff\u2019s claim moot. We do not reach the question of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-18\">Though the complaint says the defendants \u201care sued only in their individual capacities\u201d, it is plain that the injunction the appellant seeks would, if valid, restrain the United States Atomic Energy Commission from taking certain action. It is also plain that Congress authorized the Commission to take action of this general sort; i. e., to disseminate tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>nical information in the field of atomic energy. Congress did not leave the matter to implication. It expressly stated its intention to provide \u201ca program for the dissemination of unclassified scientific and technical information and for the control, dissemination, and declassification of Restricted Data, subject to appropriate safeguards, so as to encourage scientific and industrial progress. * * It shall be the policy of the Commission to control the dissemination and declassification of Restricted Data in such a manner as to assure the common defense and security. * * * The dissemination of scientific and technical information relating to atomic energy should be permitted and encouraged. * * * \u201d 42 U.S.C.A. (Supp. IV) \u00a7\u00a7 2013(b), 2161, 2161(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The legal theory asserted in appellant\u2019s complaint is that the \u201cDefendants having received confidential disclosure of the subject matter of the said application have no right to publish the same or any reports dealing with such confidentially disclosed subject matter\u201d; also, that \u201cdefendants having prevented the plaintiff from pursuing his right to apply for foreign patents * * * and having by said Classification and Secrecy Order prevented the plaintiff from even effectively negotiating for financing of such applications, are in equity and good conscience bound, on removing such classification and secrecy order, to make no publication even of information, if any, that they might otherwise have a right to publish, that would prevent the plaintiff from pursuing his remaining rights to seek foreign patents corresponding to said application, at least until the plaintiff has had a reasonable time in which to arrange for financing and pursuit of such rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The appellant has not \u201cset out in his complaint the statutory limitation\u201d, if any, which might indicate that if, as he claims, a publication would violate his rights, it would also exceed the Commission\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In effect the complaint comes only to this, that the Commission should be restrained because it is about to err, to the appellant\u2019s damage, in exercising its authority. Accordingly we cannot distinguish this case from the Larson case, in which the Supreme Court held that the courts lacked jurisdiction. As in Larson, the United States has not consented to be sued; and like Larson, this is not a case \u201cin which the statute or order conferring power upon the officer to take action in the sovereign\u2019s name is claimed to be unconstitutional.\u201d Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 690, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628. The complaint makes no such claim. Neither does appellant\u2019s \u201cStatement of questions presented\u201d, in his brief on this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">We think the District Court erred in rejecting the government\u2019s contention that the suit is against the United States. We therefore remand the case with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. State of Arizona ex rel. Arizona State Bd. of Public Welfare v. Hobby, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 170, 221 F.2d 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-10\">. He now makes, but the complaint does not, the paradoxical suggestion that the Commission is authorized to publish <em>only </em>classified or restricted information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\">. Ilis reply brief does seek to raise a constitutional question. It says: \u201cFor the Commission to effect dissemination of privately owned secret information without provision for compensation would be a wanton violation of plaintiff\u2019s rights under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. If the Atomic Energy Act purported to confer any such authority on the Commission, it would be unconstitutional.\u201d But if the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the complaint, arguments made hero cannot supply it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
