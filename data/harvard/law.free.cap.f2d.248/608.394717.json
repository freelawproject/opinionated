The alleged offenses involved two transactions. As to each transaction the indictment charged, in successive counts, (1) embezzlement, (2) larceny, (3) forgery of a check, and (4) uttering of a forged check. He was convicted on the first count and given a sentence of imprisonment, which was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-22\">Appellant urges error in the failure of the court to require the prosecution to elect as to counts, in the denial of motions for judgment of acquittal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, in the return by the jury of an inconsistent and antagonistic verdict, and in the court\u2019s action in receiving a verdict of guilty on one count and directing a verdict of not guilty on another count. We have carefully considered the contentions, pressed upon us vigorously by counsel, but we find no error affecting substantial rights of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-24\">.
