The jury returned a verdict for the defendant and the plaintiff appeals alleging error in the trial of the case. We do not find any error. Complaint is made that the judge should not have charged the jury concerning contributory negligence. But contributory negligence was alleged in defendant\u2019s answer. There was testimony in the plaintiff\u2019s case as to the manner in which the injury took place. It was sufficient to raise a question whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. We find no error in submitting the question to the jury. Cf. Dunn v. Calpin, Pa.C.P. 1941, 51 Dauph.Co. 192, 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-22\">The other alleged errors have been considered but do not need to be set forth. The case was fairly tried and the jury\u2019s verdict and the judgment thereon must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-23\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
