See decision of this Court in Williams v. United States, 9 Cir., 215 F.2d 800. On certiorari to the Supreme Court, that Court vacated the judgment of this Court and in a brief order (350 U.S. 857, 76 S.Ct. 100, 100 L.Ed. 761) remanded the case \u201cfor consideration\u201d in the light of the controlling California doctrine of respondeat superior. Upon this remand the case was further \u201cconsidered\u201d by the District Court <em>on the original trial record </em>upon which that court based its first decision reported in 105 F.Supp. 208. The District Court rendered a second opinion and decision which is reported in 141 F.Supp. 851. The present appeal is from the judgment entered on this second decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">The Basic Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b541-21\">From the record certain .facts appear to be clearly established. Appellant, an employee of a private construction firm on the Island of Guam, sustained personal injuries when a parked car in which she was sitting was struck by a military vehicle driven by Corporal Seabourn. The accident occurred near a \u201cbreakwater\u201d parking spot in Agana, Guam at or about 10:30 p. m. on March 3, 1949. Seabourn had obtained an official pass to leave the Guam army base where he was stationed, this pass covering (so far as all of the evidence reveals) the entire day and night of March 3, 1949. During the afternoon of that day and while authorized to be away from his army post, Seabourn in the company of two other soldiers (Schmidt and Vincent) engaged in drinking intoxicating beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The three men returned to their army-base \u201cunit\u201d about 7 p. m. on that day and while there, Sergeant Stiles, a member of Seabourn\u2019s company, handed Seabourn a so-called \u201ctrip ticket\u201d for a ton vehicle known as a \u201cweapons carrier.\u201d This ticket had been made out about 8 a. m. of that morning to a driver named Cabera, a soldier who also worked with Seabourn. The \u201cticket\u201d indicates that on the day in question the vehicle had been requested by a Lt. W. R. Werb, and the <em>use </em>of the vehicle was therein authorized for \u201cOfficial Business.\u201d Listed on the ticket are the various points to which the weapons carrier was driven that day. Neither Seabourn\u2019s nor Stiles\u2019 name appears on the ticket, nor was Seabourn\u2019s <em>use </em>of the vehicle in any way indicated thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In the army company \u201cunit\u201d or \u201csection\u201d in which Seabourn was serving, a loose practice had prevailed for several months under which servicemen in this unit were able to secure possession of army vehicles to drive for their own pleasure, this being accomplished by these men by informally \u201cpassing around\u201d among themselves \u201ctrip tickets\u201d which might have been issued to another driver for official army use, in this case the vehicle involved having been assigned to a man named Cabera for the use of Lieutenant Werb on the day of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Having secured the vehicle that evening by such informal means, Seabourn (in company with Schmidt and Vincent) drove the army vehicle to the Enlisted Men\u2019s Club on the Island where they drank beer and champagne after which they decided to \u201cgo for a ride.\u201d Thereafter, and prior to the accident here involved, and at a rather late hour, Seabourn let his companions out of the army vehicle and \u201ctook off\u201d alone. It was during this night drive that the accident occurred at a time when, according to Seabourn\u2019s sworn statement, he was driving the vehicle \u201conly for recreation.\u201d His two companions made official statements under oath for official army records, these statements setting forth many of the above mentioned facts. In the course of this litigation, the recitals in these records, and their later depositions, contained the averment that at the time Seabourn left them to make his night drive he was \u201cdefinitely drunk\u201d and \u201cvery drunk.\u201d Seabourn swore that he remembered nothing that occurred after he left Schmidt and Vincent except that the next morning he awoke alongside the road when the sun was shining.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">None of these three men claimed that they were required to execute military orders of any kind, or to perform military duties of any kind while away from their post on March 3, 1949, nor do they attempt to claim that army regulations then in force sanctioned the informal use of army vehicles for the purpose, and under the conditions of use shown by Seabourn\u2019s activities on that day and night.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Furthermore, there is absolutely nothing in the record to show that Seabourn\u2019s superior military officers had personal knowledge of, or control or supervision over, the use of the vehicle while it was in Seabourn\u2019s possession on all of the day and night of March 3, 1949, nor any control over Seabourn\u2019s activities after he got the trip ticket from Stiles on that evening and thus used the Cabera ticket which had been issued that morning for the use of Lt. Werb. Nor had any military order been issued by a superior officer directing, authorizing or permitting Seabourn to drive or use the vehicle during that day or night <em>for any purpose, </em>military or otherwise (including \u201crecreation\u201d), or for the discharge of any kind of a military order or duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Based upon the general facts we outline above, appellant\u2019s complaint against the United States under the Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 et seq., asserted, inter alia, that Seabourn\u2019s negligent operation of the vehicle during his night drive <em>was in the line of his duty for the Government. </em>The Government\u2019s answer, inter alia, denied this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Preliminarily, it should be made plain that, relying on application of. the doctrine of respondeat superior as ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>plied in California (from which Guam law on the subject derives), appellant has at all time strenuously contended (as her basic premise), that \u201cSeabourn was <em>not acting outside </em>the scope of his employment\u201d when he crashed his army vehicle into the parked car in which appellant was sitting; that at the time of the crash \u201cthe soldier was acting within the course and scope of (his) employment <em>by seeking entertainment that night\u201d; </em>that \u201centertainment\u201d (including driving merely for pleasure) on Guam is essential to a soldier\u2019s morale; that morale \u201cis necessary to the maintenance of efficiency in the armed forces there,\u201d hence Seabourn\u2019s night drive came within the scope of an \u201cofficial duty\u201d to himself and the army.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Before reaching appellant\u2019s theory of government liability as amplified in her briefs, we emphasize that nothing presented in the record suggests or supports a conclusion of fact or law that on his night drive Seabourn was then in any way <em>combining </em>this venture with any sort of \u201cofficial business\u201d of the army, <em>unless </em>the circumstances (a so-called \u201ccommon practice\u201d in his army <em>company </em>unit) under which he secured the use of the army vehicle for recreation can be said to make this night drive an activity which (as a matter of law) must be held to represent a <em>combining </em>of his drive for personal recreation with the discharge of some \u201cofficial business\u201d for the army. As we have noted above, Seabourn frankly avowed under oath that he was then \u201cdriving for recreation\u201d; nowhere in either his affidavit or deposition does he (or any other witness in the case) assert that a superior officer had directed (or given permission to) Seabourn to use the army vehicle for <em>any purpose </em>on March 3, 1949, or that he drove it that night <em>to execute any military orders </em>in connection with his army duties. In this very material and highly significant respect the facts of this case abruptly part company with the facts of our later noted Murphey case [Murphey v. U. S.], 9 Cir., 179 F.2d 743, where the driver of the army vehicle was acting <em>under specific direction of a superior officer when he made his night drive. </em>Yet appellant strenuously argues that <em>this case is on all fours with the facts of the Murphey case; </em>that its facts make it fit the facts of the Murphey case \u201cto a T.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We outlined above the basic facts of this case in order to relate them to the specific arguments here advanced by appellant in her briefs since they serve to clearly delineate the legal basis of her claim of government liability under the Tort Claims Act, that is to say, a claim resting squarely on the \u201crecreation-morale\u201d theory as buttressed by the claimed \u201cpractice\u201d and/or \u201cpolicy\u201d in vogue in Seabourn\u2019s company unit. These arguments are set out in considerable detail just below.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Appellant\u2019s Position</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Appellant urges that: Vehicles were necessary for recreational purposes on Guam due to \u201cdistances\u201d on the Island; all officers and enlisted men in Seabourn\u2019s unit followed the practice of circulating trip tickets; this unit practice had prevailed for at least fifteen months prior to the accident; this unit practice was a long-established \u201carmy custom\u201d and a standard operating procedure; Seabourn was \u201cengaged <em>in a series of authorized acts, </em>namely, driving the vehicle for recreation <em>to and from </em>recreational facilities provided by the Government <em>at the time of the accident?\u2019; </em>\u201cunder the peculiar circumstances of Seabourn\u2019s overseas service, his night drive was \u201cfor a governmental purpose\u201d to wit, \u201cthe improvement of (his) morale\u201d; the \u201cimprovement of morale,\u201d as such, is announced in Murphey v. United States, supra, 179 F.2d 743 <em>which was approved by the Supreme Court; </em>Seabourn <em>was authorized to use the vehicle for recreation because of the \u201ccustom, practice and standard operating procedure\u201d in vogue in Seabourn\u2019s unit; </em>under the \u201cpractice\u201d of Seabourn\u2019s unit, the same trip ticket \u201cwould be passed around from new driver to new driver\u201d; Seabourn\u2019s <em>use </em>of the vehicle <em>was authorized specifically </em>because he secured the trip ticket <em>\u201cwhile </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>[he was] <em>the official motor pool army dispatcher\u201d; </em>\u201ceven assuming that this army custom and practice might have <em>technically violated some general Army Regulations </em>still in the eyes of the law <em>such hypertechnicality should not and does not affect the rights of an injured third person\u201d; </em>therefore \u201cthe question of technical violation of Army Regulations is more or less moot,\u201d even if (as appellant says she argued before the Supreme Court) \u201cthe vehicle was not operated according to the strict terms of (the then) Army Regulations 700-105,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> still the Government would be liable <em>because </em>of the injured third person\u201d; \u201cthe violation of an <em>unenforced and ignored </em>[in his unit) Army Regulation could not be relied upon by the government to avoid liability, for to do so would permit the government to immunize itself <em>by the unfair device of enacting regulations bounding the scope of employment of its servants </em>while at the same time <em>in practice and in fact authorizing Us servants to perform the proscribed acts\u201d; </em>the (above mentioned) <em>practice \u201cwas itself evidence of authority, of permission, and of the \u2018scope\u2019 of employment for soldiers stationed on Guam at the time of the accident\u201d; </em>that being (so) <em>authorized, </em>\u201cSeabourn\u2019s authorized use of the army vehicle for recreation was within the scope of his employment. It does not matter that that use was negligent nor that the use gave him personal enjoyment. Under the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, a governmental purpose was being served which fixes liability upon the <em>government\u201d </em>\u2014 this <em>under the rule of respondeat superior; </em>what Seaboum did by his night drive was in keeping with the realities of morale maintenance since this drive was for \u201crecreational purposes\u201d; that \u201cconcepts change and it is no longer true, as appellee contends, that the employee at the time of the accident in order to impose liability must be engaged in \u2018work\u2019 or in performance of \u2018duties\u2019. * * * <em>It does not matter that Seaboum was not performing his duty as supply clerk or performing any other so-called \u2018official duties\u2019 \u201d; </em>that \u201cthis is not a case where a soldier is on a \u2018stateside pass\u2019 seeking \u2018stateside\u2019 pleasure.\u201d \u2014 \u201cthis is a case like Murphey v. U. S.\u201d; \u2014 it is a case <em>\u201cwhere the servant is combining his own business with that of his master, or attending to both at substantially the same time,\u201d </em>(thus coming within the California rule of Ryan v. Farrell, 1929, 208 Cal. 200, 280 P. 945); that under the facts of the instant case, Seabourn\u2019s \u201cscope of employment is <em>broadened </em>to include recreational activities, including driving for recreation\u201d (under <em>the \u201cspecific authorization\u201d </em>above noted); thus \u201cthe doing of <em>an authorized act </em>in a wrongful or prohibited manner will not preclude responsibility of the employer * * * the test is not whether the wrongful act itself was authorized but whether it was committed in the course of a series of acts of the agent which were authorized by the principal and while the agent <em>was still occupying himself </em>with the principal\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>business <em>within the scope of his added employment,\u201d </em>(citing Deevy v. Tassi, 1942, 21 Cal.2d 109, 125, 130 P.2d 389).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Appellant adds the contention that since Seabourn had been \u201cauthorized\u201d to use the vehicle for the purpose of recreation, there is no distinction between entertainment and recreation (or \u201cmovies\u201d as in our Murphey case, supra). She also tenders the contention that <em>\u201cthe issue is clearly presented by the evidence whether Seabourn had departed from and resumed his employment </em>* * * if the Murphey case driver [who drove on instructions from a superior officer] was not on such a departure or frolic as would preclude liability, then neither was Corporal Seabourn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In short, the argument is that Seabourn was indulging in \u201crecreation\u201d by his drive and this fact made his driving activity \u201cgovernment business\u201d (or at least an activity which <em>combined </em>recreation with government business) \u201cwithin the scope of his employment.\u201d And it is finally argued that the Supreme Court \u201cheld\u201d in the instant case \u201cthat the issue of scope of employment is governed by the California rule of respondeat superior, <em>not </em>federal law, decisions <em>or [army] regulations, whether they were enforced or not.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">Since appellant argues that the Supreme Court actually \u201cheld\u201d in the instant case that <em>Army </em>Regulations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then in force have no application whatever to the peculiar facts and circumstances revealed by the record in this case (a contention that finds no support in the text of its brief order of remand) it is crystal clear that she thinks that this Court is <em>required </em>to wholly disregard the existence of such regulations in disposing of this case. (See footnote 3, infra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">We think that what is set out just above fairly summarizes appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">So far as we are aware, no federal court has ever held that the Army is not free to adopt and enforce reasonable regulations to govern the use of its vehicles <em>by </em>servicemen and officers, <em>or </em>that such regulations can, or must be, wholly disregarded by a court when a use of army vehicles by servicemen, not in compliance with, but in violation of, army regulations, has been accomplished in the irregular manner revealed by the record in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>does not challenge the validity,of these regulations, she apparently construes them as a set of rules drafted with a calculated purpose and design to defeat certain types of tort claims by injured third persons. This seems evident by the arguments in her brief. She urges that \u201cthe rights of injured third persons are to be governed by the principles of respondeat superior, not by the skill of some legal draftsman in the Pentagon, who might, by legal fiction and blind to actualities, so draft or construe' administrative regulations as to defeat tort claims by injured third persons. Where authority to do an act is, in fact, granted, <em>this Court has held in the Murphey case, </em>and the Supreme Court has gone along with the California doctrine that the government thereby becomes liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Appellant relies heavily on what she now declares to be a precise <em>holding </em>of this Court in its Murphey decision. She asserts (p. 7 reply brief) that \u201cthis very Court [there] <em>held\u201d </em>that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\"><em>\u201cwhere permission has been granted as a general custom </em>to use an army vehicle for recreation, such <em>practice </em>fixes liability upon the government and renders groundless the trial court\u2019s findings that the soldier was not acting within the scope of his employment, <em>even though in a particular case there is positive testimony of prohibitive orders.\u201d </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis is ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">An examination of the language of our'Murphey decision reveals the absence of any such explicit <em>holding </em>therein. We therefore assume that appellant is presently endeavoring to read into this decision a non-existent judicial pronouncement of this Court on the issues in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">In summary, appellant\u2019s own arguments outlined, above, together with facts firmly established by the record, serve to clearly establish to our entire satisfaction the following highly material facts. They are: (1) Seabourn was away from his post on a pass covering all of March 3, 1949, and it is not contended that on this day and at the time of the'accident he was executing any order of, or acting under permission of, a superior officer on his drive when the car crash occurred; (2) a <em>claim </em>by appellant that at the time of the crash Seabourn was indulging in \u201cofficially authorized\u201d recreation; that even though he was not <em>then </em>performing any duty assigned to him by a superior officer, or driving with the permission of such an officer, or driving the vehicle under conditions specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>cally sanctioned by army regulations, nevertheless Seabourn must be held to have then been engaged in performing \u201cgovernment business,\u201d or (under the California rule of respondeat superior) at least <em>combining </em>his then private pursuit of recreation with the business of the master; (3) a <em>claim </em>of appellant that Seabourn\u2019s night ride must be held to have been an \u201cofficially authorized\u201d activity <em>because </em>of the loose \u201cpractice and/or policy\u201d in his \u201ccompany unit\u201d under which he managed to \u201ccheck out\u201d the vehicle \u201cwhile the official motor pool army dispatcher\u201d; (4) the claim of appellant that the loose \u201cpractice\u201d in Seabourn\u2019s unit of \u201cpassing trip tickets around from driver to driver\u201d became translated into an \u201cofficially sanctioned use\u201d <em>because </em>the late drive (even though Seabourn was very drunk and certainly in no condition to execute any sort of order) was, in any event, a legitimate and officially sanctioned means of sustaining his \u201cmorale,\u201d thus making it come within the line of his duty to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The Record of Depositions and Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">On March 7, 1949, the soldier Seabourn executed and signed an affidavit before a person qualified to take acknowledgments, and this document became and remained a part of the official army record which was before this Court and the lower court. It is Seabourn\u2019s own recital of facts made shortly after the accident. Later, and in San Francisco, California, Seabourn made and signed a deposition which was also part of the record before this and the lower court. We have carefully read both of these Seabourn documents and also the sworn statements and/or depositions of his fellow soldiers Schmidt and Vincent who were with Seabourn during a part of the day and the earlier part of the evening of March 3, 1949. As stated by Schmidt, Seabourn\u2019s soldier friend, \u201cThat\u2019s about all we did, drinking and running around.\u201d And this statement about sums up what these three young men did after Seabourn secured the army vehicle and up to the time when Seabourn, then very drunk, \u201ctook off\u201d alone for his night drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">It would unduly burden this opinion to quote at length from these several documents; it is sufficient to say that the averments therein do not part company in any here material way with the basic facts established in the record before us. Upon these facts appellant seeks to impose vicarious liability on the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The Government\u2019s Position</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Appellee says that the question before us is whether the trial court, in light of the applicable California rule of respondeat superior, correctly held that the Federal Government was not liable for injuries caused by a serviceman who, while off duty and on a pass, obtained unauthorized use of a military vehicle and went joy riding in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The Government rejects as unsound appellant\u2019s argument that pertinent army regulations are in no way applicable to Seabourn\u2019s entertainment activities at the time of the accident. It asserts generally that \u201crecreation\u201d of the peculiar character here shown can hardly be termed an aid to the maintenance or improvement of the efficiency of troops; that even if it be assumed that in Seabourn\u2019s particular unit it had become a practice for military vehicles to be \u201cpassed on\u201d from one serviceman to another and surreptitiously used (despite the official nature of a trip ticket) for off-post individual recreation, that sort of casual practice (in plain contravention of applicable Army Regulations) cannot transform Seabourn\u2019s drunken frolic <em>into a recreational activity within the scope of his employment, </em>since such a frolic obviously served no governmental purpose or interest and cannot be viewed as coming within the employee\u2019s \u201cscope of employment\u201d under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The government also argues that since pertinent Army Regulations <em>forbade </em>any \u201cpractice\u201d by servicemen of passing army vehicles around and using them as Seabourn did here, his night drive was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>clearly unauthorized and was not made for the benefit of the service. In short, an irregular custom or practice in his unit of violating army regulations for personal ends would not justify a holding by this Court that he was acting within the scope of his employment when he injured appellee, this for the reason, and upon the <em>assumption </em>that Seabourn\u2019s peculiar night drive would <em>improve and not impair </em>his efficiency and would increase his work output, with a resulting <em>benefit </em>to his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The Government emphasizes that in arguments to support her case, appellant has (1) consistently <em>assumed </em>that the record requires a finding of a custom or practice in Seabourn\u2019s unit which legally justified servicemen\u2019s use of military vehicles issued to others for official use, this for their individual recreational purposes, and (2) she urges that this practice is <em>enough </em>(despite Army Regulations) to <em>demonstrate </em>that Seabourn was acting within the scope of his employment. It was pointed out by the Government that both the lower court and this Court <em>found </em>that no responsible army official had authorized Seabourn\u2019s use of the vehicle. In other words, the Government says that appellant would have us bridge an impassable chasm with an <em>assumption </em>of fact and law not justified by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The Government further contends (and we agree) that the record fully discloses and establishes that on his night drive Seabourn was away from his post on a pass and then free from any disclosed military duty, and that no superior army officer countenanced, or even knew about, Seabourn\u2019s night use of the vehicle, or had any sort of control over this use.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In light of the fact situation we have discussed, the problem to be resolved is the application of the California doctrine of respondeat superior so far as several pertinent decisions reveal it.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In considering these decisions we have noted the application of this orthodox doctrine in federal cases and in state court decisions in situations where the courts did not part company with the basic principles announced in the California cases. Both parties have cited and relied upon such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">We think that there has been no basic change in the California law of \u201cscope of employment\u201d since the date of our earlier opinion in this case (215 F.2d 800). In considering the opinions ci-ted by the parties we do not lose sight of the fact that the armed services (like private employers) are concerned with the morale of, and recreation for, servicemen. A sound recreational program (envisioned in the army regulations) improves employees\u2019 morale and efficiency, enables them to maintain work at a higher level, and thus indirectly benefits the employer\u2019s business. And it may be conceded that on an isolated island like Guam there may. be even greater need for employer-organized and employer-supervised recreational activities than in the continental United States. Even so, such army \u201crecreational activities\u201d come within the sweep of army regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Our Murphey decision (179 F.2d 743) heavily relied on by appellant, holds nothing more, in substance, than that the driver of an army truck, <em>acting pursuant to specific official orders </em>in carrying (transporting) in an army vehicle an organized group of soldiers into town <em>for a specified recreational activity, </em>is within the scope of his employment even though the accident happened about two or three blocks <em>off his prescribed route. </em>In that case we were also dealing with an isolated army post.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">One need not examine a multitude of cases to justify application of the basic and universally accepted rule in our jurisprudence that a pre-condition for application of the respondeat superior doctrine is that the employer becomes vicariously liable <em>only </em>when the servant, at the time of the accident, is \u201cconducting the master\u2019s affairs,\u201d United States v. Eleazer, 4 Cir., 177 F.2d 914, 916. Or as Judge Cardozo expressed it in Fiocco v. Carver, 234 N.Y. 219, 223, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>137 N.E. 309, 311, \u201cthe dominant purpose must be proved to be the performance of the master\u2019s business.\u201d In no material respect does California jurisprudence part company with, or fail to recognize, that the touchstone for respondeat superior liability is the furtherance of the master\u2019s business at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">It is crystal clear that in this case Seabourn was \u201coff duty\u201d on all of March 3, 1949 on a pass, and was not executing any order of his superior officers at the time of the accident. To surmount the difficulty created by this fact situation, appellant has adopted a theory under which she claims that his \u201coff duty\u201d night drive must (as a matter of law) be regarded by us as within his line of duty <em>because </em>it was an \u201cauthorized recreational activity\u201d of a character which <em>automatically </em>brought it within the scope of his military employment. This so-called \u201cauthorization\u201d is claimed to arise from the \u201ccommon practice\u201d (or \u201cpolicy\u201d) in vogue in bis army unit which made it possible for servicemen in that unit to secure and use army \u2022vehicles <em>for their own amusement. </em>At no point in arguing her theory does appellant attempt to justify Seabourn\u2019s use of the vehicle by reference to, or reliance upon, the then applicable Army Regulations we have cited.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under her theory, they must go out of the case because they have no application to the peculiar facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In attempting to tie the facts of this case to the facts we detailed in our first Williams opinion, appellant has obviously overlooked the exact language we used in that first opinion. On page 9 of her reply brief she argues that in this earlier opinion <em>we said \u201cthat Seabourn was actually indulging in an authorized and permissible form of \u2018recreation\u2019 at the time he crashed his Army vehicle into appellant\u2019s car.\u201d </em>(Emphasis is ours.) This quotation is inaccurate and misleading. In that part of the opinion (215 F.2d 800) from which this purported quotation was lifted, we were then discussing <em>appellant\u2019s theory </em>of Government liability. In a specific reference to <em>her theory </em>of the case we said (at page 808):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201cIn stating her position on the issues, appellant asserts that since (under Army Regulations) a soldier may indulge in \u2018recreation,\u2019 his \u2018off duty\u2019 recreational activities are properly to be regarded as within the scope of his \u2018military duty.\u2019 The assumption necessarily underlying this contention is that Seabourn <em>was actually indulging in an authorized and permissible form of \u2018recreation\u2019 </em>at the time he crashed his army vehicle into appellant\u2019s car. Upon no other basis can her position be sustained * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">To this comment we added the further comment that \u201cupon no other basis can her position be sustained unless we close our eyes and agree that a loose post \u2018practice\u2019 of \u2018passing around\u2019 trip tickets issued only for <em>official use, </em>(when the actual use is not for official business) in some undisclosed way transformed the use by Seabourn into an authorized \u2018official use.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis ours.) And we also emphasized <em>at that point </em>that enlisted men\u2019s use of the vehicles \u201cfor joy riding and drinking bouts, all without the knowledge or approval of their superior officers, finds no sanction in applicable Army Regulations, but to the contrary, is a clear violation of these rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">In short, this Court did not say what appellant now says was stated in our first Williams opinion upon which she relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Appellant failed to cite three pertinent California cases which were discussed at some length in the lower court\u2019s second opinion (141 F.Supp. 851) and here relied upon by appellee. In Kish v. California State Automobile Ass\u2019n, 190 Cal. 246, 248, 212 P. 27, the California Supreme Court refused to impose a respondeat superior liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>where the employee at the time of the accident was not in performance of any act connected with the business of his employer <em>but had finished his work for the day and was \u201coff duty\u201d and on his way down town for supper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">In Lee v. Nathan, 67 Cal.App. 111, 226 P. 970, the California court held that there could be no respondeat superior liability <em>where the employee was driving the employer\u2019s vehicle after duty hours </em>while pursuing his own ends <em>despite the fact that the injuries to the plaintiff could not have been committed without the facilities so afforded to the employee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">And in Slater v. Friedman, 62 Cal.App. 668, 672, 217 P. 795, 796, the court reiterated the rule that where the servant\u2019s <em>\u201cact is done while the servant is at liberty from service and pursuing his own ends exclusively, </em>there can be no question of the master\u2019s freedom from all responsibility, even though the injury complained of could not have been committed <em>without the facilities afforded to the servant by his relation to his master.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in this reference to the three California cases is ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">And see comments of the court in such California cases as Stephenson v. Southern Pacific Co., 93 Cal. 558, 29 P. 234, 15 L.R.A. 475; Brown v. Chevrolet Motor Co., 39 Cal.App. 738, 179 P. 697; Duff v. Schaefer Ambulance Service, 132 Cal.App.2d 655, 283 P.2d 91; Gousse v. Lowe, 41 Cal.App. 715, 183 P. 295. These cases discuss issues pertinent to the issues presented in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Only a short time ago, this Court in Pacific Freight Lines v. United States, 239 F.2d 191 emphasized that California law does not impose a respondeat superior liability unless at the time of the accident the employee of the Government was actively engaged in furthering his employer\u2019s business rather than his own personal ends. This was a Federal Tort Claims Act suit arising out of an accident involving a military vehicle being driven by a serviceman who had previously been <em>directed </em>to drive the car by a superior officer. In that ease the principal question was whether, at the time of the accident, the serviceman was acting within the scope of his employment under California law. See page 193 of opinion. In the opinion in Pacific Freight we cited the case of Loper v. Morrison, 1944, 23 Cal.2d 600, 605, 606, 145 P.2d 1, 3-4. There, and in an \u201cin bank\u201d hearing, the California Supreme Court carefully pointed out the relevant circumstances and factors to be considered and weighed in relation to one another in appraising \u201cscope of employment\u201d cases in California. One of these \u201cfactors\u201d was \u201cthe incidental acts that the employer should reasonably have expected would be done.\u201d Our decision in the Pacific Freight case exonerated the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">In light of the fact that Seabourn secured possession and use of the army vehicle in violation of applicable army regulations dealing with use of vehicles for recreational purposes, can it be said that (under California law) the superior officers of his army unit should \u201creasonably have expected\u201d him to wilfully violate these army rules in the manner he did, thereafter get \u201cvery drunk\u201d and' go on a wild night drive merely to entertain himself? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Appellant urges that <em>the important, fact </em>which distinguishes our Pacific. Freight ease, supra, and the California, cases cited by appellee is that in the-case at bar, as in the Murphey and (later noted) Boynton cases, \u201cthe employee-was <em>authorized </em>for the benefit of the-employer to engage in recreational activities. Deviations in route, as in the-Pacific Freight case, are not important. <em>Here the scope of employment by virtue-of the authorization to use the vehicle-for recreation, becomes broadened so as-to include acts done pursuant to such authorization.\u201d </em>Thus appellant asserts; that there was a \u201cbroadened authorization\u201d for Seabourn\u2019s use of the vehicle-for his night ride recreation. But the-truth is that no such \u201cbroadened authorization\u201d can be found in any language in the Army Regulations; im fact, appellant is compelled, not only to-completely repudiate these regulations,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>but also to justify a loose practice of flouting them in order to sustain this particular claim. This theory of a \u201cbroadened authorization\u201d is novel. It seems to rest upon the assumption that, under and by virtue of the \u201cpractice\u201d employed in Seabourn\u2019s unit, these \u201ctrip tickets\u201d must be regarded by us as something akin to negotiable warehouse receipts or certificates, the free and unlimited use of which was legally justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The short of it is that the alchemy of legal argument cannot transmute a clear violation of applicable and controlling \u25a0regulations by servicemen into a principle of law which we must arbitrarily and artificially apply to create government liability. For us to pursue such a course would amount to a holding that the Army had no legal right to define, by suitable regulations, the proper use of its vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel calls upon us to consider the injury of one who was wholly innocent of wrongdoing. Seabourn\u2019s vicious conduct is so serious a crime under California law (Calif.Penal Code, Section 367(e)) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the offense could be punished by fine, and by imprisonment in the state penitentiary up to five years. However appealing, it is beyond our power to substitute sympathy for a proper application of the rule of respondeat superior under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We made reference above to the California Boynton case [Boynton v. McKales] (reported in 139 Cal.App.2d 777, 294 P.2d 733) which is here strongly relied on as authority sustaining appellant\u2019s theory of tort liability. The facts of that case are detailed by the court and in the margin we note these facts and pertinent holdings of the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>In its decision in the Loper case, supra, 23 Cal.2d at page 606, 145 P.2d at page 4, the court said: - \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case we cannot hold as a matter of law that Morrison\u2019s [the employee] trip to the tavern and to Dolan\u2019s home constituted an abandonment of his employer\u2019s business. * * * <em>it was within Morrison\u2019s authority to collect accounts </em>[after his regular hours of work] <em>at the time the accident occurred. </em>The employer\u2019s liability was not necessarily terminated by reason of the fact that Morrison <em>combined </em>a private purpose of his own with the business of his employer [citing Ryan v. Farrell, supra]. \u2018It is the established rule in this jurisdiction that where the servant is <em>combining </em>his own business with that of the master, <em>or attending to both at substantially the same time, </em>no nice inquiry will be made as to <em>which business </em>the servant was actually engaged in when a third person was injured; but the master will be held responsible, unless it clearly appears that the servant could not have been directly or indirectly serving his master.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In considering the California rule announced in the Loper case, and under the peculiar circumstances of this case, we again run afoul of the official army regulations which are binding on <em>all </em>army personnel when using army vehicles for recreational purposes. No order came to Seabourn authorizing him to use the vehicle <em>for any purpose. </em>His use was surreptitious and a clean-cut violation of the regulations, and for us to insist that such illegal use was \u201creasonably to be expected\u201d (or was deliberately sanctioned) by army officials would not be justified. Oddly enough, the <em>practice </em>(under army regulations) of permitting certain designated <em>forms of recreation </em>for army personnel is advanced by appellant to bolster her claim (under a California case) that in any event Seabourn was somehow <em>combining </em>his night drive with official army business at the time of the accident, this without any evidence of such \u201carmy business\u201d and in the face of his sworn statement that he was then driving <em>only </em>\u201cfor recreation.\u201d This Court is not unmindful of the injury inflicted on appellant but under the evidence we cannot regard Seabourn\u2019s wild night drive as anything other than a senseless and irrational act wholly unconnected with, and not serving or benefiting any business of his employer. For us to reach any other conclusion would do violence to clearly established facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Our decision in United States v. Johnson, 9 Cir., 181 F.2d 577, 581, is cited and relied upon by appellant. In appraising the facts we sustained a <em>finding </em>of the lower court that Moore, the (Navy) driver of a vehicle (also on Guam) was acting within the scope of his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ment when the injury to Johnson occurred. Moore was attached to a navy service depot and had duties to perform at the Dispensary. On the day of the accident he had been <em>required </em>to execute a duty (in and as a part of his course of employment) <em>to deliver his report </em>to the Dispensary. An agreed \u201cstatement\u201d in evidence indicated that Moore went on a number of other \u201cerrands\u201d <em>before </em>he got around to taking his report to the Dispensary. Moore finally started to drive toward the Dispensary; for some undisclosed reason, the car started to \u201cshimmy\u201d and the car turned over injuring Johnson who asserted that the facts brought the case within the rule of res ipsa loquitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In seeking to apply in the Johnson \u25a0case what we regarded as California doctrine to the facts, we cited Waack v. Maxwell Hardware Co., 210 Cal. 636, 292 P. 966, where the court held that the question was whether at the time and place of the accident the driver <em>had resumed his employment </em>in his master\u2019s business <em>after </em>one or more deviations for purposes not related to his master\u2019s business. The lower court had held that <em>whether there had been such a resumption of the master\u2019s business was a question of fact for the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In our Johnson opinion we also made reference to the above cited California case of Ryan v. Farrell. We there said: \u201cThe fragmentary record here contains no direct evidence as to the circumstances under which the motor vehicle was entrusted to Moore, <em>or </em>the use he was permitted to make of it. But since it appears that the vehicle belonged to the government, and that Moore was in the government\u2019s employ, the inference is permissible that <em>Moore was authorized to drive the vehicle in performing his duty of delivering his report.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) But we added that under the rule of the Waack\u2019s case, supra, the trial judge was justified in <em>finding </em>that Moore had <em>resumed his employment </em>at the time the accident occurred, and was <em>then </em>acting within the scope of his employment, which on this occasion was the delivery of a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">As we later note, the trial judge in the instant case made findings repudiating appellant\u2019s theory of \u201cscope of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Another case relied on by appellant is Carr v. Wm. C. Crowell Co., 1946, 28 Cal.2d 652, 171 P.2d 5, 6. The recital of facts therein reveals that Enloe, one of Crowell\u2019s employees, engaged in a wordy exchange with Carr, an employee of a sub-contractor on the building then being constructed by Crowell. Enloe threw a hammer at Carr, seriously injuring him. Carr brought action against Enloe and Crowell for damages. The trial court directed a (jury) verdict for Crowell but sustained a verdict entered against Enloe.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The holding of the California Supreme Court (reversing the judgment in favor of Crowell) was concisely stated as follows: \u201cIt is settled that an employer is liable for wilful and malicious torts of his employee committed in the scope of his employment.\u201d In reversing the directed verdict in favor of Crowell, the Court said: .\u201cIt is sufficient, however, if the injury resulted from <em>a dispute arising out of the employment. </em>Under the provisions of section 2338 of the Civil Code a principal is liable for \u2018wrongful acts\u2019 of his agent committed \u2018in and as a part of\u2019 the principal\u2019s business. \u2018It is not necessary that <em>the assault </em>should have been made \u201cas a means, or for the purpose of performing the work he (the employee) was employed to do.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">As bearing on the issue arising out of the particular fact situation in the Carr case, the court there cited a California case holding that a grocery store manager was acting within the scope of his employment when <em>he quarreled </em>with a customer over an order and injured the customer after an exchange of opprobrious names.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Another California case [Hiroshima v. Pacific G. &amp; E. Co., 18 Cal.App.2d 24, 63 P.2d 340] was there cited wherein the court held that an employee whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>duties were to collect power bills, was acting in the scope of his employment when he struck a customer <em>in the course of a dispute </em>as to whether the customer had received a notice that his electric service would be discontinued if he did not pay his bill. The holding was there based on the ground that every man who prefers to manage his affairs through others, remains bound to so manage them that third persons are not injured by any breach of legal duty on the part of such others while acting in the scope of their (employees) duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The court commented that the evidence in the Carr case indicates without conflict that the injury to Carr was an outgrowth of Enloe\u2019s employment- \u2014 -that <em>the altercation </em>arose <em>solely over the performance of Enloe\u2019s duties, </em>and his entire association with Carr arose out of his employment by Crowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As applied to the situation in the Seabourn case, we face the fact that at the time he injured appellant, he was not engaged in an altercation with appellant, nor was he engaged in performing any duty or duties directly or indirectly associated with normal and regular army activities. As a matter of fact, the very purpose and function of his \u201cpass\u201d was to completely free him from the necessity of performing any regular and/or routine army duties (work for his employer) during the entire time covered by the pass permitting him to remain away from his army post.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">After argument, counsel for appellant called our attention to Rayonier Incorporated v. United States, 352 U.S. 315, 77 S.Ct. 374, 1 L.Ed.2d 354, and Indian Towing Company v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 76 S.Ct. 122, 100 L.Ed. 48. We cannot agree that the holdings in these cases require us to reach conclusions different from those expressed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">We find no rational basis for disagreeing with the conclusions twice expressed in the opinions and decisions of the able and experienced trial judge in the instant case. In his decision now on appeal, he properly found as facts that \u201cthe evidence shows that Seabourn was on a frolic of his own, free to find entertainment wherever his own proclivities and desires might lead him\u201d \u2014 and further, \u201cSeabourn was neither \u2018directly or indirectly serving his master\u2019 within the scope of his employment, because he was serving only his <em>own personal desires </em>not at all connected with any recreational activities authorized by his employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">In our view these findings of fact represent the only logical conclusions that could possibly be drawn from all of the pertinent facts in evidence. In no respect are they erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Since we are in full agreement with the lower court\u2019s disposition of the issues in this case, its judgment here on appeal must be, and is, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-4\">. \u201cB.

Enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act represented a statutory relinquishment of sovereign immunity from suit for torts of the Government\u2019s servants and employees. But we find nothing in that Act which requires us to completely ignore and/or literally abrogate, as utterly meaningless, a pertinent code of Army Regulations which were designed to administratively regulate intramural operations involving and relating to the use of army vehicles by members of the armed forces. It cannot be said that these earlier adopted regulations represent a studied, unreasonable and captious purpose to nullify subsequent suits based on the Tort Claims Act or to deny justice to a plaintiff in peculiar factual situations such as those disclosed by the record before us. For us to adopt appellant\u2019s theory would be tantamount to a declaration that the army must stand helpless in the face of open violations of its regulations relating to the use by its members of vehicles employed for only <em>specifically designated </em>forms of recreation. In practical effect this would be an unwarranted intrusion by the courts into a legitimate field of army discipline. Certainly nothing in the facts of this case could possibly warrant or justify such judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">While it may be conceded that his pass for that day and night might have been cancelled at any time during this period of time had military authorities required his services, the record reveals that this was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">The arguments of appellant invite a word concerning the here present sovereign-soldier relationship and the right of the sovereign to define the boundaries of <em>that relationship. </em>Certain it is that such a relationship is <em>not </em>governed by state law \u2014 even under the Erie-Tompkins doctrine. A judgment of this Court was affirmed in United States v. Standard Oil Co., 332 U.S. 301, at pages 305, 306, 309, 310, 67 S.Ct. 1604, at page 1607, 91 L.Ed. 2067, and in its decision the Supreme Court significantly stated that <em>\u201cperhaps no relation between the Government and a citizen is more distinctively federal in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>\u25a0cha/racter than that between it and members of its armed, forces. </em>To whatever extent state law may apply to govern the relations between soldiers or others in the armed forces <em>and persons outside them </em>* * * the scope, nature, legal incidents and consequences of <em>the relation </em>between persons in service and the Government <em>are fundamentally derived from federal sources and governed by federal authority.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">So far as we are aware, the Supreme Court has never seen fit to recede from the \u201crelationship\u201d doctrine above noted. Therefore this Court cannot agree that it is free to wholly disregard, or nullify, regulations lawfully promulgated by the army for the purpose of governing the administration of its purely internal operations (such as control of the use of army vehicles by servicemen and officers). And see footnote 3, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">. We assume that in referring (in this purported quotation) to \u201cprohibitive orders,\u201d appellant is calling attention to the pertinent Army Regulations cited in the Government\u2019s brief which sets forth the then applicable Army Regulations. From this citation we conclude that the date of promulgation and/or adoption of these regulations was June 30, 1948. The claim in the instant case arises from an accident occurring in March of 1949. We cannot conclude that these earlier adopted regulations represent a studied purpose of the army to <em>defeat </em>later tort claims based on a set of facts here confronting us. We must and do assume that these administrative regulations have the force and effect of law; at no point is it argued that they are out of harmony with any statutory provision or provisions. See Standard Oil Company of California v. Johnson, 316 U.S. 481, 483, 484, 62 S.Ct. 1168, 1170, 86 L.Ed. 1611, where the Court held that army regulations \u201chave the force of law\u201d (citing apposite eases in footnote 5 of that opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\">.

The California court pointed out (139 Cal.App.2d at page 790, 294 P.2d at page 741) that (as to conflicting inferences to be drawn from the evidence) \u201cthe only decisive question [for the jury] is therefore whether the character of the banquet and the employer\u2019s relation to it were such that Brooks\u2019 attendance could be reasonably considered within the scope of his employment.\u201d The court added that while there was testimony that there was no \u201ccompulsion to attend\u201d the banquet, there was a permissible inference from the evidence that \u201cit was an official company function with close relation to its sales program and intended to benefit the company by increase in the continuity of employment, * * * the attendance at which was at least expected from the employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">In applying the rule of respondeat superior the court noted McKales\u2019 argument that no recovery could be had <em>because </em>the dinner was only \u201ca social affair\u201d which Brooks attended for his own pleasure without direct or indirect compulsion from his employer; that for this reason the evidence was insufficient to bring the case within the exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d known as the \u201cspecial errand rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">As to the so-called \u201cspecial errand rule,\u201d the court said that <em>\u201cif </em>the employee is not simply on his way from his home to his normal place of work or returning from said place to his home for his own purpose, <em>but is coming from his home or returning to it on a special errand either as part of Ms regular duties or at a specific order or request of Ms employer, </em>the employee is considered to be in the scope of his employment from the time that he starts on the errand until he has returned or until he deviates therefrom for personal reasons, (Citing cases) <em>To sueh special missions the general test as to scope of employment applies. </em>It is not necessary that the servant is directly engaged in the duties which he was employed to perform, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>included are also <em>missions which incidentally or indirectly contribute to the service, incidentally or indirectly benefit the employer.\u201d </em>Citing among other cases, Kish v. California State Auto Ass\u2019n, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The court also said: \u201cThe attendance at a social function, although not forming part of the normal duties of the employee, may come under the \u2018special errand rule\u2019 <em>if </em>the function or the attendance was connected with the employment and for a material part intended to benefit the employer who requested or expected the employee to attend.\u201d And further: <em>\u2018\u2018If the employee is within the scope of his employment </em>when he inflicts injuries, the fact that the automobile which caused the injury belonged to the employee will not relieve the employer from liability <em>if </em>the employee\u2019s use of his car was with the express or implied consent of the employer.\u201d Citing cases including the case of Kyan v. Farrell, supra. (Emphasis supplied.) ,</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Again we come face to face with the question whether Seabourn was on any sort of \u201cmission\u201d <em>for </em>his employer when he injured appellant, and whether his wild drive \u201cincidentally or indirectly\u201d benefited his employer. To agree with appellant\u2019s theory would compel us to hold that (under California law) Seabourn\u2019s drunk drive for his own recreation somehow and in some wholly undisclosed manner conferred some direct or indirect benefit on the United States, a conclusion repudiated by the dear facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">. That Seabourn was away from Ms army post on a pass and free of any military duty at the time he injured appellant, is not disputed. His' then <em>relationship </em>to the Government while on this pass or ofE-duty status \u201cwas not analogous to that of a soldier injured while performing duties under orders.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 146, 71 S.Ct. 153, 159, 95 L.Ed. 152. And the Court there added that \u201cwithout exception, the <em>relationship </em>of military personnel to the Government has been governed exclusively by federal law.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">A soldier who is off duty or on a pass is not engaged in the business of the United States. While on pass or leave, one in military service \u201cis at liberty to go where he will during the permitted absence, to employ his time as he pleases, and to surrender Ms leave if be chooses. If he reports himself at the expiration of his leave, it is all that can be asked of him.\u201d United States v. Williamson, 23 Wall. 411, 415, 90 U.S. 411, 415, 23 L.Ed. 89. (We assume that at any time during leave on a pass, a member of the army could be recalled for miltary duty.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">And see Hunt v. United States, 38 Ct.Cl. 704, 710, and Foster v. United States, 43 Ct.Cl. 170, 175, where the purport of the court\u2019s holdings was that a \u201cleave\u201d from service duties is for the sole accommodation of the recipient of the leave privilege; that when a soldier receives a furlough he is for the time being his own master and the master of his time, <em>and is free to go where he pleases, and do what he pleases, owing no military duty to the Government.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
