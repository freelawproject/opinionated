And in reliance on \u00a7 903(b) (1), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 623(b) (1), Hard, the petitioner, asserts he is entitled to a trial by jury on issues involving civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">By his various points urged in this review, Hard would constrict the Board\u2019s power, to suspend his airline transport rating, to only the case where it found him unqualified or lacking ability to fly aircraft. The Board, on the other hand, reading and synthesizing \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 609 envisages a broad grant of power encompassing deterrent action when \u201cthe interest of the public\u201d safety \u201cso requires.\u201d In other words this administrative agency charged with \u201cassuring the highest degree of safety\u201d in air transportation contends that \u00a7 609 supplies authority for making an example of Hard in order to deter him and other airline pilots from jeopardizing the safety of travelers by air. \u201cPenalty,\u201d as a symbol repeatedly used by this petitioner is singularly ineffective for gauging the scope of power granted the Board by Congress. Power, and jurisdiction flow from the total piece of legislation, under examination, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>that reason the answer eludes capture with the single word \u201cpena\u2019ty.\u201d Legislative history and experience under the Act combine in firmly suggesting an interpretation at odds with the limited view put forward by this petitioner. At any rate the conclusion petitioner suggests \u2014 that the Board mandated a \u201cpenalty\u201d is unpersuasive rather than a logically compelling linguistic technique. We think the Board\u2019s order is consonant with the Congressional grant of power and consistent with achieving the statutory aim spelled out as the \u201chighest degree of safety.\u201d Whether the Board\u2019s order has salutary effect is beside the mark for all the agency can do is strive for protection of the public traveling by aircraft. But the problem engendered by this appeal is, of course, not solved in isolation. For, as we show below, Hard participated in a serious episode appraised by the examiner as \u201cmarginal\u201d with regard to fault and responsibility. What Hard contends for would drive the Board into an area of sharp black and white, leaving the gray zone unprotected when, in the exercise of its discretion, a qualified airline pilot\u2019s behavior merits suspension rather than revocation of rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">After a non-fatal accident on February 17, 1956, at Owensboro, Kentucky, involving an Eastern Air Lines aircraft Hard was piloting, his airline transport pilot rating (ATR) was suspended, on an emergency basis, for sixty days. During that suspension period the Administrator of Aeronautics filed a complaint with the Civil Aeronautics Board seeking suspension or revocation of the ATR held by this petitioner. An examiner for CAB found that the 60 day suspension was in the public interest but that there was no violation of Civil Aeronautics Regulations. CAB, on review, ordered petitioner\u2019s airline transport pilot rating suspended for six months. The impact of the Board\u2019s order, stayed during this court\u2019s review, precludes petitioner from serving as an airline captain during the suspension period established by the Board, though he may act as a co-pilot by virtue of other unrevoked licenses currently held by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Lying behind the Board\u2019s ultimate action in ordering Hard\u2019s suspension for four months (crediting him with two months period under their emergency order) is this pilot\u2019s approach to the Owensboro Airport for landing under instrument conditions due to rain in the area. After breaking through the overcast north of the field, petitioner determined to land on Runway 5 which runs to the northeast, a course of action which required that the aircraft be maneuvered to a point southwest of the field so that the aircraft could be landed in a northeasterly direction. Hard, piloting the aircraft during this approach, proceeded southwest to a point found by the Board to be approximately one-half mile to the left of the southwest end of Runway 5. He then began a descending and banking U turn to the left to enter the runway. The left bank steepened sharply on the approach; power was applied and the aircraft rolled to the right; and the right wing struck the ground at a point 330 feet short of the runway and 125 feet to its right. The aircraft was demolished, but none of the twenty-three persons on board sustained any serious injury. At the proceedings it was the Administrator\u2019s contention, and the Board so found in effect, that Hard had not allowed sufficient lateral suspension between the end of the runway and the point at which the turn began to permit a normal turn into the runway; that he persisted in attempting to land when it became apparent that a landing could be accomplished only through acrobatic maneuvers. There was no finding by the Board that Hard lacked flying ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Relying on \u00a7 609, the Administrator filed a complaint with CAB, on March 16, 1956, requesting revocation or suspension of petitioner\u2019s certificate based on alleged lack of qualification. CAB, through its Bureau of Safety Investigation (Reorg.Plan. No. IV, \u00a7 7, 52 Stat. 1012, 1940 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 581, 582), held public hearings on March 22, 1956 and took testimony of witnesses, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>this petitioner. Petitioner responded to the Administrator\u2019s complaint with an answer and motion to dismiss; the hearing examiner overruled the motion. Subsequently a trial on the merits was held by the Board\u2019s examiner and he found, in substance, that though the emergency suspension was in the public interest there had been no violation of any rule, regulation or statute \u2014 or, succinctly put: Hard had not been shown to be unqualified to fly and that disciplinary action was uncalled for in the circumstances. The examiner\u2019s decision was appealed, June 1, 1956, by the Administrator to the Board. After the examiner\u2019s decision, but before the Board\u2019s final suspension order, its accident investigation report was issued, containing <em>inter alia </em>this statement: \u201cThe Board is of the opinion that these factors [outlined in the report] indicate poor planning and execution of the approach by Captain Hard.\u201d Several months later, the Board wrote its decision and stated among other aspects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-4\">\u201cWe agree with the Administrator that disciplinary action is called for in this case, and that the Board could not, by failure to impose a sanction, tacitly condone a course of action, which, even if no accident had resulted, would have brought an aircraft to within inches of disaster. On the other hand, we question whether respondent\u2019s conduct on this flight was so egregious as to require revocation in the public interest, when we consider his eleven year record as a captain for Eastern and over 8,000 hours of flying experience without a previous incident of this type, or any disciplinary action for violations of safety rules. This does not mean that a single violation by an experienced pilot cannot ever call for revocation of his rating, for in flagrant cases the Board has ordered revocation. But on the facts here involved, we believe that the carelessness shown is not so egregious as to point to the ultimate sanction of revocation. In our judgment, the accident itself, together with a substantial suspension of his airline transport rating, would provide a sufficient deterrent against respondent or other pilots taking similar risks with their passengers\u2019 lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">\u201cAccordingly, we find a six month suspension should be imposed upon respondent, * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">From its factual premises, that administrative logic is understandable and, again we comment on the absence of a contest over the fact findings concerning the accident. To be sure the suspension of Hard, a qualified airman, at first appears as an arbitrary or unauthorized action but we think there is ample statutory foundation supporting the power asserted by the Board. Nothing-we have found in the Act manifests a. legislative purpose to hobble this agency-in its exercise of discretion. Policy-formulation is a legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Wilson v. Civil Aeronautics Board, D.C.Cir., 1957, 244 F.2d 773, 774,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> currently pending on petition for certiorari is closely analogous to Hard\u2019s case and apparently the District of Columbia Court of Appeals was impressed', by the Board\u2019s history that: \u201cFrom the effective date of the Act of 1938. through June 30, 1956, the Board has. suspended approximately 4000 airmen for violation of rules, without findings, that they lacked competence or qualifications and without requiring re-examination before reinstatement.\u201d By a marginal note in its brief filed in our court the Board has supplied us with similar information. While, of course, a persistent course of error could not override judicial judgment, courts do and have consistently placed authoritative weight on interpretative rules and practices consistently followed over long periods by administrative agencies. United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp; Elevator Co., 1932, 287 U.S. 77, 53 S.Ct. 42, 77 L.Ed. 175;. Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, 1933, 288 U.S. 294, 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796. Without relying on the Wilson case we would leave the order brought before us for scrutiny undisturbed because in our opinion the Board acted within permissible limits of administrative interpretation circumscribed by the power and authority granted in \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We find nothing in the record showing any steps taken by petitioner for deferment of the accident report at the Board level, despite his obvious awareness of the investigation. Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute, 1948, 333 U.S. 683, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1010, adequately offsets petitioner\u2019s claim of pre-judgment by the Board. See Davis, Administrative Law, Chapter 9 (1951). Indeed, the absence of revocation manifests treatment of pilot Hard inconsistent with that argument his counsel now presses on us.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We affirm the Board\u2019s order presented for review by the petition filed in our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-27\">. 52 Stat. 973, 980, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">.
