Company, Northern Insurance Company, Commercial Insurance Company, Merchants &amp; Manufacturers Ins. Co., and Firemans\u2019 Fund Insurance Company were sued when they refused payment on plaintiffs\u2019 proofs of loss. Wittenberg\u2019s action, below, is grounded on the policies in groups B-l, C-l and D-l under which she claimed $34,952.61 fire damages to her building. By its separate suit, Town sought recovery for $59,316.64 damages, to the contents, under all the policies in groups B-2, C-2, and D-2. These two law suits were consolidated in the district court. By their answer certain insurance carriers denied that the policies in group B-l were in force and effect on the date when the loss occurred, asserting that these policies were cancelled prior to the date of loss; and further, resisted full liability on the policies grouped as C-l. The answer filed by the companies in Wittenberg\u2019s suit follows the same pattern, e. g. allegations that the B-2 group of policies were cancelled and that the C-2 group was subject to limitations on the amounts of recovery. No cause of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tion was brought on the A-l, A-2 groups of policies but they come into play as part of the factual background.</p>\n<p id=\"ALC1\">Even before September, 1954 these plaintiffs transacted their insurance business with Louis Deitelbaum, who obtained the coverage of $25,000, effective September 20, 1954 [represented by the \u201cA\u201d group of policies] and delivered them to the plaintiffs. Subsequently Deitelbaum wrote plaintiffs a letter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dated March 5, 1955, requesting return of all \u201cA\u201d policies for re-rating and in \u2022compliance plaintiffs gave them to the broker\u2019s brother for delivery to Deitelbaum, who in turn Handed the policies \u2022over to Engelhard &amp; Company. Seeking an additional $50,000 coverage on their .insurable interests plaintiffs instructed Deitelbaum accordingly, and he telephoned Walter Fitzpatrick, an underwriter employed by Engelhard &amp; Company, on March 15,1955 concerning more insurance on the building and contents. By his letter of March 21, 1955, Deitelbaum informed Town Showcase &amp; Cabinet Company, Inc. as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWg\">\u201cAs per our recent conversation, enclosed find three policies which correspond to the bill which you have .already received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cAlso, please accept this letter as \u2022confirmation that an additional $25,-\u2022000 Fire Insurance is being issued on the contents in the rear building and an additional $25,000 Fire Insurance is being issued on the rear building itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cAlso, please be advised that the garage building is covered with $1,-000 Fire Insurance on binder and contents are covered on binder for $2500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201cYou may recall at our last meeting that we discussed the problem of whether Town Office Equipment Company was a separate and distinct company or merely a trade name used as a convenience in dealing with the public. You were going to contact Kal Schein and advise accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">Deitelbaum\u2019s telephone request of Fitzpatrick produced $35,000 coverage through the Group B policies, effective March 14,1955. These policies (B) were received by Deitelbaum on March 17, 1955, and afterward, in the words of Deitelbaum\u2019s affidavit:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-19\">\u201c * * * I received a call from Engelhard &amp; Co. [March 30, 1955] asking me [Deitelbaum] to return said Policies and I delivered them back to them; that I never received any written notice of the cancellation of said Policies, nor was any written notice mailed to Town Showcase &amp; Cabinet Co. or Doris Wittenberg. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-20\">\u201cThat I did not notify either Doris Wittenberg or Town Showcase &amp; Cabinet Co. that I had returned the Policies to Engelhard &amp; Co. until the Monday after the fire loss *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-21\">At this point it is undisputed that the \u201cA\u201d policies moved from Engelhard &amp; Co. to Deitelbaum to plaintiffs and from them to the broker back to Engelhard, while the \u201cB\u201d policies went from Engelhard to Deitelbaum and back without ever physically reaching plaintiffs\u2019 hands. In any event it appears that, having asked Deitelbaum for $50,000 additional coverage and since the \u201cB\u201d policies represented only $35,000, Deitelbaum placed $15,000 coverage with the Allied Agency, Inc. These policies effective March 24, 1955 are grouped as \u201cD\u201d, and their validity is undisputed in these ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>tions; the sole question touching- the \u201cD\u201d policies concerns the amount of recovery or contribution of each carrier. At this juncture Exhibit 6, Deitelbaum\u2019s affidavit, supplies some further- factual background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201cLouis Deitelbaum, being first duly sworn, on oath deposes and says that on or about March 14, 1955 I was instructed to obtain an additional amount of insurance on the rear building at 6453 North Ridge Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, in the sum of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) and Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) worth of additional insurance on the Contents in said building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cThat <em>I </em>immediately placed an order for said insurance, which was then covered by a binder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cThat on or about the 19th day of March, 1955 I advised the assured that Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,-000.00) worth of additional insurance, as hereinabove stated, was being issued, and also stated at that time that I had been advised by the Agency that the rate would be higher than on the previous policies issued, and that I suggested to them that they make whatever improvements possible to keep the rate as low as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201cThat subsequently, on the 21st day of March, 1955, I addressed a letter to the insured, advising them that said Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) worth of additional insurance was being issued, and that thereafter I received the following Policies from Engelhard &amp; Co.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cIn the name of Doris Wittenberg: Building</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiC\">Policy No. 128189 Aetna $5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeym\">Policy No. 279 Bankers &amp; Shippers 2,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asj\">Policy No. 62710 Glens Falls 5.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_t\">Policy No. 281554 North River 5.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGm\">\u201cIn the name of Town Showcase &amp; Cabinet Co.: Contents</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">Policy No. 128190 Aetna $5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUC\">Policy No. 135701 Equitable 5.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARS\">Policy No. 281555 North River 5.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH2\">Policy No. 853017 Northern 2,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-18\">\u201cSaid Policies were dated March 14, 1955 and were five-year Policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-19\">\u201cThat on or about the 25th day of March, 1955, I received a call from Engelhard &amp; Co. asking me to return said Policies. I still had the Policies in my possession. That subsequently on, to-wit, the 31st day of March, 1955 I returned said Policies to them; that at no time did I advise, in any manner whatsoever, the insured that said Policies had been cancelled; that I had no contact with the insured, except to call and advise them that I was sending my brother Ben to pick up insurance policies that had previously been issued Sept. 1954 in order that the Agency might put a new rate on said Policies, and that they would rewrite some of the Policies on the front building in order to get a lower rate; that I did not notify the insured, Doris Wittenberg, or Town Showcase &amp; Cabinet Company that the policies hereinabove listed had been cancelled or that I had returned them to Engelhard &amp; Co. until the Monday after the fire loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-21\">On the morning (April 9, 1955) after their losses plaintiffs asked Deitelbaum for their \u201cA\u201d policies and were informed' by him that he had the policies in his office and would deliver them the following day. This stimulated the disclosure-by Deitelbaum to plaintiffs on April 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>1955 that the \u201cB\u201d policies had been handed over to Engelhard. Apparently at that same time Deitelbaum delivered the \u201cC\u201d group of policies to the plaintiffs telling them that the \u201cC\u201d policies gave \u2022effect to the re-rating on the contents and obtained from Engelhard, as supplemental insurance. Deitelbaum also delivered binders amounting to $15,000, already referred to as the \u201cD\u201d group. There is evidence indicating a conference or conferences between Deitelbaum and Fitzpatrick which apparently precipitated the shifting of policies. But we refrain from commenting on the patent conflict of evidence in the DeitelbaumFitzpatrick testimony since the case is remanded. Both sides moved for summary judgment and various affidavits were submitted. When the case was called for trial, but before the jury was impanelled, Walter Fitzpatrick and one Milton Paula an insurance consultant \u2022employed by the Cook County Inspection Bureau, testified, and after hearing their evidence the trial judge allowed defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s suits on the \"\u201cB\u201d policies and permitting but limiting recovery on the \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d groups as shown in the tabulation at the beginning of this opinion. After studying this record and counsels\u2019 briefs, it is clear that the correctness of allowing summary judgment is the critical question. We think the trial court erred by so disposing of the case under Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. It is our view of the evidence concerning substitution or cancellation of the relevant policies, that there was presented factual questions for a jury. Homan Mfg. Co. v. Long, 7 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 645, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The judgment appealed is reversed and the cause remanded to the District \u2022Court with directions to deny defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">.
