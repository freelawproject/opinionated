HILL, Appellant, v. UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b683-6\">No. 13441.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b683-7\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b683-8\">July 31, 1957.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b683-9\">Before Bazelon, Danaher and Burger, Circuit Judges, in Chambers.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b683-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Upon consideration of appellant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal without prepayment of Clerk\u2019s fee and by typewritten brief, and of appellee\u2019s opposition thereto, it is</p>\n<p id=\"ABh\">Ordered by the Court that the aforesaid motion be, and it is hereby, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b683-12\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AYy\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">The issue before the court is whether the appeal sought by appellant in this case is \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915; Farley v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529; Johnson v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593. There is no claim here that the appeal is \u201cmalicious.\u201d The meaning of the word \u201cfrivolous\u201d has crystallized in Supreme Court cases involving admission to bail pending appeal pursuant to Rule 46(a) (2), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as in that Court\u2019s recent decisions on petitions for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. See Farley v. United States, supra; Johnson v. United States, supra. I do not think that the issues raised here by counsel appointed by us to represent appellant, even on the abbreviated transcript available to appointed counsel, may justifiably be characterized as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d And even under the more rigorous and out-moded \u201csubstantial question\u201d test, this appeal cannot be regarded as insubstantial. Cf. Herzog v. United States, 1955, 75 S.Ct. 349, 351.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would grant leave to appeal in forma pauperis and direct that the stenographic transcript of the trial be provided at the expense of the United States.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-14\"> See Ward v. United States, 1956, 76 S.Ct. 1063, 1005, 1 L.Ed.2d 25, 27, where Mr. Justice Frankfurter, sitting as Circuit Justice stated that bail should be allowed pending appeal unless the appeal is \u201cso baseless as to deserve to be condemned as \u2018frivolous\u2019 or is sought as a device for mere delay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-27\">. Mr. Justice Douglas, sitting as Circuit Justice, noted that there is a \u201csubstantial question\u201d when \u201cthere is a school of thought, a philosophical view, a technical argument, an analogy, an appeal to precedent or to reason commanding respect that might possibly prevail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
