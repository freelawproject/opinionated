On September 27, 1957, an order was entered by this court requiring the appellant to show cause on or before October 9, 1957, why the appeal should not be dismissed for the reason that, although the certified record was filed and docketed in this \u2022court on April 19, 1957, the appellant had filed no brief and had taken no other \u2022or further steps to perfect her appeal. A brief for the appellant has now been received, and the appellant\u2019s answer to the order to show cause has likewise been received and filed. The said brief and answer constitute good and sufficient cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for the reason set out in this court\u2019s order of September 27, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">However, the said brief and answer disclose that this court is without jurisdiction to consider this appeal, for the reason that the district court\u2019s order striking the demand for jury trial and transferring the case to the non jury calendar was not an appealable order. City of Morgantown, W. Va. v. Royal Ins. Co., 1948, 337 U.S. 254, 69 S.Ct. 1067, 93 L.Ed. 1347; Black v. Boyd, 6 Cir., 1957, 248 F.2d 156. It is this court\u2019s duty to dismiss an appeal for want of jurisdiction, even if the issue is not raised by either party, City of Louisa v. Levi, 6 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-18\">Accordingly, it is ordered that this appeal be and it hereby is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
