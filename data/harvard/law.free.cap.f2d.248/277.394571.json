It maintained plants and hired employees in three states, New York, New Jersey and Missouri. Liberty Mutual issued a master Workmen\u2019s Compensation Policy covering those three states in 1950. When Borsari performed a job in any other state, key men would be sent from its plants to direct and assist in the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">About May 6, 1952 Liberty issued to Borsari a policy of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance (No. WC 20-300337-52 N.Y. effective April 1, 1952 for one year) which covered compensation liability of Borsari on work being done in the State of New Jersey for the Anheuser-Busch Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">On July 23, 1952, Borsari and Anheuser entered into a contract, whereby Borsari agreed to perform certain additional work for Anheuser at Newark, New Jersey. The contract for the additional work was known as Anheuser\u2019s Project 654, and Borsari\u2019s Job No. 5207. It was the second job Borsari had undertaken for Anheuser at Newark; the earlier job was known as Borsari Job No. 4910 under a contract containing similar provisions for workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. Under the terms of the contract, Anheuser agreed to furnish Borsari (at the expense of Anheuser) liability insurance protecting Borsari \u201cunder any Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act or other statute or law inposing liability for injuries sustained by [Borsari] employees in connection with work covered by the contract.\u201d The trial court properly construed this contract provision to be all inclusive, that it included any compensation liability of Borsari under the laws of Missouri, as well as those of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">Anheuser obtained from Employers Mutual workmen\u2019s compensation insurance insuring Borsari, and Employers Mutual issued and delivered to Borsari a certificate of insurance dated February 2, 1953. The date of the policy itself does not appear. The certificate was silent as to the states included in the coverage, but the master policy, which was issued to and retained by Anheuser, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>specifically provided that it covered Borsari only for the workmen\u2019s compensation liability imposed by the laws of- the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It is alleged by Liberty, that Borsari, acting in good faith, and in order to save a premium charge, and believing it was fully covered by the Employers Mutual policy for its workmen\u2019s compensation liability in every state where required, requested Liberty to eliminate from its existing workmen\u2019s compensation policy all coverage for injuries to or death of Borsari\u2019s employees in connection with the Anheuser job in Newark, New Jersey. Accordingly on December 8, 1952, Liberty issued an endorsement (No. 17) to Borsari\u2019s policy reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cInsurance Not Applicable to Certain Designated Operations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AID\">\u201cIt is agreed that, anything in this policy to the contrary notwithstanding, this policy does not insure as respects injuries (Or death resulting therefrom) sustained by any employees engaged in work directly connected with operations conducted at:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cJob #5207, Anheuser Busch, Inc. \u201cNewark, New Jersey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Borsari had made a similar request in 1950 as to Liberty\u2019s coverage on Job #4910, and the same course had been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">On March 11, 1953, a fire occurred at the Anheuser job site in Newark, New Jersey, and as a result three of Borsari\u2019s employees, Grainger, Hageman and Manthey, lost their lives. Later Borsari learned that the Employers Mutual policy did not provide coverage for Borsari\u2019s liability under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Missouri. V.A. M.S. \u00a7 287.010 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The widows of the deceased employees, who were residents of Missouri, filed claims for compensation death benefits against Borsari and Liberty, as insurance carrier, with the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Department of Labor and Industrial Relations for the State of Missouri. The Missouri statute- provided more liberal compensation than the New Jersey statute. The claimants had a choice of compensation under either the New Jersey or the Missouri statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">The contracts of employment of the deceased employees had been made in the State of Missouri and their widows were eligible to recover from Borsari and from Liberty Mutual, its insurance carrier in Missouri, the compensation benefits under the Missouri Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. Under \u00a7 287.280 of the Act and under the authority of Allen v. Raftery, 237 Mo.App. 542, 174 S.W.2d 345, Liberty was precluded from denying liability, despite its endorsement of December 8, 1952, issued to Borsari, which excluded coverage with respect to Borsari\u2019s employees in connection with the Anheuser job in Newark, New Jersey. Liberty had covered some of Borsari\u2019s employees in Missouri and under the statute (\u00a7 287.-110, subd. 2) the widows of the Borsari workmen hired in Missouri were similarly protected, although working in another state. On May 19, 1954, each surviving widow received from the Missouri Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division a final compensation award of $12,400.00 against Borsari and Liberty, a total of $37,200. The $400.00 of each award was for funeral expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">The estates of the three deceased employees had instituted common law actions in the State of New Jersey to recover damages from certain contractors for having negligently caused the deaths of these men. While the third party actions were pending, Liberty and Borsari, pursuant to the laws of New Jersey, \u201casserted liens [by statutory notice] against any recovery by the states,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the common law actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The actions in New Jersey were settled for a total sum of $82,500. In the Grainger estate the settlement figure was $30,000; in the Hageman estate $27,-500; and in the Manthey estate $25,000. Under the terms of the settlement Liberty was to receive about $15,000 as reimbursement for compensation payments theretofore paid to the surviving widows, and also the right to be released from making further payments under the Missouri awards of May 19, 1954.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Liberty alleges that as a condition of receiving its share of the settlement recovery, it was required by the statutes, of Missouri and New Jersey, to pay an attorney\u2019s fee of $5,000.00 to the attorneys who represented the estates of the deceased workmen in the third party actions; and that at the time Liberty received its part of the recoveries Liberty paid the $5,000.00 fee by three checks (Ex. 11), dated January 9, 1956, total-ling the $5,000. Liberty accordingly has claimed reimbursement of that amount from the defendants, Borsari and Anheuser, in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Liberty\u2019s claim against Borsari is that since the latter induced Liberty \u201cto eliminate three state coverage from its compensation policy,\u201d on Borsari\u2019s representation that it was obtaining similar coverage through another insurance carrier under Borsari\u2019s contract with An<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>heuser, Borsari is liable to Liberty for the loss it sustained by Borsari\u2019s failure to do so; and that the $5,000.00 attorneys\u2019 fee represents that loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Liberty claims that it is subrogated to any rights of recovery vested by law in Borsari against Anheuser, and that Anheuser breached its contract with Borsari, by failing to provide proper insurance for Borsari \u201cunder any Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d including the State of Missouri. Liberty bases its claim against Anheuser on the subrogation clause of Liberty\u2019s insurance policy issued to Borsari and on the general principles of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Judge Dawson found in favor of Liberty, holding Borsari and Anheuser jointly and severally liable for the $5,000.00 Liberty paid as its proportionate share of the attorneys\u2019 fees in the New Jersey third party actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The most important question presented on his appeal is whether the payment of the $5,000.00 by Liberty Mutual was a \u201cvoluntary\u201d payment, or a payment that Liberty was obliged to make by statute. If the payment was voluntary, Liberty Mutual would have no basis for a claim of recoupment. The nature of the payment, voluntary or otherwise, is governed by the provisions of the statute, applicable as of the date the recoveries in the third party actions were effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Although Liberty Mutual and: Borsari filed their statutory notice in the third party actions instituted in the New Jersey State Court, pursuant to New Jersey law, their right to recover on their lien, the amount of their recovery and the conditions attached thereto, are governed by the law of the State whose Compensation Act was invoked by the claimants in obtaining their compensation awards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this ease it would be the law of Missouri. However, the trial of this case and its decision proceeded on the assumption that the Compensation Law of New Jersey applied. The New Jersey statute required contribution by the compensation carrier towards the expenses and attorney\u2019s fee of the plaintiff in a third party action. It was in effect on all pertinent dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Prior to August 29, 1955, the law of Missouri, \u00a7 287.150, made no provision for the deduction of any part of the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of the third party action from the amount payable by way of reimbursement to the employer of the insured employee, or to the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, out of the amount recovered by the estate of a deceased employee in the third party action. The employer or its insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>carrier was entitled to be reimbursed for the full amount of the compensation award without any deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">If the payment of $5,000.00 by Liberty Mutual as its share of the attorney fees for the recovery made in the third party action is governed by the provisions of subdivision 2 of \u00a7 287.150 which went into effect August 29, 1955 (not July 29th as stated in Liberty\u2019s brief), i. e., if the recoveries in the third party actions were effected on or after that date, then under the language of subdivision 2, the payment of the $5,000.00 would be required by statute and would not be voluntary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">Subdivision 2 reads as follows: \u201c2. Whenever recovery against the third person is effected by the employee or his dependents, the employer shall pay from his share of the recovery a proportionate share of the expenses of the recovery, including a reasonable attorney fee. After the expenses and attorneys fee has been paid the balance of the recovery shall be apportioned between the employer and the employee or his dependents in the same ratio that the amount due the employer bears to the total amount recovered, or the balance of the recovery may be divided between the employer and the employee or his dependents as they may agree. Any part of the recovery found to be due to the employer, the employee or his dependents shall be paid forthwith and any part of the recovery paid to the employee or his dependents under this section shall be treated by them as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future installments of compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In the first clause of the first sentence \u201cWhenever recovery against the third person is effected by the employee or his dependents\u201d the word \u201cwhenever\u201d means \u201cif\u201d or \u201cin the event of.\u201d State ex rel. Kansas City v. School Dist. of Kansas City, 333 Mo. 288, 62 S.W.2d 813, 817; Morse v. Custis, 38 Cal.App.2d 573, 101 P.2d 702, 704. Note the words \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201cis effected.\u201d The date the terms of the settlement were arrived at, is not the date the recovery was effected. The date the moneys were actually paid over in settlement of the third party action is the date the recovery is effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The second clause of the first sentence \u2014 \u201cthe employer shall pay from his share of the recovery a proportionate share of the expenses of the recovery, including a reasonable attorney fee\u201d\u2014 contains the mandatory words \u201cshall pay.\u201d A payment made under that clause could not be considered as \u201cvoluntary.\u201d The said second clause also indicates when the payment of a share of the expenses is to be made. It is to be paid \u201cfrom his (the employer\u2019s or his insurer\u2019s) share of the recovery,\u201d and it is not payable until the \u201crecovery\u201d has been \u201ceffected.\u201d The date the compensation insurer (Liberty), as subrogee of the employer, received its share of the money paid in settlement of the third party action would not necessarily be the determinative date; nor would the date Liberty paid its share of the attorney\u2019s fee in the third party action be the determinative date, in deciding whether subdivision 2 of \u00a7 287.150 of the Missouri statute is applicable. As hereinabove indicated that subdivision did not go into effect until August 29, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In the case at bar the employer\u2019s insurer and subrogee (Liberty Mutual) which was obligated to pay the amount of the award made by the Missouri Compensation Board to the estates of the three deceased employees, actually paid the $5,000.00, as its \u201cproportionate share of the expenses of the recovery, including a reasonable attorney fee.\u201d The reasonableness of the $5,000.00 payment is not disputed. The trial record does not show when the recoveries were actually effected in the third party actions. A letter to Judge Dawson, dated February 24, 1956, sent by one of the attorneys after the trial, shows the total amounts of the recoveries in the third party actions by the estates of the three deceased employees, and that the payments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>made by the Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Company of Wisconsin on behalf of the defendants named in the third party actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The record is silent as to the dates the recoveries were effected in the third party actions; the dates the attorney for the estates actually received the checks in settlement of the action representing the estates\u2019 share of the amount paid; the dates those checks were deposited and paid; the dates Liberty Mutual received and deposited the checks paid in satisfaction of its liens in said actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">This defect in the trial record we sought to have supplied by a stipulation of the attorneys making a part of the record on appeal in the case, photostats of the checks (face and reverse sides) given by Employers Mutual in payment of the amounts of the settlement of the third party actions. The attorney for the defendants obtained photostats of the checks and was willing to make such a stipulation. But the attorney for Liberty Mutual refused to so stipulate. These checks should show when \u201cthe recovery\u201d was \u201ceffected\u201d in the third party actions in relation to August 29, 1955, the date when subdivision 2 of \u00a7 287.150 of the Missouri statute became effective. If the recoveries were effected prior to August 29, 1955, Liberty\u2019s payment of the $5,000.00 was not required by the-Missouri statute, was \u201cvoluntary\u201d and is not recoverable in this action.<footnotemark>5a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">The discussion of the Missouri statute in Zasslow v. Service Blue Print Company, March 20, 1956, 288 S.W.2d 377, 379, is helpful, although subdivision 2 of \u00a7 287.150 was held not applicable because, in that case, both the recovery in the third party action and the making of the compensation award had been had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>prior to the effective date of subdivision 2 of \u00a7 287.150.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The Court adopted verbatim the opinion of the Commissioner from which the following paragraphs are quoted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201cIn short, the principal question in this case is whether an employer who is liable to pay compensation to the dependent of a fatally injured employee is entitled to a subrogation credit out of the proceeds of a third party action by the employee\u2019s dependent, without proportionately sharing the cost of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cThe Act, as then written,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> treated the recovery as a fund charged first with the payment of the expenses of making the recovery and then with the compensation paid by the employer, and the employee was entitled only to whatever excess remained. * * * it was a matter of indifference whether the recovery was obtained against the third party by the employer or by the employee, and no reason is apparent why a different method of distribution should be adopted in the one case from that directed in the other. The expenses of making the recovery were a first charge on the fund by the terms of \u00a7 287.150, supra, which fixed the equities of the situation. The employer was entitled <em>to receive </em>credit for the full amount of appellant\u2019s net recovery of $6,000, without deduction of respondents\u2019 proportionate share of appellant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. * * <em>* The </em>distribution was properly held to be governed by \u00a7 287.150, supra, which was the only section of the Act evidencing the legislative intent relating to the distribution of third party recoveries in effect at the time the facts in the instant case occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cThe Sixty-eighth General Assembly repealed \u00a7 287.150, supra, and in lieu thereof enacted a new \u00a7 287.-150 consisting of two paragraphs, the first of which is a reenactment of \u00a7 287.150, supra, verbatim and the second of which provides that whenever recovery against a third person is effected by the employee or his dependents \u2018the employer shall pay from his share of the recovery a proportionate share of the expenses of the recovery, including a reasonable attorney fee\u2019, as now sought to be enforced by appellant. Laws 1955, p. 598, H.B. No. 335, \u00a7 1. This provision, however, was not in effect when the instant facts occurred. It did not become effective until 90 days after May 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>1955. This court cannot give it retroactive effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">For a discussion of a comparable situation dealing with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of New Jersey, see Savitt v. L. &amp; F. Const. Co., 16 N.J.Misc. 462, 1 A.2d 752, modified 17 N.J.Misc. 65, 4 A.2d 692, writ of certiorari denied 123 N.J.L. 149, 8 A.2d 110, judgment modified and remanded for further proceeding, 124 N.J.L. 173, 10 A.2d 728; and Feinsod v. L. &amp; F. Const. Co., 16 N.J. Misc. 514, 2 A.2d 357, affirmed 17 N.J. Misc. 65, 4 A.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">If the $5,000 payment by Liberty was not \u201cvoluntary,\u201d as that term has been defined in this opinion, the next question to be considered is whether Liberty Mutual has a claim to be reimbursed in that amount by Borsari or AnheuserBusch, or by both. The trial court\u2019s opinion holds Borsari and AnheuserBusch jointly and severally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Liberty\u2019s Claim Against Borsari</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Liberty Mutual was put in the position where it was obligated to pay the awards under the Missouri Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (despite its rider excluding the Newark job from coverage under Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy) by reason of certain representations of Borsari that Anheuser-Busch had obtained the necessary compensation insurance for Borsari under Anheuser\u2019s contract with Borsari, as a result of which Liberty at Borsari\u2019s request can-celled its compensation coverage of Borsari on the Anheuser job at Newark, New Jersey. Borsari is not excused by reason of the fact that when it notified Liberty to cancel its compensation coverage on the Anheuser job, Borsari actually believed that it was fully covered under another policy procured by Anheuser under its contract with Borsari. What Liberty was held for under Missouri law was Borsari's obligation as employer. Borsari should be required to reimburse Liberty on the theory of implied contract arising out of Borsari\u2019s representations to Liberty, as to Borsari\u2019s coverage under the compensation policy Anheuser procured under its-contract with Borsari, when Borsari requested Liberty to cancel its coverage of Borsari on the Anheuser job. This resulted in an implied agreement by Borsari that Liberty should be exonerated from any compensation liability arising out of the Anheuser job. The principles of implied contract would require under those circumstances that Borsari stand the loss and not Liberty Mutual. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Taylor, 132 Md. 511, 104 A. 171; Gise v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., 188 Cal. 429, 206 P. 624, 22 A.L.R. 1476; Janes Contracting Co. v. Home Life &amp; Accident Co., Tex. Com.App., 260 S.W. 839; DeCampos v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, 122 Cal.App.2d 519, 265 P.2d 617. Liberty was not negligent in relying on Borsari\u2019s representations. As a matter of public policy, in the interest of the workmen, the Missouri statute held Liberty liable for the awards equally with the employer, Borsari. But there is no public policy that requires that the burden of the loss should be shifted to Liberty, despite the arrangement between Borsari and Liberty for a cancellation of the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Liberty\u2019s measure of damages would not be the loss in premium which Liberty would have received from Borsari if Liberty\u2019s policy had not been changed to eliminate compensation coverage on the Anheuser job. Liberty\u2019s actual out of pocket loss (the $5,000 item) would be Liberty\u2019s measure of damages, as the District Court held. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1952) \u00a7 94.10. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Taylor, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Liberty\u2019s Claim Against Anheuser</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Liberty bases its action against Anheuser on the theory that as Borsari\u2019s insurance carrier, it is subrogated to Borsari\u2019s claim for breach of contract against Anheuser-Busch (1) by virtue of the subrogation clause contained in the master policy of insurance issued by Liberty to Borsari, and (2) by virtue of the common law principles of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Although the Missouri Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is silent as to the right of an injured employee or his dependents to sue a tortious third party it has been held that the Missouri Compensation Act did not take away the employee\u2019s common-law right against an offending third person. McKenzie v. Missouri Stables, Inc., 225 Mo.App. 64, 34 S.W.2d 136; Reynolds v. Grain Belt Mills Co., 229 Mo.App. 380, 78 S.W.2d 124; and Schumacher v. Leslie, 360 Mo. 1238, 232 S.W.2d 913. It was pointed out in Bunner v. Patti, 343 Mo. 274, 121 S.W.2d 153, 155, that while \u00a7 287.150 subrogates the employer to the rights of the employee against a third person: \u201cyet it is settled that the employee also may sue, independent of the statute, or the two may sue together; and this is true notwithstanding the employee has already claimed and collected compensation under the Act for the same injuries from his employer. Anzer v. Humes-Deal Co., 332 Mo. 432, 58 S.W.2d 962.\u201d See also, Schumacher v. Leslie, supra; McKenzie v. Missouri Stables, supra.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Liberty Mutual made the following subrogation clause part of its Workmen\u2019s Compensation insurance policy issued to Borsari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cSubrogation The Company shall be subrogated in case of any payment under this Policy, to the extent of such payment, to all rights of recovery therefor vested by law either in this Employer, or in any employee or his dependents claiming hereunder, against persons, corporations, associations or estates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The employer and his insurer stand in the position of the employee or the dependents of a deceased employee who have received payments under the policy; and they acquire such rights, and only such rights, against a third person whose negligence caused the injury, as the injured employee or the dependents of a deceased employee would have had against the third person. The sole test of liability of the third party to the subrogated employer or his insurance carrier is the liability of the third party to the injured employee or to his dependents. General Box Co. v. Missouri Utilities Co., 331 Mo. 845, 55 S.W.2d 442; Gayhart v. Monarch Wrecking Co., 226 Mo.App. 1118, 49 S.W.2d 265. See also Goldschmidt v.

We are of the opinion that the subrogation clause of the policy, when considered in relation to the purpose of the insurance and the other provisions of the policy, does not include within its scope Borsari\u2019s right of action against Anheuser-Busch for breach of contract. The purpose of the clause in the policy was to subrogate the insurer to the employer\u2019s right of action against any third party tort-feasor who injured or caused the death of insured\u2019s employee, whether that tort-feasor was a natural person, a corporation, an association, or an estate. The right of subrogation which an employer or his compensation insurer has against a third party whose negligence has resulted in injury to the employee and the resultant payment of a compensation award under a State statute, is a right created by the compensation statute. The subrogation clause of the policy gave the insurance carrier the right which the insured employer had under the statute. The employer had no common-law right of subrogation against the third party tort-feasor. McKenzie v. Missouri Stables, Inc., supra, 34 S.W.2d at page 138; Crab Orchard Imp. Co. v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. Co., 4 Cir., 115 F.2d 277 at page 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The question remains as to whether under common law principles of subrogation, Liberty Mutual has a right of subrogation to Borsari\u2019s right of action against Anheuser-Busch for breach of contract. Liberty Mutual has been required to pay something that it would not have had to pay, if Anheuser-Busch had fully performed its obligation to Borsari and furnished Borsari a policy that would cover Borsari's employees with workmen\u2019s compensation under the Missouri statute. Anheuser-Busch provided compensation insurance coverage for Borsari\u2019s employees only under the laws of New Jersey. The deceased employees\u2019 dependents elected to claim compensation under the laws of Missouri, and under the Missouri law Liberty Mutual was held liable for the compensation awards. The Missouri Commission\u2019s additional findings (dated Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ary 18th, 1955) contain the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">\u201cWe further find that Borsari Tank Corporation of America, employer herein, had insured its entire liability under the Missouri Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law as provided in Section 287.280, RSMo 1949, with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company as its insurance carrier, a duly authorized insurer; that on the date of this accident said employer had not qualified as a self-insurer as to any of its operations; and that, therefore, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company was the insurer of this employer without reservation and is primarily liable to the dependent of deceased employee. Allen v. Raftery [237 Mo.App. 542], 174 S.W.2d 345; Harris v. Pine Cleaners, Inc. [Mo. App.], 274 S.W.2d 328, loc. cit. 332.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN4\">Liberty Mutual would not have been obliged to pay the awards under the Missouri law, if Anheuser-Busch had covered Borsari with a proper compensation policy including liability under the Compensation Law of Missouri. Bosari Corporation would not have been a qualified self-insurer under Missouri law, but it would have been a properly insured employer and Liberty Mutual\u2019s release from coverage would have been recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Although there was no privity between Liberty Mutual and Anheuser-Busch, Liberty Mutual\u2019s dealings with Borsari in cancelling its coverage on the Anheuser-Busch, Newark, New Jersey, job were in reliance on Borsari\u2019s representation that Anheuser-Busch had obtained proper insurance coverage of Borsari\u2019s employees on the Anheuser-Busch job at Newark, New Jersey. Borsari\u2019s representations were made in good faith. The certificate of insurance it received from Anheuser-Busch contained the statement \u201cPull coverage under workmen\u2019s compensation law. As designated in endorsement for coverage under paragraph Qne(b),\u201d of the policy which AnheuserBusch retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The fault was on the part of Anheuser-Busch in not obtaining proper compensation coverage for Borsari. Applying equitable principles to the fact situation in this case, the loss should fall on Anheuser-Busch, not on Liberty Mutual. And in order to place the loss where it belongs, Liberty Mutual should, in equity, be subrogated to Borsari\u2019s right of action against Anheuser-Busch for breach of contract. In Gerseta Corporation v. Equitable Trust Co., 241 N.Y. 418, 425-426, 150 N.E. 501, 504, 43 A.L.R. 1320, Judge Pound writing for the Court stated the equitable basis of the doctrine of subrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">\u201cSubrogation, an equitable doctrine taken from the civil law, is broad enough to include every instance in which one party pays a debt for which another is primarily answerable, and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter, so long as the payment was made either under compulsion or for the protection of some interest of the party making the payment, and in discharge of an existing liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">See also Pittsburgh-Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Kerr, 220 N.Y. 137, 144, 115 N.E. 465, 467, holding that the doctrine of equitable subrogation \u201cincludes so wide a range of subjects that it has been called the \u2018mode which equity adopts to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by one who in justice, equity, and good conscience ought to pay it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">In the case at bar it appears that both Liberty Mutual and Anheuser-Busch were under a legal obligation to protect Borsari against liability resulting from injuries sustained by Borsari\u2019s employees in connection with the work performed by Bosari\u2019s employees at the Newark job. Liberty Mutual was so bound by virtue of the public policy of the State of Missouri, as hereinabove explained; Anheuser-Busch by virtue of the provisions of its contract with Borsari. Although both were legally bound, yet as between themselves, Anheuser-Busch was pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>marily liable, because it was the breach of its contract with Borsari that brought about the resultant loss to Liberty Mutual. Under the circumstances the equities strongly favor Liberty Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Since the two defendants, without separate representation, have presented a common defense without any claim of right as against each other, and since each is liable to the plaintiff, a joint and separate judgment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">At the new trial the trial court will be in a position to receive in evidence the checks that were given in settlement of the three third-party actions. It may also hear and receive any other proof that will show when the recoveries were effected in those actions. It will then apply the Missouri Compensation statute, in force at the time the recoveries were effected, in determining whether Liberty Mutual\u2019s payment of the $5,000 was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">At the new trial the Court may also inquire, if the issue is raised, as to the correctness of the amount of $5,000, to ascertain if it was in excess of the amount Liberty Mutual should have paid under the Missouri statute.

Consequently, without regard to where the pure legal title to the cause of action may be, either the employee or the employer is plainly a real party in interest, and, of whatever sum he recovers from the third party, he is, in part at least, the trustee of an express trust, the employee to see that the employer\u2019s right of subrogation is protected, and the employer to see that the employee secures the surplus remaining after he himself is indemnified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">* * * * \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201cIt follows, therefore, that the employer may sue in his own name without joining the injured employee, not only because he is the trustee of an expressed trust in the manner, that we have pointed out, but also because the subrogation statute seems to give him that right.

I do not understand the theory on which Liberty is said to be subrogated to Borsari\u2019s contract right against Anheuser. My brothers say simply that it is equitable that Anheuser should reimburse Liberty, since Liberty would have sustained no loss had Anheuser performed its contract. This is only another way of saying that my brothers consider, by and large and under all the circumstances of the case, that it is fair and reasonable to compel Anheuser to reimburse Liberty. But I have no confidence in this vague and slippery approach. Indeed, I do not believe that under our system of jurisprudence, judges have the right to decide cases purely on the basis of what may strike an individual judge as the right thing to do, independent of any rule of law. We are not mere philosophers, nor is it our function to dispense <em>a priori </em>justice between the parties, but rather to determine and apply the law as best we can.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">As the District Court had jurisdiction of this case by virtue of the diversity of citizenship of the parties and we are to decide a substantive question of subrogation <em>vel non, </em>there necessarily arises <em>in limine </em>the conflict of laws problem of what law governs. What law are we talking about? Is it some general concept of justice residing <em>in nubibusl </em>Or is it a \u201cfederal general common law,\u201d which we were told in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78-80, 58 S.Ct. 817, 822, 82 L.Ed. 1188, no longer exists and never did exist, although even the Supreme Court at one time thought it did? My brothers give no answers to these questions. Nor do they say they are applying New York law or Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">We must first determine what rule of conflicts the New York courts would apply, as the case was tried in a United States District Court sitting in the State of New York, and we must find \u201cwhat the state law is, not what it ought to be.\u201d Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 1022, 85 L.Ed. 1477. But neither the parties nor the Court below has told us what that law is. We may assume that either New York law or Missouri law would be held to provide the controlling substantive rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">Such research as I have been able to do in the limited time available, however, would tend to indicate that there is no principle or group of principles heretofore applied by the courts either in New York or Missouri which can fairly be said to provide a foundation for the conclusion that Liberty has a right of sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>rogation to Borsari\u2019s contractual rights against Anheuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Surely such general statements as are quoted in the majority opinion from certain New York cases are too frail a reed to lean upon. In their context they support the decisions arrived at, <em>in vacuo </em>and by themselves they are no more than pious thoughts, glittering generalities, which are all too often untrustworthy guides to the decision of particular cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Let us turn then to a consideration of certain fundamental principles of the law of subrogation, which may be thought to have general application in all American courts and to certain decisions by the New York and Missouri courts which seem, at least to me, to militate against the conclusion to which my brothers come and from which I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">It is a fundamental principle of subrogation that \u201cOne who rests on subrogation stands in the place of one whose claim he has paid, as if the payment giving rise to the subrogation had not been made.\u201d United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 242, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 1603, 91 L.Ed. 2022. In effect, the subrogee buys the claim from the subrogor. A person is not subrogated to another\u2019s rights unless he has paid that person, or at least has satisfied an obligation owing by that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Liberty paid no money to Borsari. Did it satisfy an obligation owing by Borsari? In other words, was Borsari liable to the workmen\u2019s estates under the Missouri Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act? Under Missouri law, Borsari was liable to the estates only \u201con motion and proof of default by the insurer.\u201d Mo.Rev.Stat. 1949, \u00a7 287.300, V.A.M.S. Hence Liberty\u2019s payment was not made in Borsari\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Even if we pass this hurdle and assume that Liberty did in effect satisfy an obligation of Borsari as its insurance carrier, we have merely satisfied one condition of subrogation. That is not the same as finding subrogation. An indemnity insurer by paying to or in behalf of his assured does not necessarily become subrogated to all of the assured\u2019s claims relating to the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Although it appears to be law in every state that upon indemnifying the assured the insurer is subrogated to the assured\u2019s tort claims against third party tortfeasors who caused the damage, 8 Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a7 1997; Vance, Insurance \u00a7 134, there has been considerable disagreement among the states as to whether the insurer is similarly subrogated to contract claims of the assured against third parties also obligated to make good all or part of the loss. Note, Subrogation of the Insurer to Collateral Right of the Insured, 28 Colum.L.Rev. 202; Patterson, Cases and Materials on Insurance, 303; compare Couch, op. cit. supra, \u00a7 2017, with 2 Richards, Insurance \u00a7 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Neither my brothers nor I have been able to find a single case decided by any New York or Missouri court which holds an indemnity insurer subrogated to claims against third parties who had not caused the injuries. Nor am I prepared even to go so far as to say that such decisions are desirable and on the whole in the interest of justice. It is well to remember that Borsari, for reasons doubtless satisfactory to it, failed to avail itself of the cross-claim procedure provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 13(g), 28 U.S.C.A.; and there is still apparently the possibility of separate suit. Liberty doubtless should recover from Borsari; Borsari has a right to recover against Anheuser for breach of contract; but it does not shock my sense of justice to conclude that Liberty has no cause of action whatever against Anheuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">But even if it were assumed that the judges of the highest or of other courts of New York or Missouri might be disposed to view such a holding as a forward step in the development of New York or Missouri law, the fact still remains that as yet there is no such law, the possibility of such a decision lies <em>in gremio legis; </em>it is a possibility but nothing more than that. There is a duty in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>a proper case to decide what the law of a particular state is, but not to anticipate or speculate on the subject of what that law shall some day be.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Moreover, such trend as I am able to detect in the Missouri and New York cases is in the opposite direction and indicates that subrogation to claims against third parties other than those who caused the injuries is viewed with disfavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In Plate Glass Underwriters\u2019 Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ridgewood Realty Co., 219 Mo. App. 186, 269 S.W. 659, 662, the insurer paid its assured the cost of replacing a plate glass window that had been blown out by a windstorm. It then claimed to be subrogated to whatever rights its assured, the tenant of the premises, had against the landlord under the lease to compel the landlord to bear the cost of such repairs. The court rejected this claim, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cNow, the insurance company in the case at bar did not agree to insure or guarantee to the insured the payment of any debt, or the performance of any obligation on the part of insured's landlord. It merely agreed to insure the plate glass, i. e., the property itself, for a cash consideration, to wit, the premiums paid by insured. The insurance contract was one solely between the two parties thereto, and the insurance company only paid what it contracted primarily to do; but now, notwithstanding it still retains the premiums or the benefit of its contract, it seeks reimbursement from the landlord on the basis that the latter, under a wholly separate and independent contract, should have done so. We see no basis of subrogation arising out of the circumstances herein, and are of the opinion that the subrogation clause in the insurance contract only applies to circumstances in which the law creates the right of subrogation. The plaintiff insured the property itself, not a debt due the tenant. Havens v. Germania Ins. Co., 135 Mo. 649, 658, 659, 37 S.W. 497. The mere fact that the tenant might thus have two sources to which he could look for repair or reimbursement does not give the plaintiff the right to be subrogated to that right as to one of such sources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In Alexandra Restaurant v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., 272 App.Div. 346, 71 N.Y.S.2d 515, a tenant had taken out fire insurance. A fire occurred, and the landlord restored the premises as required by the lease. The tenant-assured sued the insurer, which resisted payment on the ground that there had been no loss and also on the ground that it was subrogated to the tenant\u2019s right against the landlord. The holding was that the insurer was not entitled to the benefit of its assured\u2019s wholly independent contract with the landlord. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion. 297 N.Y. 858, 79 N.E.2d 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">I would reject Liberty\u2019s claim to subrogation against Anheuser, or, at most, leave this question open for full exploration on the remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
