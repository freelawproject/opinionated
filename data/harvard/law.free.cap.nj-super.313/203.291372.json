He was sentenced to a term of eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">A Jersey City police officer testified that on the night of October 26-27,1995, he was on patrol in a marked radio car with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>trained dog from the K-9 unit, when he received a radio call to respond to 258 Duncan Avenue in Jersey City. Upon approaching the house with the dog, the officer observed that the front door had been pried open and that a scissor gate behind the door was pulled apart. The officer, in uniform, entered the house, surveyed the immediate surroundings by flashlight, and twice gave his standard warning in a loud voice: \u201cThis is the police. You are under arrest. I have a trained police dog. If you do not come out, I will <em>release him.\u201d There </em>was no reply, and the officer released the dog, commanding him to \u201csearch and find.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Shortly thereafter, the officer heard scuffling in one of the rooms and a man yell \u201cget the dog off me.\u201d The officer entered the room and saw the dog holding defendant\u2019s right leg with his <em>teeth. When </em>defendant was handcuffed, the officer called the dog off and then radioed for back-up assistance. The officer found several hand tools including three screwdrivers (two Phillips head and one standard head), a pair of pliers, a wrench and a hammer in and around a blue satchel located near defendant. Defendant denied that he owned the tools found by the police, although he acknowledged that the tools were in the room where he was found. Defendant was arrested and taken to the Jersey City Medical Center where he was treated for puncture wounds to his right ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The building\u2019s owner testified that the building is a two-floor single family dwelling with a basement, situated on property measuring twenty feet by eighty feet. At the time of the alleged burglary, the building had been unoccupied for nearly a year. The house\u2019s water, gas and electricity had been disconnected prior to defendant\u2019s arrest. He further testified that when he went to the house after the police called him, he discovered that nearly all the copper pipes from the house were missing, in addition to other damage to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Defendant, age forty-nine, testified that he was homeless at the time of the alleged burglary and that he had been seeking shelter inside the house. He did, however, give the police an address, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>which was the home of his sister. Although the owner had not given defendant permission to enter the house, defendant had, at times, been using the house as shelter for over a month. He testified that the first time he entered the house, he entered through the front door that was closed but not locked, and that although there was a scissor gate on the inside, there were no padlocks on it. He stated that prior to his arrest on October 27, 1995, he had slept six or seven nights in the house, and that, during such time, he had not taken anything from the house, nor did he do anything to damage the house physically.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Defendant claimed that on the night of October 26th he had entered the house at around 8:00 p.m. carrying only his food and a flashlight. After falling asleep, he was awakened by the dog who came in and started biting his leg. Defendant testified that he kicked at the dog and then the police officer hit him across the face with a flashlight, knocking out defendant\u2019s front teeth. He denied going to the house with the intent to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Defendant raises four points on this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">THE PROSECUTOR VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COMPULSORY PROCESS AND DEFENDANT\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL BY THREATENING DEFENSE WITNESS MICHAEL COBB WITH CRIMINAL PROSECUTION WHICH CAUSED THE WITNESS TO INVOICE A CLEARLY REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, AND UNREALISTIC FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIM (Not raised below);</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S SUMMATION DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF A FAIR TRIAL (Not raised below);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">A The prosecutor violated <em>Stale v. Bankston </em>by suggesting that defendant was observed awake and committing a burglary by an unidentified witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">B. The prosecutor improperly commented on facts not in evidence;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">THE VERDICT BELOW WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE FACTS ADDUCED AT TRIAL FAILED TO ESTABLISH BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT 258 DUNCAN AVENUE WAS A DWELLING;</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>IMPOSITION OF THE MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN (18) MONTH SENTENCE WAS AN ABUSE OP THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S DISCRETION BECAUSE IT EXCEEDED THE PRESUMPTIVE SENTENCE FOR A CRIME OF THE FOURTH DEGREE.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Defendant\u2019s first two points are without merit, and will therefore be discussed only briefly. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). In light of our reversal on the third point, the fourth issue is rendered moot and will not be discussed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Defendant\u2019s first two points, raised for the first time on appeal and therefore subject to the plain error standard of review, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, relate to errors allegedly committed by the prosecutor during the course of the trial. Defendant did not contest his guilt with respect to the criminal trespass conviction. In fact, during the course of the trial, defendant readily admitted that he committed criminal trespass, and his defense to the burglary charge was that he was guilty only of the trespass. Defendant\u2019s attorney stated during summation: \u201cThat leaves us with [defendant] being in a building where he had no business ... being. That\u2019s a crime for which he is or should be found guilty. But that crime is not burglary. That crime is trespass. The only thing that [defendant] is guilty of, ladies and gentlemen, is trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Both of defendant\u2019s first two points relate solely to the charge of burglary of which defendant was acquitted by the jury. Because defendant was acquitted of burglary, there was not even an arguable \u201cunjust result.\u201d Both errors are thus harmless and cannot rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">Defendant next claims that 258 Duncan Avenue was not a \u201cdwelling,\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute defining criminal trespass reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>A person commits an offense if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so, he enters or surreptitiously remains in any research facility, structure, or separately secured or occupied portion thereof____ [An] offense [under this section] is a crime of the fourth degree if it is committed in a dwelling____ Otherwise it is a disorderly persons offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3a (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The statute does not define the term \u201cdwelling.\u201d Therefore, in arriving at a definition of the term, we must look elsewhere. <em>See </em>John M. Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 3 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3, at 428 (Gann 1997-98) (\u201cThe term [\u2018dwelling\u2019] in this context<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has not been defined by the Code, but has been defined by the common law in the context of adjudicating burglary cases. A dwelling, thus, is a private house, a place where a person resides and sleeps.\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Wilson, </em>1 <em>N.J.L. </em>502 (Sup.Ct.1793); <em>Connors v. State, </em>45 <em>N.J.L. </em>340, 342 (Sup.Ct.1883)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">We have found no New Jersey case discussing the question whether a vacant building with no tenants or residents constitutes a dwelling for the purposes of burglary or criminal trespass statutes. There is, however, out-of-state authority. In <em>Tukes v. State, </em>346 So.2d 1056 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1977), a defendant appealed a second-degree burglary conviction, arguing that there was insufficient support for the jury\u2019s finding that the structure at issue was a \u201cdwelling.\u201d At the time of the burglary, \u201cthe house was unoccupied and up for sale although the owner had been in residence the preceding month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056. In downgrading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the defendant\u2019s conviction to a third-degree felony, the Florida appeals court cited a 1920 case, <em>Smith v. State, </em>80 <em>Fla. </em>315, 85 <em>So. </em>911 (1920), in which \u201cthe house which defendant was charged with breaking and entering had been unoccupied for nine months, and although some of the household effects of the owner and his family were left inside it, there [wa]s no evidence that the owner intended to return and again occupy it.\u201d <em>Tukes, </em>346 So. 2d at 1056. The <em>Smith </em>Court held that \u201cin the absence of any proof that the occupant intended to return and reestablish his residence there, ... there was a failure in the evidence to prove the essential allegation that the structure was a dwelling house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1057 (citing <em>Smith, supra, </em>85 <em>So. </em>at 912).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The <em>Tukes </em>court provided the common law definition of \u201cdwelling,\u201d upon which the <em>Smith </em>court relied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe house must be occupied as a dwelling house, and not merely be suitable or intended for such purpose. The owner or occupant, or some member of his family, or a servant, must sleep there. If it is so occupied the temporary absence of the occupant will not prevent it from being the subject of burglary as a dwelling house; but a house, although furnished as a dwelling house, loses its character as such for the purpose of burglary, if the occupant leaves it without the intention to return. Occasionally sleeping in a house is not enough to make it a dwelling house.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Smith, supra, </em>85 <em>So. </em>at 912) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Johnson v. State, </em>190 So.2d 601, (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1966) (\u201cAlthough the premises involved was a residence, it was vacant and had been put up for rent, and was not being used or occupied as a dwelling at the time involved. Therefore, the breaking and entering of which the defendant was found guilty was not of [a] dwelling ... but of a building ... a lesser offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Subsequent to <em>Tukes, </em>however, the Florida Legislature, in 1982 provided a statutory definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d that dispensed with the notion of occupancy, and instead encompassed \u201ca building or conveyance of any kind, either temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile, which has a roof over it and is designed to be occupied by people lodging therein at night, together with the curtilage thereof.\u201d See <em>Perkins v. State, </em>682 <em>So.</em>2d 1083, 1084 (Fla.1996) (citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.011(2)). Florida courts have used the statute\u2019s broad definition to uphold second-degree convictions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>situations that would not otherwise have met the common law standards for dwellings. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1084-85 (upholding a dwelling burglary conviction where the house was put on the rental market, vacated by the owners several months prior to the burglary, and had no telephone or water service, although there was still electricity and well water). However, such a broad reading of the term \u201cdwelling\u201d is attributable only to the Florida statute\u2019s broad definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Other jurisdictions have likewise declined by case law to attribute the status of a \u201cdwelling\u201d to houses that are unoccupied, without tenants or owners residing in the house. For example, where a house had been rented to a family for over a year on a week-to-week basis, until the family vacated the house a short time before the break-in, a Maryland court overturned a conviction for breaking and entering a dwelling house. It found the circumstances of the case were insufficient to warrant a determination that the house at issue was a dwelling. <em>See Wallace v. State, </em>63 <em>Md.App. </em>399, 492 A.2d 970, 974 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>304 <em>Md. </em>301, 498 A.2d 1186 (1985). In reaching its conclusion, the court cited Maryland authority and criminal law treatises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">The test for determining if [a] building is a \u201cdwelling house\u201d is whether \u201cit is used regularly as a place to sleept,]\u201d ... [However,] \u201cthe mere fact that a house was built for the purpose of serving as a place of human habitation, and that it is entirely suitable therefor, will not be sufficient to qualify it as a dwelling so far as the law is concerned. It is not such before the first dweller has moved in nor after the last dweller has moved out with no intention of returning____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\"><em>Wallace </em>supports a general proposition that even when a house is between rentals, it is not considered a \u201cdwelling,\u201d but is rather \u201csimply a place in which furniture is stored pending rental by a new tenant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975 (citing <em>Marston v. State, </em>9 <em>Md.App. </em>360, 264 A.2d 127 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Similarly, <em>Rash v. Commonwealth, </em>9 <em>Va.App. </em>22, 383 <em>S.E.2d </em>749 (1989), addressed the question of \u201cwhether an unoccupied but furnished dwelling constitutes a \u2018dwelling house\u2019 for purposes of [the state burglary statute] when its last occupant has left with no intent to return and its owners plan to sell it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>house at issue had been uninhabited for approximately eight months and the owners were planning to auction the fully-furnished property. The <em>Rash </em>court, focusing on the protections to people\u2019s habitations that the burglary statutes originally sought to secure, concluded that the term \u201c \u2018dwelling house\u2019 [for the purposes of the state burglary statute] means a place which human beings regularly use for sleeping\u201d and that \u201ca dwelling is no longer a \u2018dwelling house\u2019... when its occupants leave it without any intention to return.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751-52. <em>See also State v. Scarberry, </em>187 <em>W.Va. </em>251, 418 S.E.2d 361, 364 (1992) (joining other jurisdictions in the conclusion that \u201ca dwelling is no longer a dwelling house for purposes of a burglary statute when its occupants leave it without any intention of returning\u201d); III <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 335 (14th ed. 1980) (\u201cIf a person leaves his dwelling house, intending never to return, it ceases to be a dwelling house. It does not become a dwelling house again until a new person begins to live in it; he begins to live in it when he starts to use it regularly for the purpose of sleeping.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">' As noted earlier, the owner of 258 Duncan Avenue testified that at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, the building had been unoccupied for nearly a year. Not only was the building vacant at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, the house was essentially uninhabitable. There was no electricity or other utilities, including running water. The house in this case should not have been considered a dwelling for the fourth-degree criminal trespass charge. The structure lost its character as a dwelling when it sat vacant for a substantial period.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Because the jury was not properly charged concerning the definition of a \u201cdwelling,\u201d and because defendant was correct in his assertion that the record provided insufficient support for the jury\u2019s finding that the house was a dwelling, his conviction could not have been for a fourth-degree crime. The conviction should have been for the disorderly persons offense of criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>We therefore vacate defendant\u2019s fourth-degree conviction and the sentence imposed therefor. The matter is remanded for defendant to be resentenced for a disorderly persons conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-13\">The State argues tliat defendant\u2019s arguments should not be considered because of defendant\u2019s failure to make a motion to the trial court for a new trial, under <em>R. </em>3:20-1 and <em>R. </em>2:10-1. The State is incorrect. Although defendant\u2019s appendix does not contain a record of a formal written motion for a new trial, at sentencing the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The defense has requested that a judgment of conviction be [] set aside based upon the fact that the evidence, in the defense's opinion, was insufficient to establish that the structure was a dwelling, and as a result of that, the conviction must be set aside.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-12\"> Although \"dwelling\" is defined in the criminal code section dealing with justification <em>(see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-11(c)) (\" 'Dwelling' means any building or structure, though movable or temporary, or a portion thereof, which is for the time being the actor's home or place of lodging except that, as used in [N.J.S.A.] 2C:3-7, the building or structure need not be the actor\u2019s own home or place of lodging\u201d), by the express terms of the statute, the definitions only pertain to the justification chapter. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
