The three convictions were merged and he was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment with three years\u2019 parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">Defendant has appealed. He argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>trial attorney did not move to suppress the heroin which was offered as evidence against him. Defendant also contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor cross-examined him about whether he asked for an attorney when he was arrested and implicitly argued during her summation that the grand jury\u2019s indictment was a reason for returning a verdict of guilty. Alternatively, defendant asserts that his sentence is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Defendant was arrested during a police \u201csweep\u201d in the area of West Kinney Street in Newark at approximately one o\u2019clock in the afternoon of June 7, 1994. A marked patrol car had driven through the neighborhood five or ten minutes earlier and had reported a lot of \u201cactivity,\u201d presumably suspected narcotics sales. Similar sweeps were conducted approximately three times a week in neighborhoods reported to be \u201chigh crime area[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u201cMinutes\u201d ahead of the sweep, a marked police car drove through the neighborhood, announcing through a loudspeaker that \u201canyone loitering in the area must leave that area.\u201d (By \u201cloitering,\u201d the police meant \u201cmilling around, standing around,\u201d and being unable to \u201cjustify why they\u2019re there.\u201d) Then twelve to fourteen police officers, not in uniform but wearing sweat shirts with police insignia on the front and back, arrived in the area simultaneously in five or six unmarked police cars. Their purpose was to \u201cchallenge all the people who are standing around to find out if they belong there or not\u201d and to deter them from \u201cloitering.\u201d It was not intended \u201cto get any particular individual who was reported[ ] to be involved with crime; it was basically to clean out the block from people hanging around.\u201d The police would attempt to ascertain the identities of any such persons and determine whether there were any warrants outstanding for their arrest. Sometimes, persons living in the neighborhood where a sweep was conducted complained that they would get caught up in it if they happened to be walking to a nearby store.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Newark Detective Omar Abdul Akim, who participated in the sweep, was one of the police officers who testified for the State. When Detective Akim and the two other police officers who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>working with him arrived at 342 West Kinney Street, fifteen or twenty persons other than policemen were in the area. Someone yelled, \u201cFive-O\u201d to warn that the police had arrived. The \u201csweep\u201d force arrested two or three persons, and the rest ran or walked rapidly into a nearby building and disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Defendant attracted the attention of Officers Hubert Clark and Frank Bristol because he was one of many persons who tried to run away when the police were spotted. Detective Akim and Officers Clark and Bristol ran after him. Detective Akim did not notice defendant until the other policemen had begun chasing him, and then he joined the chase. The police do not appear to have known or recognized defendant until after he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">During direct examination of Detective Akim, the prosecutor asked him, \u201cDid you identify yourselves as police officers.\u201d The detective answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The context of the question indicates Detective Akim meant that this \u201cidentification\u201d occurred while the officers were chasing defendant and he was running away. The prosecutor inquired, \u201cDid he continue to run?\u201d The detective answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">While Detective Akim was running after defendant, the detective noticed that defendant was holding the waistband of his pants and Officer Clark saw defendant take something from his waistband and throw it away. Detective Akim retrieved a brown paper bag containing glassine envelopes with heroin in them. He identified the bag and its contents as having been discarded by defendant during the chase. Officers Clark and Bristol caught defendant and arrested him. He did not have any incriminating evidence still in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">While cross-examining defendant, the prosecutor asked him the following questions and received the following replies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">Q. Did you ever ask for a lawyer when you were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">Q. You had been arrested before. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">Q. So you knew you had a right to have an attorney. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Q. You didn\u2019t ask for one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">During her opening statement to the jury, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">I would also like to inform you the reason we are here is because of this indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">This indictment is brought to this courtroom today because a few months ago a Grand Jury sat \u2014 which had consisted of 23 members. Their job was to listen to the case which the Prosecutor\u2019s Office presented to them, and by a majority of votes of the 23 members, to determine whether or not there was enough probable cause to place an indictment against the defendant, and they did that, and that\u2019s why we are here today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">She then read the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">During summation, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">I told you [yjesterday that the reason that we were here was because of this indictment, and I told you that this indictment was our admitting ticket in this courtroom because 23 people sitting as Grand Jurors sometime during the year of 1994 stated there was enough probable cause to have a true bill against the defendant regarding these charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Defendant objected, but the court declined to give the jury any admonitory instructions at that time. During the general charge, however, the court told the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">Please remember, ladies and gentlemen, this indictment is not evidence of Mr. Green\u2019s guilt. It is merely a formal charge, an informal pleading reflecting a step in the proceedings to bring this matter before a Court and a jury such as yourselves for a final decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">We cannot conceive what the prosecutor thought the relevance might be of whether defendant had requested an attorney when he was arrested and whether he knew he was entitled to an attorney because he had been arrested previously. Insofar as we can see, the only significance of these questions was to emphasize to the jury that defendant had previously been arrested. The prejudice which these questions might otherwise have caused is mitigated because defendant conceded in answer to proper questions from the prosecutor that he had previously been convicted of a third-degree crime. Nonetheless, they were entirely improper. <em>Cf. State v. Johnson, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>388, 391-92, 323 A.2d 450 (1974) (improper for prosecutor to use cross-examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>defendant solely for purpose of reviewing defendant\u2019s criminal record where defendant disclosed on direct all of his prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s references during her summation to the actions of the grand jury were also improper. It is customary for the indictment to be read to the jurors at the beginning of the trial, for the jurors to be told that their duty will be to decide at the conclusion of the trial whether the charges have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and for them to be cautioned that the indictment is not evidence of guilt. <em>See, e.g., </em>32 <em>New Jersey Practice, Criminal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 974, at 374 (Leonard N. Arnold) (Supp.1997); <em>see also State v. Vigliano, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>44, 60, 202 A.2d 657 (1964) (as part of charge, judge read indictment to and instructed jury that \u201cindictment had no probative value on the issue of guilt or innocence\u201d); <em>ef. Johnson, supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 391, 323 A.2d 450 (\u201c[Tjrial court\u2019s instructions to jury as to the import and force of an indictment ... were not only improper but possessed the clear capacity to prejudice defendant by suggesting to the jury that an indictment of itself constitutes a <em>prima facie </em>finding by a Grand Jury as to defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d); <em>State v. Goode, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 90, 650 A.2d 393 (App.Div.1994) (improper taint of jury by prosecutor\u2019s comments about success of police in obtaining search warrant based on probable cause because comment would lead jury to conclude defendant was guilty). But whatever the prosecutor\u2019s intention may have been, arguing that the grand jury had found \u201cenough probable cause to have a true bill against the defendant regarding these charges\u201d implied that the grand jury\u2019s indictment was a consideration which should influence them to convict. That implication is wrong and potentially prejudicial to the rights of the defendant, particularly in this case where the number of people scurrying about and the confusion attendant on the sweep were capable of raising at least some question about Detective Akim\u2019s identification of defendant as the person who dropped the bag of heroin. <em>Cf. Goode, supra, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 92, 650 A.2d 393 (\u201c[Rjepeated improper comments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>which ran as a thread through this trial, from opening to summation, rise to the level of plain error, for they have \u2018a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result and ... substantially prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to have the jury fairly evaluate the merits of his defense.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The court\u2019s instruction that the indictment was not evidence was too general to dissipate the harm. It did not adequately counter the suggestion implicit in the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the considered opinion of the grand jury was entitled to the trial jurors\u2019 deference. <em>Cf. State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 341-42, 605 A. 2d 230 (1992) (failure of generalized instruction to cure prejudicial impact of other-crime evidence was error); <em>State v. Slattery, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 552-53, 571 A.2d 1314 (App.Div.1990) (jury instruction about appellate review was improper because it \u201ctended to dilute the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility\u201d for deciding defendant\u2019s guilt). This misleading suggestion requires us to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We cannot tell with any assurance from the present record whether a timely motion to suppress would have prevailed. The legality of Detective Akim\u2019s seizure of the brown paper bag which he testified defendant threw away while he was running from the police depends on whether this case is controlled by <em>State v. Tucker, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>158, 642 A.2d 401 (1994), in which the seizure of evidence discarded during a chase was suppressed, or by <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 668 A.2d 460 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>519, 673 A.2d 277 (1996), and <em>State v. Doss, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>122, 603 A.2d 102 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>17, 611 A.2d 655 (1992), in which we affirmed denials of motions to suppress evidence seized during warrantless police chases.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\"><em>Ruiz, supra, </em>discusses the critical difference between that case and <em>Doss, supra, </em>on the one hand and <em>Tucker, supra, </em>on the other. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 159-62, 668 A.2d 460. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>points out that, insofar as appeared from the stipulated facts on which. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>was decided, the only reason the police had for chasing the suspect was that he ran away when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>approached. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 642 A.2d 401. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>notes that in <em>Doss, supra, </em>twenty people were gathered at eleven o\u2019clock on a November night in a parking area where drug trafficking was known to be prevalent. <em>Tucker, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 170, 642 A.2d 401. Someone in the crowd warned them that police were approaching. <em>Ibid. </em>Three or four persons, including the defendant, ran from the crowd. <em>Ibid. </em>The police followed the defendant. <em>Ib'id. </em>A police detective repeatedly commanded the defendant to halt. <em>Ibid. </em>The detective pursuing defendant recognized him as someone he had seen talking to drug dealers on several previous occasions. <em>Ibid. </em>According to <em>Tucker, supra, </em>these facts justified pursuing and stopping Doss and seizing the drugs he was found to be carrying. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>a policeman in an unmarked police car saw the defendant walking near the center of the roadway at about eleven o\u2019clock at night in a residential area where people were known to go to buy and sell drugs. 286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 157, 668 A.2d 460. The policeman drove alongside the defendant and stopped. <em>Ibid. </em>The policeman and the defendant immediately recognized each other. <em>Ibid. </em>The policeman knew that the defendant had been arrested several times for drug related offenses. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant uttered an expletive and immediately turned and ran. <em>Ibid. </em>These facts, too, were held to justify the police in pursuing him and retrieving the drugs he discarded during the chase. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 163, 668 A.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The police action in the present case, like those in <em>Doss </em>and <em>Ruiz, </em>occurred in an area where drug trafficking was prevalent. Like the defendants in <em>Doss </em>and <em>Ruiz, </em>defendant Green ran when the police arrived. Like <em>Doss, </em>but unlike <em>Ruiz, </em>the police did not recognize defendant Green before they started to chase after him. Unlike both of those other cases, the police action in the present case took place during the daytime. In both <em>Doss </em>and <em>Ruiz, </em>the totality of the circumstances supported an \u201carticulable suspicion\u201d on the part of the police which, though less than probable cause to arrest, authorized them to stop the fleeing suspects and to interro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>gate them. Acting on that \u201carticulable suspicion,\u201d the police in each of those cases shouted to their suspect, \u201cStop, police!\u201d The defendant\u2019s disobedience of those orders to stop justified their stopping him and seizing the drugs which he was carrying or had thrown away.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The record in the present case does not show that the police ordered Green to stop. In answer to a leading question from the prosecutor, Detective Akim agreed that he and the two other policemen who were pursuing defendant \u201cidentified] [themselves] as police officers.\u201d Perhaps that means that the police shouted to Green that they were police. Perhaps the question and answer imply that, besides merely identifying themselves, the police ordered Green to stop. Perhaps, however, Detective Akim was only referring to the police department insignia printed on the front and back of the sweatshirts they were wearing. We cannot be sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Our recital of the facts relevant to defendant\u2019s suppression motion was based on the trial itself. The parties saw no reason to focus on issues relevant only to the suppression of evidence, and the trial court had no occasion to make any findings with respect to whether the heroin introduced into evidence was legally retrieved because no motion was made to exclude it. Consequently, whether the police ordered Green to stop, and perhaps other significant facts as well, were left in doubt. Therefore, the present record affords us an inadequate basis on which to decide whether a motion to suppress evidence would have been granted if it had been made. However, since we have ordered a retrial on other grounds, defendant will have the opportunity for a timely motion in advance of trial to suppress the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">There is one other issue which we will mention because it is potentially significant for this and other cases, but which we will not attempt to decide because it has not been raised by either of the parties and it is unnecessary to our present decision. That is the issue whether the sweep itself was legal. It is well settled that a group of persons cannot be arrested or dispersed merely for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cloitering\u201d if they are not engaged in any illegal activity. <em>See Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>156, 158-60, 162, 168-69, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>839, 841-42, 843, 846-47, 31 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>110, 113-14, 115, 119 (1972); <em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>382 <em>U.S. </em>87, 90-91, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>211, 213, 15 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>176, 179 (1965); <em>Comarco v. City of Orange, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>463, 464-66, 295 A.2d 353 (1972); <em>State v. Caez, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 319, 195 A.2d 496 (App.Div.1963). The unanswered question in this case is whether the suspicion on the part of the police, which may have been well founded but which they were not prepared to prove, that the people gathered on West Kinney Street were engaged in illegal activities justified ordering them to disperse and, immediately afterwards, interrogating those who remained to ascertain their identities.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Our order for a new trial moots defendant\u2019s argument that his sentence is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the ease is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
