We reverse the order and remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing which is to be conducted forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">D.M. pled guilty to an accusation charging him with sexually assaulting his sister <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b). The paltry record submitted to us is not entirely clear respecting the circumstances surrounding the offense. Apparently the victim was twelve years of age and D.M. was at least four years older at the time the offense was committed. It appears that the errant sexual behavior consisted of touching the victim in inappropriate places. Although the act was repeated several times, no penetration oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>curred. At the time the offense was committed, D.M. was engaged in a long term sexual relationship with his other sister who was two years younger than he. D.M.\u2019s parents had previously discovered D.M.\u2019s aberrant sexual behavior and had removed him from the family residence to live with his grandmother. However, they subsequently permitted D.M. to return and he quickly reverted to having sexual intercourse with one sister and sexual contact with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Following entry of his guilty plea, D.M. was sentenced to the Adult Diagnostic Treatment Center (ADTC). Although the sketchy record is devoid of details, D.M. made little progress while incarcerated at the ADTC. His sentence expired on January 28, 1998. Because of his poor adjustment and the treating psychologists\u2019 prognosis of potential recidivism, D.M. was involuntarily committed to the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital for a period of twenty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On February 19, 1998, the Law Division conducted a hearing to determine whether D.M. suffered from a mental disease and whether he posed a danger to himself or others. Dr. Elter Ghahramani, a staff psychiatrist at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital, testified on behalf of the prosecutor. Much of his testimony related to whether D.M. suffered from pedophilia, the diagnosis that had been given by the treating psychologists at the ADTC. Although Dr. Ghahramani\u2019s testimony on the subject was less than enlightening, he disputed the ADTC\u2019s diagnosis because the formal psychiatric condition of pedophilia apparently required more than mere touching for sexual gratification. Although it was undisputed that D.M. had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with the older of his two sisters, she was less than four years younger than D.M., and thus the aberrant relationship between the two siblings did not meet the formal definition of pedophilia.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">While Dr. Ghahramani confessed to \u201chaving difficulty giving a psychiatric diagnosis,\u201d he concluded that D.M.\u2019s condition did not meet the statutory commitment criteria. However, Dr. Ghahra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>mani testified D.M.\u2019s \u201chistory\u201d indicated that if a \u201cpotential victim [were] available,\u201d D.M. would \u201chave a difficult time ... controlling] himself\u2019 because of his \u201cimpulsivity.\u201d The doctor opined further that \u201cif [D.M.] returned to the same environment with the same level of supervision,\u201d he would present \u201ca high risk to re-offend.\u201d Dr. Ghahramani recommended that D.M. be transferred to Trenton Psychiatric Hospital for a period of sixty days so that his interaction with female patients could be observed and evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">At the conclusion of Dr. Ghahramani\u2019s testimony, the Law Division judge announced his decision to commit D.M. to Trenton Psychiatric Hospital for thirty days. D.M.\u2019s attorney protested the judge\u2019s decision, noting that he wished to present witnesses, including D.M.\u2019s next of kin, who were then in court, in order to rebut Dr. Ghahramani\u2019s opinion and recommendation. The judge rejected the attorney\u2019s proffer, stating that he had \u201calready made up [his] mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">We reverse the Law Division\u2019s order. Our reasons are several.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">First, the Law Division\u2019s refusal to permit D.M. to present witnesses contravened the most elementary requirements of procedural due process. Because involuntary commitment effects a great restraint on individual liberty, \u201cthis power of the State is constitutionally bounded.\u201d <em>In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128, 137, 462 A.2d 1252 (1983); <em>see also Foucha v. Louisiana, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>71, 80, 112 <em>S.Ct </em>1780, 1786, 118 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>437, 448 (1992) (holding that the states must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person to be committed is mentally ill and dangerous). \u201c \u2018The civil commitment process must be narrowly circumscribed because of the extraordinary degree of state control it exerts over a citizen\u2019s autonomy.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 48, 679 A.2d 634 (1996) (quoting <em>In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 139, 462 A.2d 1252); <em>In re N.N., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>112, 130, 679 A.2d 1174 (1996). Thus, a person subject to involuntary commitment \u201cis entitled to a judicial hearing, a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>of notice, the right to present evidence, and the right to be represented by counsel.\u201d <em>In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 48, 679 A.2d 634. Moreover, while it may be within the trial court\u2019s discretion to refuse to hear testimony from the patient\u2019s next of kin, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.13(c), the statutory provision does not bar relevant testimony. Here, D.M. was denied the fundamental right to present evidence in his behalf, and was thus deprived of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Second, the Law Division judge did not articulate his reasons in ordering D.M.\u2019s commitment. In a nonjury civil action, the role of the trial court is to find the facts and state conclusions of law. <em>R. </em>1:7-4. \u201cNaked conclusions do not satisfy the purpose of <em>R. </em>1:7-4.\u201d <em>Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 570, 417 A.2d 15 (1980). Instead, the trial court is obliged to \u201cstate clearly its factual findings and correlate them with the relevant legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Our Supreme Court has said that \u201c[f]ailure to perform that duty \u2018constitutes a disservice to the litigants, the attorneys and the appellate court.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Kenwood </em>Assocs. <em>v. Board of Adj. of Englewood, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4, 357 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1976)); <em>see also State v. Singletary, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>421, 424-25, 398 A.2d 576 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>50, 404 A.2d 1150 (1979), <em>Wertlake v. Wertlake, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 485-86, 349 A.2d 552 (App.Div.1975); Brochin and Sandler, <em>Appellate Review of Facts in New Jersey, Jury and Non-Jury Cases, </em>12 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>482 (1957). In this ease, we are left with a cryptic commitment order unsupported by any factual findings or conclusions of law. The matter must be returned to the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Because the issue must be retried, we are constrained to comment on Dr. Ghahramani\u2019s testimony. As we noted earlier, although Dr. Ghahramani had difficulty providing a diagnosis, he concluded D.M.\u2019s condition did not meet the requisite statutory commitment criteria. In their appellate briefs, the parties and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Public Defender\u2019s Division of Mental Health and Guardianship Advocacy have devoted much attention to whether D.M.\u2019s psychological state may be considered a \u201cmental disease\u201d sufficient to warrant involuntary commitment upon a finding of dangerousness. Because the present record is largely uninformative respecting that question, we have no occasion to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">As a matter of due process, the term \u201cmental illness\u201d is devoid of any \u201ctalismanie significance,\u201d and legal definitions may \u201cvary substantially from their psychiatric counterparts.\u201d <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>346, -, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 2080, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>501, 513 (1997). The Constitution affords the states substantial discretion in defining the phrase \u201cmental disease\u201d and \u201cmental illness,\u201d and the definitions so drafted \u201cneed not mirror those advanced by the medical profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 117 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2081,138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Against this backdrop, our statutes define \u201cin need of involuntary commitment\u201d in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">[AJn adult who is mentally ill, whose mental illness causes the person to be dangerous to self or dangerous to others or property and who is unwilling to be admitted to a facility voluntarily for care, and who needs care at a short-term care, psychiatric facility or special psychiatric hospital because other services are not appropriate or available to meet the person\u2019s mental health care needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2m.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">The phrase \u201cmental illness\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">[A] current, substantial disturbance of thought, mood, perception or orientation which significantly impairs judgment, capacity to control behavior or capacity to recognize reality, but does not include simple alcohol intoxication, transitory reaction to drug ingestion, organic brain syndrome or developmental disability unless it results in the severity of impairment described herein. The term mental illness is not limited to \u201cpsychosis\u201d or \u201cactive psychosis,\u201d but shall include all conditions that result in the severity of impairment described herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2r.|</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">By adopting these definitions, the Legislature clearly intended to balance the rights of the mentally ill with those of our citizens who are not so afflicted. <em>See also R. </em>4:74-7. However phrased, the statutory definition requires, as a prerequisite to involuntary commitment, that the person to be committed harbor a \u201csubstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tial disturbance of thought, mood, perception or orientation\u201d significantly impairing the individual\u2019s \u201cjudgment, capacity to control behavior or capacity to recognize reality,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2r, which causes him to be \u201cdangerous to [him]self or dangerous to others or property,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2m. The statutes further require consideration of whether the person\u2019s \u201cmental health care needs\u201d and the danger presented by the underlying illness can be alleviated by means short of involuntary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Unfortunately, Dr. Ghahramani did not focus upon a functional analysis of D.M.\u2019s condition within the context of these statutory definitions. While the doctor made oblique references to D.M.\u2019s \u201cimpulsivity\u201d and the patient\u2019s inability to control his behavior, he was primarily concerned with arcane psychiatric nomenclature unanchored to the critical inquiry demanded by our statutes. We do not suggest that medical definitions are never useful in determining whether the statutory iequisites for involuntary commitment are satisfied. <em>See </em>American Psychiatric Association, <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>xiii, xxvii (4th ed.1994). But medical terminology cannot substitute for the standards plainly articulated in the relevant statutes. Regarding Dr. Ghahramani\u2019s opinion that D.M.\u2019s condition did not meet the commitment criteria, we note that the determination of whether an individual is legally committable, \u201cwhile, requiring the court to make use of the assistance which medical testimony may provide, is ultimately a legal one, not a medical one.\u201d <em>State v. Krol, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>236, 261, 344 A.2d 289 (1975); <em>see also In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 59, 679 A.2d 634; <em>In re Newsome, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 516, 424 A.2d 222 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We add one further thought before leaving the subject. Apparently, the parties to this dispute consented to staying all review proceedings pending the outcome of this appeal. We cannot fathom the reasons for such a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Accordingly, the Law Division\u2019s order of involuntary commitment is reversed. The matter is remanded for an evidentiary hearing forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
