As part of her spring semester course schedule, Graber enrolled in co-defendant Professor Alan Steinberg\u2019s Physiology (vertebrate) class. The class met weekly on Tuesdays from 8:30 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. in a campus lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>On January 24, 1995, Graber and approximately 20 other students were assembled in the lab for class. An hour and a half into the class, Professor Steinberg began demonstrating a vivisection of an anesthetized laboratory rat. At some point after the procedure began, Graber left the lab apparently to go to the bathroom. Somewhere along the way, Graber fainted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fell to the floor and hit her chin. Graber suffered two broken teeth, a split gum, and received ten stitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Subsequently, on September 9, 1996, Graber filed a complaint against Stockton and Professor Steinberg alleging that her fall and resulting injuries were caused by their negligence. An answer was filed on behalf of both Stockton and Professor Steinberg asserting various affirmative defenses including immunity under the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 <em>et seq., </em>and the Charitable Immunity Statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On February 19, 1996, Stockton and Professor Steinberg moved for summary judgment asserting the affirmative defense of immunity under the Tort Claims Act and the Charitable Immunity Statute. A hearing on the motion was conducted before the Judge John G. Himmelberger on March 26, 1997. Judge Himmelberger concluded that Stockton was entitled to the immunity provided by the statute. In so ruling, he relied on the results of a plenary hearing he had held in another case involving Stockton in which he had ruled that the college was a \u201cnot for profit entity organized exclusively for education purposes.\u201d <em>Traina v. Stocldon State College, </em>ATL-L-4307-95 (Feb. 7,1997). That status, according to Judge Himmelberger, qualified Stockton for immunity under the statute as long as the remaining requirements of the statute were met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>In this case, rather than conduct another hearing aimed at determining Stockton\u2019s institutional organization for purposes of applicability of the statute, Judge Himmelberger relied on his previous determination in <em>Tra\u00edna. </em>He again granted summary judgment in favor of Stockton (and implicitly Professor Steinberg) based on Stockton\u2019s status as an entity immune under the statute. An order issued reflecting this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Because counsel for Graber had not had an opportunity to review the transcript of the plenary hearing conducted in <em>Tra\u00edna </em>prior to oral arguments, Judge Himmelberger invited him to read the record and to file a motion for reconsideration if he believed further proceedings were required. Judge Himmelberger relaxed the ten day limitation period in which to file such a motion under <em>R. </em>4:49 to assure Graber\u2019s counsel sufficient time for review. Graber\u2019s counsel never sought reconsideration. Instead, on April 9, 1997, Graber filed a Notice of Appeal from the order granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On appeal, Graber contends that there were material issues of fact precluding summary judgment and that the trial judge \u201cmisunderstood the true purpose of the charitable immunity statute.\u201d We have carefully reviewed the record in light of her contentions and have concluded that there is no warrant for our intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">As it existed in the spring of 1995, at the time of Graber\u2019s accident, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">[n]o nonprofit corporation, society or association organized exclusively for religious, charitable, educational or hospital purposes shall, except as is hereinafter set forth, be liable to respond in damages to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of any agent or servant of such corporation, society or association, where such person is a beneficiary, to whatever degree, of the works of such nonprofit corporation, society or association; provided, however, that such immunity from liability shall not extend to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of such corporation, society, or association or of its agents or servants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>where such person is one unconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions of such corporation, society or association; but nothing herein contained shall be deemed to exempt the said agent or servant individually from then-liability for any such negligence.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Application of the statute turns on satisfaction of each of the elements plainly set forth within it. <em>See Loder v. St. Thomas Greek Orthodox Church, </em>295 <em>N.J.Swper. </em>297, 301, 685 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1996). The first condition is that <em>only a nonprofit </em>corporation, society or association is within the purview of the immunity granted\u2019 by the statute. Whether a corporation, society or organization is \u201cnonprofit\u201d is a separate question from whether or not the entity is also a \u201ccharity\u201d or organized for \u201ccharitable\u201d purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Presbyterian Homes v. Division of Tax Appeals, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>275, 286, 261 A.2d 143 (1970)(\u201c[n]onprofit status cannot be equated with charitableness\u201d). Thus an entity not specifically recognized as a charity, as that term has been defined, will satisfy the first \u201cprong\u201d of the statute by producing proofs which identify the entity as nonprofit. <em>See e.g., Seiderman v. American Institute for Mental Studies, </em>667 <em>F.Supp. </em>154 (D.N.J.1987)(incorporation under statute providing for creation of nonprofit corporations and tax exempt status evince corporation\u2019s nonprofit status).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In this case, Stockton presented various facts supporting its contention that it is a nonprofit entity. Specifically, Stockton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>relied on the certification of its vice-president, Charles Tantillo, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">3. [Stockton] is exempt from State sales/use tax pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-1 et. seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">4. [Stockton] is exempt from Federal income tax pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as an entity established for the purposes of providing educational services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">5. The operating budget of [Stockton] is derived from various sources which include State support, tuition, contract fees, and gifts or donations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">6. No profits of the College are distributed to any shareholder\u2019, board member, or officer of the College. Any revenue which exceeds the College\u2019s operational costs is placed into an account to fund subsequent years\u2019 operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Graber did not contest these facts in the trial court. She contends, for the first time on appeal, that Stockton\u2019s status as a \u201cnonprofit organization\u201d is at least questionable because the college \u201ccollects tuition, has sports teams which provide entertainment to the community, rents space at its facility for a monetary fee, and has no charter that states that it is organized solely for nonprofit use.\u201d She also claims that Stockton\u2019s failure to cite any law according it nonprofit status is dispositive of the absence of such status. As such, she maintains that a genuine issue of material fact remained in dispute for a jury to decide. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The facts cited by Graber are not in dispute. Taken at face value they simply do not affect Stockton\u2019s claim to nonprofit status. A qualifying organization does not lose its statutory immunity merely because it charges money for its services, <em>Rupp v. Brookdale Baptist Church, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 465, 577 A.2d 188 (App.Div.1990), unless it makes a profit or collects fees for services totally unrelated to its organizational pursuits. <em>See Kasten v. Y.M.C.A., </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 412 A.2d 1346 (App.Div.1980). Further, a nonprofit entity organized for educational purposes is not confined to providing purely scholastic activities in achieving its objectives. <em>See Bloom, v. Seton Hall, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 704 A.2d 1334 (App.Div.1998)(operation of on-campus pub did not alter fundamental educational nature of educational institution); <em>Pomeroy v. Little League Baseball, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 362 A.2d 39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(App.Div.1976)(entity\u2019s educational purpose not vitiated by accomplishing objectives through the teaching and supervision of baseball skills). Thus, the fact that Stockton has sports teams and hosts athletic events does not create a material factual issue as to its nonprofit status and entitlement to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We note as well that while organization under a statute providing for the creation of a nonprofit entity <em>(see e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>15A:1~1 <em>et seq.) </em>and a charter reflecting that purpose are both relevant factors to be considered in determining whether an entity is indeed not-for-profit (see <em>Seiderman, supra, </em>667 <em>F.Supp. </em>154), neither is <em>sine qua non </em>to the identification of an entity as nonprofit for purposes of the Charitable Immunity Statute. <em>See e.g., Heffelfinger v. Town of Morristown, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 384, 507 A.2d 761 (Law Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In short, the various aspects of Stockton\u2019s operation and organizational structure to which Graber now alludes, individually and collectively, are not in dispute and fall short of casting any serious doubt on the college\u2019s nonprofit status. Thus, despite Graber\u2019s claim to the contrary, no genuine issues of material fact were in dispute with respect to these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The second condition set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 is that an entity asserting the statute as a defense must also be \u201corganized exclusively for religious, charitable, or educational purposes.... \u201d Stockton maintains that it is \u201corganized under law, exclusively as an institution of higher learning.\u201d On appeal, Graber understandably raises no issue with respect to whether or not Stockton\u2019s organizational purpose is educational. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The third condition set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-7 is that the immunity provided in the statute only shields a qualifying organization from liability to \u201ca beneficiary to whatever degree, of the works of such a nonprofit corporation, society or association; provided, however, that such immunity from liability shall not extend to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of the corporation, society or association or of its agents or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>servants where such person is one unconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions of such corporation, society or association.\u201d On appeal Graber maintains that merely being a student of Stockton did not necessarily make her a beneficiary and \u201c[t]here is no case law that labels a student of a university or a college an automatic beneficiary to that institution.\u201d Not so. In <em>Bloom v. Seton Hall, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 704 A.2d 1334 (App.Div. 1998) we recently addressed the issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bloom, a Seton Hall University student, slipped and fell in a pub operated on campus by the university solely for students and their guests. <em>Id. </em>at 489, 704 A.2d 1334. Bloom sued. Seton Hall moved before trial and at the completion of Bloom\u2019s case for a directed verdict of dismissal based upon his status as a student of an entity protected by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-7. The trial judge denied the motion both times. The jury rendered a verdict in Bloom\u2019s favor and, following a denial of its motion for a new trial, Seton Hall appealed. <em>Id. </em>We found that Seton Hall was entitled to the immunity provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7, reversed the judgment for Bloom and dismissed his complaint with prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 493, 704 A.2d 1334. Fundamental though unexpressed in our reasoning in <em>Bloom </em>was the conclusion that a student engaging in educational pursuits is <em>per se </em>a beneficiary of a college or a university. Indeed, we stated in <em>Bloom </em>that for purposes of the Charitable Immunity Statute, Bloom was \u201cno less a student\u201d when patronizing the pub or buying a sandwich at the university run commons, \u201cand no less a beneficiary of its works.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 704 A.2d 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Here, Graber admits she was a student at Stockton and neither party disputes that before she fainted in the hallway she was participating in a physiology lab conducted as part of her studies. If Bloom retained his status as a beneficiary of Seton Hall\u2019s works while patronizing the campus pub, there is no question that the facts under review here provide a stronger case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Graber was a beneficiary of Stockton\u2019s educational \u201cworks\u201d at the time she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We turn next to Graber\u2019s contention that in granting summary judgment in favor of Stockton, Judge Himmelberger misunderstood the true purpose of the Charitable Immunity Statute. Relying on Judge Lynch\u2019s dissent in <em>Winters v. Jersey City, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 293 A.2d 431 (App.Div.1972),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Graber proposes that the \u201cpurpose behind the Charitable Immunity Statute was mainly to protect the trust funds of such charities from serious dissipation and to avoid diversions of their benefactors\u2019 contributions from the purpose for which they were made.\u201d Graber argues that since Stockton \u201cdoes not fall into the category of a charitable business\u201d it is not entitled to charitable immunity. However, despite its name, the Charitable Immunity Statute does not apply only to \u201ccharities.\u201d It also applies to nonprofit religious entities, <em>nonprofit educational entities </em>and nonprofit hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Graber further argues that Stockton, as a public entity, enjoys protection under the Tort Claims Act and therefore does not \u201cneed\u201d the additional protection of the Charitable Immunity Statute. Stockton counters, correctly, that its concurrent status as a public entity whose liability is controlled by the Act does not alter its entitlement to the immunity provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A--7. The Act incorporates into its provisions and affords to public entities <em>\u201cany defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private </em>person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-lb. (emphasis added). The Charitable Immunity Statute is just such a defense. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-lb, the statute is properly applied to Stockton as a public nonprofit college in the same fashion as it applies to private nonprofit colleges organized exclusively for educational purposes. <em>See e.g., Bloom v. Seton Hall, supra, </em>307 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 704 A.2d 1334. Indeed, the comment to subsection b states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">Subsection (b) is intended to insure that any immunity provisions in the act or common law will prevail over the liability provisions. It is anticipated that the Courts will realistically interpret both the statutory and common law immunities in order to effectuate their intended scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Pursuant to this section, courts have applied a wide range of statutory and common law defenses outside the Tort Claims Act to cases brought against public entities. <em>See e.g., Sykes v. Rutgers, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 269-70, 705 A.2d 1241 (App.Div.1998) <em>and Davenport v. Borough of Closter, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>635, 639-42, 684 A.2d 100 (App.Div.l996)(applying common law snow-removal immunity); <em>Del Tufo v. Township of Old Bridge, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312, 319-323, 650 A.2d 1044 (App.Div.1995), <em>aff'd </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>90, 685 A.2d 1267 (1996)(applying defense of eontributory/comparative negligence); <em>Benjamin v. Corcoran, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 634 A.2d 108 (App.Div.1993)(applying immunity under Landowners Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42A-1 et seq.). In this case, the immunity afforded under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 is available to Stockton as a nonprofit institution organized exclusively for educational purposes, even though it is also a public nonprofit college. <em>See also Tice v. Cramer, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>347, 627 A.2d 1090 (1993)(stating that public entities are entitled to immunity both under the Tort Claims Act and as established at common law).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Graber further asserts that a genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute regarding the status of Professor Stein-berg. To be sure, the pre-July 24, 1995 version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7, which applies here, did not exempt an \u201cagent or servant individually from their liability for any such negligence.\u201d Thus, Professor Steinberg was not immune from liability directly under the earlier, unamended Charitable Immunity Statute. However, it is clear that as an employee of an immune public entity, Professor Steinberg is shielded from individual liability under the provisions of the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In 1994, the legislature enacted <em>L. </em>1994, c. 49, which amended various sections of the Tort Claims Act, and importantly added the following subsection to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auu\">c. A public employee is not liable for any injury where a public entity is immune for that injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">This amendment was the legislative response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chatman v. Hall, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>394, 608 A.2d 263 (1992) in which the Court found a public employee liable for his negligence where the public entity was immune under the provisions of the Tort Claims Act governing the dangerous condition of property. The legislative history of this amendment makes clear that the bill was \u201cintended to reverse the <em>Chatman </em>ruling and to amend the Tort Claims Act to extend to public employe[e]s the same degree of immunity that the TCA grants to public entities.\u201d Senate Judiciary Statement to [First Reprint] Assembly No. 226, May 5, 1994. \u201cThe [Senate Judiciary, Law and Public Safety] committee eliminated the requirement that an employee will be immune only if his employer is immune, allowing immunity for a public employee <em>in any case where any public entity is immune.\u201d </em>Assembly Judiciary Law and Public Safety Committee Statement to Assembly, No 226, March 21, 1994. (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Professor Steinberg was an employee of Stockton College at the time of the incident causing Graber\u2019s injuries. As an employee of a public entity to which immunity attaches, Professor Steinberg is also entitled to immunity pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-lc of the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In sum, the trial judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of Stockton and Professor Steinberg under <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 666 A.2d 146 (1995) because each would have prevailed as a matter of law based upon application of the Charitable Immunity Statute and the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> Graber stated in an incident report that she \"passed out from ether\u201d which was being used in the classroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\"> In <em>Tra\u00edna, </em>Judge Himmelberger also needed to grapple with the issue of whether Stockton was engaged in the performance of its educational objectives at the time of the incident precipitating the suit against the college \u2014 i.e., the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>routine traffic stop of Tra\u00edna, a Stockton student, by campus police officers while he was driving on campus. Judge Himmelberger concluded that while \"a traffic stop in and of itself is not an educational activity ... it is reasonably related to the primary educational function and ought to be afforded immunity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\"> The statute was amended effective July 24, 1995. <em>L. </em>1995, c. 183 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. The relevant portions of the statute, as amended, do not bear on the issue of Stockton's entitlement to immunity. However, the closing provision relating to individual liability of an agent or servant for negligence was deleted and the presently amended version specifically extends immunity to employees of nonprofit entities entitled to immunity under the statute. Thus, if Graber's accident happened today, and Stockton was found immune pursuant to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2A:35A-7, Professor Steinberg would also be immune directly under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-11\"> When a nonprofit corporation, society or association raises the statute as a defense because it is organized for a charitable purpose (one of four attributes the entity must possess to meet the second requirement of the statute (pre-July 24, 1995 version)), its nonprofit status becomes a factor to be considered along with various others to determine if in fact the entity is a charity. In this case, Stockton does not assert that it is a charity or that it is organized for charitable purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b514-5\"> We gave both parties an opportunity to comment on the newly decided <em>Bloom </em>before oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> Judge Lynch\u2019s dissenting opinion was adopted by the Supreme Court in modifying the Appellate Division\u2019s decision. <em>Winters v.
