Plaintiff obtained a modest compensatory award of $40,178 (plus the net funeral and burial expenses of $3,939) under the Wrongful Death Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1 to -6, and a punitive damage award of $1.25 million under the Survivor\u2019s Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-3. Defendant Coastal Oil of New York, Inc. (Coastal) challenges the punitive damage verdict on a number of grounds. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On January 4, 1990 Helen V. Robbins (Mrs. Robbins), a widow, age 60, was driving her 1979 Lincoln Town Car north on County Route 649 in Commercial Township, Cumberland County. On the same day, Alan L. Whitaker, Jr. (Whitaker), an employee of Coastal, was driving a 36,000-pound Coastal oil truck south on County Route 633. The southbound lane of County Route 633 was governed by two yield signs where it intersects County Route 649. Due to maladjusted rear brakes, Whitaker was unable to stop the truck, even though he was \u201cstanding\u201d on the brakes. The truck crossed the intersection, struck Mrs. Robbins\u2019 automobile, and overtopped it. Mrs. Robbins died in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Harold E. Smith, the nominal plaintiff, executor of Mrs. Robbins\u2019 estate, filed an action under the Wrongful Death Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1 to -6, and under the Survivor\u2019s Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-3, against Whitaker and Coastal (collectively defendants). Smith died in 1995 and Grant Keller was appointed to replace him as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">On its appeal, Coastal raises many issues, but primarily contends that, as a matter of law, plaintiff should not recover punitive damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">On June 8,1990 the plaintiff executor filed this action under the Wrongful Death Act and Survivor\u2019s Act against defendants. Among other things, plaintiff claimed that the Coastal oil truck driven by Whitaker on January 4, 1990 had been \u201cimproperly serviced and maintained, in that the brake systems, air hoses and braking mechanisms were faulty, defective and not in proper working order.\u201d Plaintiff also alleged that \u201cdefendants ... either knew or should have known that the braking systems and braking mechanisms on the vehicle being operated by ... Whitaker ... were faulty, defective and not in proper working order, but ... defendants negligently, recklessly and with callous disregard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the safety of others, failed to take such proper steps as were necessary to adequately service, maintain and ensure that the braking mechanisms on said vehicle were in proper working order.\u201d Finally, plaintiff alleged that the \u201ccarelessness and recklessness\u201d of defendants was \u201cwillful, wanton, and with knowledge of a high degree of probable harm to others such that the deliberate and wanton failure of the defendants ... should be assessed with punitive and exemplary damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On May 9,1995 the first jury trial began. After all sides rested on May 11, 1995 they agreed to the judge\u2019s suggestion to select a second, different jury to decide the \u201cpunitive damage issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">On May 12, 1995 the first jury was asked to answer this question: \u201cWhat amount of money, if any, would fully and fairly compensate Lois Buttner as the survivor of Helen V. Robbins for the actual pecuniary or financial loss suffered by Lois Buttner due to the death?\u201d The jurors (6-0) answered \u201c$40,178\u201d to this question. Following this, the judge molded the verdict by adding the net \u201cfuneral bill and expense\u201d of $3,939, for a total judgment of $44,117. On May 30, 1995 the judge entered a judgment against defendants reflecting that the jury had \u201crendered a verdict in the amount of $40,178 pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A.-31-1, <em>et seq.\u201d </em>and that the judge had \u201cmolded the verdict as to funeral and burial expenses pursuant to the Survivor\u2019s Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-3 to include the sum of $3,939.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">On May 15, 1995 Coastal filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs punitive damage claim. In response, plaintiff filed a cross-motion for a new trial on the wrongful death damages claim. The judge denied Coastal\u2019s motion, holding that plaintiffs claim for \u201cpunitive damages\u201d against defendants \u201ccould be properly presented under the survivorship statute.\u201d The judge also denied plaintiffs cross-motion for a new trial on the \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d Finally, the judge ruled that the \u201cfuneral bill\u201d of $3,939 \u201cwould properly be included in the wrongful death aspect of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">On July 15, 1996 the punitive damage trial began before a new jury. With the consent of plaintiff and Coastal, plaintiffs punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>damage action against Whitaker was dismissed. On July 25, 1996 the jury was asked to answer two questions. The first question was: \u201cDo you find that the conduct of the Defendant, Coastal Oil Company, gave rise to a claim for punitive damages?\u201d The jurors (6-0) answered \u201cyes\u201d to that question. The second question was: \u201cWhat is the proper amount of punitive damages to be awarded in this case against Coastal Oil Company of New York?\u201d The jurors (6-0) answered \u201cone million, two hundred fifty thousand\u201d to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">On August 5, 1996 Coastal filed a motion for a new trial or remittitur. On September 5, 1996 the judge entered an order denying Coastal\u2019s new trial motion. In this order, the judge at Coastal\u2019s request amended the judgment entered on May 30,1995 to reflect that the \u201cmolded verdict including funeral and burial expenses were recovered pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>Both parties then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Coastal raises nine points on its appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">1. DID THE JUDGE ERR IN HOLDING THAT PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE RECOVERABLE UNDER THE WRONGFUL DEATH ACT?</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">2. DID THE JUDGE ERR IN NOT DISMISSING PLAINTIFF\u2019S PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIM AS A MATTER OF LAW, BECAUSE NO COMPENSATORY DAMAGES WERE RECOVERED BY PLAINTIFF UNDER THE SURVIVORSHIP ACTION?</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">3. MUST THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD BE REVERSED, BECAUSE THE FACTS OF THIS CASE DO NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR EGREGIOUS CONDUCT NECESSARY FOR THE IMPOSITION OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES?</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">4. DID THE JUDGE ERR IN DENYING COASTAL\u2019S MOTION TO BAR PLAINTIFF\u2019S EXPERTS AND IN REJECTING ITS OBJECTION TO ONE EXPERT RENDERING AN OPINION AS TO CAUSATION?</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">5. DID THE JUDGE ERR IN DENYING COASTAL\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR REMITTITUR, BECAUSE THE $1.25 MILLION AWARD WAS CLEARLY EXCESSIVE, AND NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES ACT?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>6. DID THE JUDGE ERR IN DENYING COASTAL\u2019S MID-TRIAL MOTION TO RECUSE HIMSELF?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">7. WAS THE JURY\u2019S PUNITIVE DAMAGE VERDICT THE PRODUCT OF PASSION OR PREJUDICE, BECAUSE THE JURY APPARENTLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF PROXIMATE CAUSE OR THE STANDARDS BY WHICH TO MEASURE CONDUCT IN DETERMINING WHETHER PUNITIVE DAMAGES WERE APPROPRIATE?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">8. DID THE JUDGE ERR IN PERMITTING IMPROPER FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO BE PLACED BEFORE THE JURY TO CONSIDER IN DETERMINING A PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">9. DID THE JUDGE ERR IN ADMITTING INTO EVIDENCE COASTAL\u2019S FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION CARRIER PROFILE FOR THE PERIOD JULY 22,1994 TO JULY 22,1996?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Plaintiffs sole point on the cross-appeal states:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">DID THE JUDGE MAKE SEVERAL TRIAL ERRORS WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED IN THE EVENT THIS MATTER IS REVERSED AND A RETRIAL IS ORDERED?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">Coastal first contends that the judge \u201cerred in holding that punitive damages are recoverable under [the] New Jersey Wrongful Death Act.\u201d The judge made no such ruling and would have erred if he had. The judge said that: \u201cIn a wrongful death action, perhaps punitive damages would not be appropriate.\u201d With regard to the \u201cpunitive damage issue,\u201d he ruled that this issue \u201ccould be properly presented under the survivorship statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">When the death of a person is caused by the \u201cwrongful act, neglect or default\u201d of another, an \u201caction for damages\u201d arises. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1. In \u201cevery action\u201d brought under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1, the jury can only award damages \u201cwith reference to the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death, together with the hospital, medical and funeral expenses incurred for the deceased\u201d to the \u201cpersons entitled to any intestate personal property of the decedent.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-5. In this case, the sole surviving adult child, Lois Buttner, was the only eligible beneficiary under the Wrongful Death Act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>This aspect of the Wrongful Death Act was explained in <em>Turon v. J. &amp; L. Constr. Co., </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>543, 86 A.2d 192 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">The evident policy of the statute is the recovery of damages for the pecuniary injury sustained by the designated beneficiaries. The act is essentially remedial rather than penal. Damages are assessed to compensate for the injuries sustained by the persons to whom they are payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">[8 <em>N.J. </em>at 555-56, 86 A.2d 192.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">The design of section 5 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-5], from the very beginning, was the limitation of the measure of damages to the \u201cpecuniary injuries\u201d sustained by the statutory beneficiaries as the result of the death. The statutory policy was remedial and not punitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">[7d at 557, 86 A.2d 192.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\"><em>See Carey v. Lovett, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>44, 67, 622 A.2d 1279 (1993) (\u201cDamages for the wrongful death of an infant, like wrongful-death damages generally, are limited to economic matters.\u201d); <em>Graf v. Taggert, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>303, 311, 204 A.2d 140 (1964) (\u201cOur [Wrongful] Death Act was not intended to grant damages against a tortfeasor merely to punish him.\u201d); <em>Goss v. American Cyanamid, Co., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 241, 650 A.2d 1001 (App.Div.1994) (\u201cAn award of damages in a wrongful death action is not intended to punish the tortfeasor, but only to replace that which the decedent likely would have provided.\u201d); <em>DeFelice v. Beall, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 599, 644 A.2d 1136 (App.Div.) (\u201cThe purpose of New Jersey\u2019s Wrongful Death Act is to provide compensation for pecuniary losses suffered by. survivors of those killed by wrongful acts.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>268, 649 A.2d 1288 (1994). In <em>Meehan v. Central R.R. Co. of New Jersey, </em>181 <em>F.Supp. </em>594 (S.D.N.Y.1960), the decedent\u2019s administrator sought to recover \u201cpunitive damages\u201d under the \u201cNew Jersey Wrongful Death Statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1 to 2A:31-6.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. \u201cIn accordance with the compensatory nature of the New Jersey Wrongful Death Statute,\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cpunitive damage action on the wrongful death was dismissed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">In <em>Kern v. Kogan, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>459, 462, 226 A.2d 186 (Law Div.1967), the administrators of the minor decedent filed a medical malpractice action against the defendant doctor who had treated the minor from March 9, 1964 to her death on March 18, 1964. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Based primarily on <em>Graf, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>303, 204 A.2d 140, and <em>Meehan, </em>181 <em>F.Supp. </em>594, the Law Division judge in <em>Kern </em>granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 action to recover \u201cpunitive damages\u201d from Kogan \u201cunder the Wrongful Death Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468-69. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">A reading of the cases discloses that the status of the law in New Jersey bearing upon wrongful death actions would seem to restrict all such claims to compensatory damages, and therefore, the demands for punitive damages based upon the allegations that defendant Dr. Kogan was fraudulent, deceitful and negligent, which actions resulted in the death of decedent, will not lie and thus defendant\u2019s motion with respect to these counts will be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at <em>469.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">New Jersey case law has not changed on this point since the <em>Kern </em>decision in 1967. <em>See Jadlowski v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 213, 661 A.2d 814 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>326, 670 A.2d 1066 (1996) (observing that a \u201cpunitive damages award is not to be considered compensatory,\u201d we noted that \u201cpunitive damages are not awarded for a wrongful death\u201d). Punitive damages are not recoverable under most wrongful death statutes in this country. Ghiardi <em>&amp; </em>Kircher, <em>Punitive Damages </em>\u00a7 5.19 n. 4 (Cum.Supp. 1992); Schlueter &amp; Redden, <em>Punitive Dam,ages </em>\u00a7 9.9(A) at 589 (3d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">We agree with Coastal that punitive damages are not available under our Wrongful Death Act. We also conclude that the jury made no such award.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Since no traditional compensatory damages were recovered under the dismissed survivorship action, Coastal claims that plaintiff\u2019s demand for punitive damages should have been dismissed as a matter of law, citing <em>O\u2019Connor v. Harms, </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 29-30, 266 A.2d 605 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>137, 270 A.2d 40 (1970); <em>Cooper Distributing Co. Inc. v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., </em>63 F.3d 262 (3d Cir.1995); and <em>Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., </em>4 F.3d 1153 (3d Cir.1993). We disagree with Coastal\u2019s conclusory contention that because there were no traditional com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>pensatory damages for pain and suffering under the survival action, \u201ca punitive damages verdict cannot stand ... as a matter of law.\u201d Indeed, Mrs. Robbins sustained the ultimate injury or damage; her life was extinguished. Of interest, the jury was not asked to consider \u201cnominal damages.\u201d In an action for malicious conversion of property and punitive damages, we have stated: \u201cAssuming that compensatory damages cannot be proved beyond a nominal sum, the better view appears to be that exemplary damages may nevertheless be awarded in this type of action.\u201d <em>Winkler v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>66 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 29, 168 A.2d 418 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>581, 170 A.2d 544 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">This is the procedural context pertinent to Coastal\u2019s contention. Before the jury was brought into the courtroom to begin the first trial, Coastal\u2019s attorney stated there was \u201cno question\u201d that Mrs. Robbins \u201cdied as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident.\u201d However, he also stated that it \u201chas candidly been admitted by [plaintiffs] counsel\u201d that \u201cthere is not one single item of proof that exists or could be placed before this jury indicating that Mrs. Robbins suffered any conscious pain or endured any suffering at all,\u201d because, during discovery, no post-accident witness \u201chas indicated any consciousness at all by Mrs. Robbins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Over plaintiffs objection, the judge dismissed plaintiffs damage claim \u201cwith respect to the pain and suffering,\u201d because there \u201cneeds to be conscious pain and suffering to be part of the ... damages that goes to the jury.\u201d According to the judge, \u201cthere is nothing in the medical reports or in the observations of doctors, nurses, emergency personnel, or any of those people that would suggest that there was conscious pain and suffering.\u201d For the same reason, the judge, over plaintiffs objection, dismissed plaintiffs damage claim \u201cwith respect to the hedonic damages,\u201d because \u201chedonic damages would have to be based on the victim\u2019s own loss of enjoyment and all those are simply not available.\u201d <em>See Eyoma v. Falco, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 445, 589 A.2d 653 (App.Div. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>As noted, at the end of the first trial, the judge had entered a total judgment of $44,117 against Whitaker and Coastal. The judge also stated in the final judgment of September 5,1996, after the second trial, that \u201call compensatory damages, including funeral and burial expenses, recovered by plaintiff in [the first] trial\u201d were \u201crecovered pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>This was a reallocation of the initial judgment of May 30, 1995, after the first trial, when the judge had \u201cmolded the verdict as to funeral and burial expenses pursuant to the Survivor\u2019s Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-3 to include the sum of $3,939.\u201d Since 1969, funeral and burial expenses are recoverable and properly may be allocated to either the survival action, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-3,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or the wrongful death action, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">At the motion hearing following the first trial, Coastal\u2019s attorney again observed that, at the beginning of the first trial, plaintiffs attorney had \u201ccandidly admitted before this court that he did not have one, single solitary witness who would come in here and say that Mrs. Robbins even for one second survived the accident,\u201d or \u201chad any apprehension or fear or fright ... of an impending death with a crash.\u201d Coastal asserted that there had been a \u201ccandid representation\u201d by plaintiff that \u201cthere was not any evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>he could present on a survivorship claim.\u201d Coastal argued that the \u201cpunitive damages aspect of the case must be dismissed as a matter of law,\u201d because \u201cthere are no punitive damages available under the Wrongful Death Act,\u201d and because \u201cthere has not been one dime, not one single dime recovered under the survivorship action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In response, plaintiff argued that he had \u201cnever relied upon the Wrongful Death Act to establish a claim for punitive damages,\u201d but instead had \u201calways relied upon the Survivor\u2019s Act,\u201d because \u201cpunitive damages would be compensable under the Survivor\u2019s Act.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel asserted that Coastal misunderstood plaintiffs concession at the first trial. Plaintiffs counsel asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArC\">I never said that the survivor\u2019s cause of action was not being pursued. In fact, it was pleaded in every count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">Your Honor, I never conceded at any time that there wasn\u2019t a survivor\u2019s claim. What I conceded was that I couldn\u2019t produce evidence of conscious pain and suffering of the decedent. I never said that there was no daim under 2A:15-3. In fact, legally it stands alone. I disagree with counsel\u2019s assessment that you can\u2019t have punitive damages where no compensatory damages have been awarded [under the Survivor\u2019s Act]. I disagree with that as a matter of law. They can be in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In denying Coastal\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs punitive damage claim, the judge said there was \u201cno question that in this case, at least insofar as the proofs are concerned, the decedent died instantly and there was no proof to the contrary\u201d; that is, \u201cthere simply was- no proof of cognition that she was alive after the impact for any period of time.\u201d He explained that he had also dismissed plaintiffs \u201cpain and suffering claim,\u201d because there was \u201cno proof\u2019 of \u201cconscious pain and suffering,\u201d because Mrs. Robbins \u201cdied instantly ... without any period of suffering.\u201d He explained that he had previously dismissed plaintiffs claim for \u201chedonic damages,\u201d because there was \u201cno question\u201d that Mrs. Robbins \u201cdied instantly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u25a0While the judge considered Coastal\u2019s argument that \u201cthere ... must be at least a dollar\u2019s worth of compensatory [damages]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>recovered under the Suivivor\u2019s Act \u201cto trigger punitive damages,\u201d he rejected this argument because the \u201cpunitive damage issue should have a stand-alone basis in a case such as this.\u201d Judge Forester explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Punitive damages would have been a claim available to Mrs. Robbins had she survived. I believe it should not depend on whether or not she died instantly or whether or not she died after an anguishing death.

I believe that that is not the intent of the Legislature and I don\u2019t believe that that was the intent of the decision in <em>Kern </em>[93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>459, 226 A.2d 186 (Law Div.1967) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">[I]n a ease where survivorship claims are made and not released and not abandoned, I do not believe that by granting the motion to dismiss the pain and suffering aspects of the ease, ... that, therefore, the punitive damages ... under the 2A:15-3 rubric were likewise dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">For example, it is mentioned there [\u201cin the punitive damage charge, 620\u201d] that punitive damages may be awarded for wrongful conduct even if you have decided not to award compensatory damages citing <em>Nappe v.

In <em>Messina, supra, </em>a writ of attachment was issued in favor of the administrator <em>ad prosequendum </em>of deceased, in an action in tort for personal injuries suffered between the time that the tort was committed and death.

Even accepting this as a case of \u201cinstantaneous death\u201d in fact, the intermediate Maryland appellate court affirmed the \u201cjury\u2019s award of punitive damages in the survivorship claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793. The Maryland court in <em>Potomac Electric Power </em>explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">Under the unique circumstances before us, there has been proof of an \u201cactual loss\u201d or a \u201cshowing of compensable injuries\u201d although, aside from the award for funeral expenses, no compensatory damages were awarded in the survivorship action. In arguing that no punitive damages may be awarded, appellant shall not be permitted to rely on the fact that its reckless act instantaneously caused the death of the 15-year-old decedent. Because punitive damages are not recoverable under the wrongful death statute, <em>see Cohen v. Rubin, </em>55 <em>Md.App. </em>83, 101-02, 460 A.2d 1046 (1983), in cases of instantaneous death punitive damages would be precluded under appellant\u2019s theory. Such a result would thwart the policy of punitive damages \u201cto punish the wrongdoer for misconduct and to deter future egregious conduct by others.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v.

To establish a policy rewarding defendants otherwise liable for punitive damages for their expediency in causing an innocent person\u2019s death would be absurd.

I believe it should not depend on whether or not she died instantly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>whether or not she died after an anguishing death. To do so would place the following unusual circumstance that someone who were to do something outrageous and worthy of punitive damages, if the person was killed thereby, and killed instantly, there would be no claim for punitive damages. Whereas if they were less effective in their method and, consequently, the person lingered in the hospital for a year, then punitive damages would apply. I believe that that is not the intent of the Legislature and I don\u2019t believe that that was the intent of the decision in <em>Kern.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The judge may have somewhat over-credited the evidence when he said that, \u201cat least insofar as the proofs are concerned,\u201d there was \u201cno question\u201d that Mrs. Robbins \u201cdied instantly.\u201d Granted, there was \u201cno proof to the contrary,\u201d in that there was \u201cno proof ... that she was alive after the impact for any period of time.\u201d However, giving plaintiff the benefit of the presumption that life continues until the contrary is shown, the judge might have assumed that Mrs. Robbins was alive for a period of time, albeit brief, after the impact between Coastal\u2019s oil truck and her automobile. But in any event, we conclude that plaintiffs survivorship claim for punitive damages was legally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">While the factual underpinnings of the judge\u2019s conclusion may have been somewhat theoretical, we think his legal conclusion was sound: \u201cPunitive damages would have been a claim available to Mrs. Robbins had she survived. I believe it should not depend on whether or not she died instantly or whether or not she died after an anguishing death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">We reject Coastal\u2019s casuistic or metaphysical argument that as a matter of law, plaintiff cannot recover punitive damages under the survival action. Plaintiffs decedent clearly suffered \u201csome injury\u201d and \u201csome harm\u201d from Coastal\u2019s conduct, the predicate for a freestanding award of punitive damages (without compensatory damages) under <em>Nappe v. Anschelewitz, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 51, 54, 477 A.2d 1224. We also cannot overlook the reality that reallocation of the burial and funeral expenses <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to the survivor\u2019s action or even an implied verdict for nominal damages of six cents ($.06) could supply the necessary underlying procedural predicate for the award. \u201cBecause of the fortuitous circumstance that an injured plaintiff failed to prove compensatory damages, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>dant should not be freed of responsibility for aggravated misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 477 A.2d 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Coastal next contends that the punitive damage award in the survival action must be set aside because its alleged conduct \u201cdid not rise to a level required for consideration for imposing punitive damages.\u201d We disagree. Coastal relies heavily upon <em>M.G. v. J.C., </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>470, 603 A.2d 990 (Ch.Div.1991), where the trial judge held that \u201c[t]o warrant a punitive damage award there must be an evil minded act <em>accompanied </em>by a wilful and wanton disregard of the rights of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 603 A.2d 990 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In <em>M.G., </em>the Chancery Division judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">To warrant the punitive damage award there must be an evil minded act <em>accompar nied, </em>by a wilful and wanton disregard of the rights of others. <em>Nappe v.

The 36,000 pound straight-body oil truck was operated by a completely inexperienced and virtually untrained driver, who knew nothing about how to adjust air brakes or how the complex braking system on this oil truck actually worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The truck, a used 1974 Ford, had been purchased by Coastal in October 1989 and Whitaker, an inexperienced oil truck driver, was hired to operate this vehicle. Whitaker had no experience with heavy equipment; he had never operated anything larger than a pick-up truck before employed by Coastal. He never claimed he knew how to drive a large oil truck. Whitaker testified that he knew nothing about adjusting the brakes. The oil truck was equipped with air brakes and Whitaker stated that \u201cafter a while\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>he knew that the brakes needed adjustment. Whitaker said that he had never been given the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. He had no commercial driver\u2019s license nor did he ever obtain the commercial driver\u2019s manual issued by the State of New Jersey. He was never sent to school for any training.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">This oil truck had a front-brake limiting valve which operated to reduce its front braking power on wet surfaces. When activated, it prevented the front brakes from engaging. However, Whitaker knew nothing about that device or how it worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The air brakes on this truck required brake adjustments regularly and systematically. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations mandated regular maintenance. Pre-trip inspections were required. Whitaker stated that he only knew how to step on the brakes to check them. He knew nothing about how to adjust them. Specific pre-trip braking tests were never explained to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Whitaker also said that he was required to fill out driver\u2019s daily logs or pre-trip inspection reports. He said he was required to check off the items he inspected, but he did not know how to check the brakes. The driver\u2019s daily logs revealed that there were a number of problems with this vehicle during the two-week period before the date of Mrs. Robbins\u2019 January 4, 1990 fatal accident with this truck. Whitaker kept noting electrical problems. Fuses kept blowing, and as a result, turn signals, brake lamps and stop lights would malfunction. In addition, a blown fuse would cause the low-brake air-warning buzzer to malfunction. Whitaker testified that he had no knowledge about how to maintain the truck, and on the date of this accident, the manager, John Sorenson, did not check the brakes. Whitaker could not tell whether the brakes were in good working order except by using them.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Whitaker recorded this truck as being in good working order on December 15, 1989. However, there were numerous violations found on that day by Trooper John Herman when the State Police pulled the truck over for inspection. The vehicle was declared out-of-service or \u201credlined\u201d for having no operating low-air warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ing device, no rear brake lamps, no windshield wipers, no emergency marking kit, a broken right vent window, and no legible description of a has/mat warning. The brake lamps and low-air warning device were \u201cout of service conditions.\u201d Trooper Herman testified that he was not aware that Coastal had ever certified that any repairs were completed after December 15, 1989, though required to do so. On December 15, 1989, however, Trooper Herman never actually inspected the brake adjustments. He did, however, testify that repeated usage of air brakes causes them to go out of adjustment and that regular maintenance and adjustments were critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Before the accident, Whitaker had informed management at Coastal\u2019s Vineland, New Jersey facility that there were problems with these brakes. He did not know if the brakes had ever been adjusted, and he stated that the brakes felt \u201cweak\u201d at and before the time of the accident. Again, Whitaker was not trained on what to look for or to do if brakes felt weak and needed adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Between the time of the December 15, 1989 State Police stop and the time of this accident, there is no indication that repairs were made. Rather, evidence suggested Coastal knowingly and deliberately operated the vehicle \u201cout of service\u201d for several weeks. The driver\u2019s daily logs reveal the same electrical problems that caused this vehicle to be declared \u201cout of service\u201d on December 15,1989 continued to exist during the two-week period prior to this accident. The only record of repair was a January 2, 1990 invoice from a company known as \u201cMet\u2019l Worx.\u201d A representative from Met\u2019l Worx testified the repairs were done on January 2, 1990. However, these same problems were found after the January 4, 1990 accident involving Mrs. Robbins. These conditions were outlined by Trooper Manuel Gordillo and Trooper Herman as described in the North American Out-of-Service Criteria. Under North American criteria, a vehicle is deemed unsafe to operate if declared out-of-service. The North American Out-of-Service Criteria indicate that the rear brakes on a vehicle like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>one involved in this accident were required to be within adjustment. One rear brake with an adjustment limit of 2 1/4\u201d renders the vehicle out-of-serviee. At the time of this accident, both rear brakes were at 2 1/4\u201d. Either of the rear brakes would have rendered this vehicle unsafe to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">As Whitaker approached the intersection, before the accident, he testified that his brakes were not working properly. He was going about 35 to 45 m.p.h. At no time before the impact was he able to lock his brakes. He said that he observed Mrs. Robbins\u2019 vehicle traveling northbound after he realized that his brakes did not work. He said he saw Mrs. Robbins\u2019 vehicle perhaps five seconds before impact. In fact, Whitaker testified that he was standing on the brakes in an effort to make the vehicle stop but was unsuccessful. Trooper Mario Terruso testified that Whitaker told him at the scene that he could not stop the vehicle. Whitaker\u2019s truck overtopped Mrs. Robbins\u2019 vehicle and literally tore the engine away from the Lincoln Town Car, causing it to \u201cstretch out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Whitaker was questioned as to whether he knew how to perform a pre-trip inspection of the brakes to make sure they worked properly. He was questioned by reference to the New Jersey Commercial Driver\u2019s Manual testing procedures. He said that he did not know how to perform that test. He also did not know what service criteria rendered the vehicle out-of-service.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In addition to Whitaker\u2019s own statements that he was unable to stop the vehicle, there was testimony from Trooper Manuel Gordillo and two experts produced by the plaintiff, Graham Thompson and John Cheruka, that the rear brakes on this truck were not operational and provided no braking power. Trooper Gordillo testified that a size 30 clamp-type chamber, as on this 1974 Ford, with rear brake adjustments at 2 1/4\u201d will not permit the brakes to hold. He said that you will \u201cnot have any brakes.\u201d Graham Thompson, a mechanical engineer, noted that with the rear brakes at 2 1/4\u201d of adjustment, the rear wheels still were moving with the spring brakes activated. The spring brakes, also known as \u201cmax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>is,\u201d were the emergency brakes designed to lock the rear brakes in the event of an emergency. Thompson said these are on the same system that operate the rear brakes of the vehicle. Thompson said that they were \u201ctotally defective.\u201d Thompson also stated that within a reasonable degree of engineering probability, the stopping power of this truck had been reduced between 92% and 95% at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Plaintiffs safety expert, John Cheruka, testified as to the brakes and indicated that 70% to 80% of the stopping ability of the truck was performed by the rear brakes. He also stated that the rear brakes were \u201cway out of adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Coastal was unable to produce any evidence of regular, systematic adjustments to the brakes as required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations. The only evidence of brake adjustments was nearly two months before this accident. There was no evidence the brakes had ever been adjusted after that date. This was the only maintenance record that Coastal was able to produce with the exception of the January 2 invoice from Met\u2019l Worx which allegedly repaired the non-braking problems which put the vehicle out-of-service on December 15, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Plaintiffs experts also severely criticized the safety program at Coastal. John Cheruka testified that Coastal had \u201cone of the worst maintenance programs [he had] seen.\u201d Coastal failed to notify the Department of Transportation of a fatal accident, failed to file a fatal accident report, and failed to conduct a required investigation as to the cause of the accident. John Cheruka testified that daily inspections of these air brakes were required and he found that this vehicle had been driven with out-of-service violations following the December 15, 1989 stop. Cheruka also testified that Coastal\u2019s own personnel, McCourt and Sorenson, who were responsible for safety, did not even know how to conduct proper daily brake inspections. He found no maintenance program in existence and no record to confirm such a program\u2019s existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Graham Thompson, the mechanical engineer, said that based upon the amount of time the driver described between first seeing Mrs. Robbins\u2019 vehicle and the impact, within a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, the absence of rear braking on the vehicle caused the accident. In contrast, Coastal produced no expert testimony and simply argued that an \u201caccident reconstructionist\u201d was required, notwithstanding Coastal\u2019s stipulation or admission of both negligence and proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Coastal also attempted to elicit evidence through Thompson, plaintiffs expert, that a state trooper from the fatal accident unit, Trooper Lombardo, thought that inattentiveness may have played a role in the accident. Lombardo, however, was not called to testify and he never performed an accident reconstruction. In response to questions, which were allowed over objection with respect to driver inattention and the fact that the brakes on the truck did not lock, Thompson testified that \u201cthe brakes were so inoperative that the vehicle would not even veer to one side or the other.\u201d In addition, Thompson testified that Whitaker was applying his brakes at least 500 feet in front of the intersection and that Whitaker conceded he saw the other vehicle five seconds before impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Coastal tried to adduce testimony that it inspected the vehicle after the accident and found nothing wrong. Coastal attempted to have John Sorenson testify that these brakes were in proper working order at the time of the accident. Sorenson actually could not recall when he had done such an inspection. In fact, Sorenson was confronted with the Met\u2019l Worx invoice that indicated the brakes had been adjusted before the truck was returned to Coastal. Sorenson conceded that he had no way of knowing whether or not he inspected the brakes on the vehicle before or after it came back from Met\u2019l Worx. Sorenson also conceded this truck had various problems with the electrical system and brake warnings, lights, brake lamps, turn signals, and other items which would not function from time to time. The jury was provided with records that showed this vehicle was operated continually for over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>a two-week period with such problems. Plaintiff contended these problems were safety hazards and out-of-service conditions, pursuant to the State Police guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Plaintiff also examined John McCourt, Coastal\u2019s transportation manager, who ultimately was responsible for safety. McCourt\u2019s testimony revealed that Coastal had essentially no maintenance program at the Vineland facility, and there were no record-keeping procedures. McCourt testified that terminal managers such as Bruce Arnold, the Vineland facility manager, did have maintenance experience. However, he conceded that Arnold never received any such training and had no idea how to keep proper maintenance records. Arnold testified he had no maintenance experience because he was a \u201cmarketing person.\u201d McCourt had no knowledge as to fatal accident reporting requirements and had never checked whether or not a fatal accident report was filed. McCourt was not familiar with the North American Outr-ofService Criteria and was unaware of the fact that, if the rear brakes on a size 30 clamp chamber were beyond 2\u201d in adjustment, the vehicle was unsafe to operate. He could not say that John Sorenson had any idea how to do a pre-trip inspection of brakes. As to record-keeping with respect to maintenance, which was required pursuant to federal regulations, McCourt simply said that \u201cwe have never done it.\u201d He admitted that there were no records of any brake adjustments after November 14,1989 and no written policy to ensure that regular and systematic brake adjustments occurred. McCourt testified that no changes were made after the accident and record-keeping procedures had not changed up until the time of trial. McCourt also conceded there were no policies in effect at Coastal to monitor vehicles that had been taken out-of-service by State Police. He stated that he never checked to see if repairs were done to this 1974 Ford after it was taken out-of-service by State Police on December 15, 1989. He confirmed that he had no idea how many miles were being put on this truck and conceded that the odometer on the vehicle was. broken. McCourt did, however, confirm that the brakes should have been adjusted at least every 1,000 miles but he never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>conducted any training sessions with drivers or employees to tell them that. In addition, there was no training program or budget set aside to train drivers with respect to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Code Regulations and no written testing in place. McCourt stated that he was satisfied Whitaker knew how to adjust the brakes to make sure they were working properly and that their safety and record-keeping procedures were sufficient. He said he would be comfortable handling the program today the same as was done back in 1989. McCourt also conceded that he did not even know what the maximum allowable slack adjustment was on this type of vehicle during his 1992 deposition and that he checked on this before testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Coastal also had been asked in discovery to provide post-accident information with respect to out-of-service conditions regarding vehicles. Plaintiff finally was able to retrieve Federal Department of Transportation records showing that between July 22, 1994 and July 21, 1996 nineteen stops of Coastal vehicles took place, and 50% to 55% of them had been taken out of service due to safety violations. Five of the nineteen violations were for out-of-adjustment brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The picture portrayed to the jury of total brake failure on this oil truck, due to lack of attention to maintenance procedures and poor supervision, was sufficient, if believed by the jury, to justify punitive damages. The jury reasonably could have found under this evidence a wilful and wanton disregard of public safety, rising to the level of reckless indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Coastal contends the judge erred by permitting the jury to consider improper financial information in deciding punitive damages. In 1995 Coastal\u2019s assets were valued at about $37.6 million. In 1993 Coastal\u2019s assets were valued at about $351.6 million. This difference primarily was created when Coastal transferred a substantial part of its assets to Coastal Refining and Marketing, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>(Coastal liefining), a separate legal entity, at the end of 1993, purportedly for sound business reasons unrelated to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Coastal contends that the judge erred in allowing the jury to \u201cconsider the prior value ... of defendant Coastal,\u201d because this violated the dictates of <em>Herman v. Sunshine Chem,. Specialties, Inc., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>329, 627 A.2d 1081 (1993), in which the Supreme Court set forth the considerations a jury may undertake in determining an appropriate award of punitive damages. Coastal asserts that its prior value was \u201cno longer an appropriate consideration\u201d in 1996, especially because \u201cat the time of the trial in July of 1996,\u201d Coastal, \u201cwhile still a substantial company having assets of Thirty (30) Million Dollars at the time of trial, did not have the same assets as in 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In <em>Herman, </em>the Supreme Court said the jury, for purposes of awarding punitive damages, could consider \u201cevidence of defendant\u2019s financial condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 627 A.2d 1081. For purposes of punitive damages, \u201cpunishment and deterrence,\u201d the Court concluded that defendant\u2019s \u201cfinancial condition\u201d roughly meant defendant\u2019s \u201cability to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 627 A.2d 1081. Any \u201cindicia\u201d of defendant\u2019s financial condition presumptively could be an \u201cindicator\u201d of defendant\u2019s ability to pay. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 627 A.2d 1081. <em>See generally Leimgruber v. Claridge Assoc., Ltd., </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>450, 456, 458-59, 375 A.2d 652 (1977) (stating that the \u201cwealth of the perpetrator\u201d is among the \u201cconsiderations which normally enter into a punitive damage assessment,\u201d the Court concluded that the amount of punitive damages should vary with the \u201cwrongdoer\u2019s financial circumstances\u201d and \u201cability to pay,\u201d so that \u201cvery wealthy offenders would be charged with higher damages\u201d); <em>Weiss v. Weiss, </em>95 <em>N.J.L. </em>125, 127, 112 <em>A. </em>184 (E. &amp; A.1920) (noting that the \u201cmode of proving the wealth of the defendant\u201d for purposes of punitive damages should \u201crelate to ... his actual pecuniary ability\u201d); <em>Flaacke v. Stratford, </em>72 <em>N.J.L. </em>487, 488, 64 <em>A </em>146 (E. &amp; A.1906) (noting that, \u201con the question of punitive damages,\u201d it is \u201cobviously proper that the wealth of the defendant should be considered, because an award which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>practically bankrupt a poor man would be but light punishment as against a man of considerable wealth\u201d); <em>Belinski v. Goodman, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 357, 354 A.2d 92 (App.Div.1976) (noting that the \u201cactual wealth of a defendant is relevant on a claim of punitive damages\u201d); <em>Gierman v. Toman, </em>77 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 20, 185 A.2d 241 (Law Div.1962) (noting that the \u201cinjured party may establish ... the <em>actual </em>pecuniary ability of the defendant as bearing upon the subject of punitive damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Coastal would confine the evidence of its financial condition to \u201cits assets and net worth at the time of the trial in July of 1996\u201d and would have withheld from the jury information that, \u201cat the end of 1993,\u201d Coastal had transferred about 90% of its assets to Coastal Refining. Under Coastal\u2019s proposal, the jury would have known that \u201cCoastal\u2019s assets at the time of the 1996 trial were approximately 37.6 million dollars,\u201d but would not have known that \u201cCoastal\u2019s assets ... in 1993 were $351,550,000,\u201d or what \u201caccounted for the difference in the size of the corporation\u201d between 1993 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">If Coastal is correct, this implies that a corporate defendant could avoid the imposition of a large punitive damage award simply by transferring the bulk of its assets to a sister or standby corporation before trial, transforming itself from a wealthy defendant with the ability to pay a large punitive damage award into a poorer defendant perhaps without the ability to pay such an award. Coastal\u2019s proposal is not consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s approval in <em>Herman </em>of the use of any helpful or relevant \u201cindicia\u201d or \u201cindicator\u201d of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the punitive damage award. 133 <em>N.J. </em>at 345-46, 627 A.2d 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Coastal also contends that the judge erred in allowing the jury to know the value of a corporation which was not the subject of this litigation, Coastal Refining, a \u201ccompletely separate corporate entity\u201d which was not the \u201ccorporate entity on trial.\u201d Of course, as even Coastal acknowledges, the evidence actually before the jury was that Coastal Refining acquired the assets of Coastal at the end of 1993, which accounted for the difference in the size <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>between 1993, when Coastal had assets of about $351.6 million, and 1996, when Coastal had assets of only about $37.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We are satisfied the issue was handled properly by Judge Forester. He allowed the jury to evaluate the entire financial situation. Moreover, the verdict\u2019s size does not suggest any abuse of the financial information in the circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Coastal claims the punitive damage award of $1.25 million was totally inappropriate or clearly excessive, the result of misunderstanding or passion and prejudice. Coastal stresses that the Legislature \u201crecently passed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.14,\u201d which caps punitive damage awards in most civil actions at \u201c$350,000 or five times compensatory, whichever is the greater amount.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.14(b). \u201cSince the punitive damage award herein was ... not in accordance with [this] recently passed legislation,\u201d Coastal asserts that we \u201cshould vacate the award and at minimum order a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The Punitive Damages Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.9 to -5.17, was enacted on June 29, 1995 and \u201cshall take effect 120 days after enactment and shall apply to causes of action filed on or after the effective date of this act.\u201d <em>L. </em>1995, c. 142, \u00a7 11. Plaintiffs complaint was filed on June 8,1990. The Punitive Damages Act is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Coastal also contends the punitive damage award of $1.25 million is \u201cclearly excessive\u201d because it bears \u201cno reasonable relationship to the compensatory award in this case of $40,178.\u201d Because of this claimed asymmetry, Coastal asserts that we \u201cshould vacate the award and at minimum order a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">In <em>Nappe, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 477 A.2d 1224, the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere some injury, loss, or detriment to the plaintiff has occurred,\u201d punitive damages may be awarded \u201cwhether or not compensatory damages are awarded\u201d <em>(ie., </em>\u201cin the absence of compensatory damages\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 51, 477 A.2d 1224. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Accord Stella, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 69-70, 574 A.2d 468. The Supreme Court \u201cdoes not call for a fixed ratio between compensatory and punitive damages awarded\u201d and instead adheres to the general doctrine that the \u201camount of punitive damages ... awarded must bear some reasonable relation to the injury inflicted and the cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Leimgruber, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 457, 375 A.2d 652. This also is why an \u201cappellate court is always free to determine that the punitive award is excessive, based on factors in addition to the scope of compensatory damage ..., such as the comparative seriousness of the misconduct and the wealth of the malefactor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 375 A.2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Finally, there is no \u201cspecific ratio between compensatory and punitive damages,\u201d because punitive damages are \u201cassessed from the perspective of the defendant rather than of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>M.G., </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 480, 603 A.2d 990. <em>Accord Scott v. Scott, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>601, 615, 649 A.2d 1372 (Ch.Div. 1994). Punitive damages are \u201cnot awarded to compensate a plaintiff, but rather to p\u00fcnish a wrongdoer\u201d; a punitive damage award is the \u201cpunishment ... for the act\u201d of the defendant, \u201cnot the consequences thereof.\u201d <em>Cappiello v. Ragen Precision Indus., Inc., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 532-33, 471 A.2d 432 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Damage awards by a jury, whether compensatory or punitive, \u201cshould be upset for being excessive only in clear cases.\u201d <em>Leimgruber, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 459, 375 A.2d 652. In <em>Allen v. Craig, </em>13 <em>N.J.L. </em>294 (Sup.Ct.1833), the former Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen a jury gives exemplary damages,\u201d a court \u201chas no graduated scale by which to measure them, and its general and safest rule, is not to interfere, unless they are manifestly outrageous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. In <em>Leimgruber, </em>this court had reduced the punitive damage award from $16,500 to $5,000, \u201con the basis of its finding that the trial court\u2019s award was \u2018clearly excessive.\u2019 \u201d 73 <em>N.J. </em>at 453, 375 A.2d 652. The Supreme Court reversed our ruling and reinstated the $16,500 punitive damage award. <em>Id. </em>at 453, 461, 375 A.2d 652. The Supreme Court explained: \u201cAbsent a finding that the quantum of such damages was \u2018manifestly outrageous\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>(Allen v. Craig, </em>supra) it should have refrained ... from disturbing that part of the trial court judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 375 A.2d 652. We do not find the $1.25 million award manifestly outrageous in the circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We find the balance of Coastal\u2019s contentions: (1) denial of motion to bar plaintiffs experts or reject their testimony, (2) denial of Coastal\u2019s recusal motion, and (3) admission in evidence of the Federal Highway Administration Carrier Profile, and the points raised on the cross-appeal, clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-3 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Executors and administrators may have an action for any trespass done to the person or property, real or personal, of their testator or intestate against the trespasser, and recover their damages as their testator or intestate would have had if he was living.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">In those actions based upon the wrongful act, neglect, or default of another, where death resulted from injuries for which the deceased would have had a cause of action if he had lived, the executor or administrator may recover all reasonable funeral and burial expenses in addition to damages accrued during the lifetime of the deceased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-5 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">In every action brought under the provisions of this chapter the jury may give such damages as they shall deem fair and just with reference to the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death, together with the hospital, medical and funeral expenses incurred for the deceased, to the persons entitled to any intestate personal property of the decedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
