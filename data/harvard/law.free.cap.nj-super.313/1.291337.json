The legislative history of the statutes creating each Fund provides little guidance to their intended interaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">Petitioner, Herbert Bashir, was a limousine driver for a company that carried neither workers\u2019 compensation nor automobile liability insurance. He was driving the company\u2019s vehicle when it was involved in a collision with a hit-and-run driver. Bashir filed for benefits from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-120.1. That Fund pays \u201cawards against uninsured defaulting employers who fail to provide compensation to employees or their beneficiaries in accordance with the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation law.\u201d However, under the 1988 amendment to Article 7A, an award is limited to medical expenses and temporary disability. Pain and suffering and permanent disability awards are no longer available from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-120.2b and c, as amended by <em>L. </em>1988, c. 25, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Plaintiff also sought benefits under the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund and reached a tentative settlement with the UCJF in the amount of $9,000 \u201csubject to Board approval and an Eligibility Hearing.\u201d Thereafter, the UCJF declined payment based upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-70(a), which provides for summary disposition of UCJF applications at a hearing where the applicant is required to show, among other things, that \u201c[h]e is not a person covered with respect to such injury or death by any workers\u2019 compensation law....\u201d Plaintiff brought this action to enforce the claimed settlement. The Law Division Judge concluded that despite the very limited scope of Article 7A Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund benefits, petitioner was a \u201cperson ... covered by [a] workers\u2019 compensation law,\u201d and as such is precluded from receiving benefits under the UCJF statute. The judge rejected plaintiffs contention that the reasoning of <em>Licata, v. Lutz, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>255, 225 A.2d 127 (1966), should allow him to recover from the UCJF.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The UCJF was created by statute in 1952. The Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund was created in 1966, the same year <em>Licata, </em>was published. Section 70(a) of the UCJF Law has never been amended, and there is no indication that the Legislature ever considered the application of \u00a7 70(a) to beneficiaries of the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund. Principles of statutory interpretation are not especially helpful in deciding whether the \u201ccovered by\u201d language of \u00a7 70(a) applies to the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund. The Supreme Court opinion in <em>Lienta </em>is the only direct interpretation of that provision, and therefore our best guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">In <em>Licata, </em>the plaintiff employee had signed a waiver of Article 2 workers\u2019 compensation benefits and was therefore permitted to pursue his common law remedies pursuant to Article 1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. The <em>Licata </em>Court held that the UCJF barred employees qualified to receive Article 2 remedies, but not employees entitled to common law remedies permitted by Article 1. The plaintiff here has neither remedy, but only recourse to the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund. The Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Licata, </em>concluding that the Article 1 eligible employee is not barred, is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">The employee who is covered by Article II has a remedy that is readily available and difficult to defeat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">The Article I remedy imposes more burdens upon the employee. The employee who is covered by Article I must be ready to face the rigors of litigation in the law courts. He must allege and prove negligence on the part of his employer, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-1. Even though his injury arose by accident out of and in the course of his employment, he is not guaranteed a recovery. In no sense can an employee covered only by the provisions of Article I be considered \u201ccovered * * * by any workmen\u2019s compensation law\u201d within the meaning of N. J.S.A. 39:6-70(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\"><em>[Licata, supra, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>at 258, 225 A.2d 127 (citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Given the limitations of the remedy afforded by the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund, we conclude that like Licata, plaintiff is not a person \u201ccovered\u201d by any workers\u2019 compensation law \u201cwithin the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-70(a).\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">We recognize that the literal words of the UCJF statute appear to support the motion judge\u2019s ruling. However, \u201c \u2018[t]he surest way to misinterpret a statute or a rule is to follow its literal language without reference to its purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coco Bros., Inc. v. Pierce, </em>741 F.2d 675, 679 (3d Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Viacom Int\u2019l Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, </em>672 F.2d 1034, 1040 (2d Cir.1982)). <em>See also Dodd v. Copeland, </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 486, 240 A2d 444 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>537, 247 A.2d 129 (1968) (\u201cThe literal sense of terminology cannot prevail over the reason and spirit of the expression as a whole.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The purposes of both the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund and the UCJF are similar: to protect persons who suffer injury that should have been compensable by an insuror for the responsible party but for that party\u2019s defalcation. The similarity of purpose\u2014 providing at least some benefits to one who is victimized by another\u2019s failure to obtain statutorily-mandated insurance cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>age \u2014 cannot be overlooked. Of course, there is a concomitantly similar need to protect the public treasury by avoiding duplicate recovery. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. UCJF, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>271, 281, 536 A2d 752 (1988) (\u201cIf there is one definite principle that emerges from our PIP law, policy, and precedent, it is that there shall be no double recovery of PIP benefits.\u201d) <em>See also </em>Senate Labor, Industry and Professions Committee Statement to Assembly, No. <em>1784 </em>\u2014 L. 1988, c. 25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">The bill further provides that the Commissioner of Labor shall conserve and defend the assets of the fund, establish a review procedure for claims made against the fund, hire legal and medical experts to protect the fund, and employ legal counsel to represent the fund and conduct investigations on behalf of the fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The remedial nature of both the UCJF and the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund persuades us, reading the respective enabling Acts in <em>para materia, </em>that the Legislature did not intend that the limited Unemployed Insurer\u2019s Fund benefits deprive an employee such as plaintiff of all UCJF benefits. We recognize that the UCJF was created to provide only \u201csome measure of relief\u2019 to persons who would otherwise be without a remedy because their injuries were caused by uninsured or unidentified drivers. <em>See, e.g., UCJF v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>185, 189, 649 A2d 1243 (1994). We do not read the limited relief implicit in the UCJF statute to bar an injured employee who has a potentially more limited remedy under the later enacted Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">While we must construe the UCJF statute to avoid depletion of the Fund by unqualified claims, a construction that would deprive plaintiff of any award from the UCJF would be contrary to the remedial purposes of the legislation establishing each Fund. To the extent that our decision today is inconsistent with <em>Minardi v. Nocito, </em>66 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 168 A2d 825 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>31, 174 A2d 658 (1961), decided prior to the legislative enactment of the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund, we decline to follow its implied holding that an injured employee whose employer carried no workers\u2019 compensation insurance is ineligible for UCJF benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>We conclude that the purposes of both laws are best served by a narrow reading of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-70(a), and therefore hold that plaintiffs Article 7A right to proceed against the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund does not exclude him from the protection of the UCJF as \u201ca person covered ... by any worker\u2019s compensation law.\u201d We further hold that if plaintiff qualifies for benefits payable from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund under Article 7A of the Workers\u2019 Compensation law, he can still recover from the UCJF, but only to the extent the benefits he would otherwise receive from the UCJF exceed the benefits he receives from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Allowing petitioner to recover from the UCJF, subject to deduction for \u201cany amount which plaintiff has received or can collect from any person <em>for the same injuries and damage,\u201d </em>is consistent with our holding in <em>Shebell v. Strelecki </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>139, 146, 249 A2d 10 (App.Div.1969) (emphasis added). There the injured claimant received $9,000 from the UCJF before he consulted a new attorney and realized that he could possibly recover ordinary workers\u2019 compensation benefits in an Article 2 proceeding. His claim petition was dismissed upon settlement with his employer and its carrier for $24,750. The Fund was permitted to recover its $9,000 payment by authority of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-71, irrespective of the workers\u2019 compensation bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In Bashir\u2019s case, an award from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund cannot cover either permanent disability or pain and suffering. To that extent, we know it will not be \u201cfor the same injuries [or] damage[s].\u201d Our decision is also consistent with <em>Dodd v. Copeland, supra, </em>where we said that the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law and the UCJF \u201cmust be read with reference to each other.\u201d 99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 488, 240 A2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">We reverse and remand for entry of judgment enforcing the $9,000 settlement between plaintiff and the UCJF, reduced by the amount plaintiff has recovered or will recover from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
