He was also convicted of unlawfully possessing a handgun (third degree), possessing hollow nose bullets (fourth degree), and disorderly persons resisting arrest, as well as various motor vehicle statute violations, including careless driving. All charges, criminal and motor vehicle, had been tried to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Defendant also appeals from the sentence for the criminal convictions and the disorderly persons offense, an aggregate eight-year term consisting of concurrent sentences, respectively, of eight years, four years, eighteen months, and six months. Appropriate fines, assessments and fees were also ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\"><em>POINT I </em>THE CONVICTION FOR RESISTING ARREST SHOULD HAVE BEEN MERGED WITH THE CONVICTION FOR ELUDING A POLICE OFFICER.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\"><em>POINT II </em>THE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE COURT IS EXCESSIVE.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\"><em>POINT III </em>THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO INSTRUCT THE JURY ON THE DEFINITION OF INJURY EVEN THOUGH THE RISK OF INJURY WAS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF SECOND DEGREE ELUDING. (NOT RAISED BELOW)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\"><em>POINT IV </em>BECAUSE THE JURY WAS PERMITTED TO INFER THAT DEFENDANT\u2019S CONDUCT CREATED \u201cA RISK OF DEATH OR INJURY\u201d IF IT DETERMINED THAT HIS CONDUCT VIOLATED A MOTOR VEHICLE LAW, AND SUCH RISK IS AN ELEMENT OF SECOND-DEGREE ELUDING, THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT FAILED TO DELIMIT THE UNDERLYING MOTOR VEHICLE OFFENSES. (NOT RAISED BELOW).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-15\"><em>POINT V </em>DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL ON THE SECOND-DEGREE ELUDING CHARGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED BECAUSE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONDUCT DID NOT CREATE A RISK OF DEATH OR INJURY TO ANY PERSON.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>At about 10:45 p.m. on October 15,1994, Paterson police officers Brian DeProspo and Orlando Robinson were on routine patrol in a marked police vehicle. Officer Robinson was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Officer DeProspo testified at trial. In response to a radio dispatch regarding a blue Honda driven by a black male, the officers proceeded to the vicinity of East 23rd Street. While travelling south, they passed a blue Honda proceeding north on East 23rd Street. The officers turned their vehicle around and activated the lights and siren. They attempted to stop the Honda, but it accelerated. It circled the block twice, travelling erratically, in an apparent effort to evade the police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">DeProspo testified that he and his partner pursued the Honda for about a mile, covering about thirteen or fourteen city blocks. During the course of the pursuit, according to the detail of DeProspo\u2019s testimony, the driver of the Honda, later identified as defendant, proceeded through stop signs six times, sometimes slowing down and sometimes not. At one time, he drove on the left of the roadway; at another, he drove the wrong way on a one-way street. The vehicles traveled no faster than 30 miles per hour throughout the chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Eventually, the path of defendant\u2019s vehicle was blocked and he was apprehended. The Honda was stopped at the intersection of Broadway and 23rd Street where, according to DeProspo, defendant \u201cjumps out, leaves the door open and attempts to run.\u201d The police officers left their vehicle and \u201cimmediately grabbed him,\u201d placing him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">During the chase, defendant had thrown an object from his car, which landed in front of a yellow house. After the chase ended, the officers returned to the particular location and recovered a .38 caliber handgun loaded with hollow nose bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In the circumstances established, the conviction for disorderly persons resisting arrest should have been merged with the conviction for second degree eluding. All of the elements of the lesser offense are contained in the greater. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8a(1); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>State v. Johnson, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 134-35, 495 A.2d 1367 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>312, 508 A.2d 195 (1985) <em>(\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8[a(1) ] ... provides that a defendant may not be convicted of two offenses if one is a lesser included offense of the other.\u201d). Moreover, the proofs established no separate crime as a matter of fact. Defendant was arrested immediately upon the conclusion of the vehicular chase as he \u201cattempted\u201d to run from his automobile. The chase was the factual predicate of the eluding conviction. At its conclusion, defendant had no opportunity to engage in any separate resistive conduct and, therefore, cannot be treated as if he had committed an additional, distinct crime apart from second degree eluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Based on similar reasoning, we conclude that the conviction for careless driving should also have been merged with the conviction for second degree eluding. <em>Cf. State v. Dorko, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 56, 688 A.2d 1109 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>28, 695 A.2d 670 (1997) (reckless driving conviction merged into eluding conviction). <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-97 defines the motor vehicle offense as \u201cdriv[ing] a vehicle on a highway <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> carelessly, or without due caution and circumspection, in a manner so as to endanger, or be likely to endanger, a person or property!)]\u201d Manifestly, every significant element of this offense is embodied in second degree eluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">No other issue raised with respect to the sentence has merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). Except for the absence of the necessary mergers, we regard every aspect of the sentences imposed herein to have been well within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. We remand for the entry of an amended judgment of conviction to reflect the required mergers. On remand, the trial court may consider whether the last sentence of the first paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b is a mandatory provision requiring the suspension of defendant\u2019s driving privileges for a period, <em>see State v. Mercadante, </em>299 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>per. </em>522, 528-29, 691 A.2d 819 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>26, 695 A.2d 668 (1997) (\u201cAn illegal sentence is correctable at any time, even after the sentence has begun.\u201d), and whether, in the circumstances, it is appropriate to apply that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The remaining issues defendant raises bear upon his conviction for second degree eluding, and implicate the reasoning in <em>Dorko, supra. </em>In his first argument in this regard, defendant contends that his conviction for second degree eluding must be reversed because the \u201crisk of death or injury to any person\u201d is an essential element of the crime as established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b, and the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the definition of \u201cinjury.\u201d Defendant cites <em>Dorko </em>as authority for the proposition that a conviction for second degree eluding must be reversed when such an instruction was not given. We agree with defendant in his reading of <em>Dorko, </em>but we respectfully disagree with our brethren therein that an instruction defining \u201cinjury\u201d is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">It is clear from the very terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b that the Legislature intended to include within the ambit of conduct constituting second degree eluding the operation of a motor vehicle or vessel, during flight from the police, in such a manner as to create a risk of death or any kind of injury to any person. The statutory phrase \u201cinjury to any person\u201d is clear and all-inclusive. If there were any reason to discern that the Legislature intended to include some types of risked injury as elements of second degree eluding and exclude others it would, of course, be necessary for a jury to be clearly instructed as to which types were covered and which were not. But with injury risks of all types included, there is no more need to define the term \u201cinjury\u201d than there is to define the term \u201cdeath\u201d in this context. <em>See State v. Warlock, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>596, 612-13, 569 A.2d 1314 (1990) (No merit in argument that court failed to define \u201cwrong\u201d for jury: \u201can instruction is necessary only if the distinction [between legal wrong and moral wrong] is critical to the facts on which a ... defense\u201d or an element of the crime is based.); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 264-65, 706 A.2d 1160 (App.Div.1998) (Response to jury request for a defin\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tion of \u201csafe place\" as used in kidnapping statute was proper, where the supplemental instruction stated it was \u201ca factual determination for the jury to make.\u201d); <em>State v. Scher, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 270-71, 650 <em>A.2d </em>1012 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>276, 658 A.2d 299 (1995) (Conviction for reckless manslaughter upheld where jury was told to rely on its \u201cgood common sense\u201d and its \u201cunderstanding of the English language\u201d concerning the term \u201ccasual drinking\u201d as a factor in determining whether defendant\u2019s conduct was reckless); <em>State v. McClary, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 229, 599 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>6, 611 <em>A.2d </em>646 (1992) (Not necessary to define the word \u201cforce\u201d in jury charge on robbery); <em>State v. Rombolo, </em>91 <em>N.J.L. </em>560, 563, 103 A. 203 (E. &amp; A.1918) (\u201c[A] trial judge ... is not required to give the jury definitions or synonyms of common English words used in a statute in their ordinary meaning.\u201d). <em>See also State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>326, 385, 700 A.2d 306 (1997) (It was error in penalty phase of trial of capital offense not to define the term \u201cpurpose,\u201d an element distinguishing one aggravating factor from another since \u201ccourts must define terms for the jury\u201d even though \u201ccommonsensical\u201d where they are central to any essential, discriminating finding a jury is required to make.); <em>State v. Alexander, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>563, 571-73, 643 A.2d 996 (1994) (Court must explain even statutory terms with common, well-understood meanings, such as \u201cleader,\u201d or \u201cdrug kingpin,\u201d when their \u201cintended scope of application\u201d is in question and when \u201cclarification is essential to ensure that the jury will fully understand and actually find those elements in determining ... guilt.\u201d); <em>State v. Kimbrough, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 64, 262 A.2d 232 (App.Div.1970) (Where, in a prosecution for receiving a stolen automobile, defendants alleged they were passengers in the car, the court erred in failing to instruct on the qualities of and distinctions between \u201cactual physical possession\u201d and \u201cconstructive possession\u201d to assist the jury in applying \u201cthe statutory inference of guilty knowledge.\u201d) Accordingly, we conclude that there was no error in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury in this regard, which did not define \u201cinjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Defendant\u2019s next argument based on <em>Dorko </em>concerns the \u201cpermissive inference\u201d established in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b \u201cthat the flight or attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury to any person\u201d if the conduct alleged \u201cinvolves a [motor vehicle] violation.\u201d The premise of defendant\u2019s argument in this regard, that the trial court \u201cfailed to delimit the underlying motor vehicle offenses,\u201d is not supported by the record. That omission was a fundamental flaw in the trial in <em>Dorko, </em>but this case is free of any such defect. Here, unlike in <em>Dorko, </em>the motor vehicle violations were before the jury for determination as well as the criminal charges, and the trial judge carefully charged the elements of each alleged motor vehicle offense which, in addition to being found by the jury, might also lead to the \u201cpermissive inference\u201d established in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In a related vein, defendant\u2019s last argument based on <em>Dorko </em>is that there was no proof of any person in the vicinity of the chase endangered by defendant\u2019s conduct. As observed in <em>Dorko:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">If the statutory inference cannot be made, then the State would be required to prove affirmatively that there was at least one person put at risk within the zone of danger created by defendant\u2019s conduct, because the statute clearly requires that defendant be shown to have \u201ccreate[d] a risk of death or injury to any person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-2b. The statutory inference is provided to avoid the necessity for such proof, but, as noted, the court must give the jury proper guidance to invoke the inference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\"><em>[Dorko, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 60-61, 688 A.2d 1109.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Although we also disagree with the underlying premise of this observation, we have concluded that the jury in this trial was properly guided in all respects given a predicate in the proofs for application of the statutory inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Further, by way of factual distinction between this case and <em>Dorko, </em>we note the observation in <em>Dorko </em>concerning the circumstances therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">We cannot read into the statute hypothetical persons who might have been in the area. We thus draw a distinction between a ease where a defendant runs stop signs and red lights and speeds, all through a heavily-traveled area, thus clearly fulfilling the element of the statute of putting persons in danger, and a case (as here) where a defendant commits the same offenses at 3:00 a.m. on deserted streets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 61, 688 A.2d 1109.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">It seems rather obvious that a motor vehicle pursuit through the city streets of Paterson in a residential/commercial area at 10:45 p.m. creates a risk of death or injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The conviction under appeal is affirmed. The matter is remanded for resentencing to reflect the required mergers. In all other respects the sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> Defined in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:1-1 to include every public roadway used for vehicular travel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
