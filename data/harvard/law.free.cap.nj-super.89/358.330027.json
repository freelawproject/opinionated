Schwartz, </em>Deputy Attorney General, argued the cause for the plaintiff <em>(Mr. Arthur J. Sills, </em>Attorney General of New Jersey, attorney).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-5\">No appearance for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b377-7\">Gaulkin, S. J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Arh\">In an opinion reported in 85 <em>N. J. Super. 22 (Cty. D. Ct. </em>1964) the trial court ruled that defendant Armstrong had not violated <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:3-1 <em>et seq. </em>relating to the licensing of architects, and plaintiff board appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Defendant, who is not a licensed architect, drew the plans for a combination dwelling, cocktail lounge and tavern which he thereafter erected. The dwelling portion, consisting of a bedroom, living room, kitchen and bath, is occupied by defendant and his wife. The tavern and cocktail lounge is operated by them and consists of a dining room seating about 120, a barroom seating about 20, and a kitchen and auxiliary rooms. The entire building is about 40' x 80/.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:3\u201410 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">\u201cAny person who shall pursue the practice of architecture in this State, or shall engage in this State in the business of preparing plans, specifications and preliminary data for the erection or alteration of any building * * * without a certificate * * * to practice architecture * * shall be liable to a penalty of not less than $200.00, nor more than $500.00 for the first offense * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">Any single act or transaction shall constitute engaging in business or the practice of architecture within the meaning of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-13\">Nothing herein contained shall prohibit * * * any person in this State from acting as designer of any building that is to be constructed by himself for his own occupancy or occupancy by a member or members of his immediate family * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">See generally Annotation <em>What amounts to architectural or engineering services within license requirements,\u201d </em>82 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1013 (1962); Annotation <em>\u201cSingle or isolated transactions as falling within provisions of commercial or occupational licensing requirement \u201d </em>93 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>90 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The trial court held that \u201cThe statutory exception contemplates possession by the designer for whatever lawful purpose he may choose.\u201d It held, in effect, that it was not even necessary for Armstrong to live in the premises, so long as he intended, when he designed the building, that he or some member of his immediate family was to operate the tavern and cocktail lounge. That would be equally true if the building were a supermarket, a department store or a theatre, no matter how large, so long as defendant or some member of his immediate family operated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">It seems to us that a major purpose of this statute is to protect the safety of the public. The construction placed upon it by the trial court would go a long way toward depriving the statute of that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u201cAlthough, generally speaking, penal statutes are to be strictly construed, <em>State v. Meinken, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>348 (1952), the rule of strict construction does not mean that the manifestations of the Legislature\u2019s intention should be disregarded.\u201d Sta<em>te v. Edwards, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>292, 298 (1958). See also <em>State v. Congdon, </em>76 <em>N. J. Super. </em>493, 500 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962); 2 <em>Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (3d ed. Horack </em>1943), \u00a7\u00a7 4501-4510. \u201cA statute will not be construed so as to reach an absurd or anomalous result.\u201d <em>Robson v. Rodriquez, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>517, 528 (1958); <em>La Polla v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>71 <em>N. J. Super. </em>264, 275 <em>(Law Div. </em>1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">It is true that the statute is poorly drawn, and that a literal reading of it might support the appealed construction. However, it is a commonplace that often the surest way to misconstrue a statute is to read it literally. That, we think, would be the result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">If the Legislature intended that construction, why the reference to \u201coccupancy by a member or members of his immediate family\u201d? Such language usually is used, as, for example, in insurance policies, to mean buildings totally or at least mainly so inhabited, and we think it obvious that that was what the Legislature meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Most similar licensing statutes throughout the country make the exception inapplicable to \u201cbuildings intended for the mass assemblage of people,\u201d <em>Ala. Code tit. </em>46, c. 2, \u00a7 9; <em>Fla. Stat., </em>\u00a7 467.09; <em>Ga. Code, </em>\u00a7 84-321; <em>cf. Ark. Stat., tit. </em>71, c. 3, \u00a7 302, <em>La. Rev. Stat., tit. </em>37, \u00a7 160; or limit the exception to buildings \u201cnot for sale, rental or use by the public,\u201d <em>Ariz. Rev. Stat., </em>\u00a7 32-144; <em>Ill. Ann. Stat., c. </em>10\u00bd, \u00a7 4; or to buildings \u201cintended solely for private use,\u201d <em>Colo. Rev. Stat., </em>\u00a7 10-1-17, or otherwise make it clear that the exception applies only when the designer risks only himself and his family. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:3\u201410 does not make that clear, but the purpose to protect the public is so obvious, and opening the door in the fashion sought by defendant would load to such emasculating and absurd results, that we have no doubt that the intent of the Legislature was as we have stated, and that the words of the statute are sufficient to express that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the case is remanded to the county district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
