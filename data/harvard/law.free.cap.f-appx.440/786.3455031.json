Moses argues that the district court should have excluded from its calculation of loss the amount of a fraudulent loan for which Roland Lane Jr. applied. Moses also argues that his sentence for violating his supervised release is procedurally unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">The district court did not clearly err by including in Moses\u2019s amount of loss the fraudulent loan for which Lane applied. Moses \u201caided\u201d or \u201cabetted\u201d Lane in applying for the fraudulent loan \u201cduring the commission of [Moses\u2019s] offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). Moses allowed Lane to use in his loan application false information about his employment with Moses\u2019s shell corporation, Atlanta Construction Group, and Moses verified that false information about Lane\u2019s purported employment when queried by the lender. Officer Jan Moses examined loan applications filed by Moses and determined that he had used the same false information to apply for at least two loans and to obtain at least one loan and 13 lines of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Moses\u2019s sentence for violating his supervised release is procedurally reasonable. The district court considered the sentencing factors and found that Moses\u2019s conduct was \u201cvery serious,\u201d his actions \u201cshow[ed] no willingness and no inclination to ever change,\u201d that his \u201cschemes\u201d posed a \u201cdanger to our economic system and to those who rely on the person\u2019s honesty,\u201d and \u201cthe only way to protect people is to keep [him] in jail longer.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Moses complains that the district court did not address the need to provide educational or vocational training or to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4), (a)(6), but \u201c[t]he district court need not state on the record that it has explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor,\u201d <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007). The district court provided a sufficient explanation for its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">We AFFIRM Moses\u2019s sentences.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
