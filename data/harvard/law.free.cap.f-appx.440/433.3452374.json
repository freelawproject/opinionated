The district court found no dispute concerning the government\u2019s status as holder of a valid mortgage or the amount of payment in default. On appeal, defendants argue that the disputed ownership of improvements to the property and the subsequent transfer of portions of the land render summary judgment improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-24\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. Morris v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, </em>457 F.3d 460, 464 (5th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-25\">Defendants fail to raise any genuine dispute of material fact. First, the alleged ownership of improvements on the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>gaged property is irrelevant to the government\u2019s in rem suit because any such owners would retain their property rights until ninety days after a written demand for removal. <em>See </em>La. Civ.Code 493 (2003). Second, Louisiana law allows a foreclosing mortgage creditor to ignore any post-recording transfers or encumbrances of the mortgaged property. <em>See Dibert v. Marrero, </em>117 F.3d 160, 175 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, the district court properly granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
