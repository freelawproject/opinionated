The IJ and BIA determined that Zhou was not credible and denied relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we deny Zhou\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\u201cWe review the decision of the [BIA], and we review the decision of the [IJ] to the extent that the [BIA] expressly adopted the opinion of the [IJ].\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Because the BIA issued its own opinion upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009). We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>but we review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, for substantial evidence to support them. <em>Id.; Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">\u201cOur review for substantial evidence is highly deferential.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. We must \u201caffirm the [BIA\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). In making that determination, \u201c[w]e view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision, and we will reverse the agency\u2019s finding only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">In this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Zhou was not credible. Zhou offered inconsistent testimony at his removal hearing. For example, on direct examination he testified that his wife was forced to undergo sterilization on July 10, 1997 because she had a child before their marriage was registered. Zhou stated that the Chinese government first learned about the birth of their child when they registered their marriage on November 10, 1997 \u2014 four months <em>after </em>his wife\u2019s sterilization took place. On redirect examination, however, Zhou testified that some time before his wife\u2019s sterilization a neighbor informed the Chinese government about his child\u2019s birth. Zhou\u2019s testimony at his removal hearing was also inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tent with statements in his asylum application. Zhou testified that he was unaware of China\u2019s age and registration requirements for marriage. However, Zhou indicated in his asylum application that he registered his marriage \u201conce [he and his wife] reached the marriage age.\u201d An adverse credibility determination may be based on \u201cthe inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements ..., [and] the consistency of each such statement.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). After review of the evidence, we conclude that the record does not compel us to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny Zhou\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">. Zhou did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief in his notice of appeal or brief before the BIA. The BIA, however, addressed the issue <em>sua sponte. </em>Nevertheless, we lack jurisdiction to consider Zhou\u2019s present challenge because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies on the claim. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that we lack jurisdiction to consider a claim that an applicant did not raise before the BIA, even if the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>addresses the claim, because the applicant did not exhaust his administrative remedies). Accordingly, we dismiss Zhou\u2019s petition to the extent that it raises a claim for CAT relief. Zhou has also abandoned his claim for withholding of removal under the INA by failing to offer argument on the claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AW_P\">. In his brief, Zhou also challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that, even if credible, Zhou is not eligible for asylum. We decline to address that issue because the BIA did not review it. <em>See Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (stating that this Court reviews only the BIA\u2019s finding and conclusions except those expressly adopted from the IJ's order).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
