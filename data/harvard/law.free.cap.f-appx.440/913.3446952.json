After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">On appeal, Santacruz argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on his 1993 conviction for armed burglary of a dwelling. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) (providing for a twenty-year maximum imprisonment sentence if defendant\u2019s initial deportation was subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (providing for a 16-level increase in the offense level if defendant was deported after a felony conviction for a crime of violence). Santacruz contends the district court could not rely on this prior conviction because it was not charged in his indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">Santacruz\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We repeatedly have explained that, even after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we are bound by <em>Al-mendarez-Toms </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-19\">In any event, at sentencing, the district court did not resolve any factual dispute as to the existence or nature of this prior conviction. Santacruz did not object to the factual statement in his Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that he had a 1993 Florida conviction for armed burglary of a dwelling. Nor did he argue that his armed burglary of a dwelling conviction was not an aggravated felony or a crime of violence. Thus, Santacruz admitted the existence and nature of his prior conviction for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that there is no statutory <em>Booker </em>error if the defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on facts in the PSI to which the defendant did not object at sentencing).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>For these reasons, the district court did not err in using Santacruz\u2019s prior armed burglary of a dwelling to determine Santa-cruz\u2019s statutory maximum sentence and advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a defendant\u2019s preserved Sixth Amendment claim. <em>See United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1304-06 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-14\">. At sentencing Santacruz, citing <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), objected to the PSI\u2019s use of a booking sheet to describe the underlying circumstances of his prior armed burglary conviction and asked that this portion of the PSI be removed. The district court responded, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was relying primarily on the judgment of conviction and not the additional information in the PSI. On appeal, Santacruz does not raise his <em>Shepard </em>argument, and thus abandons it. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
