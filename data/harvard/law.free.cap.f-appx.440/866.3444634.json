On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the district court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Foreign Sovereignties Immunity Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court was correct in its finding that none of the FSIA exceptions apply to Plaintiffs claims and that the FSIA is the sole source of jurisdiction for claims between foreign citizens and foreign sovereignties. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The FSIA entitles foreign states immunity from the jurisdiction of United States courts unless a statutory exception applies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604; <em>Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, </em>507 U.S. 349, 351, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 1474, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993). The act defines \u201cforeign states\u201d to include agencies and instru-mentalities of such states. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a). It is the sole source of jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts. <em>Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., </em>488 U.S. 428, 435-38, 109 S.Ct. 683, 688-90, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). Venezuela is a foreign state and Plaintiffs concede that Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\u201cPDVSA\u201d), is an \u201cagency or instrumental<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>ity\u201d of Venezuela, and therefore a \u201cforeign state\u201d within the meaning of the FSIA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a), (b). Thus, both are entitled to immunity unless one of the FSIA\u2019s statutory exceptions applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the court has jurisdiction because two statutory exceptions to the FSIA \u2014 the commercial activity exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2), the terrorism exception, \u00a7 28 U.S.C. 1605A \u2014 apply. The commercial activities exception of the FSIA does not apply, both because the actions complained of are not commercial in nature and because they do not have a direct effect on the United States. The terrorism exception does not apply because none of its requirements are met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Courts have jurisdiction over a foreign state and its agencies or instrumen-talities if the cause of action is \u201cbased ... upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2). Plaintiffs\u2019 underlying claims are for false imprisonment and forced labor \u2014 activities related to the exercise of police powers \u2014 and are not commercial in nature. <em>See Nelson, </em>507 U.S. at 361-62, 113 S.Ct. at 1479-80 (\u201cThe conduct boils down to abuse of the power of its police by the Saudi Government, and however monstrous such abuse undoubtedly may be, a foreign state\u2019s exercise of the power of its police has long been understood for purposes of the restrictive theory as peculiarly sovereign in nature. Exercise of the powers of police and penal officers is not the sort of action by which private parties can engage in commerce.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Additionally, the acts alleged here have no direct effect in the United States. A direct effect within the meaning of the FSIA is one that follows \u201cas an immediate consequence of the defendant\u2019s ... activity.\u201d <em>Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 607, 618, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 2168, 119 L.Ed.2d 394 (1992) (quotations and citation omitted). Plaintiffs claim there is a direct effect on the United States because the work of the Cuban medical professionals creates an inflow of oil and money to Cuba, which is in turn used to finance an army that is a direct threat to the United States. They also argue that any actions of PDVSA have an effect on the United States because they sell petroleum here and because American consumers pay a higher price for gas as a result of the agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. None of these allegations plead the type of direct effect on the United States required by \u00a7 1605(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">It is not clear whether Plaintiffs intend to appeal the ruling that the terrorism exception of the FSIA was not met, because they make only passing mention of it in their brief on appeal. However, even if this claim is raised on appeal, it is unpersuasive. The district court was correct in its conclusion that \u201c[njone of the requirements of the terrorism exception\u201d pertain. Section 1605A applies only to claims for \u201cpersonal injury or death\u201d arising from acts of \u201ctorture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act\u201d perpetrated by agents of a foreign state. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(l). Plaintiffs do not assert any \u201cpersonal injury or death\u201d claims. Furthermore, even if plaintiffs\u2019 claim fell within \u00a7 1605A, the district court correctly found that three of 1605\u2019s additional requirements were not met: (1) the foreign state must have been designated a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d when the predicate act occurred, 28 U.S.C. 1605A(a)(2)(A)(i)(I); (2) the claimant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>victim must, at the time the predicate act occurred, have been a citizen, soldier, or employee of the United States, 28 U.S.C. 1605A(a)(2)(ii); and (3) the claimant must have afforded the foreign state a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate before bringing suit, 28 U.S.C. 1605A(a)(2)(iii). The district court was correct in finding that none of these requirements was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The district court was correct in its determination that no statutory exception to the FSIA is applicable and that, therefore, our courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. Plaintiffs also argue that the court has jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Claims Act (\u201cATCA\u201d), the laws of the state of Florida, the laws of both Venezuela and Cuba, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. Because the FSIA is the sole source of jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts, we need not address these other arguments. <em>See Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., </em>488 U.S. 428, 435-38, 109 S.Ct. 683, 688-90, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). Further, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the argument that the ATCA provides a basis for jurisdiction over a foreign state. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs raise additional arguments in their brief that are, at their core, additional arguments that jurisdiction existed. Because we conclude that no FSIA statutory exception is met, we need not address those arguments either.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
