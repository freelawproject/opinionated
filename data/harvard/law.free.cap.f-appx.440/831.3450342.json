On appeal, Crosby asserts that his Rule 59 motion was timely, but his argument only addresses the merits of the motion. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the denial of Crosby\u2019s Rule 59 motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">The Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) filed a complaint under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a), and the Credit Repair Organizations Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679 <em>et seq., </em>against RCA Credit Services, LLC; Crosby, individually and as an officer or manager of RCA; and Brady Wellington, individually and as an officer or manager of RCA. The district court ultimately entered a final amended judgment and permanent injunction against Crosby on all counts of the complaint on October 15, 2010. Crosby filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>motion for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 on November 16, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The district court denied the motion as untimely. The court found that to comply with Rule 59\u2019s time limits, Crosby would have had to file his motion by November 12, 2010, and under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b)(2), the court could not extend Rule 59\u2019s 28-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Crosby filed a notice of appeal on January 3, 2011, indicating that he was appealing both the judgment and the denial of his Rule 59 motion. We <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Crosby\u2019s appeal of the amended final judgment and permanent injunction because the notice of appeal was untimely as to the judgment. We allowed Crosby\u2019s appeal of the denial of his Rule 59 motion to proceed because he timely appealed the denial of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Mays v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>122 F.3d 43, 46 (11th Cir.1997). Applying an incorrect legal standard or incorrectly applying the law is an abuse of discretion. <em>Klay v. Humana, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 1241, 1251 (11th Cir.2004). A motion for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment \u201cmust be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(b), (e). A district court \u201cmust not extend the time\u201d to file a Rule 59 motion. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crosby\u2019s Rule 59 motion as untimely. The final judgment in this case was entered October 15, 2010. Under Rule 59(b), (e), Crosby had to file a motion for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment by November 12, 2010 \u2014 that is, 28 days after the entry of the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(b), (e). Crosby filed his Rule 59 motion four days after this deadline, on November 16, 2010. The district court applied the correct legal standards to determine that Crosby\u2019s motion was untimely and to determine that it could not extend the deadline under Rule 6(b)(2). <em>See Klay, </em>382 F.3d at 1251; Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(b)(2). Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crosby\u2019s Rule 59 motion as untimely, and we do not address the merits of Crosby\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the denial of Crosby\u2019s Rule 59 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
