Scott argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by failing to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>mental demands of her past relevant work. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We review the agency\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence is \u201cless than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). We may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">When determining a claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits, an ALJ must consider whether the claimant: (1) is performing substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe impairment; (3) has a severe impairment that meets or equals an impairment specifically listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1; (4) can perform her past relevant work; and (5) based on her age, education, and work experience, can perform other work of the sort found in the national economy. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. \u201cAt the fourth step, the ALJ must assess: (1) the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u2018RFC\u2019); and (2) the claimant\u2019s ability to return to her past relevant work.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1238 (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv)). Residual functional capacity is the claimant\u2019s remaining ability to work despite her impairments. <em>See Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cIf the claimant can return to her past relevant work, the ALJ will conclude that the claimant is not disabled.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Under this court\u2019s interpretation of the regulations, the claimant bears the burden to prove that she is unable to \u201cperform h[er] past <em>kind </em>of work, not that [s]he merely be unable to perform a specific job [s]he held in the past.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Bowen, </em>801 F.2d 1291, 1293 (11th Cir.1986) (emphasis added) (holding that while claimant was unable to perform his previous job as a link belt operator at a pipe manufacturing facility, which required him to climb and descend stairs, he did not establish that he was unable to perform his \u201cpast relevant work\u201d because he failed to show that working as a link belt operator in other settings would also require him to climb and descend stairs).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Scott\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the ALJ erred by denying her claim for relief without considering the mental demands of her past work as a teacher\u2019s aide. We conclude that the ALJ properly considered Scott\u2019s residual functional capacity and her ability to return to her past relevant work in assessing her eligibility for benefits. Scott\u2019s primary impairments include depression, degenerative joint and disc disease, fibromyalgia, as well as chronic pain in the neck, lower back, hands and feet. The ALJ reported that Scott\u2019s residual functional capacity is only \u201cslightly limited\u201d as a result of her physical impairments. Specifically, the ALJ found that in light of Scott\u2019s treatment records she has the residual functional capacity to perform \u201clight work,\u201d as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b). Under \u00a7 404.1567(b), light work \u201cinvolves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds.\u201d Further, \u201clight work\u201d jobs generally \u201crequire! ] a good deal of walking or standing, or ... involve!] sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b). The ALJ noted that Scott\u2019s past relevant work involved serving as a teacher\u2019s aide, which is categorized as \u201clight work\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d). The DOT\u2019S description of the tasks that a teacher\u2019s aide typically performs matches Scott\u2019s own account of the tasks she completed while working as a teacher\u2019s aide. These tasks include grading papers, developing lesson plans, and assisting teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Scott argues that when the ALJ concluded that she could perform her past work, the ALJ failed to take into account the fact that the students with whom she worked as a teacher\u2019s aide were \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d towards her. The claimant, however, bears the burden to prove that she is unable to perform her past relevant work as that job is performed in the general economy, not merely as it is performed in the specific circumstances in which the claimant worked in the past. <em>See Jackson, </em>801 F.2d at 1293-94. Scott does not argue that she is unable to work as a teacher\u2019s aide as that job is generally performed and has therefore waived that argument. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1578 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (explaining that issues not argued on the merits in the parties\u2019 briefs are waived); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5). Further, an ALJ may rely on information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles to determine whether a claimant can perform her past relevant work as it is generally performed in the national economy. <em>See Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1230 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that while the DOT is not dis-positive, the ALJ may \u201ctake administrative notice of reliable job information available from various governmental and other publications, such as the DOT\u201d); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(b)(2) (explaining that the Social Security Administration \u201cmay use ... resources, such as the Dictionary of Occupational Titles ... published by the Department of Labor, to obtain evidence ... to help ... determine whether you can do your past relevant work, given your residual functional capacity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Scott is able to work as a teacher\u2019s aide. The DOT indicates that working as a teacher\u2019s aide requires only light exertion. <em>See </em>DOT Listing No. 099.327-010, <em>available at </em>DICOT \u00a7 099.327-010. In addition, the ALJ found that Scott\u2019s RFC allows for light exertion. The ALJ reported that none of Scott\u2019s treating or examining physicians placed limitations on her ability to function or precluded Scott from work activity. Substantial evidence thus supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Scott could perform her past relevant work as a teacher\u2019s aide.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
