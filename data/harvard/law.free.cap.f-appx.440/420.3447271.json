In his petition, Mathe-son asserted that he was actually innocent of the conspiracy, that the evidence was insufficient to establish a conspiracy, that the search warrant in his case was based on false information, and that the prosecutor had knowingly used fabricated evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">As the district court determined, Matheson can proceed via \u00a7 2241 only if he shows that relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is inadequate, which in turn requires him to demonstrate under the savings clause that his claim (i) is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which established that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in his trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Although he conclusionally states that he relies on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court case, Matheson does not cite any Supreme Court decision which is retroactively applicable and which establishes that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense, nor does he show that the claims were \u201cforeclosed\u201d by the Eleventh Circuit at the time of his trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that Matheson contends that the actual innocence and miscarriage of justice standards provide an exception to the requirement that a petitioner must qualify under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 to challenge his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition, the claim fails as we have consistently held that federal habeas law does not recognize a freestanding actual innocence claim. <em>See Foster v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 367-68 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
