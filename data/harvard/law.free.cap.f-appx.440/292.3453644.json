He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We review the district court\u2019s ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">Based on our analysis pursuant to <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), we conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Maillet\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea: Maillet has not asserted that he is actually innocent of the charge of producing child pornography; Maillet\u2019s motion was not promptly filed; the record supports the conclusion that Maillet received close assistance of counsel and, additionally, that his plea was knowing and voluntary; and, as Maillet failed to demonstrate a fair and just reason for withdrawal of his plea, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B), resetting the case for trial would have unnecessarily inconvenienced the district court and wasted judicial resources. Although withdrawal of the plea would not have prejudiced the Government, the absence of such as showing, alone, is insufficient to mandate permission to withdraw a plea where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>as here, a credible reason has not been proffered. <em>See Carr, </em>740 F.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Maillet additionally argues that his conviction exceeds Congress\u2019s power to legislate under the Commerce Clause. Maillet\u2019s constitutional challenge to the statute of conviction, however, is barred by his knowing and voluntary appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
