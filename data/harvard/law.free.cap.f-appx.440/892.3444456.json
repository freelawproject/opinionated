Solis-Caceres contends the district court abused its discretion both by denying his motion to compel and by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on his claims. He asserts the Government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion on his behalf violated his equal protection rights because it has filed Rule 35(b) motions in similar circumstances for others. After review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">After sentencing, a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the government moves for such a reduction based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). Generally, the government has the power, but not the duty, to file such a motion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (analyzing substantial assistance motions under \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)); <em>see also United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.2008) (applying <em>Wade </em>to Rule 35(b) motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Where the filing of a Rule 35(b) motion is discretionary, \u201cfederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. \u201c[J]udicial review is appropriate only when there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasis in original) (quotations omitted). A defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing simply because he \u201cclaims to have provided substantial assistance or ... makes only generalized allegations of an improper motive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">The Government did not promise to file a Rule 35(b) motion. The plea agreement stated the Government would \u201cconsider\u201d filing a motion and that the power to make such a determination \u201crests solely with the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida.\u201d At Solis-Ca-ceres\u2019s plea colloquy, the magistrate judge expressly stated that \u201call that the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ment is agreeing to do is consider filing the motion,\u201d and \u201c[tlhe/re not promising that they will file the motion.\u201d Solis-Ca-ceres stated that he understood. Because the Government\u2019s filing of a Rule 35(b) motion was discretionary, the district court could review the Government\u2019s refusal to file only if Solis-Caceres alleged an unconstitutional motive for the refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Construing his arguments liberally, Solis-Caceres claims his equal protection rights were violated because some prisoners received Rule 35(b) motions, but he was denied such a motion because the Government was vindictive, and sought to punish him for filing his requests for medical examinations and \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. However, Wade\u2019s examples of unconstitutional motives concern protected characteristics and Solis-Caceres has not shown the Government\u2019s alleged retaliatory motive stems from a similarly arbitrary classification. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840 (stating unconstitutional motives would include a failure to file because of defendant\u2019s race or religion). Even if, assuming <em>arguendo, </em>Solis-Caceres has presented an unconstitutional motive sufficient to support review, he has put forth no evidence the Government actually possessed or acted under this vindictive motive. As such, he has failed to provide a \u201csubstantial showing,\u201d precluding the district court from reviewing the Government\u2019s decision not to file a Rule 35(b) motion. <em>See Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d at 961. As such, the district court did not err in denying the motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to conduct evidentiary hearings. <em>See United States v. Winfield, </em>960 F.2d 970, 972 (11th Cir.1992) (reviewing a district court\u2019s decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion). There was no substantial showing of an unconstitutional motive, and thus Solis-Caceres was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d at 961. Therefore, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
