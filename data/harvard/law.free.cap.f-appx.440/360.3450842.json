At sentencing, Mares-Calderon\u2019s offense level was increased by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) because, prior to his deportation in 2006, Mares-Calderon was convicted in Texas in 1996 of possession of marijuana and in 1999 of possession of a controlled substance. The district court regarded Mares-Calderon\u2019s second conviction as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(4S)(B) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because it could have been prosecuted as a felony under the recidivist clause of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">This court affirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Mares-Calderon, </em>370 Fed.Appx. 518 (5th Cir.2010). On October 4, 2010, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of this court, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). <em>Mares-Calderon v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 80, 178 L.Ed.2d 2 (2010). On November 19, 2010, Mares-Calderon completed his term of imprisonment and was released by the Bureau of Prisons. On November 22, 2010, Mares-Calderon was deported from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">On remand, Mares-Calderon asks this court to \u201csummarily remand his case for entry of corrected judgment reflecting conviction and sentencing under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).\u201d He argues that because <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>vitiated the treatment of his 1999 conviction as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d he is entitled to a corrected judgment. According to him, the judgment should be corrected because \u201c[a] conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) as opposed to a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) has numerous implications and collateral consequences.\u201d We deny Mares-Calderon\u2019s request for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">First, as a practical matter, it is unclear what correction Mares-Calderon wants us to order on remand. In his written submissions, he suggests that the criminal judgment in this case should be amended to reflect a \u201cconviction\u201d under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) as opposed to one under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Our review of the record, however, reveals that Mares-Calderon\u2019s criminal judgment is silent on whether the district court relied on \u00a7 1326(b)(1) or \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Indeed, the criminal judgment merely refers to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). Because the judgment does not refer to \u00a7 1326(b)(2), it is unnecessary to order the correction Mares-Calderon requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">Second, remand is improper because this case is moot. \u201cA case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. 277, 286, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Where a litigant\u2019s primary stake in the outcome becomes moot, federal courts will allow the suit to proceed only where some collateral consequence of the litigation\u2019s outcome persists. <em>Alwan v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 507, 511 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">As a threshold matter, we must clarify the nature of Mares-Calderon\u2019s conviction. Contrary to his representations, Mares-Calderon was not convicted under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Rather, his conviction is based on a violation of \u00a7 1326(a), which, as the Supreme Court has observed, actually defines a substantive offense. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (\u201cSubsection (a) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>a crime.\u201d)- Subsection (b), on the other hand, merely serves as a \u201cpenalty provision, which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence for a recidivist.\u201d <em>Id.) accord United States v. Vasquez-Olvera, </em>999 F.2d 943, 945 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that subsection (b) is a sentence-enhancement provision and not a separate criminal offense). Because it is clear that Mares-Calderon could not have been convicted under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), we interpret his arguments regarding \u00a7 1326(b) as attacking his sentence and not his underlying criminal conviction for illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In light of this clarification, it is evident that this case is moot. Mares-Calderon\u2019s primary stake in his challenge to his sentence disappeared when he was released from prison and deported in November 2010. These circumstances, combined with the fact that Mares-Calderon is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are enough to moot Mares-Calderon\u2019s challenge to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007) (finding that a challenge to a sentence was moot because the inadmissible defendant completed his term of imprisonment and was deported).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Put simply, this case is moot. As a result, Mares-Calderon\u2019s request for remand and reformation of his criminal judgment is DENIED for want of appellate jurisdiction. This appeal is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<author id=\"b386-8\">HAYNES, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">writing specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">I agree with the majority opinion that \u201cit is unnecessary to order the correction Mares-Calderon requests\u201d and, therefore, would not reach the question of mootness. His request should be denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">. Mares-Calderon was removed from the United States for illegal reentry at least once before his conviction in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">. The fact that Mares-Calderon is challenging his sentence, and not his conviction, renders this case distinguishable from our decision in <em>Alwan. </em>In <em>Alwan, </em>we determined that the BIA\u2019s categorization of a conviction as an \"aggravated felony\u201d produced collateral consequences \u2014 namely, permanent inadmissibility \u2014 that prevented the petitioner's case from being moot. Unlike the petitioner in <em>Alwan, </em>Mares-Calderon has failed to present any collateral consequences that would flow from the application of sentencing enhancements under \u00a7 1326(b). This distinction also renders our decision in <em>United States v. Villanueva-Diaz </em>inapposite. 634 F.3d 844, 848-49 (5th Cir.2011) (finding that a case was not moot because the petitioner was challenging his conviction and recognizing the collateral consequences that can stem from a criminal conviction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b384-15\">. Sheriff Callahan argues, for the first time in his reply brief, that the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Brown and Henson \"are entirely unrelated and that any comparison of the two cases by this Court is unwarranted,\" but offers no additional explanation for this assertion, which is offered only in the context of arguing that the evidence was inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. An argument raised for the first time in a reply brief should not be considered. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
