Petitioners argue the BIA erred by reviewing their well-founded fear of persecution <em>de novo </em>and by reweighing the record evidence. They also argue they established their eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief based upon a well-founded fear of persecution under China\u2019s family planning policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\u201cWe review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the [INA].\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). We defer to the agency\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of its own regulations unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The BIA may not \u201cengage in <em>de novo </em>review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge,\u201d but may review an immigration judge\u2019s factual determinations only to assess whether those determinations were clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Furthermore, except for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts, the BIA is not permitted to engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). But the BIA \u201cmay review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(h). Under its precedent, the BIA reviews <em>de novo </em>whether the facts establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Matter of A-S-B-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 493, 496-98 (BIA 2008), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>620 F.3d 372 (3d Cir.2010). As such, the BIA \u201cis entitled to weigh the evidence in a manner different from that accorded by the Immigration Judge, or to conclude that the foundation for the Immigration Judge\u2019s legal conclusions was insufficient or otherwise not supported by the evidence of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Here, the BIA did not apply the wrong standard of review, nor did it err by reviewing <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s finding that Petitioners failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 496-98. Whether an alien has established a well-founded fear does not involve a simple factual determination; rather, it involves the application of the law to the facts. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, in this regard, is neither plain error, nor inconsistent with the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Moreover, the record shows the BIA did not engage in <em>de novo </em>factfinding; rather, it properly considered <em>de novo </em>whether the facts in the record amounted to an objectively well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); <em>Matter of A-S-B-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 496-98. The BIA was also entitled to reweigh the evidence, to the extent it did so, in concluding that Petitioners\u2019 evidence was insufficient to establish an objectively well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Matter of A-S-B-</em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Having determined that the BIA\u2019s method of analysis was appropriate, we now turn to its conclusions. Because the BIA issued a decision and did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s interpretation of applicable statutes <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84. Under the substantial evidence standard, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cWhen reviewing for substantial evidence, we do not ask whether the evidence presented by an applicant might support a claim for relief; instead, we ask whether the record <em>compels </em>us to reverse the finding to the contrary.\u201d <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">An applicant may prove a well-founded fear of future persecution, and thereby qualify for asylum, by demonstrating a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199-1200 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Asylum claims based on China\u2019s one-child policy must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <em>In re J-H-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 196, 198, 201 (BIA 2007). To demonstrate an objectively reasonable fear, the alien must establish: (1) \u201cthe details of the family planning policy relevant to [the alien]\u201d; (2) \u201cthe alien violated the policy\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe violation of the family planning policy would be punished in the local area in a way that would give rise to an objective fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198-99. Fines may amount to persecution if they cause a \u201csevere economic disadvantage.\u201d <em>In re T-Z-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 163, 173 (BIA 2007). To meet the severe economic disadvantage standard, the fine should reduce the alien \u201cto an impoverished existence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Based on our review of the evidence, we cannot say the BIA\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence, nor can we say the record <em>compels </em>the contrary finding. The record (1) contains little, if any, evidence from similarly situated individuals that would support a finding of an objectively reasonable fear of persecution; (2) includes evidence indicating that forced sterilizations were not common in Fujian Province; and (3) suggests that Petitioners\u2019 children, who are United States citizens, may not be counted for birth planning purposes upon them return to China. Additionally, even assuming Petitioners would be subjected to a fine, they failed to prove such a fine would cause \u201csevere economic disadvantage\u201d and reduce their family \u201cto an impoverished existence.\u201d <em>See In re T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 173-74. The foregoing does not compel a finding that the BIA\u2019s decision was unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Though we sympathize with Petitioners and do not doubt their subjective fears, this record does not compel us to find those fears of persecution are objectively reasonable. Consequently, we must deny their petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-5\">. Because Petitioners have not demonstrated an objectively reasonable fear of persecution, they have failed to establish their eligibility for asylum. <em>See Mehmeti, </em>572 F.3d at 1199-1200. And by extension, they have failed to satisfy the more stringent burdens for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that a failure to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily entails ineligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
