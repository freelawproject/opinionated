The district court sentenced Herrera-Escobedo to 70 months imprisonment as to the first count and 36 months imprisonment as to the second count, to run concurrently, based on a Sentencing Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months imprisonment. In reaching that Sentencing Guidelines range, the district court applied a 16-level enhancement to the defendant\u2019s base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(I). Herrera-Escobedo now appeals from the sentence imposed by the district court. He raises two challenges to his sentence on appeal. We conclude that neither challenge has merit and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">First, Herrera-Escobedo argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) based on a finding that he was previously deported following a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. He contends that there was insufficient evidence before the district court to establish that his prior Texas conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as that term is defined in Application Note l.B to \u00a7 2L1.2. Specifically, Herrera-Escobedo argues that the Texas statute under which he was convicted, the former Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.123, \u201ccan penalize one for the simple possession\u201d of a controlled substance \u2014 conduct that falls outside the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d He maintains that because only the state court judgment, and not the charging document, was attached as an exhibit to the Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the documentation that the district court relied on when it concluded that his prior conviction qualified as a drug trafficking offense was inadequate under <em>Shepard v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">It is undisputed that Herrera-Escobedo did not raise this challenge to the sentencing enhancement in the district court. At the sentencing hearing, Herrera-Escobe-do\u2019s counsel commented that this court \u201chas had a problem with ... the drug delivery statute under Texas state law for enhancement purposes.\u201d But counsel conceded that the indictment in the defendant\u2019s state case \u201cclarifies the issue in a way where [this court] would be satisfied that the 16-level enhancement applies.\u201d Counsel concluded: \u201cthe information is available to the Court that says, yeah, [the] 16-level enhancement is justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Where a defendant failed to raise an objection to a sentencing enhancement in the district court, we review the issue for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, because Herrera-Escobedo\u2019s counsel assured the district court that the information available to the court demonstrated that the 16-level enhancement applied, it could be argued that Herrera-Escobedo did not merely forfeit his objection to the sentencing enhancement, triggering plain error review,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but rather invited the alleged error he now raises on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Absent manifest injustice, a defendant may not appeal errors that he \u201cinvited or induced.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note, though, that the Government does not argue that Herrera-Escobedo is barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>challenging the 16-level enhancement under the invited error doctrine. \u201c[0]ut of an abundance of caution, we will review for plain error.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Even under plain error review, Herrera-Escobedo is not entitled to relief. To satisfy the plain error standard, \u201cthe [defendant] must show an error, that is clear or obvious, and that affected his substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If those conditions are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, a district court must apply the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United </em>States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Using this approach, \u201ca district court looks to the elements of a prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction, when classifying a prior offense for sentence enhancement purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In a \u201cnarrow range of cases,\u201d a district court may look beyond the statutory elements of the offense in making this determination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This court has held that the determination of whether a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d was committed falls into that narrow range of cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, under <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>the additional information a district court may consider is limited to the \u201ccharging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">As an initial matter, we note that on May 5, 2011, the government filed an unopposed motion to supplement the record with the indictment from the Texas case at issue, which this court granted. Accordingly, that document is now part of the record. The indictment states that the defendant \u201cdid ... intentionally and knowingly deliver, to wit, actually transfer a controlled substance listed in Penalty Group 1, to wit; HEROIN.\u201d Herrera-Escobedo has made no attempt to argue that this description of his conduct is insufficient to establish that his prior conviction was for a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Although Herrera-Escobedo emphasizes that only the state court judgment of conviction, and not the indictment, was attached as an exhibit to the PSR, a \u201cstate court judgment fall[s] within the scope of documents a court may consider under Shepard.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Here, the state court judgment specifies that Herrera-Escobedo\u2019s conviction was for \u201cUNLAWFUL DELIVERY PG 1-HEROIN.\u201d As this court held in <em>United States v. </em>Marban-Calderon,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as of November 1, 2008, \u201ca [prior] Texas con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>viction for delivery of a controlled substance \u2014 whether by active transfer, by constructive transfer, or by offer to sell\u2014 necessarily qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because both the charging document and the state court judgment that was attached as an exhibit to the PSR establish that Herrera-Escobedo\u2019s prior conviction was for a drug trafficking offense, the district court did not err in applying the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Second, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Herrera-Escobedo challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. That argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. </em>Pineda-Arrellano.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
