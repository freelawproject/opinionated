He was sentenced to life imprisonment on counts two and three, to be served concurrently, and 60 months of imprisonment on count four, to be served consecutively to the sentences for counts two and three. Jackson seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of audita querela challenging his sentence in view of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-19\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Jackson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues and is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Jackson argues that the writ of audita querela is available because <em>Booker </em>established a new rule of constitutional law that was unforeseeable at the time of his sentencing, appeal, and habeas petition. He contends that <em>United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 605 (5th Cir.2005), is inapplicable because he filed a motion to reopen his criminal case pursuant to a writ of audita querela, and not under \u00a7 2255. He contends that <em>Booker </em>should be applied retroactively under <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-20\">Jackson cannot assert this claim in a petition for writ of audita querela because redress is available under \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>(5th Cir.1993). Jackson\u2019s inability to meet the requirements for bringing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). Jackson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Jackson\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
