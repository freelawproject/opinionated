No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We review a sentence \u201cwhether within or without the guidelines ... only for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. de</em>nied, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). To be upheld on appeal, a sentence must be reasonable both procedurally and substantively. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">On appeal, Cedano argues that the guideline under which his guidelines range was calculated \u2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 \u2014 inherently is unreasonable because it double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history, resulting in an enhancement for certain crimes no matter the specific circumstances of those crimes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such double-counting, he contends, places too much emphasis on a defendant\u2019s criminal history and does not reflect the sentencing goals of section 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">But we review only a defendant\u2019s final sentence, and not the guidelines themselves, for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that the reasonableness standard applies to the final sentence, not to each decision made during the sentencing process). And the Sentencing Commission intended prior felony convictions to count under both section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) and the criminal history category. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6); <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992) (explaining that the criminal history category serves \u201cto punish likely recidivists more severely\u201d while enhancements under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) serve \u201cto deter aliens who have been convicted of a felony from reentering the United States\u201d). Thus, the use of Cedano\u2019s prior drug trafficking convictions in both his criminal history category and adjusted offense level did not render his sentence unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Cedano also argues that the disparity between his sentence and the sentences received by defendants in \u201cfast-track\u201d districts rendered his sentence unreasonable. At sentencing, Cedano acknowledged that his argument was foreclosed by our circuit precedent in <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>Castro, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>explained that no unwarranted disparity existed when one district participated in the fast-track program and another district court did not participate in the program. <em>Id. </em>at 1252-53; <em>see also United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006) (disparities associated with early disposition programs are not unwarranted sentencing disparities for purposes of section 3553(a)(6)). So, we are barred from reviewing his present claim under the doctrine of invited error. <em>See United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that we are precluded from reviewing an issue on appeal if defendant has induced or invited the district court into making the alleged error, including where defendant waives a procedural right or agrees to the admissibility of certain evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In sum, Cedano\u2019s appellate arguments do not persuade us that the district court\u2019s guidelines sentence \u201clies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). Cedano has not met his burden of demonstrating that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-7\">. Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, the guidelines range, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">. Cedano received a 16-level enhancement because he had earlier been deported after a conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-11\">.In addition, the district court considered that Cedano, a lawful permanent resident, had twice been convicted of drug crimes under two different aliases. He was deported after both convictions and later re-entered the United States using his real name. Ceda-no admitted that he used the aliases so that he could re-enter the United States. We cannot say that the district court's reasons for imposing a guidelines sentence \u2014 including Cedano\u2019s history and characteristics and his \"complete lack of respect for the laws of this country\u201d \u2014 is unsupported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
