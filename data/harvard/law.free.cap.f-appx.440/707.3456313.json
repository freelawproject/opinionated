Rios-Rios contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). If we conclude that no procedural error occurred, \u201cthe second step is to review the sentence\u2019s \u2018substantive reasonableness\u2019 under the totality of the circumstances, including \u2018the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party challenging the reasonableness of a sentence \u2018bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1270 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Here, Rios-Rios challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his 30-month sentence. Rios-Rios argues that his sentence, which represented an upward variance from the advisory guidelines range of 12 to 18 months imprisonment, is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. In imposing its sentence, the district court noted that Rios-Rios had illegally entered the United States and been voluntarily deported on five prior occasions. The district court explained that a 30-month sentence was necessary given Rios-Rios\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to deter future criminal conduct, and the seriousness of his offenses. Those were all appropriate considerations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s sentence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
