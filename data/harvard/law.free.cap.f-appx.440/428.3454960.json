The district court upwardly departed from the guidelines range of 15-21 months of imprisonment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Cervantes asserts that his prior criminal activity places him within the \u201cheartland\u201d of illegal reentry cases and that, because many of his prior convictions are temporally remote, his criminal history category does not substantially underrepresent the seriousness of his criminal history. He also contends that he no longer has a motivation to return to this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">In the context of a Guidelines departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3, reasonableness review requires this court to evaluate both \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute regarding whether Cervantes\u2019 sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, <em>see United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006), because even without the benefit of such a presumption, the sentence imposed by the district court does not constitute an abuse of discretion given Cervantes\u2019 extensive criminal history and record of recidivism. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (instructing the district court to consider \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d as well as, inter alia, the need for the sentence imposed \u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48 (affirming a departure based on the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant was a recidivist whose criminal-history score did not reflect his lengthy criminal history).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Further, the extent of the departure is less than other sentences that we have affirmed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 442-43 (5th Cir.2006) (upholding an upward departure from range of 46-57 months of imprisonment to a sentence of 120 months); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 346-48 (upholding upward departure from range of 27-33 months of imprisonment to a sentence of 60 months). Even were this court to conclude that a different sentence would be better, that \u201cis insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
