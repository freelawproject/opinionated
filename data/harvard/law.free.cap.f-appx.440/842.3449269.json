Chevez, a Florida state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 federal habeas petition. We granted a certificate of appealability as to whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc), by misinterpreting and failing to address Che-vez\u2019s claim that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to appeal the denial of his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief <em>de novo. Gamble v. Sec\u2019y, Florida Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>450 F.3d 1245, 1247 (11th Cir.2006). The scope of review is limited to the issue specified in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing a motion to vacate filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In <em>Clisby v, Jones, </em>we held that when a district court fails to address all claims in a habeas petition, we will vacate without prejudice and remand th\u00e9 case for consideration of all remaining claims. 960 F.2d at 938. We have defined a \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. In <em>Griffin v. California, </em>the Supreme Court declared that the Fifth Amendment \u201cforbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d 380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Upon review of the record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we vacate and remand. As the state concedes, the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by misinterpreting and failing to address Chevez\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to appeal the denial of his motion for a mistrial. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment, without prejudice, and remand to the district court for consideration of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
