Coleman argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-21\">Coleman\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. Coleman facilitated the sale of more than 150 kilograms of cocaine by the Black Mafia Family to a drug dealer in Birmingham, Alabama. After Coleman learned that he had been indicted, he assumed a false identity and evaded arrest for at least two years. Although the district court was \u201cnot too sure that [it] agreefd] with\u201d the arrangement between the United States and Coleman to award him an adjustment for a minor role in the conspiracy based on his background as described in the presentence investigation report, the district court reduced Coleman\u2019s offense level and then correctly calculated Coleman\u2019s advisory guideline range of 70 to 87 months of imprisonment. The district court reasonably determined that a sentence at the high end of the guideline range \u201cappropriately reflected] the seriousness of [Coleman\u2019s] criminal conduct,\u201d and took \u201cinto account the very large amount of drug distribution that [he] was involved in, his obvious knowledge of the very widespread nature of the drug conspiracy,\u201d and the \u201chuge amounts of drugs [that] were being distributed by [the] group.\u201d Coleman argues that there is an unwarranted disparity between his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>sentence of 87 months of imprisonment and the 64-month sentence that the district court imposed on his codefendant, Barima McKnight, but the two men were not similarly situated, <em>see United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009). In contrast to Coleman\u2019s role as a facilitator and intermediary between distributors of large amounts of cocaine, McKnight loaded and unloaded cocaine and money and counted money. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We AFFIRM Coleman\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
