He argues that the district court erred by revoking his supervised release instead of ordering him into a drug treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-23\">The district court permissibly found that Turlich possessed and used controlled substances. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>978 F.2d 181, 182 (5th Cir.1992). Unless the district court found that he was eligible to be ordered into drug treatment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), revocation of supervised release was mandatory. \u00a7 3583(g)(1). Tur-lich committed numerous violations of the terms of his supervised release, twice testing positive for drug use, twice failing to report to his probation officer, and incurring a state court conviction of simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>criminal damage to property. He did not merely fail a drug test. The district court did not err by finding that no exception was warranted pursuant to \u00a7 3583(d). Because the district court did not apply the exception, the mandatory revocation of supervised release was not an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
