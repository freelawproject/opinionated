After serving out his prison sentence, he began a term of supervised release in January of 2009. In December of 2010, Mason\u2019s probation officer petitioned for a warrant for Mason\u2019s arrest on the ground that Mason had violated the terms of his supervised release by using cocaine and failing to abide by the conditions of home confinement. A few days later, the probation officer amended the petition to include a new basis for revocation: Mason\u2019s attempt to use a \u201cwhizzinator\u201d \u2014 a device a used to substitute another liquid in the place of the urine of a person taking a drug test \u2014 to avoid testing positive for cocaine. Mason and his attorney did not learn of the whizzinator allegation until the morning of the revocation hearing about three weeks later. Nevertheless, Mason pleaded true to all of the allegations in both petitions, and the district court revoked both terms of Mason\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">The district court determined that Mason\u2019s prior criminal history was IV and that his violation was Grade C, with the result that the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Guidelines recommended a sentence in the range of 6-to-12 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on Mason\u2019s attempt to deceive the probation officer with the whizzinator and his steadfast insistence during the revocation hearing that he did know there was anything wrong with using the device, the district court determined that an above-Guidelines sentence was appropriate. The statutory maximum on each count was 24 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court sentenced Mason to 30 months imprisonment: 24 months on one revocation and 6 months on the other, with the sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>On appeal, Mason argues that his sentence was patently unreasonable because the district court\u2019s decision to impose an above-Guidelines sentence was based on Mason\u2019s use of the whizzinator and this conduct was not charged in the original arrest-warrant petition. Revocation sentences are ordinarily reviewed under a highly deferential \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Mason did not object during the revocation hearing that the length of his sentence was unreasonable, so we review his sentence only for plain error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To show plain error, Mason must identify a forfeited error, clear under existing law, that affects his substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Mason\u2019s argument that the revocation petition failed to charge him with using the whizzinator is factually inaccurate. The amended petition includes this charge. Mason did not receive notice of the amendment until the morning of the revocation hearing. However, his attorney declined the district court\u2019s offer of additional time to confer with Mason about the allegation, to which Mason immediately pleaded true. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Mason had a due process right to receive earlier notice of the amendment, he waived that right by pleading true to the allegation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, Mason has not shown that the district court committed error, plain or otherwise, by considering his use of a whizzinator in determining the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">When revoking supervised release, a district court may impose any sentence within the statutory maximum<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and is free to order that the sentences run consecutively.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because neither of Mason\u2019s sentences exceeded the statutory maximum, the district court did not plainly err in imposing them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
