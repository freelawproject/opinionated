He now lives in Jamaica, having been removed from the United States by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We are obligated to examine whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We note that the record does not explain why Maxwell, who was sentenced to concurrent five-year prison terms in 1988, was still incarcerated when he filed his \u00a7 2241 application in 2010. More importantly, the record does not show, and Maxwell does not assert, that he is serving the supervised release term imposed on one of his convictions. Accordingly, any claim for \u00a7 2241 relief challenging the execution of Maxwell\u2019s sentences would be moot, and we have no jurisdiction to consider moot matters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Because Maxwell \u201cattacks errors that occur[red] at trial or sentencing,\u201d his ostensible \u00a7 2241 application is properly construed under \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, Maxwell was sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, not in Mississippi, where he filed this action. Because a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in the sentencing court, the district court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate Maxwell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus \u201cthe district court was without the power to rule on\u201d Maxwell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims, and we have no jurisdiction to review their merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to the question of whether the district court erred in entertaining the matter as a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">Under the savings clause, Maxwell might have avoided the jurisdictional bar to challenge the correctness of his federal sentences under \u00a7 2255 if he had demonstrated that no adequate or effective relief was attainable by motion under that section and therefore that relief under \u00a7 2241 was proper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If that were the case, a \u00a7 2241 application challenging the imposition of Maxwell\u2019s sentences could have been brought in the Southern District of Mississippi.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Maxwell, however, makes no effort to demonstrate that the district court erred in determining that he failed to show that the savings clause applied. Because Maxwell fails to identify error in the district court\u2019s analysis on this issue, it is as though he failed to appeal that part of the decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Maxwell has abandoned any claim that the district court erred in not allowing him to proceed under \u00a7 2241 through application of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>clause.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The appeal is DISMISSED as moot to the extent that the suit challenges the execution of Maxwell\u2019s sentences under \u00a7 2241, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED to the extent that the suit challenges the correctness of Maxwell\u2019s sentences under either \u00a7 2255 or \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Maxwell has also filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental brief. There, he contends that his attorney, in providing counsel on whether Maxwell should accept a plea agreement, failed to tell Maxwell that his status as a permanent resident would be affected if he proceeded to trial and was found guilty. Maxwell contends the plea agreement offer would have allowed him to stay in the country. Because we are dismissing the case, we DENY Maxwell\u2019s motion to file this brief.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
