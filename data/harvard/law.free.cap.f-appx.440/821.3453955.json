Roel Vaughn was injured on the job while operating a forklift manufactured by Hyster Company, Inc. Vaughn thereafter brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>this action against Hyster.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He alleged that Hyster was liable for his injuries under the Alabama Extended Manufacturers\u2019 Liability Doctrine and for breaching its purported implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The district court granted Hyster summary judgment after excluding, on Hy-ster\u2019s motion, the opinions of Vaughn\u2019s two expert witnesses. Memorandum Opinion dated December 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Vaughn appeals the summary judgment, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the opinions of his experts and erred in granting summary judgment because material issues of fact remained to be litigated with respect to his breach of implied warranty claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The district court, in its order granting Hyster summary judgment, described how Vaughn\u2019s injury occurred, according to Vaughn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">Mr. Vaughn was employed by Federal Mogul Corporation as a materials handler and was performing his job duties at its Jacksonville, Alabama plant when the subject accident occurred on March 2, 2007. The accident occurred while [Mr.] Vaughn was operating a Hyster \u201cstandup\u201d fork lift truck, which he had regularly operated since December of 2004. According to [Mr.] Vaughn, he maneuvered the lift truck into an aisle, and stopped the vehicle to the left of some shelves containing automotive parts. [Mr.] Vaughn then looked down and to his right toward two pallets on the floor, to locate parts he needed to lift with the truck and move onto another pallet. While holding in his right hand a label identifying the parts he needed to move, [Mr.] Vaughn leaned to his right to get a closer look at the pallets on the floor. [Mr.] Vaughn does not remember how far he leaned, testifying that \u201cI Just remember leaning over.\u201d [Mr.] Vaughn testified that \u201c[o]ne second I was looking at this label, and the next second I knew something bad had happened, and I was turned like sideways, and my arm was dangling.\u201d [Mr.] Vaughn\u2019s right arm apparently struck a portion of the shelving and was severely injured. [Mr.] Vaughn does not know how the accident occurred. [Mr.] Vaughn does not believe that the vehicle moved on its own. Mr. Vaughn is \u201cfairly sure\u201d that an operating manual was located on the lift truck, but he does not recall reading it. In a section warning operators to \u201cuse common sense,\u201d the operating manual warned that operators should \u201c[k]eep arms, legs, and head inside operator\u2019s compartment.\u201d Mr. Vaughn also acknowledged that there were various warning labels on the vehicle. [Mr.] Vaughn testified that \u201cI saw them on there, and I\u2019m sure I read part of it, but I don\u2019t know if I read letter for letter.\u201d Like the operating manual, the warning labels instructed operators to \u201c[k]eep arms, legs and head inside operator\u2019s compartment.\u201d In February 2004, approximately three years prior to the accident, Mr. Vaughn completed a Federal Mogul \u201cLift Truck Operators Training Course Written Exam.\u201d In the \u201ctrue or false\u201d portion of the exam, [Mr.] Vaughn indicated that the following statement was false: \u201c[I]t is OK to have your feet or hands outside the running lines of the equipment.\u201d [Mr.] Vaughn testified that he knew he could be injured if he did not keep his arms inside the operator\u2019s compartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>The district court excluded the opinions of Vaughn\u2019s expert witnesses, Emmett Gamel and Thomas Talbot, under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, after it engaged in the gatekeeping function prescribed by <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). The court found Gamel lacking in \u201csufficient knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to render an opinion concerning the design or safety feature design of forklift trucks,\u201d Mem. Op. at 16, and that Vaughn failed to show that the \u201cmethodology used by Gamel in formulating his opinions [was] reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The court found Talbot\u2019s opinions unreliable because, \u201clike Gamel\u2019s, [they were] not based upon sufficient facts or data, and because Talbot did not use any methodology in reaching his opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as with Ga-mel\u2019s opinions, Vaughn \u201cdid not address the reliability of Talbot\u2019s testimony in [his] response\u201d to Hyster\u2019s motion to exclude the opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 22. \u201cThey offered no explanation, no factual support, no case law, and no argument to support a conclusion that the methodology used by Talbot in formulating his opinions [was] reliable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The record fully supports the district court\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>findings and thus its decision to exclude the experts\u2019 opinions. Hence, the district court\u2019s ruling did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The district court rejected Vaughn\u2019s claim that Hyster breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose on the ground that Vaughn \u201cabandoned\u201d the claim by not addressing the claim in his response to Hyster\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 27. We find no error in the court\u2019s action. The district court rejected Vaughn\u2019s claim that Hyster breached an implied warranty of merchantability because, assuming that the experts\u2019 opinions were not needed to make out a claim, Vaughan failed to satisfy the court\u2019s requirement that, in opposing a motion for summary judgment, a party</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">must ... produce significant, probative evidence demonstrating a genuine issue [of material fact] for trial. In [his] response, [Vaughn] merely noted that \u201cPlaintiffs testimony regarding the un-merchantable quality of the subject forklift is ... sufficient to defeat Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion.\u201d Although Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed Mr. Vaughan\u2019s deposition, Plaintiffs never cited to any portion of that testimony as evidence which would support this claim As required by Appendix II of the Uniform Initial Order, the Plaintiffs must support each statement of fact with specific reference to those portions of the evidentiary record that support it.... And, as the Plaintiffs admitted ... Vaughn does not know how the accident occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 28 n. 8. We discern no error in the district court\u2019s rejection of the implied-warranty-of-merchantability claim. The court\u2019s judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">.
