After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">In 2009, a police officer posed on the Internet as a teenage boy using the screen name \u201cCaleb94infl.\u201d The officer posted a profile indicating that he was fourteen years old, had lived in foster homes and was unhappy. Shortly after entering an Internet chat room, the officer encountered Defendant Girard, using the screen name \u201cOnestep99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">For approximately an hour and 45 minutes, Defendant Girard chatted with \u201cCa-leb94infl,\u201d discussing sexual activity and arranging to meet at a nearby Dairy Queen to engage in sex. About thirty minutes later, Girard arrived at the Dairy Queen and was arrested. Girard admitted that he was \u201cOnestep99,\u201d that he had intended to meet a fourteen-year-old boy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>and that he probably would have engaged in sexual relations with the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">During a subsequent search of Defendant Girard\u2019s residence, officers discovered that Girard\u2019s computer was equipped with programs to clean traces of online activity and to encrypt data. No child or adult pornography was found on Girard\u2019s computer. However, forensic analysis revealed that Girard had viewed Ca-leb94infl\u2019s Internet profile shortly after the officer entered the chat room.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">B. Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Defendant Girard pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. In exchange for Girard\u2019s guilty plea, the government agreed not to recommend a specific sentence, but reserved the right to present evidence and make arguments as to the application of the guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8558(a) factors, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-7\">The United States Attorney agrees not to recommend a specific sentence. However, the United States Attorney does reserve the right to advise the District Court and any other authorities of its version of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offenses by DAVID ALLEN GIRARD, including correcting any misstatements by defendant or defendant\u2019s attorney, and reserves the right to present evidence and make arguments pertaining to the application of the sentencing guidelines and the considerations set forth in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">In addition, the parties reserved the right to appeal any sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">C. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated a total offense level of 29, which included, <em>inter alia, </em>a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), because Girard knew or should have known that the victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PSI noted that: (1) the undercover officer\u2019s online profile indicated that the fourteen-year-old boy was living in a foster home and had \u201cbeen bounced around most of [his] life\u201d; (2) the \u201cvictim\u2019s unstable home environment would make him an unusually vulnerable victim\u201d; and Girard had \u201ca history of exploiting similar circumstances. (see paragraphs 39 and 40).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Paragraphs 39 and 40 of the PSI indicated that, at the time of Girard\u2019s arrest, he was on probation for a 2001 conviction for possession of child pornography. During the course of the 2001 investigation, law enforcement learned that Girard had made contact with a seventeen-year-old boy in an Internet chat room and wired the boy money for a bus ticket to visit Girard\u2019s residence. The boy stayed at Girard\u2019s home for several days. Girard admitted he knew the boy was a minor and wanted to help the boy, who was having problems at home. As a result, Girard was separately charged with, and pled guilty to, contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">For the 2001 child pornography offense, the state court imposed a ten-year sentence and split the sentence between three months in jail and sixteen months\u2019 home confinement, with five years\u2019 probation. For the 2001 contributing to the delinquency of a minor offense, Girard was given a one-year suspended sentence, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>two years\u2019 probation. As a condition of his probation on the child pornography conviction, Girard was not allowed to have Internet access or contact with minors and was required to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">With a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of III, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was ten years\u2019 imprisonment, the range became 120 to 135 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). The PSI noted that if, pursuant to the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, Girard knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim, and his criminal history included a prior sentence for an offense involving a vulnerable victim, an upward departure may be warranted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither party objected to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">D. Government\u2019s Letter to Probation Office</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">After the PSI was released, but before sentencing, the government sent a letter to the probation office stating that: (1) an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), cmt. n. 4 was appropriate because Girard exhibited \u201ca penchant for young \u2018troubled\u2019 boys who come from unstable family environments\u201d; and (2) in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, an upward variance from the 120-to-135-month guidelines range was appropriate because Girard traveled between states to engage in sexual acts with a troubled youth and previously exploited children.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">E. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">At sentencing, the parties confirmed they had no objections to the PSI. The district court confirmed the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations and the advisory guidelines range of 120 to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">In mitigation, Girard argued that, due to a work-related accident in the fall of 2001, which crushed his foot, he took various medications to control the pain that also affected his ability to control impulses. In response, the government noted that Gir-ard\u2019s January 2001 arrest for the child pornography and contributing to a minor\u2019s delinquency offenses, which showed his \u201cpenchant for children,\u201d predated his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">The government stated that there were two possible bases for imposing a sentence above the advisory guidelines range \u2014 an upward departure under \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) and an upward variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The government submitted a copy of the undercover officer\u2019s online profile, the Internet chat between Girard and the officer posing as \u201cCa-leb94infl\u201d and certified copies of records relating to Girard\u2019s prior 2001 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">The online profile showed a picture of a teenage boy and stated that the boy\u2019s name was Caleb and he was \u201c14 years old.\u201d According to Caleb\u2019s profile, his \u201clife basically SUX,\u201d he was in a foster home, he had \u201cbeen bounced around most of [his] life,\u201d did not have many friends and \u201chad to grow up quick.\u201d The chat transcript showed that Girard quickly steered the conversation with Caleb toward sex, asked whether Caleb wanted to meet to engage in sexual acts and arranged to meet Caleb within thirty minutes behind a Dairy Queen. A certified copy of the arrest affidavit for Girard\u2019s 2001 conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>indicated that Girard let a thirteen-year-old boy spend the night in his home, served the boy alcohol and gave him cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The government argued that: (1) Caleb\u2019s online profile indicated that he was in a foster home and had been \u201cbounced around, which signifies his vulnerability via an unstable home environment\u201d; and (2) paragraphs 39 and 40 of the PSI, to which Girard did not object, indicated that Girard had \u201cpossessed child pornography and contributed to the delinquency of a minor, who the Defendant even admitted, \u2018was having difficulties at home and at school.\u2019 \u201d The government stated that its position was \u201cthat the Defendant is choosing these victims based upon their vulnerability, someone who doesn\u2019t have a stable home environment or is in a foster home and has a need or desire for affection and stability.\u201d The government asked the district court \u201cto consider that portion of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, that Application Note 4, when fashioning a sentence.\u201d In addressing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the government noted Girard\u2019s criminal history of crimes against children and \u201cthe nature of this offense which seems to have graduated from his prior offenses\u201d and argued that the public needed protection from Girard.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The district court found that an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1 was warranted because Girard\u2019s prior 2001 conviction (for contributing to a minor\u2019s delinquency) and the instant offense both involved the selection of a vulnerable victim. The district court described Girard\u2019s selection of vulnerable boys who were \u201clonely and in need of affection\u201d as his \u201csort of modus operandi, if you will.\u201d As a result, the district court increased Girard\u2019s offense level by two levels to produce an advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The district court next found that the need to protect the public from Girard warranted an upward variance. The district court stressed that Girard\u2019s offense was \u201cextremely serious\u201d and that Girard\u2019s conduct had \u201cgraduated\u201d from his prior 2001 convictions. The district court noted that a program on Girard\u2019s computer was designed to erase or destroy images, which made it impossible for law enforcement to recover any incriminating evidence that may have been on Girard\u2019s computer. When the district court stated that Girard failed to register as a sex offender after his 2001 convictions, defense counsel interrupted and advised the court that Girard in fact had registered. The district court stated, \u201cI stand corrected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">The district court said that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s no question in this Court\u2019s mind that [Girard is] a serious sex offender, and [Girard is] a danger to the public and our children.\u201d At this point, the district court expressed concern that Girard may have committed other acts, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-8\">The concern that I \u2014 one concern I have is with this type of obsession \u2014 and it\u2019s not reflected in the Presentence Report, but between 2001 and 2009, I have a very hard time believing there were not more acts committed. I certainly have a hard time believing that you were not possessing child pornography on [your] computer, particularly in light of the data encryption destruction, if you will, program that you had on your computer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-9\">In any event, the primary factors for the Court\u2019s variance in this case is the need for deterrence for you, Mr. Girard, as well as, most notably, the need to protect society from crimes of this nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">The district court pointed out that although Girard\u2019s 2001 convictions \u201cshould have been enough of a message\u201d to Girard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>the instant offense \u201cwas even more aggravated\u201d than his 2001 convictions, which suggested that Girard could not control himself. The district court imposed concurrent 195-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Girard filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AZP0\">A. Breach of the Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Girard argues that at sentencing the government breached the plea agreement by arguing that there were circumstances supporting both an upward departure and an upward variance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">\u201cThe government is bound by any material promises it makes to a defendant as part of a plea agreement that induces the defendant to plead guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Horsfall, </em>552 F.3d 1275, 1281 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhether the government violated the agreement is judged according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding at the time he entered his plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The government breaches a plea agreement when it advocates a position incompatible with its promises in the agreement or makes a recommendation \u201cwhich merely pa[ys] \u2018lip service\u2019 to the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>77 F.3d 368, 370-71 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Here, the government promised not to recommend a specific sentence, but reserved the right to advise the district court of the circumstances of the offense and to argue the proper application of the guidelines and consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. At sentencing, the government argued that an upward departure might be warranted under the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) given that Girard\u2019s criminal history included a 2001 conviction for contributing to a minor\u2019s delinquency offense \u201cthat involved the selection of a vulnerable victim.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), cmt. n. 4. The government also argued that a variance above the advisory guidelines range might be warranted based on various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Girard\u2019s criminal history, the nature and circumstances of his current offense and the need to protect the public from him. <em>The government did not, however, request a specific sentence or suggest the extent to which the district court should impose either a departure or a variance. </em>As such, the government\u2019s argument for the \u00a7 3Al.l(b) departure and an upward variance struck a balance between exercising its reserved right to argue for the proper application of the guidelines and the proper consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its obligation not to request a specific sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">Under the express terms of the plea agreement, it was not reasonable for Gir-ard to expect the government to refrain from advocating for an upward departure authorized by the guidelines and supported by the PSI\u2019s undisputed facts or to expect the government not to emphasize those undisputed facts when addressing whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted a variance. Thus, Girard has not shown that the district court erred when it permitted the government to argue for an upward departure and an upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>However, even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that there was error, Girard did not object to the government\u2019s arguments in the district court and cannot show that any alleged error was plain. This Court has never addressed in a published opinion whether the precise language at issue in Girard\u2019s plea agreement precludes the government from advocating for an upward departure or variance, so long as the government does not request a specific sentence. Furthermore, our only published case addressing identical language in another plea agreement concluded that the government did <em>not </em>breach the plea agreement when it asked the district court to consider imposing consecutive sentences. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>487 F.3d 1358, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2007). Given the current law in this Circuit, we cannot say any alleged error was plain. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that for an error to be plain it must be \u201cclear under current law\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">B. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Girard argues that his 195-month sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court based it on speculation, rather than reliable evidence, that Girard had a \u201cmodus operandi\u201d of targeting vulnerable boys from unstable homes and engaged in other undetected crimes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The party challenging the sentence has the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). In reviewing the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, we consider whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as, <em>inter alia, </em>selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact may be based upon evidence presented at trial, facts admitted by the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, undisputed statements in the PSI or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2004). A sentencing court\u2019s fact findings \u201ccannot be based on speculation.\u201d <em>United States v. Newman, </em>614 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">If the defendant challenges a factual basis for his sentence, the government must then prove those facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Liss, </em>265 F.3d 1220, 1230 (11th Cir.2001). However, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the facts \u201cmust be asserted with specificity and clarity\u201d to trigger the government\u2019s burden of proof. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006). If the defendant does not object to the PSI\u2019s factual statements, they are deemed admitted for sentencing purposes, and the district court may rely upon them even in the absence of supporting evidence. <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1323 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 843-14 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Here, Girard did not carry his burden to show his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Girard made no objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>PSI\u2019s factual allegations regarding his 2001 convictions, thus admitting them for sentencing purposes. In addition, the government presented certified copies of Gir-ard\u2019s 2001 convictions, the fictitious online profile for Caleb and Girard\u2019s online chat with who he thought was Caleb. The district court\u2019s findings that Girard\u2019s criminal history demonstrated a pattern, or \u201cmodus operandi,\u201d of targeting lonely boys from troubled homes and that Girard\u2019s conduct escalated between the 2001 offenses and the instant offense were based on these undisputed facts and evidence, rather than speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">As for the district court\u2019s comment expressing concern that, given the computer software that destroys data, Girard may have committed other acts, a review of the district court\u2019s entire discussion of its reasons for imposing the upward variance suggests this was an offhand comment rather than a factual basis for the variance. Specifically, the district court primarily stressed the seriousness of Girard\u2019s current offense and that Girard had \u201cgraduated\u201d from his earlier 2001 offenses. When the district court commented that it was hard to believe Girard had not possessed child pornography between 2001 and 2009, the court also acknowledged that the PSI did not reflect that Girard had committed any other acts during those eight years. The district court then stated, \u201cIn any event, the primary factors for the Court\u2019s variance in this case\u201d was the need to deter Girard and protect the public. The district court then stressed that Girard\u2019s 2001 convictions did not deter him from committing the instant \u201ceven more aggravated\u201d offense. In sum, when the challenged comment is read in context, we do not think it reflects a fact finding by the district court in support of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court\u2019s comment was impermissible speculation, Girard never objected to it. As such, Girard is required to show error that is plain that affected his substantial rights, i.e., that the court\u2019s speculation \u201cactually did make a difference\u201d and that there was a reasonable probability that, absent the impermissible speculation, Girard would have received a lesser sentence. <em>See United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1177 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that if the effect of the error is uncertain, the defendant cannot show that it affected his substantial rights).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Girard also claims that the district court\u2019s speculation \u201cresulted in a substantially higher sentencing range.\u201d This argument lacks merit, too. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>court made the challenged comment <em>after </em>confirming the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations and imposing the vulnerable victim upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">For all of these reasons, Girard has not carried his burden to show prejudice with regard to the alleged speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-9\">. Section 3A1.1(b)(1) provides that: \"[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim, increase by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). A vulnerable victim is one who is the victim of the offense of conviction (or relevant conduct) \"who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3A 1.1, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-10\">. The commentary to \u00a7 3A1.1 states that \"[i]f an enhancement from subsection (b) applies and the defendant\u2019s criminal history includes a prior sentence for an offense that involved the selection of a vulnerable victim, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, cmt. n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\">. We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>whether the government breached a plea agreement, but apply plain error review where, as here, the defendant failed to raise the issue before the district court. <em>United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2008). To establish plain error, the defendant must show: (1) an error, (2) that was plain, (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness and integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.; see also Puckett </em>v. <em>United States, 556 </em>U.S. 129, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1432-33, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\">. The cases Girard cites involved plea agreements with substantially different language, which makes them inapposite. Most importantly, in none of these cases did the government reserve the right to present evidence and make arguments pertaining to the proper application of the guidelines or to the consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)'s sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628 (11th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>77 F.3d 368 (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rewis, </em>969 F.2d 985 (11th Cir.1992). Thus, these cases do not establish error that is plain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b924-12\">. Girard does not argue that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b925-6\">. Ordinarily, if a defendant fails to object to a sentencing error before the district court, we review for plain error. See <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). Although we have not yet done so in a published opinion, five other circuits have applied plain error review to procedural reasonableness claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mancera-Perez, </em>505 F.3d 1054, 1058 (10th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Gilman, </em>478 F.3d 440, 447 (1st Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>488 F.3d 363, 367-69 (6th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>462 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Sylvester Norman Knows His Gun, III, </em>438 F.3d 913, 918 (9th Cir.2006). As the Tenth Circuit explained, \u201cthe usual reasons for requiring a contemporaneous objection apply to challenges to the district court\u2019s method of arriving at a sentence. A timely objection to the method can alert the district court and opposing counsel, so that a potential error can be corrected, obviating any need for an appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Flores, </em>444 F.3d 1218, 1221 (10th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Sorondo, </em>845 F.2d 945, 948-49 (11th Cir.1988) (\"The purpose of the plain error rule is to enforce the requirement that parties object to errors at trial in a timely manner so as to provide the trial judge an opportunity to avoid or correct any error, and thus avoid the costs of reversal.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
