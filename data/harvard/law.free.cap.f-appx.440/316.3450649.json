The district court certified that Thompson\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith and denied him leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-23\">When a district court certifies that an appeal is frivolous and is not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Fed.R.CivP. 24(a)(3), a litigant may either pay the filing fee or challenge the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>court\u2019s certification decision by filing a motion for leave to proceed IFP in this court. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).
