Munn now appeals. He argues that he established all elements of his claim because the record clearly showed that: (1) he was physically disabled; (2) CPI did not provide him with full and equal accommodations because it refused to photograph him with his dog at its particular studio during normal business hours; and (3) CPI acted wantonly and willfully because it violated a criminal statute and tossed him off the premises after he informed CPI of its legal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment, applying the same substantive law as the district court. <em>Durr v. Shinseki, </em>638 F.3d 1342, 1346 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Genuine disputes are those in which the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Claims brought under \u00a7 51-1-6 are governed by general principles of tort law. <em>See Reilly v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., </em>272 Ga. 279, 280, 528 S.E.2d 238, 240 (Ga.2000). Accordingly, to prove a claim under \u00a7 51-1-6, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the defendant owed him a duty; (2) the defendant breached that duty; and (3) the breach caused the plaintiff actionable damages. <em>See Dupree v. Keller Industries, Inc., </em>199 Ga.App. 138, 141, 404 S.E.2d 291, 294 (Ga.App.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Where the only injury is to the peace, happiness, or feelings of the plaintiff, damages are recoverable only if the defendant acted maliciously, willfully, or wantonly. <em>Westview Cemetery, Inc. v. Blanchard </em>234 Ga. 540, 545, 216 S.E.2d 776, 780 (Ga.1975); <em>Waldrip v. Voyles, </em>201 Ga.App. 592, 595, 411 S.E.2d 765, 768 (Ga.App.1991). Willful conduct is conduct which evidences an intent to inflict injury. <em>Martin v. Gaither, </em>219 Ga.App. 646, 652, 466 S.E.2d 621, 625 (Ga.App.1995). Wanton conduct is that which is \u201cso reckless or so charged with indifference to the consequences as to justify the jury in finding a wantonness equivalent in spirit to actual intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(ellipses omitted). Where a party violates another person\u2019s rights under the justified but mistaken impression that the action is required to comply with other obligations, the party\u2019s good faith conduct after seeking advice cannot be malicious, willful, or wanton. <em>See Woodruff v. Kroger Co., </em>475 F.Supp. 147, 149 (M.D.Ga.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Assuming that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-1-6 authorized a suit for a violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 30-4-2, that CPI owed Munn a duty to provide full and equal access to its facilities, and that his dog, Due, qualified as a \u00a7 30-4-2(b)(l) \u201cservice dog,\u201d the district court properly granted CPI summary judgment because CPI did not breach such duty. CPI told Munn that it could not grant his request to be photographed with his dog at the studio during normal business hours because of its concern for the safety of children who were there. It would be willing to grant his request when the studio was closed, i.e., before or after normal business hours. Or, he could go to another CPI studio which could accommodate his request during normal business hours. Munn chose neither option.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Even if we considered CPI\u2019s refusal to photograph Munn and his dog (at the studio he chose) during normal business hours a breach of the \u00a7 30-4-2 duty, Munn still could not recover. As noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>above, damages for injury to the peace, happiness, or feelings would be recoverable only if CPI acted maliciously, willfully, or wantonly. CPI\u2019s response to Munn\u2019s request clearly did not rise to such level. CPI dealt with Munn in good faith, in conformance with its responsibility for the safety of the children in the studio.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-9\">.Section 30-4-2, \"Equal accommodations for blind persons, persons with visual or physical disabilities, and deaf persons; use of guide or service dogs,\u201d states, in pertinent part;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">(a) ... persons with physical disabilities ... are entitled to full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges [at] any ... places to which the general public is invited, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to all persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">(b)(1) ... every physically disabled person ... shall have the right to be accompanied by a service dog.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Section 30-4-1(2) defines a physically disabled person as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">any person, regardless of age, who is subject to a physiological defect or deficiency regardless of its cause, nature, or extent that renders the person unable to move about without the aid of crutches, a wheelchair, or any other form of support, or that limits the person's functional ability to ambulate, climb, descend, sit, rise, or to perform any related function.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-20\">.
