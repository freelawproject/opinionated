The district court granted a certificate of appeala-bility (COA) on the issue of \u201cwhether [Page] should be relieved of his career offender designation and re-sentenced.\u201d Page claimed in his \u00a7 2255 motion that his below-the-statutory-maximum sentence as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) could not be sustained in light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), because his prior Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer no longer constituted a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We decline to answer the question in the COA, because we conclude Page is procedurally barred from raising his sentencing claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">A prisoner in federal custody may file a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2255 \u201cclaiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Courts have consistently held, however, that a collateral challenge is not a substitute for direct appeal. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). In general, a defendant is required to assert all available claims on direct appeal, and \u201crelief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is reserved for transgressions of constitutional rights and for that narrow compass of other injury that could not have been raised in direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cAccordingly, a non-constitutional error that may justify reversal on direct appeal does not generally support a collateral attack on a final judgment unless the error (1) could not have been raised on direct appeal and (2) would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">Page\u2019s claim that his below statutory maximum sentence violates the Sentencing Guidelines, as interpreted post <em>-Johnson, </em>is a non-constitutional claim. As such, if this claim could have been raised on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>appeal, Page is procedurally barred from raising it under \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>at 1233. \u201cA ground of error is usually \u2018available\u2019 on direct appeal when its merits can be reviewed without further factual development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232 n. 14 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Page did not challenge his status as a career offender on direct appeal. In fact, Page did not file a direct appeal at all. Page offers no reason why he could not have raised his career offender status on direct appeal. \u201cIn procedural default cases, the question is not whether legal developments or new evidence has made a claim easier or better, but whether at the time of the direct appeal the claim was available at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1235. Where the basis of a claim is available, and other defense attorneys have recognized and litigated it, unawareness of the objection will not constitute cause to excuse a procedural default. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>153 F.3d 1305, 1307-08 (11th Cir.1998). Moreover, the fact that this Circuit\u2019s precedent may have been adverse to Page\u2019s claim does not mean that the appeal was \u201cunavailable.\u201d A defendant\u2019s belief that his claim would have been futile \u201ccannot constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.\u201d <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Because Page\u2019s status as a career offender is a non-constitutional issue that he could have raised on direct appeal, it is not cognizable on collateral review under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-12\">. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the petitioner's prior conviction for battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03 did not categorically qualify as a predicate felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1269, 1274. In light <em>o\u00ed Johnson, </em>this Court subsequently held that the fact of a defendant's Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer, standing alone, no longer qualified as a predicate \"crime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>609 F.3d 1168, 1169-70 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
