United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s 180-month sentence following his guilty plea to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 297 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(\u201cJackson I </em>\u201d) (unpublished), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 896, 178 L.Ed.2d 739 (2011). In <em>Jackson I, </em>Appellant argued, among other things, that the district court erred in imposing an enhancement based on the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), because \u201cresisting an officer with violence,\u201d as defined by the Florida statute under which he was convicted, and as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. We rejected that claim because, under the \u201ccategorical\u201d approach we use in determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for ACCA enhancement purposes, Jackson\u2019s conviction of resisting an officer with violence qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA, and we do not turn to a specific factual inquiry. <em>See Jackson I, </em>355 Fed.Appx. at 298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-21\">We also mentioned \u2014 in response to one of Jackson\u2019s arguments \u2014 that under our law, a minimal amount of force can still constitute a violent felony, citing our decision in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2008), <em>reversed and remanded by </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision in <em>Jackson I </em>and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of its decision in <em>Johnson. See Jackson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 896, 178 L.Ed.2d 739 (2010). We asked for, and have received, supplemental briefs from the parties on the effect of <em>Johnson </em>on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>On reconsideration, we affirm, once again, Jackson\u2019s sentence. A crime is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA if it satisfies the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the statute, which requires that the crime is punishable by more than one year in prison, and \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <em>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). In <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010), we held that resisting an officer with violence is a violent felony under the residual clause. We are bound to follow Nix unless and until it is overruled by this Court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008). Therefore, we must conclude that resisting an officer with violence constitutes a violent felony within the meaning of the residual clause of the ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Accordingly, we substitute our previous opinion in this case with this one and affirm Jackson\u2019s sentence after our further consideration in light of Johnson, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">OPINION SUBSTITUTED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. Contrary to Jackson\u2019s argument, the United States did not need to cross-appeal the district court\u2019s ruling applying the elements clause and rejecting the application of the residual clause in order to preserve its argument pertaining to the residual clause. <em>See United States v. American Ry. Exp. Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435, 44 S.Ct. 560, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924) (\u201cthe appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it\"); <em>United States v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>465 U.S. 805, 814 n. 12, 104 S.Ct. 1495, 79 L.Ed.2d 826 (1984) (\u201c[A] prevailing party may urge any ground in support of the judgment, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d). Because the government\u2019s reliance on this alternative argument \u2014 advanced at every step of this litigation \u2014 that resisting an officer with violence also is a violent felony under the residual clause does not seek to \"enlarg[e]\u201d its rights under the district court\u2019s order, this argument has been preserved for appellate review. <em>American Ry. Exp. Co., </em>265 U.S. at 435, 44 S.Ct. 560.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
