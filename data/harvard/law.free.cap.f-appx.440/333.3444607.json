On appeal, Hernandez argues that his sentence is unreasonable and that he should have been granted a downward departure. He asserts that the district court did not apply the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors properly, did not take into account his cultural assimilation into the United States, created an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and those of similarly situated defendants, and imposed a sentence that violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s bar against cruel and unusual punishment. We lack jurisdiction to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure, although Hernandez may still challenge his sentence as unreasonable. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">We review Hernandez\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If error has been preserved, an appellate court reviewing for reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Although he asked for a sentence below the guidelines range,- Hernandez did not specifically object to the sentence imposed. Thus, it is questionable whether he is entitled to review for abuse of discretion or merely for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Because Hernandez is unable to show either abuse of discretion or plain error, we need not decide which standard of review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">The record belies Hernandez\u2019s assertions that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory and failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Cf. Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (listing these as procedural sentencing errors). Although Hernandez asserted that he had culturally assimilated to the United States, this is not a mandatory basis for a departure, and the district court was not required to accord this fact dispositive weight. <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Montelongo, </em>263 F.3d 429, 433-34 (5th Cir.2001). Because Hernandez identified no similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>situated defendant who received a lesser sentence, he has not established sentencing disparity. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006). Hernandez\u2019s conclusional assertion of an Eighth Amendment claim does not warrant review. <em>See United States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 255 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Because it was within the properly calculated guidelines range, Hernandez\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the district court considered sentencing Hernandez below the guidelines range but determined that the record and the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) called for a sentence at the bottom of that range. Hernandez has not shown that the district court committed \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
