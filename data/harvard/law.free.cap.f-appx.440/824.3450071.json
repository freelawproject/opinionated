Stephen, as the sole corporate officer of First Loan Solution, Inc., sold tracts of land in northern Florida. He advertised the land primarily to members of the Haitian community in South Florida and falsely informed the victims that First Loan Solution owned the land. Stephen hired the law firm of Estime-Thompson, P.A. to conduct real estate closings. Patricia De Pons, who managed Estime-Thompson\u2019s title operation, conducted the fraudulent closings purporting to transfer title of land tracts from First Loan Solution to the buyers. She also provided buyers with fabricated, unrecorded warranty deeds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Stephen was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1349, and eighteen counts of substantive mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2. He entered into a written plea agreement with the government, in which he agreed to plead guilty to count one of the indictment and the government agreed to seek dismissal of the remaining eighteen counts. In the plea agreement Stephen acknowledged that the district court would consider the sentencing guidelines and that the court had \u201cthe authority to impose any sentence within and up to the statutory maximum\u201d of 20 years. The government agreed to seek a reduction in Stephen\u2019s offense level based on his acceptance of responsibility, and the parties agreed to jointly recommend three enhancements to Stephen\u2019s base offense level: a 20-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(E) for a loss of more than $7,000,000 but less than $20,000,000; a 6-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(C) for 250 or more victims; and a 4-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for Stephen\u2019s role as an organizer or leader of the criminal activity. Those were the only three sentencing guidelines enhancements that the plea agreement mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">In addition to those three enhancements, the presentence investigation report recommended a 2-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 because Stephen \u201cabused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. The PSI also recommended a 2-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) because the offense involved the use of sophisticated means. Stephen\u2019s base offense level was 7, but with all of the enhancements the PSI set his adjusted base offense level at 41. With a 3-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level was 38. The PSI assigned Stephen zero criminal history points and a criminal history of I, and his recommended guidelines range was 235 to 293 months. Because a statutory maximum of 20 years applied, however, the PSI set Stephen\u2019s guidelines range at 235 to 240 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Stephen filed objections to the PSI based on, among other things, the recommended enhancements for abuse of a position of trust and for sophisticated means. At the sentence hearing the district court questioned both sides about the facts related to those enhancements. The court thereafter imposed a sentence of 240 months followed by three years of supervised release. It later ordered $6,804,736.08 in restitution, based on the claims filed by victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Stephen contends that (1) the government breached the plea agreement by arguing in favor of an abuse of trust enhancement and seeking a sentence above the guidelines range that was indicated by the plea agreement; and (2) even if the government did not breach the plea agreement, it contains an unenforceable sentence appeal waiver. He also contends that the district court erred by (1) applying the 2-level abuse of trust enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3; (2) applying the 2-level sophisticated means enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C); and (3) applying a 20-level enhancement based on its calculation the amount of the loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1). Stephen asserts that he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea, or he should be resen-tenced by a different district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The only argument Stephen makes that, if successful, would allow him to withdraw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>his guilty plea is his contention that the government breached the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Rewis, </em>969 F.2d 985, 988-89 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cThere are two remedies available when a plea agreement is breached: (1) remand the case for re-sentencing according to the terms of the agreement before a different judge, or (2) permit the withdrawal of the guilty plea.\u201d). Because Stephen did not argue to the district court that the government allegedly breached the plea agreement, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Romano, </em>314 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cBefore an error is subject to correction under the plain error rule, it must be plain under controlling precedent or in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or rule; it must have adversely affected the outcome of the proceedings; and it must be such that the failure to correct it would seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Lett, </em>483 F.3d 782, 790 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The government is bound to a material promise that induces a defendant to plead guilty. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). \u201cWhether the government violated the agreement is judged according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding at the time he entered the plea.\u201d <em>Rewis, </em>969 F.2d at 988. In the present case, although some of the government\u2019s statements at the sentence hearing could be construed as arguments in favor of imposing the abuse of trust enhancement, the government repeatedly emphasized that it intended to honor the plea agreement, and it never specifically asked the district court to impose the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The district court asked counsel for both parties whether there was a factual dispute about Stephen\u2019s abuse of a position of trust with the victims of the fraudulent scheme. The court told Stephen\u2019s counsel that it did not \u201ccare about\u201d the plea agreement and asked for an explanation of \u201cwhy, factually,\u201d the abuse of trust enhancement was \u201cnot applicable.\u201d Stephen\u2019s arguments on that subject did not persuade the court, which concluded that the enhancement was \u201cappropriate.\u201d The court stated that it intended to impose the enhancement despite the government\u2019s decision to \u201ccontinue with [its] position as stated in the plea agreement.\u201d Thus, Stephen\u2019s substantial rights were not affected because the district court was going to impose the enhancement even though the government did not agree to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The government complied with its promise in the plea agreement to recommend a sentence \u201cwithin the advisory sentencing guideline range produced by application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d At the sentence hearing, the government stated that in light of the district court\u2019s decision to set the guidelines range at 235 to 240 months, it recommended a sentence of 235 months, at the low end of that range. Counsel for Stephen acknowledged that there was not \u201cmuch wiggle room between 235 and 240.\u201d Stephen\u2019s counsel also recognized that the parties had entered the plea agreement based on the understanding that the guidelines range would be between 151 and 188 months, which would be \u201chopefully satisfactory to the Court,\u201d but because the court was not satisfied with that guidelines range, counsel asked for a \u201cvariance down to 151 months.\u201d Just because the district court decided to impose a higher guidelines range does not mean that the government breached the plea agreement. In the plea agreement itself Stephen acknowledged that \u201cthe court ha[d] the authority to impose any sentence within and up to the statutory maximum\u201d of twenty years. Stephen has not shown that the government breached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the plea agreement, and he is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea or to be resen-tenced by a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Having determined that the plea agreement was not breached, we now turn to the issue of whether Stephen waived his right to challenge his sentence. The plea agreement contained a sentence appeal waiver, which is enforceable if Stephen agreed to it knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350 (11th Cir.1993). To establish that Stephen waived his appeal rights knowingly and voluntarily, \u201c[t]he government must show that either (1) the district court specifically questioned [Stephen] concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that [Stephen] otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">As the government concedes, Stephen\u2019s sentence appeal waiver is not enforceable. The district court failed to question him about it during the plea colloquy, and it is not manifestly clear from the record that he otherwise understood its full significance. Because the waiver is unenforceable, we will consider the merits of Stephen\u2019s challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Stephen first contends that the district court erred by applying a \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement for abuse of a position of trust. When considering a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines, we review its findings of fact for clear error and its application of the guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Humber, </em>255 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). The sentencing guidelines provide for a 2-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant abused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. The \u00a7 3B1.3 commentary defines \u201c[p]ublic or private trust\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca position of public or private trust characterized by professional or managerial discretion (i.e., substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 cmt. n. 1. \u201cThe enhancement ... requires that the offender occupy a position of trust in relation to the victim, not another party.\u201d <em>United States v. Louis, </em>559 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Because every instance of fraud involves an element of misplaced trust, \u201ca sentencing court must be careful not to be overly broad in imposing the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1264 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). The government must show \u201cthat the victim placed a special trust in the defendant beyond ordinary reliance on the defendant\u2019s integrity and honesty that underlies every fraud scenario.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, 521 </em>F.3d 1235, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Mullens, </em>65 F.3d 1560, 1567 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that district court erred by applying abuse of trust enhancement based on the defendant\u2019s exploitation of friendships he cultivated with investors by virtue of his membership in a country club).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">The abuse of trust enhancement in the present case was based on only two findings of fact by the district court: (1) Stephen was the sole corporate officer of First Loan Solution; and (2) Stephen, who is of Haitian descent, marketed to the Haitian community in South Florida. Both facts are true, but neither fact supports the district court\u2019s application of the abuse of trust enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Stephen\u2019s role as sole corporate officer at First Loan Solution meant that he had a fiduciary relationship with the company, but \u00a7 BB1.3 requires a showing that the defendant held a position of trust in relation to the victims. <em>See Louis, </em>559 F.3d at 1226. \u201c[T]he abuse of trust enhancement applies only where the <em>defendant has abused discretionary authority entrusted to the defendant by the victim; </em>arm\u2019s-length business relationships are not available for the application of this enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Garrison, </em>133 F.3d 831, 839 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation marks omitted). As a seller of land Stephen simply had a buyer-seller relationship with the victims, not a fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">As for the national origin Stephen shared with the victims of his fraudulent scheme, at the sentence hearing one victim told the district court that Stephen and his co-defendant \u201cdid something very bad to the Haitian population.\u201d The witness explained: \u201cHe\u2019s Haitian, they were trusted with the money from the Haitian people.\u201d In its brief to this Court, however, the government does not argue that the -victims placed special trust in Stephen because of their common Haitian heritage, so that argument has been abandoned. <em>See United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 989 (11th Cir.2008) (arguments not made in a party\u2019s brief are abandoned). In any event, even if the victims were inclined to do business with Stephen because he was of Haitian descent, that would be more akin to a social relationship than a close personal or fiduciary relationship. <em>See Mullens, </em>65 F.3d at 1567.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Although Stephen may have gained his victims\u2019 trust by lying to them about safely placing their money in an escrow account, his false promise does not establish that the victims placed any special trust in him beyond the ordinary reliance that underlies every fraud scenario. <em>See Williams, </em>527 F.3d at 1250-51. The district court erred by applying the \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Stephen also contends that the district court erred by applying a sophisticated means enhancement. The sentencing guidelines provide for a two-level increase in the defendant\u2019s base offense level if \u201cthe offense ... involved sophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1 (b)(9)(C). The commentary describes \u201csophisticated means\u201d as \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense,\u201d including \u201c[c]onduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 8(B). Every one of the defendant\u2019s individual actions does not have to be sophisticated; instead, it is enough if \u201cthe totality of the scheme was sophisticated.\u201d <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">The undisputed facts set forth in the PSI establish that Stephen\u2019s offense was more complex than a simple real estate transaction. Stephen arranged bus trips for prospective buyers to view vacant land that First Loan Solutions purportedly owned, hired the Estime-Thompson law firm to serve as closing and escrow agent, and sent letters to victims offering false explanations for closing delays and falsely reassuring the victims that their deposits were being held in an escrow account. Stephen\u2019s co-defendant De Pons conducted fraudulent closings and provided victims with fabricated, unrecorded warranty deeds. All of these actions were instrumental in the execution or continued concealment of the offense. They were intended to reassure the buyers that the transactions were legitimate and that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>deposits were safe. The district court did not clearly err in finding that the offense involved the use of sophisticated means.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Stephen contends that the district court erred by increasing his offense level 20 levels based on a loss amount of more than $7,000,000 but less than $20,000,000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(K). He argues that at the restitution hearing, which was conducted after the sentence hearing, the actual amount of loss claimed by the victims was less than $7,000,000. Based on that amount of restitution, Stephen asserts that his offense level should be lower under \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J) (providing for an 18-level increase for a loss amount over $2,500,000 but not more than $7,000,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Stephen failed to object to the loss amount in the PSI, so he admitted for sentencing purposes that his offense involved a loss amount of $10,600,000. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] failure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes.\u201d)- Not only that, but Stephen agreed in the plea agreement that a 20-level increase for a loss amount of more than $7,000,000 but less than $20,000,000 was appropriate. The district court did not err by sentencing him based on a loss amount that he had admitted and had agreed was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Stephen failed to show that the government breached the plea agreement. Thus, we affirm his conviction. Because the district court erred by imposing an abuse of trust enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, however, we vacate Stephen\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. De Pons and Clotilde Jean, who managed the daily operations of First Loan Solution, were Stephen's co-defendants, but they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>not parties in this appeal. De Pons was sentenced at the same time as Stephen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-9\">. Stephen also contends that the district court failed to satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). Because we are remanding for resentencing, that issue is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
