He argues that the district court committed reversible plain error by convicting, sentencing, and entering judgment against him under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) on the basis that he was previously convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Although we have not yet decided whether robbery or aggravated robbery in Texas Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 29.02 and 29.03 are aggravated felonies, we are not persuaded that Guevara has carried his burden of demonstrating error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 1326(b)(2) enhancement on the basis that his convictions were crimes of violence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>636 F.3d 728, 736-37 (5th Cir.2011) (concluding that Texas aggravated robbery is a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because it involves a serious potential risk of physical injury to another); <em>United States v. Sandlin, </em>589 F.3d 749, 757 (5th Cir.2009) (stating that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion on plain error review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2078, 176 L.Ed.2d 416 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
