Maillet argues, inter alia, that his plea was rendered involuntary by counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of its ramifications. We review the district court\u2019s ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Based on our analysis pursuant to <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), we conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Maillet\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea: Maillet has not asserted that he is innocent of the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm; Maillet\u2019s motion was not promptly filed; the record supports the conclusion that Maillet received close assistance of counsel and, additionally, that his plea was knowing and voluntary; and, as Maillet failed to demonstrate a fair and just reason for withdrawal of his plea, <em>see </em>Fed. R.CrijylP. 11(d)(2)(B), resetting the case for trial would have unnecessarily inconvenienced the district court and wasted judicial resources. Although withdrawal of the plea would not have prejudiced the Government, the absence of such as showing, alone, is insufficient to mandate permission to withdraw a plea where, as here, a credible reason has not been proffered. <em>See Carr, </em>740 F.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
