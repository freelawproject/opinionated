D\u2019Andrea appeals his jury conviction for using facilities in interstate commerce to attempt to persuade, induce, and entice a person he believed was a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). An undercover law-enforcement officer posed as a 14-year-old girl (the minor). D\u2019Andrea contends: the district court did <em>not </em>have subject-matter jurisdiction because D\u2019Andrea\u2019s intrastate use of the Internet and cellular-telephone services did <em>not </em>satisfy the interstate nexus requirement of \u00a7 2422(b); and the evidence at trial about whether D\u2019Andrea believed the minor to be younger than 18 years was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. Each claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">To prove an attempt to violate \u00a7 2422(b), the Government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant <em>used a facility or means of interstate commerce </em>to intentionally \u201cpersuade, induce, entice, or coerce a person whom he believed to be a minor into illegal sexual contact and took a substantial step toward that persuasion or enticement\u201d. <em>United States v. Barlow, </em>568 F.3d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted) (emphasis added). D\u2019Andrea does not dispute that he used Yahoo Messenger and cellular-telephone text messaging to intentionally persuade, induce, and entice the minor to engage in sexual activity and that he took a substantial step toward that persuasion or enticement.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">Before trial, D\u2019Andrea moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting: the district court lacked jurisdiction because he communicated with the minor entirely within the state of Mississippi. The district court denied the motion, as well as when D\u2019Andrea renewed it at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">A district court\u2019s determination of subject-matter jurisdiction is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Gasch v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>491 F.3d 278, 281 (5th Cir.2007). The facility or means of interstate commerce provision is an element of the offense; but interstate communication is not required by the statute. Accordingly, D\u2019Andrea\u2019s challenge to no evidence showing an interstate communication is irrelevant regarding jurisdiction. Likewise, his reliance on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) is inapposite. <em>Lopez </em>concerned the constitutionality of a federal statute under the commerce clause, and D\u2019Andrea has not challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 2422(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-17\">Regarding his insufficient-evidence challenge, D\u2019Andrea asserts: based on the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>dence presented at trial, <em>no </em>rational jury could have found that he believed the minor was younger than 18 years. D\u2019Andrea moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief and renewed the motion at the close of his case. Nevertheless, he failed to renew the motion after the Government presented its rebuttal witness, and he did <em>not </em>file a post-verdict motion. Therefore, the evidence is reviewed only to determine whether there has been \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice, which is found if the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt\u201d. <em>United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 886, 895 (5th Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The record is <em>not </em>devoid of evidence that D\u2019Andrea believed the minor was younger than 18 years. A Sheriffs Deputy testified that the minor\u2019s Yahoo Messenger profile stated she was 14 years old. Although D\u2019Andrea disputed the Deputy\u2019s testimony on this point, and noted that Yahoo Messenger members had to be 18 years old to create a profile and enter a chat room, D\u2019Andrea did not dispute that the minor told him repeatedly that she was 14 years old. Moreover, the chat and text-messaging transcripts offer <em>no </em>indication that D\u2019Andrea believed he and the minor were role playing.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should <em>not </em>be published and is <em>not </em>precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
