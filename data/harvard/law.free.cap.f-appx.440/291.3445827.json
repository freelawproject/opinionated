He contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>district court erred in applying an 8-level aggravated-felony enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based on his prior conviction of deadly conduct under Texas Penal Code Annotated \u00a7 22.05(b)(2). The government argues that Mendez Carranza\u2019s counsel waived the issue because he objected to the 16-level enhancement and argued that only the 8-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The record does not show that defense counsel was aware of an argument that the 8-level enhancement should not apply or any evidence that counsel intentionally relinquished a known right. Counsel did not make a specific objection to an enhancement but withdraw it later at sentencing. Further, Mendez Carranza did not receive a benefit from any waiver of the right to challenge the enhancement. Because the record does not indicate that counsel intentionally relinquished a known right, he did not waive any challenge to the 8-level enhancement. <em>See United States v. Andino-Ortega, </em>608 F.3d 305, 308 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 350-51 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Castaneda-Baltazar, </em>239 Fed.Appx. 900 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Mendez Carranza asserts that his prior Texas conviction of deadly conduct by knowingly discharging a firearm at or in the direction of a habitation in violation of Texas Penal Code Annotated \u00a7 22.05(b)(2) was not a crime of violence (\u201cCOV\u201d) for purposes of the 8-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He also argues that the district court erroneously classified his prior offense as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), so the judgment should be corrected to reflect that he was convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Because Mendez Carranza did not raise those arguments in the district court, review is limited' to plain error. <em>See Andino-Ortega, </em>608 F.3d at 308-09; <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The court did not plainly err in finding that his prior conviction was an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) or in applying the 8-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). In <em>United States v. Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d 492, 495 (5th Cir.2006), we held that a conviction of deadly conduct under \u00a7 22.05(b)(1) constituted a COV for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (applying 16-level enhancement for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). We have not addressed whether a \u00a7 22.05(b)(2) conviction is an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and a COV for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), so any error was not clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 298 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Mendez Carranza has not shown that the district court plainly erred in finding that his \u00a7 22.05(b)(2) conviction was an aggravated felony or in applying the 8-level felony enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>See id.; Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
