It is further alleged that notwithstanding the recommendation so filed, the defendant, in violation of his duty, refused, and still refuses, to appoint the relator to the office or place of deputy state supervisor of elections for Sandusky county. The prayer is for a. writ requiring defendant to make the appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">The defendant by his answer denies the allegations of the petition, and avers that \u201cthere being no recommendation before him for the appointment of a deputy state supervisor of elections in and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the county of Sandusky, from, the republican executive committee of said county,\u201d he appointed to that place another person, who has entered upon his duties and is still acting in the performance thereof. Evidence was taken on the issues thus joined, which, it is conceded, shows that on the 14th day of July,. 1900, there was sent from Fremont, Ohio, to the office of the state supervisor of elections at Columbus, Ohio, the following recommendation: \u201cRecommendation for appointment of member of board of deputy state supervisors of elections for Sandusky county. Fremont, Ohio, July 14, 1900. To the Secretary of State, Columbus, Ohio. The undersigned members, chairman and secretary of the republican executive committee of Sandusky county, Ohio, acting for and on behalf of said committee, hereby recommend Albert E. Culbert, of Fremont, Ohio, for appointment as deputy state supervisor of elections for said county for the term beginning August 1, 1900, and ending July 81, 1902. (Signed.) J. D. Bemis, Chairman, A. H. Jackson, A. E. Culbert, Secretary, J. H. Becker, C. P. Myers, W. A. Roush.\u201d This document was received at the office of the defendant on the 17th day of July, 1900, and was then filed therein with the following endorsement: \u201cRecommendation for appointment of deputy state supervisor of elections for San-dusky county. <em>Republican. </em>Received July 17, 1900. Charles Kinney, Secretary of State.\u201d And the receipt and filing of the paper by the defendant was acknowledged in the following communication to. the relator: \u201cOhio, Department of State, July 17, 1900. Albert E. Culbert, Fremont, Ohio. Dear Sir: I am in receipt of the recommendation of the republican executive committee of your county in behalf of your appointment as deputy state super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>visor of elections, and have filed the same.

Rugh, the only member of the republican county executive committee of Sandusky county, whose name is not signed to the recommendation herein above set forth, sent his written recommendation to the state supervisor of elections in the words and figures following: \u201cGibson-burg, Ohio, July 14, 1900. Hon. Charles Kinney. Secretary of State, Columbus, Ohio. My Dear Sir: I hereby recommend Albert E. Culbert, of Fremont, Ohio, for appointment as deputy state supervisor of elections for said Sandusky county, for the term beginning August 1, 1900, and ending July 31, 1902. (Signed.) E. L. Rugh.\u201d The evidence also shows that the persons whose names are signed to the foregoing recommendations constituted the entire republican executive committee of Sandusky county, that their signatures thereto were genuine, and that J. D. Bemis was chairman, and A. E. Culbert, secretary of the committee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-7\"><em>Dyer, Williams &amp; Stouffer; Richards \u00e9 Heffner; D. B.

L. Rugh, who presented a separate written recommendation; and the relator contends that this recommendation contains the expressed will of the committee, and that it can not be questioned by the respondent except on the ground that it is fraudulent, and not genuine. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">No such claim as this is made by the respondent or his attorneys; and we, therefore, contend that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>testimony should be considered by the court in its determination of this case except the recommendation itself. This conclusion must be accepted as correct; for, if this recommendation is not fraudulent, it must be genuine; if genuine, is expresses the will of the executive committee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">Now the will of the executive committee, when expressed in the form of a recommendation of a qualified person, to the state supervisor, at least ten days before the appointment is made, must be regarded; for, in the language of the statute, \u201cthen the state supervisor shall appoint the persons so recommended.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">The duty of the state supervisor being purely ministerial, mandamus will lie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">Under the statute, when the proper committee has recommended, the secretary of state has no discretion in the making of the appointment. The language of the statute is, that if such recommendation be made, \u201cthen the state supervisor shall appoint the person so recommended.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">His duty is purely ministerial, and is plainly specified. <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.

The subsequent signing of the printed form by the chairman and secretary, or by all the committee as in this case, was simply the formal execution of the agreed action of the committee, and it is immaterial when or where said recommendation was signed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-7\">It will be noted that all of the cases cited by counsel in'brief for respondent, which counsel have been kind enough to furnish to us in advance of the preparation of our brief, are cases which have relation to corporate bodies, or to bodies officially organized, by statute, in the nature of corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-8\">This is distinctly stated to be the basis of the decision in the case of <em>State ex rel. Steinbeck </em>v. <em>Treas., </em>22 Ohio St., 144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-9\">The republican county executive committee of San-dusky county is neither a creature of statute nor a body corporate. It has no corporate rights, and cannot exercise any corporate functions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-10\"><em>McKane </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>123 N. Y., 609; 51 Hun., 629.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-11\">It is clear, therefore, that the reasoning and the authorities contained in the cases cited by counsel, applying as they do to corporations and corporate acts, are not pertinent to the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-12\">This committee had no constitution or by-laws, nor had it even adopted any rules for its guidance in conducting its business. It therefore cannot be said that because such formal action as the statutes re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>quire of corporate bodies, or such as conform in all respects to the rules of parliamentary law, was 'not observed, that the action of this committee in recommending relator was, therefore, void. On the contrary, the subsequent signing of the recommendation of relator by the officers and members of this committee is such a ratification of the action of the committee at its meeting as to preclude the denial of the good faith of the committee\u2019s action. <em>Broat, 27 </em>N. Y. Sup., 176.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-5\">In none of the authorities, is it held to be necessary that there should be a formal vote of the body, except in those eases, where, by statute, it is made the duty of such boards or other bodies to keep a formal record of their proceedings. <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Smelts, 2 </em>C.

That the members shall have proper notice of the meeting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\">2.

Two or three members, according to the testimony of relator,, expressed themselves favorable to the appointment of relator, but that was all.

This is the case in the matter before the court. Albert E. Culbert, the relator, seeks to have his rights to the office of deputy state supervisor determined by this court.

The statute contains the further provision that, \u201cif the executive committees of the two political parties in the county casting the highest and the next highest number of votes in this state at the last preceding November election, recommend qualified persons to the state supervisor at least ten days before the appointment is made, then the state supervisor shall appoint the persons so recommended to. the number to which such party is entitled; but if no such recommendation is made, the state supervisor shall make the appointments agreeably to the-provisions herein contained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">These statutory provisions are mandatory in terms, enjoining on the state supervisor of elections the duty of appointing, each year, at the time named, one-deputy supervisor of elections for each county from each of the two political parties that, at the preceding November election, cast the highest and the next highest number of votes for governor or secretary of state, and requiring him to appoint the person recommended by the county executive committee of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>party, when he possesses the necessary qualifications, and the recommendation has been properly made within the required time. The obvious purpose of the statute is to allow the designated political parties, through the executive committee appointed by them, to select their own representation on the county board of elections; and when their recommendation is properly made, the state supervisor is not at liberty to disregard it and appoint another person of his own choice. He is called upon to decide in the first instance whether the person recommended is qualified and the recommendation is made by the proper committee within the proper time. But his decision when contrary to the fact, in either respect, is open to correction by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The real defense made in this case is, that the relator was not properly recommended for appointment because his recommendation was not authorized by regular action had at an organized meeting of the committee. There was no resolution or motion favoring the relator\u2019s recommendation adopted while the committee was in session; but we have discovered nothing in the statute which requires that manner of recommendation, or the observance of any particular formality. The committee is merely an agency of convenience, whose members are usually chosen by convention to look after the local interests of the party, and they are neither required to keep a record, nor to conform their proceedings to any particular rules or regulations. It bears little or no analogy either in its character or functions to those boards and bodies which are clothed with the power of imposing public burdens and of making contracts in their corporate capacity, and which can therefore act only in organized meetings required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>law; nor, to those governed by parliamentary usage. In the absence of special intructions from the convention which chooses the members of the committee, (and there does not appear to have been any in this, case,) they must necessarily determine their own mode of action; and, no other mode having been adopted, the concurrence of all the members, authenticated by their signatures, in any measure within the scope of their authority, would seem to be sufficient for all the practical purposes of such a committee. It is not doubted that the relator, when his recommendation was filed with the defendant, was, and still is, a citizen and elector of Sandusky county, lacking no-qualification necessary to entitle him to receive the appointment of deputy state supervisor of elections, for that county; nor that his recommendation is the genuine instrument which it purports to be, and was-filed within the time required by law. The recommendation was in substantial conformity with the statute, and sufficiently expresses the wish of the committee for the relator\u2019s appointment as a deputy supervisor of elections of Sandusky county. His right to the appointment is a statutory one, which the defendant in the performance of his official duties was bound to recognize.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">It is claimed in argument, however, that mandamus, is not the proper remedy of the relator, because the title to an office is involved, the only method of trying which is by proceeding in <em>quo warranto. </em>This is-not a proceeding to oust the occupant of an office, or-determine his right to its possession.- Its purpose is to obtain the necessary evidence of the relator\u2019s right to demand the place to which he should have been appointed. The appointment of the defendant is a preliminary step essential to the establishment of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>right, and must necessarily precede an action in <em>quo warranto </em>against the occupant of the office. For, until the appointment shall he made, the relator is not an officer <em>de jure, </em>nor entitled to demand of the occupant the possession of the office, or maintain an action for its possession. In an action of that kind the occupant, is the only proper party defendant. In this action the state supervisor of elections is the only proper defendant; and the action is closely analogous to one in mandamus to compel a canvassing officer or board to issue a certificate of election to a person entitled thereto. Such an action does not determine the title to the office, but its only result, if successfully maintained, is to put the party in a position to contest the claimant\u2019s title by <em>quo warranto. </em>This view is: sustained by authority. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, 2 </em>Gray, 370; <em>Elisha Strong\u2019s Cases, </em>20 Pick., 484; <em>Groome </em>v. <em>Gwinn, </em>43 Md., 574; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hilliard, </em>29 Ill., 413; Merrill on Mandamus, Section 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>Peremptory torit awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
