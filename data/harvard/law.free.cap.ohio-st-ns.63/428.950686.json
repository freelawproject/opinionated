To be classified as such it must meet, the requirements of that class of legislation. It must, relate to the general health, morals or safety of the public. This law does not affect either. It does not. affect the general welfare in any possible way.

Article 1, Section 2, of the state constitution; Article 2, Section 26. So also by the terms of' the 14th amendment , to the national constitution. No other industry save that of coal mining is affected by this law. One class of persons only has been selected for the paternal protection of the state. As we have indicated, the only purpose that this act can have is. to provide a scheme whereby people may make contracts on the basis of information resulting from the operation of the law. The same reasons could as well apply to' other branches of industry. Laws of a similar tendency might as well be enacted regulating industries other than that of coal mining. They could be enacted for the purpose of regulating ore or limestone mining, but all such legislation is against the .\u2018spirit and policy of the constitution. Cooley\u2019s Const.

Haun, </em>7 Kan.

Va., 802, in which it is held that the so called scrip law is constitutional. But as to tins decision, it was by an evenly divided court, and when we consider it in connection with the decision of the same court in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodwill, </em>33 W. Va., 179, we do not see how any weight can be attached to the former decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">In the following cases the so called scrip laws or similar laws have been held.unconstitutional. <em>In re House Bill No. 147, 23 </em>Col., 504; <em>Frorer </em>v. <em>People, </em>141 Ill., 171; <em>Showalter </em>v. <em>Ehlan, </em>5 Pa.

S., 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-10\">After all, the real question in controversy in this case, and as appears to us the only ground which may admit of argument, is the fifth specification, which challenges the validity of this act, upon the ground that it is beyond the power of the legislature in-the exercise of what is known as police power, to pass such a law. In proceeding to a discussion of the limits of the police power, we call the attention of the court to a decision of this court in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Wick, </em>18 Ohio St., 190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>We insist, as a proposition of law, that the exercise of the police power in a state, is full and complete in the legislature thereof, and subject to no restrictions except those which may be found in the constitution of the United States and of the state itself; that a court will not usurp the powers of the legislature by declaring an act invalid upon any broad ground of justice, or upon the ground that particular hardship is in the act before them, or upon other mere equitable considerations, and that the court is silent before the express will of the people (the written law), and if the court thinks the law a hard one it is not for them to say it is void for that reason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\">It had been recognized for a long time prior to the independence of the United States, that the legislative branch of government had ample authority to make regulations for the conduct of certain kinds of business among the citizens; and these United States, that is the people thereof, were and are possessed with the same powers. As has been many times said, this particular power referred to is a power inherent in every government, and that under these powers the government may regulate the conduct of its citizens toward each other and the manner in which they shall use their property when such regulation becomes necessary for the public good.- And so we say, that in the state of Ohio the legislature, as the representative of, and in expressing the will of, the people, has the same power of regulation which has existed since governments have existed and which are not expressly surrendered in the constitution of the state or of the United States. <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S., 113 (24 Law Ed., 77.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\">The common law of police power as now in vogue is, as we have seen, not a new force, but is now more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>often called into action as conditions have so wondrously changed, and its repeated assumption in .these later days only substantiates the claim made for it, that it accommodates itself to meet the requirements of an ever-growing, progressive age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">We now desire to call the attention of the court to instances of the exercise by the legislature of this power in several of the states of the Union, and to the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized the right of a state legislature to the exercise of this power in similar cases to the case at issue. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>110 Ill., 590; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>169 U. S., 366; <em>Barbier </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>113 U. S., 27; <em>Budd </em>v. <em>New York, </em>143 U. S., 517; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Ala., 58; <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>136 Mass., 239; <em>Brechbill </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>102 Ind., 528; 55 Md., 97; <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Yaden, </em>23 N.

Va., 802.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">The law making power of the state can do any legislative act not prohibited by the constitution. The statutory provision or regulation of any business which is required to insure peace and quietude to the community and to secure the general welfare is within the legislative authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\">Before taking up the decisions of other states we desire to cite to the court the amount of legislation enacted in Ohio for the supervi ion and government of mine owners for the inspection of their mines and the prevention of casualties and protection of their employes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-9\">This is to show that the state of Ohio has taken under its general supervision this vocation, for the purpose of securing the safety of employes by requiring ventilation and inspection of mines, and govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>mental reports thereof, and that the defendant, therefore, must submit to such regulations as the sovereign, the state, thinks conducive to public health, public morals and public security. All of chapter 9, title 3, Revised Statutes of Ohio, embracing sections 290 to 306, inclusive, were enacted for the purpose aforesaid and all the restrictions therein required in the business of mining are directly in harmony with the character of the legislation embraced within the act in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\">We also in this connection desire to refer the court to sections 4444, 4444a, 4445 and 4446, Revised Statutes of Ohio, where it is plainly designated as to what the contents of a bushel for measuring coal, stone and lime shall be, and that where facilities can be had all sales of coal shall be by weight and 2,000 pounds avoirdupois shall constitute a ton thereof, and also the liability of persons selling coal in violation of these provisions. These statutes have existed upon our statute books for more than twenty years and have never been questioned. The power embodied in them has been called into question in other states and fully sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\">By the express enumerations of powers given to cities and villages in the statutes of Ohio, under section 1692, in subdivision 16 thereof, the express authorization is given to councils to provide by ordinances for the regulating of the weighing and measuring of hay, wood and coal and other articles exposed for sale; so that every citizen of a city or village where such an office has been created by ordinance, can demand as a matter of right from any person selling to him a ton of coal, a certificate of weight that there are 2.000 pounds avoirdupois in the ton purchased by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>such person. <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>14 Wend., 87; <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S., 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-6\">The inspection and regulation of weights and measures have always been regarded as proper subjects of police supervision and the mere fact that it may' to some extent interfere with the right of contract is no objection to it. First Blackstone Com., 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">In the case of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Wick, supra, </em>the public policy of the state was announced. Such public policy is back of, or the foundation of, the legislation in question. <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>157 U. S., 160; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Joint Traffic Ass\u2019n, </em>171 U. S., 505; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>decided by the court of appeals of Kansas, May 19, 1898, construing chapter 188 of the Kansas laws of 1893. This statute is very similar to the one passed by the Ohio legislature, which is here objected to as being unconstitutional. <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Milwaukee, </em>12 Wis., 673; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>53 Pacific Reporter, 375.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-8\">The following cases also sustain the proposition contended for: <em>Boston Beer Co. </em>v. <em>Mass., </em>97 U. S., 25; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>169 U. S., 366; <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S., 113; <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>New York, </em>14 Wend., 87; <em>Eaton v. Kegan, </em>114 Mass., 433; <em>Charleston </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>2 McCord, 495; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>90 Tenn., 575.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-9\">It might not be improper to call attention, in a casual way, to the rules governing courts in passing on the constitutionality of legislative acts. Article 2, Section 1, of the constitution provides: \u201cThe legislative power of this state shall be vested in a general assembly, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-10\">Here then the whole legislative power vests in the legislature, and is . supreme, except when limited by some other provision of the constitution. <em>Ohio ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>rel. </em>v. <em>Covington, </em>29 Ohio St., 102; 1 Story on the Constitution, Sec. 426; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Tingle, </em>55 Ohio St., 423.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-5\">Shauok, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY6\">There is no authority for the detention of the petitioner unless the act of the general assembly set out in the statement of the case is constitutionally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">That the constitution gives inviolability to the right to make contracts, and that the legislature may deny the right only when it is required for the general welfare, and when it is promotive of public health or morals, are propositions established by familiar authorities and admitted by the attorney general.- We have, therefore, to consider only the purpose of this enactment and the nature of the contract which it assumes to forbid. Its purpose is to terminate the rights heretofore universally recognized in this state, and often exercised, of determining by contracts voluntarily entered into between miners and operators the mode in which the basis of compensation to be made by the latter to the former should be ascertained. Counsel for the state expressly disclaim any authority in the legislature to determine the price to be paid for mining coal, and it is true that no such authority is assumed in this act. By the method of payment heretofore in use, in which compensation was determined upon the basis of screened coal, miners have become entitled to receive and operators have become bound to make, compensation having regard to the skill and care exercised by the miner in the prosecution of his work. The effect of the act is that the total compensation to be paid by an operator is to be determined by agreement, but that it must be paid to miners without discrimination on account of their skill and care. Why the general assembly se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>lected this class of laborers for discrimination \u2014 why they are deemed less entitled than others to compensation which encourages merit by rewarding it \u2014 we do not know, nor inquire. For, however unjust to this class of laborers the act may be, we can inquire only whether the general assembly had power to pass it. It is suggested as the basis of the act, that frauds may be perpetrated in the screening and weighing of coal under the contracts heretofore entered into. To this suggestion it is sufficient to answer that if such danger exists it may well justify appropriate legislation for the prevention of such fraud. But this legislation does not seek to prevent fraud nor to provide for the health or safety of those engaged in mining. Its sole purpose is to establish a uniform standard of compensation among those upon whom it operates. That is, so far as skill and care are concerned, it estaN lishes a uniform standard of earning capacity. The standard thus to be established for all must sarily be that of the least efficient, since their efficiency can not be increased by legislation. To withhold from merit its reward, may be a favorite object of socialism, but it is inimical to the individual rights which are preserved by the constitution. Acts not distinguishable from this in any substantial respect have been held repugnant to similar constitutional provisions. <em>In re House Bill, etc., </em>21 Col., 27; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>8 Pa. Superior Ct., 339; <em>Millett </em>v. <em>The People, </em>117 Ill., 294; <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>The People, </em>142 Ill., 380. We are aware that divided courts have reached the opposite conclusion. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Coal Co., </em>36 W. Va., 802, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>61 Kans., 32. But in both cases what we regard as the correct view is expressed in the dissenting opinions. The views which prevailed in the cases lastly cited seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>be entertained by those whose minds have not become entirely' divorced from the view once urged, but long since abandoned, that constitutional limitations are mere admonitions to the general assembly, and that they do not serve to annul legislative enactments inconsistent with their provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">This act may be invalid for other reasons, but our decision is placed upon the ground that it is an unwarranted invasion of the rights of miners and operators to make contracts by which the former shall be entitled to receive, and the latter obliged to make compensation according to the value of the service rendered and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>Petitioner discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
