Magruder and wife, by a trustee, leased to Abraham M. Taylor one hundred and thirty-five feet of land in Cincinnati, Ohio. The lease contained covenants that the lessee should erect upon the ground demised a good and substantial brick building, not less than three stories high and covering the entire front of said lot, and to insure each of the buildings for at least fifteen hundred dollars against loss by fire. If not so insured by the lessee within thirty days from the completion of the buildings the lessor might cause them to be insured at his expense. The lease was for ninety-nine years, renewable forever, at certain agreed rent. Upon the death of Taylor, his real estate was partitioned among his children, and the east half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the premises above mentioned, being 67 1-2 feet front was allotted to Charles Taylor, he to pay $1,215 per annum for that portion. The plaintiff, The Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company, being desirous of acquiring that real estate for its purposes, in January, 1895, purchased the leasehold of Charles Taylor, subject proportionately to the number of feet thereby conveyed, to all the terms, conditions and stipulations contained in a lease for ninety-nine years, renewable forever, executed by Abert, trustee, and, Magruder and wife to Abraham M. Taylor, the portion of the rent reserved in said lease assumed by the bridge company, being $1,215 annually. On the 19th of July, 1895, the Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company filed their petition in the probate court of Hamilton county to appropriate the1 land so leased for the purpose of widening a roadway and extending the approaches to their bridge, _ commonly known as the' suspension bridge. Having made a proposition to the defendants for the purchase of their interest in the said property, which proposition was not accepted, the bridge company, on the 18th of December, 1895, filed a supplemental petition against the defendants, praying for the appropriation of their interest in the premises aforesaid. The defendants answered this petition, setting up, among other things, that the Magruder s, the owners of the fee and of the lease, have assented and do assent and agree to the erection of the bridge and the approaches thereof as a compliance with the covenants of said lease, respecting the kind and description of structure or building that should or may be erected thereon, by the terms of the lease, and have waived and do thereby waive all objections to the same, if any can be made thereto on account of the covenants in the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The probate court found for the bridge company on the preliminary hearing and ordered the jury to assess compensation. On the trial before the jury the lease to Abraham Taylor, the partition between his'children, and the conveyance to the bridge company were shown, and in addition thereto, two agreements between the bridge company and one Sarah Taylor, as to the use of the premises by the bridge company, a bond by the bridge company and Bradford Shinkle to Charles S. Taylor, reciting the lease of the property in question to Abraham Taylor and its. transfer to the bridge company, reciting, whereas, the said Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company assumes, in proportion to the number of feet it bought, and agreed to perform all and every of the terms and conditions of' the lease upon the part of said lessee to be performed, and conditioned to be void if the bridge company hold, the Taylors harmless for any breach of the terms and conditions of the original lease by the bridge company. And it was shown that in pursuance of said conveyance and agreements the bridge company \u2018entered into possession and continuously occupied said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">The plaintiff offered evidence' tending to show that the interest of the Magruders was limited by the value of the land exclusive of the buildings, which was placed at from $12,000 to $16,000 each. The Magruders asked the probate court to charge the jury, in substance, first, that the bridge company, was bound by virtue of its contract to pay defendants $1,215 annually during the term of the lease; second, that the right to receive the $1,215 per annum, according to the terms of the lease, is, as between the bridge company and the Magruders the measure of damages; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>third, that neither the salable value of the ground rent nor the nature and value of the land were to be considered in assessing compensation to the Magruders; fourth, that the Magruders were entitled to re ceive a full equivalent for the annual rent of $1,215, for the full term of ninety-nine years, renewable forever, and that the jury should ascertain what sum when securely invested would yield that amount; five, that the jury were to determine from the evidence what sum would be necessary to purchase a well secured income of $1,215 net per annum, and to award that sum to the Magruders; all of which charges were refused. And the court charged that the jury were to determine the market value of the ground rent and award such market value to the Magruders, and market value was, in substance, defined as the fair selling value. The jury awarded $20,250 as compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">Motion to set aside the verdict and award a new trial was overruled and a final order entered awarding the property to the bridge company free and clear from the terms and conditions of the said lease thereupon. On petition in error the common pleas court reversed the judgment of the probate court; and without retaining the cause for trial by a jury, proceeded to render final judgment dismissing the proceedings. The circuit court affirmed the common pleas court and it is now sought here to reverse the judgments of the common pleas and circuit courts and to affirm the judgment of the probate court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-6\"><em>Robert Ramsey </em>and <em>Ramsey, Maooioell &amp; Ramsey, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-7\">1. It is true that in Ohio, both by statute and decision, a perpetual leasehold estate is to be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>land for certain purposes. But the discussion of that question is irrelevant. Whatever the nature of the interest of the lessors under the lease, it was still a right of some kind which, until quieted, interposed as complete an obstruction to the public improvement as though it were a fee simple estate unimpaired by lease or otherwise. The statute provides for the appropriation of any \u201cparcel of property, interest, or right\u201d which stands in the way of public improvement. Sec. 6414 Rev. Stat. The right to appropriate any obstruction, whether it be in the form of an estate in the land, or a stone wall on the land, or a personal covenant in a lease affecting the use of the land, is necessarily involved in the very idea of eminent domain. Lewis on Eminent Domain, Sec. 265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-6\">2. The claim that the company has assumed all the covenants of the lease, and that those covenants must be held inviolate, is unfounded for two reasons: (a) If the company had assumed the covenants of the lease, the appropriation would not amount to a violation of contract; but (b) the company did not assume the covenants in any sense which would establish a privity of contract with the lessor. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. Kip, 46 N. Y., 546; <em>Decamp </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>47 N. J. L. 43; <em>Tail\u2019s Exr. </em>v. <em>Asylum, </em>84 Va., 271; <em>West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, </em>47 U. S. (6 How.) 507; but the taking of a lessee\u2019s interest in a fractional part of the premises did not create any privity of contract with the lessor. <em>Jones, Admx., </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>14 Ohio, 606; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>17 Ohio, 449; <em>Sutliff </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>15 Ohio St., 186.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-7\">Nor does the fact that the lessor has accepted the apportioned installments of rent directly from the several assignees of the lessee operate as a novation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>or establish a privity of contract with him. <em>Harmony Lodge </em>v. <em>White, </em>30 Ohio St., 569; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>DeBus, </em>31 Ohio St., 468; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>42 Ohio St., 180.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-4\">If it were otherwise, then the original lease with all of its covenants and conditions would be split up into separate and independent leasehold estates in the several tracts as to which possession had been severed. But such is not the effect of a severance of possession. 2 Taylor on Landlord &amp; Tenant, section 491; 1 Washburn on Real Property, p. 536, section 15; <em>Eyton </em>v. Jones, 21 L. T. N. S., 789; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>5 Barb. 339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-5\">It is said that the appropriation is not necessary, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-6\">First, that the restrictions upon use under the lease are not made conditions of title and may therefore be disregarded by the bridge company without imperiling its possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-7\">Second, that those restrictions have been waived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">1. Upon the first point it is sufficient to say that until this public improvement can be made without breach of contract, a court will not deem a proceeding in eminent domain unnecessary. <em>Giesy </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., 4 </em>Ohio St., 308; <em>Toledo Con. Street Railway </em>v. <em>Street Ry., </em>6 C. C., 362, 3 Circ. Dec., 493.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-9\">2. The claim that all restrictions upon the use of the premises have been waived, is wholly without foundation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-10\"><em>(a.) </em>There was no evidence either tending, or designed to show such waiver.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-11\"><em>(I?.) </em>The answer alleging waiver is not effective to put that question in issue, or call for a reply denying the allegation, since the pleadings of the civil action are not appropriate to special proceedings. The ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>propriator files its application in this particular proceeding. That is all the pleading there is. The statute makes up the issues. Section 6420, Rev. Stat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-6\">(c.) Nor can the answer be taken as amounting in itself to a waiver. It came too late. The statute requires the corporation to endeavor to agree with the owner. Failing in that, it may invoke the aid of the court. Jurisdiction having once attached by the filing of the application, it can not be defeated thereafter by any act of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-7\">(cZ.) But a mere waiver would have been insufficient even if it had been made in time. Public improvements can not be erected upon the faith of a waiver. There must be a title, that is, an independent title, and not a title which is linked by covenants and conditions with the titles of somebody else. The so-called waiver would still leave the bridge company yoked to the Taylors under the original lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdF\">(e.) Again, it is a misnomer to speak of waiver. The tests by Avhich the original lease was found to be indivisible and entire in all its parts, show that such consent as would be necessary to enable the bridge company to make its improvement, Avould amount in laAv to the formation of a neAV contract. The law will not compel the parties to enter into a contract of lease. If an existing title is inadequate to the needs of the corporation, then it is for the corporation to say Avhat kind of a title it will offer to buy. If it can not reach a purely voluntary agreement with the owner in that respect, then the law may be invoked for the appropriation of that uniform title which is conferred in every case, to-wit, an easement in the nature of a fee simple estate. The law does not compel the parties to make contracts that are not mutually satisfactory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>(\u2020.) </em>Finally, waiver implies privity of contract. If there is no privity of contract between the bridge company and these defendants in error, there is nothing for these defendants in error to waive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-4\">It is claimed that the court erred in holding that the appropriation extinguished the covenant of rent. It is true that where a lease is not in the nature of an obstruction to the public improvement; that is, where its covenants may be performed notwithstanding the improvement, an appropriation of the reversionary interest does not necessarily affect the covenant of rent. But where the public work can not been ter ed upon consistently with the provisions of the lease, the lease must give way, just as a house or a stone wall must give way. The covenants of the lease are mutual and dependent. The court can not. make a decree extinguishing certain of the covenants, and preserving others. Each group of covenants forms the consideration for the other, and they must-stand or fall together. Otherwise, the court would, be making new contracts for the parties.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-5\"><em>Richards, Baer &amp; Richards, </em>and <em>Harper &amp; Allen, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-6\">The interest the bridge company really wishes to appropriate is a ground rent, which is an interest incorporeal in its nature, separate and independent of the leasehold, and capable of enjoyment apart from and in addition to the use and enjoyment of the land by the lessee. Williams Real Property, 243; Tiedeman Real Property, Sec. 171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-7\">Along-with and in addition to this incorporeal reversion, or the technical fee, or whatever one may choose to call it, the lessor has a valuable separate and independent property, <em>i. e., </em>the right to receive a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tain sum of money annually; the payment of which sum is a charge on the premises superior to all other charges. Williams, R. P., 322; <em>Stephenson </em>v. Haines, 16 Ohio St., 478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">If it is sought to cancel and extinguish this contract, instead of appropriating the use of the land, another difficulty arises, for that differs widely from the mere act of appropriation. For the cancellation of the agreement and the release of the Taylors, both parties to that agreement, must be parties in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">The effect of condemnations of land for public uses upon rents and leases has been the subject of adjudication in numerous cases. Randolph on Eminent Domain, Sec. 340; <em>Workmen </em>v. <em>Miflin, </em>30 Pa. St., 362; <em>P. W. &amp; B. Ry. Co. </em>v. Williams, 54 Pa St., 103; <em>Foote </em>v. Cincinnati, 11 Ohio, 408.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">There is no pretense in this case that every interest in or in any way connected with *the land involved herein is to be ascertained and taken in this proceeding. The original lessees are not parties hereto, nor is it contended that they have the least interest in the matter, the bridge company have stepped into their shoes, acquiring all their rights and assuming all their obligations. The bridge company now own by voluntary purchase a perpetual lease on the premises; and they occupied the premises by virtue of this lease before action was commenced against these defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">This proceeding is manifestly for the only purpose of securing the interest of the Magruders; the right to collect rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-10\">We shall now consider whether the bridge company has shown the necessity for the appropriation contemplated by section 6420, Revised Statutes. Randolph on Eminent Domain, Secs. 52, 185, 186; Sec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>6416, Key. Stat. <em>Geisy </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>4 Ohio St., 308; Lewis on Eminent Domain, Sec. 163.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">The point we wish to make is that the perpetual lease voluntarily purchased by the bridge company enables them to build and maintain the bridge, that this is the public use contemplated by the statute and the constitution and that any further interest taken by the bridge company would be for their own private benefit and profit. <em>McArthur </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>5 Ohio, 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">It is well settled that the exercise of the right of eminent domain rests upon public necessity, and is just as broad as that necessity and no broader. <em>Weisenberger </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>3 Circ. Dec., 714, 7 C. C., 173, 180, affirmed, 61 Ohio St., 561; <em>State </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>40 Ohio St., 504.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">It seems to me there is a striking analogy between the case at bar and the case of taking water from a river for canal purposes. In each there is a clear public use. and in each the corporation attempted under guise of a proceeding in eminent domain to gain an undue private advantage. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Ohio, 391.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">So in the case at bar the public welfare does not require that more property should be taken than a sufficient estate to support and protect the building and maintenance of the bridge. x\\s the leasehold estate already owned by the bridge company is sufficient for this purpose no further estate or property interest can be taken. <em>Buckingham </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>10 Ohio, 288; <em>Bloodgood </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>18 Wend., 9; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>69 Fed. Rep., 273; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Kip, </em>46 N. Y., 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-9\">And so in all such cases where an appropriation was permitted, the condemning corporation was in possession of the property as lessee, under a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>with the lessor to deliver up possession at a certain time. <em>West River Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Dix, 47 </em>U. S., (6 How.), 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">Now we contend that the bridge company own a sufficient estate and, therefore, it is not necessary to use the property of another. 47 U. S. (6 How.), 537; <em>State </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>55 N. J. L., 194; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>36 Hun., 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">Our interest in this property is capable of enjoyment apart from and in addition to the use of the land for bridge purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">We have seen that the proposed taking is beneficial to the corporation considered as a business enterprise, that this will not authorize a taking. <em>McQuillen </em>v. <em>Hatton, 42 </em>Ohio St., 202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-9\">Now in order to authorize the condemnation in the case at bar the bridge company must show clearly that \u201ceach parcel of property, interest, or right * * * sought to be appropriated\u201d (section 6416, Revised Statutes) is necessary for, and is to be used by, the public (section 6420, Revised Statutes) and that such property, interest or right can not remain in and be enjoyed by the now owner without defeating this use by the public.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-10\">Many cases could be cited in which even after condemnation and payment of award it was held that certain interests remained in and could be enjoyed by the former owner. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>13 Ohio St., 42; <em>McClelland </em>v.

Hoav can the necessity for this appropriation contemplated by sections 6416 and 6420, Revised Statutes, be found Ain til it appears that the landlord refused to permit the proposed use and when it appears of record that the landlord offers to grant a full license without compensation and that the bridge compar v refuses to accept such license, surely the court should not hesitate to dismiss the proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-10\">A leasehold estate is a hereditament (section 4181, Revised Statutes), and may therefore be partitioned (section 5754, Revised Statutes). The leasehold was in fact partitioned by the Taylors and enjoyed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>them in severalty for many years.

Appropriation is not an eviction, nor an incumbrance on the land. It does not divest the tenant of his seisin, and but partially disturbs his possession. The tenant\u2019s liability to pay rent to his landlord continues unimpaired, and the tenant is entitled to a compensation to include his liability to pay rent for the full term. <em>Workmen </em>v. <em>Mifflin, </em>30 Pa.

The case, as we apprehend it, lies within narrow bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">By section 6438 of the Revised Statutes, the court of common pleas, if it reverse the judgment of the probate court in appropriation proceedings, is required to \u201cretain the cause for trial and final judgment.\u201d In this case the record shows that the court of common pleas, having heard the cause on \u201cthe petition in error, the record and proceedings of the probate court and the arguments of counsel,\u201d reversed the judgment, of the probate court and rendered judgment for the costs against the expropriator, The Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company; and, without further trial, proceeded to render a final judgment dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the supplemental and amended petitions and adjudged that the plaintiffs in error, the defendants in error here, go hence without day and recover their costs. To all of this the bridge company, by its attorney, excepted. There was no bill of exceptions taken. Indeed, none was necessary; for the error, if any, plainly appears in the journal entry of the court of common pleas. A reading of the whole of the section of the Revised Statutes referred to, discloses that the \u201ctrial\u201d in the court of common pleas must be a jury trial, as in the trial in the probate court. It does not appear that such a trial was had in the common pleas. On the contrary, it appears that the court of common pleas reversed the judgment of the probate court and retained, the case for trial and heard and considered the premises,\u201d that is, upon further consideration of the \u201cpetition in error, the record and proceedings of the probate court and the arguments of counsel,\u201d found that there existed no right nor necessity for the appropriation of the interest of the defendants in the described property, and thereupon rendered final judgment. This was a palpable violation of the statute. The case of <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>39 Ohio St., 170, does not apply. In that case the court of common pleas reversed the probate court and retained the case for trial and final judgment. It was held that error would not lie to the judgment of reversal because it was not a final judgment. In this case the court did not retain the case for trial, and erroneously proceeded to final judgment. The judgment of reversal and the judgment of dismissal were one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">This error would dispose of the case here; but we will briefly indicate our conclusions on.the vital question involved in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The right of eminent domain is inherent in the sovereignty, and whatever property is required for the public use, whether real or personal, and whatever extent of interest therein, whether tangible or intangible, may be appropriated. These are settled principles of the law. Lewis on Emient Domain, Secs, 262, 262a; 10 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law, 2nd Ed., 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">By the constitution of this state, this power is lodged in the legislature under the general grant of legislative power, and the limitations are few and simple, practically none except that the property shall be taken for a public use only, and that compensation shall be made to the owner in money, without deduction for benefits to any property of the owner. In delegating this power the legislature has regard to the purpose for which it is to be exercised. In some cases it may be a mere franchise, a right of way, in other cases the public interest may require ownership in the property. Hence, while the legislative grant should be strictly construed, it should not be technically construed so as to defeat the purpose of the grant. By the statute of Ohio, Revised Statutes, section 3542, a company organized to construct a bridge over the Ohio river is authorized to purchase, or appropriate, and hold such real estate as, in the opinion of the directors, will be required for the site of the bridge, and of suitable avenues or approaches leading thereto. This grant, when fairly construed, confers the power to acquire any interest in real estate, whether an estate in fee simple or a less estate, which in the opinion of the directors will effectuate the purpose of the grant. In fact, it would seem to be the policy of the state that bridge companies \u201cshall own\u201d the banks of the stream over which the bridge is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>structed, unless permitted to occupy by a written grant with tbe owner. Such is' tbe law as to bridges wholly within the state. At any rate, Revised Statutes, section 3542, in our opinion, confers the right to acquire and hold whatever interest in real estate is necessary, in the opinion of the directors of the bridge, company, for the site of the bridge, its avenues and approaches. Beyond the question whether the proposed taking is a public use, or not, the necessity of' the appropriation is not a judicial question. Ranney, J., <em>Giesy </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>4 Ohio St., 325. <em>Boom </em>Co. v. <em>Patterson, </em>98 U. S., 403, 406. Mere physical occupancy of the land may not, in the judgment of the directors, meet all the needs of the company for a site. It may not be desirable to construct the abutments., and approaches of an interstate highway upon a mere leasehold, although the lease may be with the privilege of renewing it forever. The embarrassment of paying rent forever, for the site, may be a good reason for preferring to own the site of the structure, and for not negotiating for and accepting a mere right, to occupy the land on the terms of the owners. It is nearly certain that the company would not deem it. to be a business-like course to construct and maintain a costly bridge upon a leasehold where the lease not. only did not permit a bridge, but required the owner of the bridge to maintain a block of store buildings, over the whole of the described land. Under such circumstances, it is no more than ordinary prudence to endeavor to extinguish the lease and to obtain the complete title to the land by purchase or appropriation of the outstanding interest. Having the right, to acquire the absolute ownership of the property, by purchase or appropriation, if in their judgment it was needed, the directors proceeded strictly according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>fco law when they proposed- to buy the interest of the defendants and to so complete the title of the company to the land, and upon refusal by the defendants to accept their proposition, in instituting the proceedings to appropriate. The offer by the defendants, in their answer, to waive compliance with the covenants of the lease respecting the kind of structure to be erected and maintained on the land, avails them nothing. It is in effect an attempt to make a new and different contract; and to compel the company to \u2022abide by this waiver, would be to give to the defendants the option, and'to destroy the right of the plaintiffs to appropriate as in the opinion of the directors may be necessary. The finding of the court of common pleas that there is on the part of said corporation no right nor necessity for the appropriation of the interest of the defendants in error in or to the said described property, and the judgment of the same court dismissing the case, as well as the judgment of the circuit court affirming it, are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In its present state of mind the court has been unable to agree to affirm the judgment of the probate court. Members of the court, including myself, would affirm the judgment. The case will therefore be remanded to the court of common pleas for trial as provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the common pleas court, in reversing the judgment of the probate court and dismissing the amended and supplemental petitions herein, and that of the circuit court affirming the judgment of the common pleas court, should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-9\">Minshall, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
