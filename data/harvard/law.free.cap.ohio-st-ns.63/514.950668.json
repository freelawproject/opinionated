In consideration of which, as appears from a fair interpretation of the contract, the defendant, without any provision relieving him, agreed, in effect, to place the school board in as good a situation as before. The contract clearly shows that the matter of this, contingency of the \u201chouse falling down\u201d or being destroyed was within the contemplation of the parties at the time, and the contract makes it incumbent upon the defendant, not only to remove the building, but to rebuild and reconstruct it, which language would never have been used if the parties had not contemplated this possibility. The defendant did not provide in his contract that he was not to perform it in event the building, by unavoidable accident, was destroyed before he began the removal. In short, he is not excused because of the act of God, since it is his contract obligation, and, in his contract he did not provide against such a contingency, but rather provided that he would, in any event, remove, rebuild and reconstruct the school building. If the contract had simply provided that the said Townsend shall remove said building and repair the same, then under the well settled rules of construct]' on, the defendant would be required to rebuild. <em>Meriwether </em>v. <em>Lowndes Co., </em>7 Southern Rep., 199.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The meaning of \u201crepair,\u201d as defined by the decisions, is \u201cto rebuild.\u201d The language used in the contract is \u201cremove, reconstruct and rebuild.\u201d It would be a strange distinction to say that if the party agreed to remove and repair that he would be compelled to rebuild, even though an act of God intervened and destroyed the structure, and, then to say that where he agreed to remove, rebuild and reconstruct, and the act of God intervened and destroyed the structure, he would not be compelled to rebuild. Taylor on Land, and Ten. (8 Ed.l, Sec. 357.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-5\">If in every contract the condition is implied, though not written therein, viz., that the subject matter of the contract shall continue in existence, as in this case the building, then why does not the act of God always excuse a party from his contract obligation, and why were not the defendants in the 25th Conn, and in the 25th N. Y. cases cited, relieved from the performance of their contract. They agreed to do no more than the defendant in this case, yet the court held that they were not to be relieved from contract obligations. This is not the class of cases for personal services, for the delivery of a specified chattel, where the chattel is lost, destroyed or dies, or where the person to perform services of a personal nature by subsequent cause is prevented; nor is it a case where a person agrees to sign in a certain hall or building which is afterwards destroyed, because in all such cases, a clear distinction is apparent from the one at bar.

If, in the act of removal, or before, a part of the material composing the structure was lost, then it became necessary in the act of restoring and rebuilding, which the defendant at his own expense undertook to do, that he supply such material necessary in the reconstruction and rebuilding of said building. And there was no less a duty incumbent upon him because the building was entirely demolished. <em>School Dist.

This is an inaccurate expression, because where it is an answer to a complaint of an alleged breach of contract that the thing done or left undone was so by the \u2018act of God;\u2019 what is meant, is, that it was not within the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-8\">By the modern understanding of the law we are not bound to seek for a general definition of the term \u201cact of God,\u201d or <em>vis major, </em>but only to ascertain what kind of events were within the contemplation of the parties; this becomes apparent if one attempts to frame a definition of the term \u201cact of God.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-9\">We cannot arrive at a more distinct conception than this: \u201cAn event which, as between the parties, and for the purpose of the matter in hand, cannot be definitely foreseen or controlled.\u201d Pollock, Principles of Contracts, page 362.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-10\">This being the English rule in cases similar to the one at bar we can see but little cogency in counsel for plaintiffs arguing for, and citing the English rule as to repair between landlord and tenant, for if the argument would not tend to support the proposition in England, how much less available is it here in this country where the law of landlord and tenant has been so largely modified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-11\">An American case in point is <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Byron, </em>27 N.

The board, in performance of the agreement on its part, on the 12th day of November, 1895, conveyed the school lot to the railway company, w7hich then took possession, constructed its road over the same, and has continued in its. occupation. And the defendant performed all the stipulations of the contract on his part, except the one by which he agreed to remove the school house to the-new site and there reconstruct and rebuild it. Hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ing failed and refused to perform that part of his agreement, the board proceeded to, and did erect on' the new site, at a cost of $1,349, a new school house exactly like the one that was on the lot conveyed to the railway company, except the addition of a cupola, which cost fifty dollars. The reasonable cost of building a school house on the new site, of the same size and material as the one which the defendant agreed to remove, reconstruct and rebuild there, it is agreed in the statement of facts, would be one thousand dollars. After having made due demand of the defendant, the board of education brought the action below to recover, as its damages for his breach of the contract, the amount expended in the building of the new school/ house. The defense, which is admitted to be true, is based solely on the ground that on the 28th day of November, 1895,&gt; the school house mentioned in the contract was blown down and demolished by a violent wind storm so that it \u201ccould not, as a school house,, be removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The effect of the storm, it is claimed, rendered im-' possible the performance by the defendant of that stipulation of the contract by which he undertook to remove the school house and reconstruct and rebuild it on the new site, because its existence and identity as a building were destroyed, and that discharged him from all liability on his undertaking. It appears to be accepted by the authorities that, as a rule, there is an implied condition in executory agreements, to the effect that their performance shall not be rendered impossible by the intervention of unforeseen,accidental and uncontrollable superior agencies, and that their performance will be excused when it is prevented by such agency; as where there is a contract for the delivery of specific property at a future time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>and before tbe time of delivery arrives, tbe property is destroyed by inevitable accident. But, it is an important part of that rule, that tke_\\intervention of such inevitable accident will not excuse performance when the essential purposes of the contract are still capable of substantial accomplishment, although a literal performance has become physically impossible. 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d ed., 14=8 and cases there cited. <em>White </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>26 Me., 361, 368; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>28 N. Y., 217, 223; <em>Robson </em>v. <em>Mississippi River Logging Co., </em>61 Fed. Rep., 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The impossibility of performance of the contract by the defendant is supposed to have arisen from the fact that, as the building was blown down, it could not thereafter be removed \u201cas a school house,\u201d that is, as a <em>standing building. </em>But, to remove it in that wray was not exactly the obligation of the contract. The school building is spoken of in the\u201d contract as the thing to be removed, and not as designating the manner of removal. It is practicable to remove a building intact; but that is not the only way. It may be removed, within the common understanding, by taking the material and reconstructing or rebuilding it at another locality. Which method w-ould, in this instance, have been the more practicable and less expensive, does not appear. But the latter appears to have been in the contemplation of the parties; for, the contract is not only that the defendant should remove the school building from ydiere it stood, but also that he should <em>reconstruct </em>and <em>rebuild </em>it on the new site, so that it should be in suitable and proper condition for school purposes. To '^reconstruct is to rebuild, and to rebuild is to \u201cbuild up again; to build or construct after having been demolished.\u201d Century Dictionary. Nor is the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ing of the term restricted to the erection of the new building on the site of the old one. So that, notwithstanding the school house was blown down by a storm, it remained possible for the defendant to reconstruct and rebuild it on the new school site and thus perform his contract, not only substantially but strictly and exactly. This construction of the contract is strongly accentuated by reference to the provision for removing tbe wood house and out buildings. These buildings probably being small wooden structures, the agreement with respect to them is, simply that the defendant shall remove them to a proper place on the new site and there put them in proper condition. The absence of any stipulation to <em>reconstruct </em>or <em>rebuild </em>them, shows that those terms were used understanding^ and accurately with respect to the school house. It seems evident, looking to the entire agreement, that the essential purpose which the parties had in mind was, that there should be placed by the defendant, without expense to the board of education, the same facilities in the way of buildings for carrying on the public school there, that existed at the time of the contract on the lot then owned and in use by the board. And if, because it was cheaper to do so, or for other reason, the defendant had constructed on the new site entirely new buildings, equivalent of the old ones, that would have been a substantial compliance with his contract, which the board of education could not refuse to accept. The most favorable view that can be taken of the case for the defendant is, that under the contract two disitinct modes of performance were open to him; one by removing the school house as a standing building by means of jacks and rollers, or other appliances, the other by tearing it down and using the material for its reconstruction, either of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>which he was at liberty to adopt, and either of which, it may be conceded, would have been a sufficient compliance with his contract. Though the former mode of performance became impossible, the latter was not.. And/\u201cit can hardly admit of contradiction,\u201d said the-vice-chancellor, in <em>Barkworth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>4 Drewry, 1, 24-25, that where a party is allowed at his option, to-perform his contract in \u201cone or the other of two modes; and one of them becomes impossible by the act of God he is bound to perform it in the other mode.\u201d And see <em>State </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>7 Ohio, 171-172. This rule rests upon the substantial reason that, so long as the contract is capable of performance in any mode contemplated by the parties, its performance cannot be said to have become impossible. A clearer case fob the application of the rule than the one before us can hardly be conceived. Beside, the act of God, so-called, which excuses the performance of a contract because that has become impossible, does not necessarily discharge the party from the obligations arising from the contract, except, it may be, when the contract is wholly executory on both sides. If an artist contracts to paint a picture for ten thousand dollars received from his patron, and thereafter becomes incapacitated from blindness to fulfill his promise, by what right is he justified in claiming the money? We are not aware of any principle, and have not been referred to any adjudicated case, that would give absolution from the obligations of a contract to a party who has received from the other full consideration for a promise which the former has become unable to fulfill, and at the same time protect him in the enjoyment of the consideration paid. The act of God may properly lift from his shoulders the burden of performance, but has not yet been extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>so as to enable Mm to keep the other man\u2019s property for nothing. \u25a0 It is plainly apparent from the contract in hand, that the parties, as the basis of the agreement, estimated the value of the lot conveyed by the board of education to the railway company to be as much more than that of the lot conveyed to the board as it would cost to place on the latter a school house, in suitable and proper condition for school purposes, and other conveniences for a public school, equivalent to those on the lot owned by the board when the contract was made. And, in so far as the defendant has failed to do those things, he has received from the board a valuable consideration which he retains, and for which he has not given what he promised, nor anything whatever. It appears from the agreed statement of facts that the reasonable cost of doing what the defendant so failed to do, is one thousand dollars, which amount the plaintiff expended in the fall of 1896, toward placing a school house on the newly acquired site, after demand on the defendant to perform his contract in that behalf, and his failure to do so. We think the judgments below should be reversed, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b545-7\">Davis, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArO\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The general rule Avhich is so clearly stated in the majority opiMon is incontrovertible. There is an exception to it, however, which is equally Avell recognized. It is thus formulated in 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 2nd ed., 590: \u201cIt has long been conceded that where a contract is entered into, of a continuing character, or to be performed at a future time, dependent upon the continued existence of a particular person or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>thing, or the continuing ability of the obligor to perform, subsequent death, destruction, or disability will excuse the obligor from compliance with the terms of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u25a0 It seems to me that the construction put upon the terms of this contract is forced and unwarranted by the language of the agreement. These are the words of the contract: \u201cSaid James B. Townsend further agrees within said time, to remove the <em>present school house, </em>* * * and rebuild and reconstruct the <em>said </em>building, so that <em>it </em>will be in <em>suitable and proper condition for school </em>purposesTownsend does not agree here to build a <em>new </em>school house. He only agrees to <em>remove </em>the <em>present </em>school house. He does, not agree to remove the materials when it ceases to be a school house, and to rebuild and reconstruct the building from these materials. He agrees to remove the present school house, and to rebuild and reconstruct the <em>said </em>building, that is, the present building,, so that <em>it, </em>that is the present building, will be in suitable and proper condition for school purposes. \u201cRebuild\u201d does not always mean to build anew. It has a very common secondary meaning, for example, \u201c2. To make extensive repairs and alterations in.\u201d Standard Dictionary. From these considerations it appears to me to be the clearly expressed intention of the parties to this agreement that Townsend should remove the school house to its new site and put <em>it, </em>the-identical school house, \u201cin suitable and proper condition for school purposes.\u201d That is the natural and obvious import of their language. If Townsend\u2019s contract obligation was to build a new school house, why should he be required to put it in suitable and proper-condition for school purposes? The condition is implied in the obligation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The argument that the railroad company has the plaintiff\u2019s land without having given all of the agreed consideration therefor, has little weight with me. It is based on an assumption of the very thing in dispute here, namely, that ToAvnsend agreed to re-erect the school house, and not merely to remove it and put it in condition for school purposes. If he did not agree to rebuild the structure, in case it was destroyed by the act of God, then the argument of the majority falls to the ground; for the plaintiffs have already received all of the consideration which he was to give in the exchange of property in such case. Other objections might be urged against the reasoning of the majority; but no good purpose would be served by extending the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In my opinion, when the tornado destroyed the school house, Townsend was released from the obligation to remove that building and to put it in suitable and proper condition for school purposes; and therefore I maintain that the judgment of the circuit court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
