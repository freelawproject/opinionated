Petitioner is seeking enforcement of its orders. Respondent urges us to deny enforcement because as it asserts, the findings upon which petitioner relies to support its order are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">Respondent is a California public utility corporation engaged in supplying illuminating gas and electricity for industrial, commercial, and domestic use to the residents of the City and County of San Diego, California. It is admitted that respondent is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">The trial examiner found and, for the most part, petitioner relied on the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">Cosby M. Newsom, a former employee of respondent and against whom the charged unfair labor practice is alleged to-have been directed, was one of five instrument technicians employed by respondent. Respondent had a union contract with many employees. Instrument technicians were not covered by that contract. In August or September, 1950, Newsom returned from a trip to Los Angeles. He informed his fellow technicians that higher rates of pay were received by instrument technicians employed in the same industry in Los Angeles. The opinion was expressed by one member of the group that the higher wage obtaining in Los Angeles was due to the fact that the workers there were unionized. A discussion was had as to the advisability of having the Union represent them as a bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">A few days prior to January 15, 1951, on reporting for work, Newsom and two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>other instrument technicians informed Harold L. Warden, instrument engineer, and their immediate superior, that the instrument technicians felt they should receive a raise in pay and were considering asking the Union to represent them. Warden expressed sympathy with the idea and informed them that he would aid them in furthering their union program. Warden contacted two other instrument technicians and informed them that their only chance of securing higher wages was through union representation and that he would assist them in getting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Warden contacted Kalins, his immediate superior, a safety engineer, and informed him of the instrument technicians\u2019 plans to join the Union. Warden and Kalins contacted Hathaway, superintendent of the electrical department, Kalins\u2019 immediate superior. Hathaway requested a meeting with the instrument technicians. It was held later that day. Present were Hathaway, the five instrument technicians, Warden and Kalins. Hathaway inquired who was the employees\u2019 spokesman. He was informed that no selection had been made. Hathaway inquired whether the efforts of the five employees to get union representation was prompted by any grievance other than the wage question. He was informed that there was none. Plathaway expressed the opinion that the men should have sought wage increases through normal company channels rather than attempting to enlist the aid of the Union and informed them that had they done so he would have given the matter speedy consideration but that inasmuch as the company\u2019s contract with the Union had more than a year to run he doubted whether the Union could get the men any relief for a long period of time. Hathaway stated that he had no objection to the men joining the Union but thought that respondent\u2019s top management might object, stating several reasons why he thought they would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The instrument technicians decided to have the Union represent them. A request for representation was formulated, copies of which were sent to the Union and one to respondent\u2019s vice-president in charge of operations. Upon arriving at the plant the morning following the distribution of the request, Warden made a statement to Newsom and Fowler as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u201c * * * our [instrument technicians] position didn\u2019t look too good, and that if he [Warden] were in our shoes he would get these affairs in order because there is a possibility we may all be looking for other jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Other statements were made by Warden to the different instrument technicians at different times, such as: \u201c * * * that the instrument technicians would find it difficult to obtain employment as instrument technicians elsewhere because Warden doubted whether they had the necessary qualifications to combat the competition they would encounter; that * * * they would meet with strong opposition in their organizational move.\u201d This testimony was given credence by the trial examiner over contradictory testimony by Warden. The statements made by the officials of respondent were construed by the men as meaning they would lose their jobs if they continued their union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">\u201cHathaway testified, and his testimony with respect to this meeting is in substantial accord with the testimony of the others present, that after Kalins and Warden had concluded their presentation of a proposed training program for the instrument technicians and the plan had been unanimously approved, he inquired of Kalins and Warden how the instrument technicians were performing their tasks; that Kalins and Warden replied that all were doing satisfactory work except Newsom; that he then asked each person present for his opinion of Newsom\u2019s work; that each replied it was not satisfactory and each added that in his opinion Newsom \u2018would not become a satisfactory instrument man and should not be in the training course which was about to start\u2019; that he then posed the question: \u2018Should we terminate Newsom?\u2019; that each person replied in the affirmative; and that he thereupon instructed Kalins to discharge Newsom.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">\u201cOn January 31, Newsom, accompanied by Warden, went to Kalins\u2019 office where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Newsom was informed by Kalins, \u2018you can apply for a transfer to another department through personnel, you can resign and probably get letters of recommendation, or we will terminate you within two weeks.\u2019 When Newsom asked Kalins the reason for the aforesaid action, Kalins stated that Newsom\u2019s services were unsatisfactory and then proceeded to enumerate certain incidents which occurred during his tenure of employment. After a brief discussion regarding the said incidents, Newsom requested Kalins to call a meeting of all the instrument technicians and to inform them of the disciplinary action and the reasons therefor. When Kalins asked the purpose of such an unusual procedure, Newsom replied that the other men \u2018were in the middle of a move to organize\u2019 and therefore the action taken against him had \u2018a bearing on the rest of the members of the department\u2019. Thereupon, Kalins summoned the other four men to his office, informed them of the action taken against Newsom, and then stated the purported reasons therefor. Despite Newsom\u2019s detailed explanation that the incidents cited for his seeming neglect of duty took place over a three-year period, that none was of recent date, that he previously had satisfactorily explained to Warden\u2019s superiors, at the time Warden complained to them about the incidents, that the incidents were of little or no consequence. Kalins remarked that Newsom could no longer remain in the department. Kalins refused to recede from his adamant position to rid his department of Newsom even though, in response to his invitation to the instrument technicians to express their .views with respect to the said disciplinary action, Fowler said, to quote Kalins, \u2018something to the effect that the men were all together in this thing and that he felt in his (Fowler\u2019s) own mind that the company possibly was trying to fire Newsom in order to break up their attempt at unionization; that they could, therefore, take it to the National Labor Relations Board.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u201cNewsom refused to resign or to request a transfer to another department. On February 15, the respondent, because New-som refused to take the aforesaid action, discharged him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOhe\">Respondent produced testimony supporting its discharge of Newsom on grounds other than his union activities. The trier of the facts gave credence to the evidence supporting the union activity charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Respondent insists that it discharged Newsom because his work was unsatisfactory. The fact that Newsom had been in the employ of respondent for the greater part of three years and was discharged two weeks after his union activities began of itself makes the discharge of Newsom suspect. By this we are not suggesting that suspicion alone can sustain a charge of unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The acts of omission and commission which respondent allege as motivating it in discharging Newsom extend over a period of three years. He, Newsom, was in the employ of respondent for nearly three years, holding a position of an instrument technician during practically all' of the time. He had become, at the time of discharge, senior technician. During this period of job tenure, especially during the early part of his employment, officials of respondent expressed satisfaction with Newsom\u2019s work:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">\u201cJohn T. Hardway, respondent\u2019s efficiency engineer until the end of August 1950 when he re-entered the United States Navy, * * * \u25a0 [upon returning] to visit the plant in December 1950, he told Newsom: \u2018It looks like this war may involve us too, and if you and the rest of us return, remember this, Newt, there is a place for you in the instrument department. I don\u2019t care whether you go back in the Merchant Marine, the Navy, or what, but there is a place for you in the instrument department.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">\u201cStation Chief Campbell, * * * told Newsom about a week before the effective date of Newsom\u2019s discharge that he should not be \u2018broken hearted\u2019 over his plight, adding that he, Campbell, had recommended Newsom very highly a year or so before and was sure that Newsom would make his mark in the world, for Newsom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>was strong, versatile and able. Respondent\u2019s respect for Newsom\u2019s ability as a technician was likewise displayed around the first of 1951, \u2018before respondent learned of Newsom\u2019s leadership in the union movement. Warden assigned Newsom to certain \u2018routine\u2019 work, explaining that he disliked burdening Newsom with that type -of work but Newsom was the only man in the department capable of doing that work satisfactorily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The faults found with Newsom\u2019s work, with the exception of alleged errors in the preparations of some records, did not occur near the date of discharge. The most recent derelictions charged were not discovered until after discharge; manifestly these could not have figured in the cause of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Warden, Newsom\u2019s immediate superior, in 1951 informed Newsom that he was the only man who could handle routine work at both stations and Newsom was selected to instruct Webb in the routine work at one of the stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">As hereinabove pointed out, Hardway, at one time an efficiency engineer for respondent, in December, 1950, assured New-som that there would always be a place for him in the instrument department. Hardway later was one of the officials who criticized Newsom\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Hathaway testified that he decided to discharge Newsom because of the unfavorable reports given him at the January 30 meeting. Respondent urges that these reports were the motivation for Newsom\u2019s discharge by Hathaway, but this contention loses its force in the face of Hathaway\u2019s testimony that before that date he had asked permission from Noble to discharge Newsom. This discussion between Hathaway and Noble occurred on or about the time respondent first learned of Newsom\u2019s union activity. This evidence in addition to the statement by Noble that the company might have objections to the technicians joining the Union and the statement of Warden that the technicians might have to look for new jobs is substantial. From it, and other evidence hereinbefore detailed, petitioner could reasonably draw the inference that the reason for Newsom\u2019s discharge was his union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Respondent correctly asserts that under the requirements of the Labor Management Act of 1947 appellate courts are required to take a \u201cnew look\u201d in determining whether substantial evidence exists to support a finding. It is no longer sufficient if some substantial evidence exists. Such evidence must withstand scrutiny with an eye focused on its relation to all the evidence in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Of course this does not imply that we are to judge the credibility of witnesses. That function still remains with the trier of the facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the instant case, as in most contested cases, we are called upon to consider conflicts in the testimony given by opposing witnesses. Even though we would have, had we been the trier of the facts, resolved the conflict differently, we cannot do so as a reviewing court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The testimony supporting the petitioner\u2019s orders is not inherently improbable nor is the evidence produced by respondent so overwhelming as to render the testimony on which petitioner relies untrustworthy. Reviewing the whole record we are not left with a conviction that a mistake has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Respondent urges that petitioner erroneously relied on statements made by Warden because he, Warden, was not in a position to bind the respondent. The activities of Warden in association with other officers of respondent conclusively show that he was acting for respondent and with its full knowledge. He was the go-between; he carried the messages and was present at and took part in the discussions which culminated in the discharge of Newsom.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">We have given consideration to respondent\u2019s arguments that an employer has a right to discharge for any cause except for union activity; that union activity does not protect employees; that a wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>latitude should be accorded an employer in the matter of discharge. These arguments are pertinent in the consideration of the record as a whole in making a determination as to whether substantial evidence exists to support the findings of petitioner. In our opinion these considerations do not drain the findings made by petitioner of substantiality. Respondent stresses the argument that in discharging Newsom it was acting in the interest of the general public in removing from its working force an incompetent man, whose careless work in an important job might produce power failure and thus occasion loss and inconvenience to. thousands of people. That argument does not ring true. The danger, if such it was, must have been apparent and more acute during the three years of Newsom\u2019s employment. Experience must have made him more competent as the years went by. Why did respondent so suddenly stress this danger so near the time Newsom began his union activities?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The order of enforcement is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">.
