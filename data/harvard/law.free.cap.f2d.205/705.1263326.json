A dispute arose over the fare. Tarman followed appellee from the cab and knocked him down. There was evidence that Tar-man then drove the cab over appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>right leg. This appeal is from judgments against both Tarman and the Company for personal' injuries said to have been caused by the assault and by negligent operation of the cab. The District Court directed a verdict against Tarman.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Appellants contend that appellee\u2019s status at the time of his injuries, and the duty they owed him, were jury questions. But we think it clear that there was a continuing carrier-passenger relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Though appellants concede that \u201ctitle to this taxicab was held in the name of\u201d the Company and that it was registered in the name of the Company with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and the Public Utilities Commission, both appellants testified that Tarman owned the cab. We think actual ownership immaterial in the circumstances. In Harlem Taxicab Ass\u2019n v. Nemesh, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 124, 191 F.2d 459, 461, we said \u201cAn association\u2019s name and insignia raise a presumption that it owns or controls a cab on which they appear, but this is decisive only in the absence of contrary evidence.\u201d There the injured plaintiff was not a passenger. We pointed out that \u201cAn association of cab owners is estopped to deny liability to an injured passenger who has been induced by the association\u2019s representations to ride in a cab that bears its name. Rhone v. Try Me Cab Co., 62 App.D.C. 201, 65 F.2d 834.\u201d In the Rhone case the association did not own the cab but its insignia were painted on it. A passenger was induced by the association\u2019s advertising to telephone its office for a cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In the instant case the Company\u2019s legend, telephone number, and distinctive color scheme were on the cab. We think it immaterial that appellee did not telephone for the cab but hailed it. When a company\u2019s insignia on a cab suggest ownership and consequent responsibility, it is estopped as against a - passenger to deny responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The evidence on scope of employment was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict against the Company. In Dilli v. Johnson, 71 App.D.C. 139, 140, 107 F.2d 669, 670, an employee in charge of a restaurant assaulted a customer. We said \u201cthe jury was justified in finding that the servant * * * was acting within the scope of his employment\u201d even though he \u201cwent beyond the ordinary line of duty\u201d. A carrier\u2019s responsibility for assaults is quite as extensive as a restaurant keeper\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">We have considered appellants\u2019 other contentions and find no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">CLARK, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
