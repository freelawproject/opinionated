We agree with the district court, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed by Judge Ganey, 113 F.Supp. 275, that the company is not a railroad within the meaning of the act but is rather a street railway and bus company operating a local passenger transportation system on, over and under the streets of the city of Philadelphia and the adjacent urban area of its metropolitan district. Compare Mangum v. Capital Traction Co., 59 App.D.C. 241, 39 F.2d 286, and Keffer v. Capital Transit Co., 87 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 183 F.2d 808, which involved the street railway and bus transportation system of the District of Columbia. The district court was, therefore, right in dismissing the appellants\u2019 actions brought against the company under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-23\">The judgments of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
