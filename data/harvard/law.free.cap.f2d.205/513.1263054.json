No federal jurisdiction is asserted on the ground of diversity of citizenship; the sole jurisdictional claim is that a federal question is presented by the record, the determination of which will decide a controversy between the parties involving more than, three thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\">In their brief, page 2, the \u201cappellants predicate this appeal upon the single ground that their complaint alleged a cause of action arising under the Constitution of the United States and that jurisdiction to determine this cause is conferred upon the district court by 28 U.S.C. 1331.\u201d The appellants say nothing about the jurisdictional amount required by said Section 1331 being involved, nor does it appear in the record that such amount is involved in any controversy between the parties. Millions may be involved in a controversy between appellee and some persons not parties to the suit; hut in' what amount the appellants will be affected by the result of this suit is not clearly alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">In their brief, in response to hypothetical questions as to what tax is restrained, what assessment is restrained, what levy is restrained, what collection is restrained, the appellants say: \u201cThe answer is plain; the only thing which is sought to be restrained is a \u2018system\u2019 and only so far as such system violates the statutes of Texas. All lawful acts of the appellee are left untouched by the relief sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-20\">In addition to the absence of the requisite jurisdictional amount, we think a definite federal question, integrated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>record on which the decision of the case would turn for one side or the other, is also lacking. Therefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
