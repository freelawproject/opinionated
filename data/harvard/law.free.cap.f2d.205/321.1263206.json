Oil petition of appellant, the action was removed from the Superior Court to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Southern Division. There appellant answered, a jury trial was had, a verdict for appellee for $3,000 was returned, and a judgment was entered on the verdict. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-21\">The principal question is whether the evidence warranted the verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-22\">Appellant does not contend that the amount of the verdict ($3,000) was excessive, if the evidence warranted a verdict for appellee, but contends that the evidence did not warrant any verdict for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-23\">There was evidence to the following effect: At all pertinent times, appellant operated a retail merchandise store in Oakland, California, and maintained a parking lot and a driveway adjacent to the store, the driveway constituting the principal means of ingress to and egress from the parking lot. The driveway crossed and occupied part of a public sidewalk. Appellant\u2019s customers used the parking lot and the driveway, including that part of the driveway which was on the sidewalk, and did so with appellant\u2019s knowledge and consent. On June 1, 1950, between 3:45 and 4:00 P.M., while walking on the sidewalk and attempting to cross that part of the driveway which was on the sidewalk, ap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>pellee stepped into and upon some oily substance which had been spilled or deposited and permitted to remain in that part of the driveway. Appellee was thereby caused to, and did, slip, fall and suffer the injuries for which she sought to recover damages in this action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee did not see the oily substance before she stepped into and upon it, nor did she know that there was any such substance in that part of the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The evidence did' not show the exact length of time the oily substance remained in that part of the driveway before the accident. However, there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that it was spilled or deposited in that part of the driveway shortly after 2:00 P.M. on June 1, 1950, and remained there until the accident occurred \u2014 a period of about one hour and 45 minutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore the jury could properly find that appellant should have discovered the oily substance and should have removed it from that part of the driveway before the accident; that appellant\u2019s failure to do so was negligence; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that appel-lee\u2019s injuries were caused by that negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Appellant contends that there was no evidence that appellant, by its affirmative act, created a condition which was likely to cause harm to persons using the sidewalk. There is no merit in this contention; for, as indicated above, there was evidence that appellant maintained and knowingly permitted its customers to use a driveway which occupied a part of the sidewalk, thereby creating a condition which was likely to cause harm to persons using that part of the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Appellant contends that there was no evidence that it had knowledge or constructive notice of the presence of the oily substance in that part of the driveway which was on the sidewalk. There is no merit in this contention; for, as indicated above, there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the oily substance remained in that part of the driveway for a period of about one hour and 45 minutes before the accident. The jury could properly find that that was long enough to charge appellant with notice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">We conclude that the evidence warranted \u00bfhe verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Appellant requested the District Court to give the jury an instruction reading, in part, as follows; \u201cNo affirmative duty rested on [appellant], as the owner of property abutting said sidewalk or otherwise, to keep the sidewalk in a safe condition.\u201d The District Court refused to give the quoted part of the requested instruction. Appellant contends that the refusal was error. This contention is rejected for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">The District Court was not, nor are we, concerned with any part of the sidewalk except the part occupied by the driveway. Appellant \u2014 which (as the evidence showed) maintained and knowingly permitted its customers to use the driveway \u2014 had a legal duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence in keeping that part of the sidewalk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>in a proper and safe condition for the passage of pedestrians rightfully using it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court, therefore, properly refused to give the quoted part of the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-24\">. Appellant raised this question by a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence and by a motion to set aside the verdict and the judgment and for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. The evidence showed the character and extent of appellee\u2019s injuries. To describe them here would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">. Peter Kristovich (an employee of appellant), whose duty it was to inspect that part of the driveway, testified that he inspected it \u201cabout two to three o\u2019clock in the afternoon\u201d of June 1, 1950; that he did not \u201csee any oil deposit\u201d in that part of the driveway at that time; and that he did not inspect that part of the driveway again until after the accident. Appellee testified that the oily substance was \u201cdusty\u201d and \u201chad dirt on it\u201d when she stepped into and upon it \u2014 between 3:45 and 4:00 P.M. \u2014 thus indicating that it had been there for some time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"><em>. </em>Granucci v.
