The former would have us hold that it need not account for profits or damages despite the finding of infringement, the latter that its award is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-24\">Continental, a Delaware corporation, was organized in April, 1933, as a subsidiary of a corporation which had been manufacturing alcohol since 1912. With the repeal of prohibition in December, 1933, Continental began to sell Dixie Belle and Dixie Beaux gin to the public,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> engaging in an extensive advertising campaign on behalf of Dixie Belle in 1933 and 1934. On February 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>1934, Continental registered, the trademarks Dixie Belle and Dixie Beaux with the United States Patent Office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although both marks were to be applied to other distilled alcoholic beverages as well as gin, we are here chiefly concerned with the use of the mark Dixie Belle on gin and gin products.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Century, an Illinois corporation, was organized in November, 1933, as a subsidiary of a grain and feed corporation. It began the sale of bottled liquors early in 1934 and on September 24, 1934, filed an application in the Patent Office for registration of the trade-mark Dixiana, claiming to have used the mark since September 10, 1934. Continental filed a notice of opposition thereto within two months. On March 9, 1935, Century applied for another registration, this time for the trade-mark Dixie Dew, claiming to have used the mark since February 20, 1935. Again Continental promptly filed a notice of opposition to the application alleging, as in the case of Dixiana, that this mark infringed its own prior-registered marks, Dixie Belle and Dixie Beaux. On October 28, 1936, after the taking of evidence, both notices of opposition were sustained by the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences. These decisions were affirmed by the Assistant Commissioner of Patents on July 2, 1937. In the meantime Continental had tried without success to persuade Century to discontinue voluntarily its use of the marks Dixiana and Dixie Dew.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Century manufactured and sold Dixie Dew whiskey and Dixiana gin until June 30, 1939, the date on which we affirmed the lower court\u2019s interlocutory decree. Dixie Dew whiskey constituted approximately 30% of the total number of cases of all liquors sold by Century during the period covered by the account. In 1943 Century sold its business to another distilling corporation at a substantial profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">On July 28, 1937, Century brought suit against Continental under Section 4915 of the Revised Statutes, as amended,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for a determination of its right to register the two trade-marks. Continental counterclaimed for an injunction and an accounting. The district court, in an interlocutory decree filed June 27, 1938, dismissed the bill on procedural grounds. With respect to the counterclaim the court held that Century\u2019s marks Dixiana and Dixie Dew infringed Continental\u2019s Dixie Belle and Dixie Beaux, that Century\u2019s marks were a color-able imitation of Continental\u2019s, that they were calculated or liable to cause confusion, mistake or deception in the minds of the public, that both Century\u2019s and Continental\u2019s goods were of the same descriptive character and properties and were sold in interstate commerce. It concluded that Century\u2019s use of the marks constituted an infringement and ordered \u201cthe usual accounting\u201d to be taken on reference to a master. On appeal to this court, 1939, 106 F.2d 486, the decree was affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court denied cer-tiorari, 309 U.S. 662, 60 S.Ct. 581, 84 L.Ed. 1010. It is conceded, however, that the propriety of ordering an accounting was not argued during any of the above proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">The accounting before the master commenced early in 1940. In June, 1943, Century moved the district court for a modification of the interlocutory decree, arguing that under the then recently decided case of Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381, it was not liable to Continental for profits on its sales of Dixie Dew whiskey. The motion was denied. The master filed Parts I and II of his re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>port on November 17, 1948, and Part III on February 21, 1951. Altogether almost 10,-000 pages of testimony were taken. On December 20, 1951, the district court entered judgment against Century on Continental\u2019s counterclaim in the amount of $129,296.20. This figure represents 25% of Century\u2019s profits ($110,248.95) on its sales of Dixiana and Dixie Dew products during the accounting period (June 30, 1935, to June 30, 1939), plus interest and costs. The only item of damages to Continental which had been included in the master\u2019s award was disallowed by the court. As stated, Century appeals on the ground that it need pay none of its profits on account of the infringement while Continental is dissatisfied with the award, contending that it is entitled to all Century\u2019s profits on the infringing goods plus several items of damages. Century also argues that the master erred in disallowing certain overhead charges as a deduction from profits. Both parties contest various other items allowed or disallowed by the master and the court below on this accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">This action is governed by Sections 16 and 19 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 96 and 99 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Century\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Century does not, and indeed cannot, dispute the determination of infringement, but argues that it has established that there was no palming off, no fraud and no confusion of source and therefore it should not be held to account for even 25% of its profits on the infringing goods. Reliance is placed on cases holding that while an injunction is proper where an infringement has been found no accounting will be ordered absent a showing of confusion. See, for example, Straus v. Notaseme Hosiery Co., 240 U.S. 179, 36 S.Ct. 288, 60 L.Ed. 590; Durable Toy &amp; Novelty Corp. v. J. Chein &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 1943, 133 F.2d 853, certiorari denied, 320 U.S. 211, 63 S.Ct. 1447, 87 L.Ed. 1849; Coca Cola Co. v. Snowcrest Beverages, Inc., D.C.Mass.1946, 64 F.Supp. 980, affirmed, 1 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 280, certiorari denied, 332 U.S. 809, 68 S.Ct. 110, 92 L.Ed. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Despite a brilliantly presented argument on its behalf Century\u2019s fundamental difficulty of necessity remains, namely, that in order for it to prevail we must reverse the district court\u2019s (and master\u2019s) findings of fact as being clearly erroneous or hold that as a matter of law an accounting should never have been ordered. The facts on which the findings are based and the applicable law do not justify either course.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Under the rule of the Mishawaka case, supra, which it is agreed governs these situations, the infringer, in order to reduce the profits for which he would otherwise be answerable, must show to what extent they are \u201cdemonstrably not attributable to the unlawful use.\u201d The master was aware that Century\u2019s burden was a difficult one, stating that if the equities and burden of proof were reversed he would not hesitate to reduce the recoverable profits even further than he did. He also pointed out that while accuracy in this type of case is impossible of attainment Century had not shown that more than 75% of its profits on Dixie Dew whiskey was not attributable to infringement. The master properly noted that if a windfall is to result from the failure to achieve mathematical precision in gauging the percentage of the infringer\u2019s sales not attributable to confusion it belongs to the wronged, not the wrongdoer. See Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 207, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381. The court below accepted the master\u2019s 25% figure. After an examination of the evidence we cannot say that this constituted clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">It is true, of course, that if the district court in 1938 had refused to order an accounting Century would not have been held liable for a portion of its profits \u2014 assuming the court would not have been reversed on appeal. The fact is that the question of Century\u2019s liability for profits or damages was not argued to the trial court at that time nor to us on appeal. In the circumstances the statute required that an accounting be had. At the very least, it cannot be said that as a matter of law Continental was not entitled to such accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Century contends that we are not bound by the law of the case insofar as the interlocutory decree directed an accounting of profits and damages. We agree that in a proper setting \u2014 one in which there could be no showing of pecuniary harm to the infringed \u2014 it may be the appellate court\u2019s duty to vacate an order of accounting, even after fifteen years\u2019 litigation. In our view this is not such a case. It is Century\u2019s belief that the evidence adduced before the master coupled with the comments of the lower court conclusively show that there was no confusion. As we have earlier stated, under the Mishawaka rule the burden was on Century to prove the fact that its profits were not attributable to the infringement. It is possible that had Continental been saddled with the burden of affirmatively demonstrating the converse it would have presented more evidence of confusion. Be that as it may, the record shows that Century\u2019s own witnesses, many of them trade-witnesses, testified that there was confusion between the brand names Dixie Belle and Dixie Dew and that consumers are aware of brand names, not names of manufacturers, when they purchase liquors. When this fact is coupled with the master\u2019s finding that Dixie Dew was in direct competition with Dixie Belle <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it cannot be contended that the district court, even if it had been gifted with the clairvoyance to foresee what the proofs before the master would show, should, in its interlocutory decree, have denied Continental an accounting as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">Century is very much encouraged by what it calls a finding by the court below that the similarity did not cause confusion. Since this proposition is repeated many times in Century\u2019s briefs and was urged at the oral argument we must, at the risk of unduly burdening this opinion, discuss it rather fully. After the master had submitted his interim report the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>was asked by the parties to pass on certain specific issues which were considered important. The court did so in an opinion filed on December 8, 1949. Eleven principal points were made, some of which affirmed the master\u2019s determinations, some of which reversed him. They were set out in the form of conclusions and were followed by explanatory notes. The third point states: \u201cCentury is not entitled to any deduction for interest on investment.\u201d The master had concluded that while it was inconsistent with the differential or marginal profit theory of accounting <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to allow the infringer interest on its investment in the infringing goods, the case law compelled this result. He therefore allowed Century such interest as a credit. The court refused to accept this proposition, finding that whether interest should be allowed depended on whether the infringement was wilful and deliberate. The trial judge noted that three kinds of infringement are generally recognized in patent and trade-mark cases \u2014 innocent, wilful and fraudulent. After stating that \u201cit certainly was not innocent\u201d, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">\u201cBut in this case there can be no possible question that Century\u2019s conduct was willful, undertaken and persisted in with full knowledge of Continental\u2019s rights, and, if it adds anything, it can also be characterized as deliberate. It was not fraudulent if \u2018fraudulent\u2019 be taken, as it generally is, to mean an intent to deceive the public as to the nature or origin of the goods. In other words, I do not believe that Century intended or expected anyone to buy Dixie Dew bourbon whisky under the impression that they were buying Dixie Belle gin. <em>Nor do I believe that Century intended or expected that the public, in buying Dixie Dew, would think that they were buying a product of the Continental Distilling Company although this result may actually have occurred in a few negligible instances. </em>The fact is that Century thought that it had a good trademark which would sell its goods, that it knew that Continental was building up a reputation by the use of a similar, although not identical, trademark and that it was quite willing to go into very large-scale production and sale of the article, with at least a presumed knowledge that it had no right to it, and taking the risk it might be held an infringer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">\u201cTherefore, inasmuch as this infringement was willful, I think the only proper and logical course is to disallow all interest on investment as a deduction.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">It is the italicized language in this note which is seized upon as indicating that the district court found that the similarity did not cause confusion. While stating his belief that <em>Century did not intend or believe </em>that its whiskey would be purchased under the impression it was Continental\u2019s gin or a product of Continental at all, the district judge did not expressly say or inferentially hold that the similarity between the Century Dixie Dew name and that of Continental\u2019s Dixie Belle did not cause confusion. Clearly the court neither purported nor intended to make such a finding, particularly in view of the fact that the master in his interim report, which had been submitted to the court prior to the rendition of the above opinion, discussed at some length the factors which he believed indicated that confusion with or response to the \u201cdiffused appeal\u201d of Dixie Belle favorably affected sales of Dixie Dew. These factors included, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ccompanion-product confusion\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and \u201cresponse to \u2018familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ring\u2019 or sound of name.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if the district court\u2019s above-quoted language is taken to be a <em>finding, </em>as claimed by Century, that there was no confusion of source in the sense that purchasers of Dixie Dew whiskey believed they were buying a Continental product (which is clearly not justified), Century falls far short of having established that there was no confusion between the infringing and infringed marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Century takes the view that in the absence of confusion of source there is no basis for an award of profits or damages. This is not, in our opinion, a correct statement of the law if \u201cconfusion of source\u201d is taken to mean a conscious belief on the part of the buying public that Dixie Dew whiskey was manufactured by Continental.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the majority in the Mishawaka case, recognized that an infringer may be liable for profits realized because of a \u201cresponse to the diffused appeal of the plaintiff\u2019s symbol,\u201d 316 U.S. 206, 62 S.Ct. 1024. Furthermore, 316 U.S. at page 207, 62 S.Ct. at page 1025, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201cIn the absence of his proving the contrary, it promotes honesty and comports with experience to assume that the wrongdoer who makes profits from the sales of goods bearing \u00e1 mark belonging to another was enabled to do so because he was drawing upon the good will generated by that mark.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">As noted, the master was cognizant of the distinction between confusion of source in the narrow, restricted sense and the broader concept of diffused appeal. Note 9, supra. He was equally aware that there could be a recovery for impairment of the good will of the Dixie Belle trademark, although he disallowed damages on this ground because he felt they would duplicate his award of px-ofits.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">If, on the other hand, confusion of source as used by Century has a broader meaning than that we have ascribed to it above, i. e., if it is the equivalent of response to diffused appeal, loss of good will, etc., we are unable to agree, from the evidence, that the order to account should he vacated as a matter of law or that the award should he reversed because clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Century also feels aggrieved because the master and the court below refused to charge certain non-variable expenses (overhead) against profits on Dixie Dew. Despite the fact that during the four years embraced by the accounting Dixie Dew was Century\u2019s best seller, gross sales total-ling $6,175,599.24 by Century\u2019s own figures, it was claimed that it had sustained a loss of $21,861.23 on that product.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As a starting point in computing Century\u2019s profits the master used the various bookkeeping and accounting entries appearing in that corporation\u2019s books. It was found that many items in \u201ccost of sales\u201d, \u201cselling ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>penses\u201d and \u201cgeneral and administrative expenses\u201d \u2014 all of which, of course, served to reduce the amount of profits attributable to Dixie Dew \u2014 were of a fixed or non-variable character and would have been incurred even had Century not manufactured the infringing goods, e. g., taxes, depreciation and insurance. Other items were variable, increasing as production increased, e. g., supplies and raw materials. A third class consisted of items which were partly variable and partly non-variable, i. e., which up to a point would be incurred in any event but which would increase as that point (of production) was passed. Included in this mixed group, too, were items of expense which, in the words of the master, \u201c[varied] with increased production but not in direct proportion thereto.\u201d Typical items in this class were labor and fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The master, applying the so-called differential cost or marginal profit theory, disallowed all non-variable expenses, allowing the expenses in the mixed group only to the extent that they were incurred because of the production of Dixie Dew.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He observed that as matter of internal bookkeeping or accounting such charges would be proper but was of the opinion that they should not be permitted to offset profits on this accounting, particularly since allocations of these expenses to Dixie Dew were either arbitrary or \u201cmatters of interpretive accounting subject to the choice or whim of Century\u2019s accountants.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He correctly noted that the use of the differential cost theory made possible the discovery of concealed or incidental profits\u2014 in the form of charges which but for the infringement would have been made against the non-infringing part of Century\u2019s business \u2014 properly allocable to Dixie Dev/.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">We are told by Century that the differential cost theory is inapplicable to this case because no fraud has been shown. The authorities do not indicate that a finding of fraud is required. In the leading case of Tilghman v. Proctor, 125 U.S. 136, where this theory was applied, there appears to have been no showing of fraud\u2014 on the contrary, interest was disallowed plaintiff because the validity of the infringed patent was \u201cin earnest controversy.\u201d See also Christensen v. National Brake &amp; Electric Co., D.C.E.D.Wis.1926, 10 F.2d 856, modified, 7 Cir., 1930, 38 F.2d 721, certiorari denied, 282 U.S. 864, 51 S.Ct. 36, 75 L.Ed. 764.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> An alternative theory would permit the infringer to allocate all items of overhead and fixed expenses on a percentage basis <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to the infringing goods. Although this method is used in many accountings,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> possibly for convenience and expedition (the differential cost theory requires a much more painstaking and time-consuming accounting, often unjustified), we are not persuaded that the master erred in refusing to apply it in this case in preference to the differential cost theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The remaining points raised by Century may be disposed of briefly. They relate to the disallowance as deductions of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>items of non-variable expenses and the partial disallowance of items which were variable only to a degree. Typical totally disallowed items were fire and tornado insurance, real estate taxes and labor on repairs. Under the differential cost theory, which we approve in this case, these fixed expenses were properly disallowed. Other items \u2014 salesmen\u2019s salaries and expense, general sales office expense and general and administrative expense \u2014 were partially allowed to the extent that they were found to be attributable to the production of Dixie Dew. We perceive no error in this phase of the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Century makes specific objections to the manner of computing deductions for freight charges. The court below, while recognizing that freight was properly allocable as an expense, held that because of Century\u2019s failure to keep records of the exact amounts of freight charges incurred on Dixie Dew products \u2014 even though it had notice that it might ultimately have to account as an infringer \u2014 the court would assume that Dixie Dew was shipped in carload lots only. While this assumption reduced the actual freight charges incurred, under the circumstances we cannot say the court below erred. The same is true of the disallowance of estimated discounts, returns and allowances. These, however, were rejected in toto because, unlike freight, there was no proved minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">After an examination of the applicable law we affirm the disallowance of interest on Century\u2019s investment in Dixie Dew and of federal income and excess profits taxes. There is likewise no merit in Century\u2019s argument that the cost of the accounting should be borne by Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Continental\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"A3K\">Continental complains because it was awarded only 25% of Century\u2019s profits on sales of Dixie Dew. Its specific assignments of error are two: (1) that the trial court misconceived the quantum of proof imposed on infringers by Mishawaka and (2) that Century has failed to demonstrate that 75% or any other part of its profits on the infringing goods was not attributable to the infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">The first argument \u2014 that the use of the word \u201cdemonstrably\u201d in the Mishawaka case imports a higher standard of proof than the usual fair preponderance of evidence rule of civil cases \u2014 was considered and rejected by the district judge. We agree with him that \u201cdemonstrably\u201d was used merely as meaning \u201ccapable of being shown or made evident by reasoning or proof\u201d and therefore hold that the Mishawaka case does not impose a different burden of proof on infringers than the customary civil rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">As to the master\u2019s finding, adopted by the trial court, that Century has proved 75% of its profits on Dixie Dew to be non-attributable to the infringement, it must be borne in mind that he was in close touch with this case for many years, that he heard dozens of witnesses and took thousands of pages of testimony. His report is lucid, fair and well reasoned. In arriving at the 25% figure he found many factors which indicated non-confusion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While we might conceivably have arrived at a different figure had we been the triers of fact, a review of the evidence compels the conclusion that the master\u2019s determination is not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">It is next argued that Continental was improperly disallowed damages on account of the infringement. Continental sought three items of alleged damages: (1) loss due to depression of price of Dixie Belle, (2) loss of profit on loss of sales during the two and one half years\u2019 post-in-</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>fringement period<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and (3) loss or impairment of Dixie Belle\u2019s good will. As to the first, the master found Continental\u2019s proofs \u201centirely inadequate\u201d and disallowed it. He also awarded no damages for the third item, stating that there was \u201cno convincing evidence in the record of permanent injury to, or impairment of, Dixie Belle\u2019s goodwill, other than loss of sales.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He somewhat reluctantly permitted Continental to recover 13% of its claimed losses of profit on lost sales during the post-infringement period, despite the dearth of evidence relating to the adverse effects of Dixie Dew\u2019s infringement on those sales. The district court, however, disallowed all claims for damages, including lost sales during the post-infringement period. The reason for reversing the master on the latter point, according to the court, was that in the accounting of profits no distinction had been made between Dixie Dew whiskey which reached the ultimate consumer before and after the effective date of the injunction. Thus it was entirely possible that Continental would, if allowed these damages, recover twice \u2014 once in Century\u2019s accounting for profits and again in the assessment of damages. The principle that such a double recovery is not permitted was recognized in Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 208, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381. See also Obear-Nester Glass Co. v. United Drug Co., 8 Cir., 1945, 149 F.2d 671, 674, certiorari denied, 326 U.S. 761, 66 S.Ct. 141, 90 L.Ed. 458, and Restatement of Torts, Section 747, Comment b. Continental, having chosen to recover Century\u2019s profits on Dixie Dew, cannot also recover damages for lost sales. The district court\u2019s action was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Insofar as damages for items (1) and (3), supra, were disallowed a question of fact is presented. We are satisfied that the master\u2019s determinations do not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Most of Continental\u2019s remaining points relate to allowances, total or partial, of expenses claimed by Century and which, of course, reduced Continental\u2019s recovery. They, too, are principally concerned with factual determinations which, upon an examination of the record, we are loath to disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\"> Finally, we are told that the district court should have allowed Continental its litigation expenses. It would seem that such expenses may be allowed as damages in an infringement suit if there is a showing of fraud. Aladdin Mfg. Co. v. Mantle Lamp Co., 7 Cir., 1941, 116 F.2d 708, certiorari denied, 296 U.S. 639, 56 S.Ct. 173, 80 L.Ed. 454; General Motors Corp. v. Circulators &amp; Devices Mfg.

While it is arguable that they may be awarded as costs at the discretion of the court, <em>the </em>trial judge <em>did not </em>believe this case warranted such action.

In the case of Dixiana it offered, prior to the Examiner\u2019s decision to pay Century a reasonable sum for such voluntary discontinuance.

Dixie Dew, although a cheap whiskey, sold at approximately the same price as Dixie Belle, a quality gin, gins as a class being lower-priced than whiskeys as a class. Both products were sold, to a certain extent at least, in the same geographical areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. Discussed infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. The master said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">\u201cThe diffused appeal or familiar ring of the name could readily have suggested to a prospective bourbon buyer that Dixie Dew might partake of the same quality and value among bourbons as that enjoyed by Dixie Belle among gins; that something of the known quality and value of the higher-priced gin might be obtained in the lower-priced bourbon; <em>or </em>that the two brands were produced and distributed by the same distiller and that the cheaper whiskey perhaps also drew upon the assurances and warranties of his integrity, skill and experience.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">. In his discussion of this subject the master said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201cIt is also a matter of common knowledge that a purchaser will respond to the impulse to try a recognized or suggested brand in preference to an unknown or unfamiliar brand, in the absence of other inducements. The familiar ring or sound of the name Dixie Dew, for which, under the findings of the Court in this case, we must assume that Continental\u2019s Dixie Belle was responsible, could conceivably have sold appreciable quantities of Dixie Dew for Century as a matter of quick response to catch-phrase recognition (possibly without even a conscious identification in the mind of the purchaser with any specific recognized or remembered commodity).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\">. Century's position is not improved by virtue of Continental's concession at oral argument that it never claimed such direct confusion existed. The master had already stated that direct confusion was \u201cnegligible or even non-existent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b198-13\">. It seems obvious that the majority did not employ this language without considering its significance, since the dissenting opinion expressed the belief that an injunction would suffice because the trial court had concluded that there was \u201cno direct proof of any ordinary purchaser being misled into believing that heels marketed by the defendant were products of the plaintiff company.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b198-14\">. This figure is from Century\u2019s revised account filed November 10, 1941. In an earlier account, filed April 1, 1940, Century showed a loss of $76,142.90 on Dixie Dew.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\">. Throughout this opinion, the opinions of the district court and the report of the master there is very little separate discussion concerning Dixiana gin. The master found that, compared to Dixie Dow, sales o\u00ed Dixiana were de minimis. Accordingly, in the interest of simplification the profits realized on Dixiana (8759.40) were determined in the same manner as those realized on Dixie Dew, without, however, a separate detailed account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. Ho commented further: \u201cIn either case, the Master is afraid that the opportunity for profit was too clearly apparent to both officers and accountants of Century \u2014 fully cognizant as they were at all times of Century\u2019s possible liability to Continental J'or infringements profit \u2014 to permit the Master to believe that their derisions could have been unaffected by self-interest, or promised on pure accounting theory.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b199-13\">. The Court of Appeals there affirmed the disallowance of exemplary damages on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s case was not strong enough to justify disturbing the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b199-14\">. Total sales of the infringing commodity over total sales of the infringer\u2019s entire business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b199-15\">. Duro Co. of Ohio v. Duro Co. of New Jersey, 3 Cir., 1932, 56 F.2d 313, is a case in which we approved this method of determining an infringer\u2019s profits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">. Among these factors are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"A4Y\">1. Dixie Dew, a cheap bourbon, appealed to a different class of purchasers than Dixie Belle, an expensive gin.</p>\n<p id=\"AIt\">2. Dixie Dew sold well in areas where Dixie Belle had little or no acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"azf-dedup-0\">3. Purchasers of a cheap whiskey were not very susceptible to the appeal of Dixie Belle advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">4. Because the demand for whiskey exceeded the supply immediately after re- . peal, brand appeal was not necessary to capture the initial market.</p>\n<p id=\"ak-dedup-0\">5. There were a considerable number of anonymous sales of Dixie Dew in bars.</p>\n<p id=\"ADf\">6. During the infringement period Dixie Belle was not as well known as it is today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b201-5\">. From June 30, 1939 to December 31, 1941.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">. The master noted that while Continental had claimed a reduction of good will from $2,367,500 on December 31, 3936, to $133,220 on December 31., 1913, its sales of Dixie Belle in 3942 were almost double those of its best preinfringement years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
