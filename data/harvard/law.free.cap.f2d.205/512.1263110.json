We did not hold in our former opinion that a joint tenancy in Little Hope plantation, with the right of survivorship, was created in V. A. and Sarah Stein. All the parties in interest suppressed the will of the mother, obviously for the purpose of leaving in effect the trust created by the will of their father as to property in which it is stipulated that each has an undivided one-eighth interest. It would shock the conscience of the Court to allow a fiduciary to play fast and loose with his <em>cestuis que </em>trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-21\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
