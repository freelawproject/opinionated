We are urged by counsel to decide the case, notwithstanding the death, of Hawk.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">This case obviously became moot upon Hawk\u2019s death, and this Court would not be justified in deciding questions which have become academic, no matter how interesting they may be. Following the established practice in dealing with a case such as this which became moot pending a decision of this Court on the merits, the judgment appealed from is vacated and the case is remanded with directions to dismiss it. See United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S.Ct. 104,95 L.Ed. 36.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
