In it, in addition to general claims that the indictment and conviction were invalid, claims unsupported by any specific reason having any kind of validity, appellant put forward as his chief reliance the claim that his conviction was the result of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-24\">The district judge, finding that there was no sufficient legal basis for the motion, denied it, and this appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-25\">Here, while urging upon us, as he urged below, that he was entrapped and, as he did there, his general claims that his conviction violated due process, he urges nothing which presents any valid reason for granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-26\">In addition to the fact that he cannot use a section 2255 motion to retry his case, the record shows that he was represented below 'by counsel and that the defense of entrapment, which he now seeks to present, was fully presented and fairly charged on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The other matters which, by a kind of general complaint against his lot, he seeks to urge as reasons for setting the judgment aside, are in general not sufficiently specific and definite, and to the extent that they are, they present no valid reasons for granting his motion. Neither does a search of the record present any.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The judgment denying the motion is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
