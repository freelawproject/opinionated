There is no need to detail the evidence or to engage in extended discussion of the nature of acts, conduct, or statements which constitute unfair labor practices. It is enough to say that we think the order of the Board is sustained both in fact and in law. Accordingly, an order of enforcement will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
