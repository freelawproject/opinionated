The indictment charged that the defendant mortally wounded one Hysan in robbing him of his clothes. Hy-san died shortly after he was found unconscious, nearly naked, and badly beaten, locked in appellant\u2019s hotel room. Some of Hysan\u2019s clothes were afterwards seen in appellant\u2019s possession, and there was other evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-23\">\u201cAlthough the indictment charged murder in the first degree, the appellant could have been found guilty thereunder of murder in the second degree * * *, since a defendant may be found guilty of any offense necessarily included in the crime charged in the indictment.\u201d Goodall v. United States, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 148, 151, 180 F.2d 397, 400, 17 A.L.R.2d 1070.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court told the jury that \u201cmurder in the second degree is a killing with malice aforethought but without purpose or intent to kill.\u201d The limitation, \u201cwithout purpose or intent to kill,\u201d was erroneous. An intentional killing that is not premeditated and not connected with another crime is murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Weakley v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 8, 198 F.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The jury may have thought the appellant killed Hysan intentionally. If the jury had known it could convict an intentional killer of second degree murder, it might have returned a verdict of second degree murder. With a man\u2019s life at stake, we have no right to assume the contrary. \u201cFrom presuming too often all errors to be \u2018prejudicial,\u2019 the judicial pendulum need not swing to presuming all errors to be \u2018harmless\u2019 if only the appellate court is left without doubt that one who claims its corrective process is, after all, guilty.\u201d Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 615, 66 S.Ct. 402, 406, 90 L.Ed. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-16\">. Goodall, like the appellant, was charged with killing in an attempt to rob. The evidence against the present appellant would have warranted a conviction of second degree murder, though the evidence against Goodall would not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-17\">. \u201cWhoever * * * kills another purposely, either of deliberate and premeditated malice * * * or in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate any offense punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, or without purpose so to do kills another in perpetrating or in attempting to perpetrate any * * * robbery * * * is guilty of murder in the first degree,\" D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 22-2401. Section 22-2402 is irrelevant here. \u201cWhoever with malice aforethought, except as provided in sections 22-2401, 22-2402, kills another, is guilty of murder in the second degree.\u201d \u00a7 22^-2403.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
