We shall consider only the first ground. The bankrupt was what is known as a \u201cfree lance motion picture editor\u201d: that is, one to whom producers sent moving picture films when first made, for him to cut down, piece together and conform to their requirements. He testified that about ten per cent of his employment was on a \u201cpiece-work,\u201d and the rest upon a weekly, basis. The producers always treated him as an employee when on a weekly basis and withheld the federal tax upon what they paid him; not so, upon his \u201cpiece-work.\u201d However, when he produced a copy of his federal tax return for 1951, it appeared that only as to about one-fifth of his total receipts had he claimed credit for any tax withheld at the source, and that only two out of thirteen producers had withheld any tax. The referee found that, if he had received more than the \u201cwithholding slips\u201d that these producers sent him, he had \u201cfailed to keep records touching 80 per cent of his earnings for that year. If he received others and did not produce them, concealment or destruction is the only inference warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">A witness for the objecting creditor contradicted the bankrupt by saying that in the industry, with which he was familiar, such men as the bankrupt were regarded as independent contractors, and did not get. \u201cwithholding slips\u201d from the producers; but apparently the referee accepted the bankrupt\u2019s testimony. An opposite conclusion would have convicted the bankrupt of false swearing; but, taking his version, there was certainly a discrepancy between his tax return and the facts. For example, he did not explain why he produced from the same producer one slip for $71.60, as to an item of $400, and no slip for an item of $1585. Nor did he account for the absence of any slips whatever in the case of ten other items aggregating more than $1000. His testimony as a whole was extremely confused and improbable, particularly when he said that he kept his income tax returns and withholding slips in odd cans left about in the laboratory where he worked. Finally, the referee was not satisfied with his explanation of the disappearance of the copies of his federal income- tax returns for 1949 and 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">We can see no reason why a .bankrupt, as taxpayer is not as much bound to the U. S. under \u00a7 14, sub. c(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to keep financial'records from which his \u201cfinancial condition\u201d can be \u201cascertained\u201d as he is. bound to any other creditor. Simmons was earning a substantial income, on which in one way or another he paid nearly $600' of taxes in 1951; and it was his duty to preserve means by which the tax could be checked. We do not mean that the preservation of his \u201cwithholding slips\u201d was an inevitable <em>necessity </em>\u2014 arguendo, we may assume that an adequate journal of receipts' and expenses might serve; but it does seem to us that the referee was right in thinking that more was necessary than to leave his affairs so much at loose ends. Since 1938 it has not been necessary to prove any intent to conceal in order to satisfy this specification. We are to remember that \u201ca discharge of a bankrupt from his debts is a privilege or favor that has been granted by Congress upon such terms as it has seen fit to impose\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even as <em>res </em>integra, we should think it not \u201cjustified\u201d to keep so little record on which one\u2019s, income could be checked; and, as we have held,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the decision of the referee is controlling unless we are quite sure that it was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">FRANK, Circuit Judge, concurring im the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-5\">. \u00a7 32, sub. c(2), Title 11 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">.
