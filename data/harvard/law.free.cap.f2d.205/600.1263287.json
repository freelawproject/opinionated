The jury found all the defendants guilty, and the judge entered judgments of conviction and sentenced them. Defendants Kelinson, Thai and Saltz have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">1. The government offered in evidence, and the judge permitted the reading to the jury of, a part of defendant Sobers\u2019 testimony given before the grand jury. As Sobers did not take the stand, he was not subjected to examination by the other defendants. His grand-jury testimony was competent evidence against him at the trial. But since it was given after the conspiracy had ended, it was hearsay as to the other defendants. Because of the difficulty of preventing prejudice to them, the judge, in his discretion, might have re fused to admit it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Had </em>it been received, however, coupled with a carefully worded admonition that the jury should not consider it as to anyone hut Sobers, there would have been no error. Apparently believing that often such a cautionary instruction may be futile or worse \u2014as it may actually serve to intensify the effect on the jury which the instruction purportedly avoids <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 the trial judge here, eager to dispense with such an instruction, sought to limit the part of Sobers\u2019 grand-jury testimony which was received so that it would have no bearing on the conduct of anyone hut Sobers. But this effort failed; for the portion of that testimony read to the jury clearly created the impression that the other defendants were even more guilty than Sobers. Therefore, to admit it without a warning charge constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-19\">The government argues that the appealing defendants waived this error because, after the judge had concluded his charge, he asked for objections, and defendants\u2019 counsel then failed to ask for a <em>warning </em>as to Sobers\u2019 testimony. We cannot agree in the light of the following: Counsel for the defendants other than Sobers had objected to the reception of this evidence as against them, specifically stating that it contained numerous references to them. The judge overruled the objection, but added that he was \u201cgoing to give definite and clear appropriate instructions to the jury to the effect that the statements contained in the transcript of the defendant Sobers before the grand jury are not binding on his co-defendants.\u201d He also said, \u201cI want to avoid the necessity of telling the jury that they are to disregard any part of that <em>testimony that </em>involves <em>the other </em>defendants. I have warned you about this now outside of the hearing of the jury because I don\u2019t want you in summation between now and the end of the trial to invite the necessity of my admonishing the jury about it.\u201d We think that, in these circumstances, no waiver of the error resulted from any failure to request a cautionary charge. The objections previously made amply sufficed to make known to the judge that these defendants would assert he had erred. Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. rule 30, 18 U.S.C., does not require a lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to become a chattering magpie.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s mistake, we think he aggravated when, at the close of his charge, he said: \u201cNow, some comment was made about Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 24. Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 24 was a transcript of the testimony of the defendant Sobers before the Grand Jury. You may remember that a day or two prior to the reading of a portion of that testimony we had several prolonged recesses. They were made necessary in the opinion of the Court because of the fact that the testimony was voluminous in the first place and, secondly, because the Court felt that some of the testimony wasn\u2019t properly admissible in evidence. We had some discussion about the thing. I finally made the ruling that only a part may be read to the jury. All exhibits are being made available to you except that one, and the reason for that is that I can\u2019t let you have something which contains matter which I have already ruled is inadmissible. But I do want to say this to you, that having heard the testimony read to you, and in some instances re-read, I don\u2019t want you to infer anything at all from the fact that the remainder of it wasn\u2019t read. Don\u2019t try to guess what it might have contained. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to any of the litigants in this case \u2014 either to the Government or to the defendants \u2014 if you were to do any such thing.\u201d On account of this error, there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">2. Defendants argue that the judge erred in not giving a charge they requested, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cWhere the circumstances proved are just as consistent with honesty and good faith, as with an alleged deceitful intent, the inference of fraud is not warranted, because 'fraud cannot be imputed from circumstances that are consistent with truth and fair dealings.\u201d We do not agree, since the judge repeatedly told the jury that the government had the burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., United States v. Valenti, 2 Cir., 134 F.2d 362, 364; United States v. Feinberg, 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 592, 594, 154 A.L.R. 272; United States v. Greenstein, 2 Cir., 153 F.2d 550, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">3. Although the evidence against defendant Kelinson was far from overwhelming, it was enough to support the verdict adverse to him. We have considered defendants\u2019 contentions as to other alleged, errors and think them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\">.
