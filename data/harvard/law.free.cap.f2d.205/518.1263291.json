Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York v. Henderson, 5 Cir., 128 F.2d 1019; Radcliff Gravel Co. v. Henderson, 5 Cir., 138 F.2d 549. In eSich of those cases, however, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed; while in the present case, the judgment is i-eversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this Court. Such further proceedings, we think, should include the allowance of such claims for legal sexwices rendered before the Deputy Commissioner and in the Distinct Court and on appeal as may appear just and proper in accordance with the provisions of 33 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 928. Accordingly, the motion for this Court to fix attorney\u2019s fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-19\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
