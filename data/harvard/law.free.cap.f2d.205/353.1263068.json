HAND, CHASE and CLARK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-20\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b405-21\">The taxpayer claims that he is entitled under Section 117(d) (2) and (e) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117 (d) (2), (e) (1), to carry over to the year 1945 a loss resulting from a nonbusiness bad debt that became worthless in the year 1943, Internal Revenue Code, \u00a7 23 (k) (4), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(k) (4). In 1937 he advanced $15,000 to his wife to purchase the voting trust certificate of the entire outstanding capital stock of The Nation, Inc. The taxpayer assisted his wife because of her desire that The Nation \u2014 a weekly magazine- \u2014 continue to be published in accordance with its past policy and that her salaried position be protected. No written instrument evidenced the transaction; the money was to be repaid \u2014 without interest\u2014 only if and when the taxpayer\u2019s wife received sufficient dividends from The -Nation. In 1943 The Nation, Inc. was liquidated following the sale of all of its assets for $1 and the assumption of its liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-22\">The Tax Court stated in its opinion, 18 T.C. 780, \u201cwe do not have the arm\u2019s length dealings that may normally give rise to a debtor-creditor relationship.\u201d Despite the taxpayer\u2019s earnest assertions to the contrary, it is evident from this that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>found as a fact that no debt had been created. This interpretation is reinforced by the subsequent part of the opinion in which as an alternate ground for denying the taxpayer\u2019s claim the case is discussed under the assumption that an obligation had existed, the court holding that it would not be a debt within the meaning of \u00a7 23(k) of the Internal Revenue Code since there was to be no repayment except upon the happening of a contingency. Compare Alexander &amp; Baldwin, Ltd. v. Kanne, 9 Cir., 190 F.2d 153 with Island Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 57 F.2d 992. The finding that there was no debtor-creditor relationship is supported by the evidence, and we do not think that it can be regarded as \u201cciearly erroneous.\u201d Cf. Estate of Van Anda v. Commissioner, 12 T.C. 1158, affirmed, 2 Cir., 192 F.2d 391. Consequently there is no need to pass on the alternative ground relied upon by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
