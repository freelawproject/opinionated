Southern Steel Co., 5 Cir., 123 F.2d 954; Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162; Ritchie v. Lewis-Browning Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 434; and Otis Pressure Control v. Guiber-son Corp., 5 Cir., 108 F.2d 930; pressed hard upon the court these attacks upon the patent. Calling particular attention to its contention that the most pertinent prior art had not been cited to, or considered in, the patent office, defendant insisted that the patent in suit was not entitled to the presumption of validity which would ordinarily arise from the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Plaintiff admitted that its patent was a combination patent, all of the elements in which were old. Vigorously denying though the defendant\u2019s contention that the combination was a mere aggregation of these elements, the result not the product of the combination, but the mere aggregation of several results, it insisted. that the patent describes and claims a new.combination of elements producing new and advantageous results not theretofore achieved in the gas lift valve art. It insisted in short that this bringing together of old elements was clearly patentable \u201cbecause it produced by their joint action a novel or useful result or an. old result in' a more advantageous way;. Grinnell Washing Machine Co. v. E. E. Johnson Co., 247 U.S. 426, 38 S.Ct. 547, 62 L.Ed. 1196, that, indeed, it filled a long felt and unsupplied want in a novel manner not only insuring for it great commercial success but evidencing real invention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The district judge, after carefully canvassing all the patents and weighing all the evidence, rejected defendant\u2019s attacks upon the patent in suit. Finding that, though it was a combination patent, it represented a new and useful invention and was entitled to protection, and that defendant had infringed it, he concluded that plaintiff should have its decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">While the findings of fact are too many and too long to be set out in full, the substance of the principal ones are copied below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Based on these findings, the district judge concluded that the Garrett patent was valid and that it had been infringed and gave judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Appealing from that judgment, defendant is here re-arguing all the matters argued below and insisting that the findings are clearly erroneous and must be set aside and the judgment reversed. We do not think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">On the contrary, we think the district judge correctly apprehended' the evidence and its effect, and as correctly found the facts established thereby. It will serve no useful purpose to discuss the authorities each cites. There is no real difference of opinion between the parties as to the controlling legal principles. The dispute arises on' their application to the facts. The decision of the case, in short, turns on the facts as testified to and found. We cannot agree that the findings are clearly errone-eras. On the contrary we think that they are almost, if not quite, demanded by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Appellant correctly states that commercial success cannot take the place of invention, but it is equally true that such success may be evidence in support of one-element of patentability that the claimed invention is useful. Appellant correctly states, too, that one who claims a patent on a combination of elements, all of which are old, has a heavy burden' to show that there is something more to his patent than their mere assembling, thqir mere aggregating, each to perform its own function, the combination as a whole performing no new function, effecting no new result. Cf. Butex Gas Co. v. Southern Steel Co., 5 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>123 F.2d 954. But it is also true that a patent for a combination can be valid, and we are of the clear opinion that, upon the facts found, this is one of that kind. On the case as a whole the judgment was right and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">On the question of venue, we agree with the district judge that the venue was properly laid, and that this is true under both section 1400(b) and section 1391 (c), 28 U.S.C.A. The district court, on evidence sustaining his finding, has found that \u2022at the time of filing the complaint, defendant had a legal and established place of business in the Eastern District of Texas, arid had sold some of the infringing valves there. In addition, under the authority of our decision in Dalton v. Shakespeare, Co., 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 469, the venue was properly laid in the Eastern District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Appellant\u2019s view, that the affirmance in Cardox Corp. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 344 U.S. 861, 73 S.Ct. 102, by a divided court of the decision in C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co. v. Barnes, <em>7 </em>Cir., 194 F.2d 410, which this court refused to follow, had the effect of disapproving our decision\u2019 in the Dalton case, will not do. The court was divided four to four, and the decision is not authority for or against appellant\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed, and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-12\">.

Defendant has, between Aug. 15, 1950 and Nov. 3, 1950, sold within the Eastern District of Texas valves as depicted in Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 57 and 60 and being the same valves known as defendant\u2019s Type \u2018A\u2019 valve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">\u201c7. The invention relates to the gas lift production of oil where gas is introduced into the well casing at the ground surface and is conveyed to the interior of the flow tubing of the well through which the oil is produced through valves which are mounted upon the well tubing at different levels below the ground surface. The lowermost valve usually will be near the bottom of the well. The installation of such valves are made upon the tubing lengths as the tubing is made up and lowered into the well. During such installation, the valves are subjected to a pressure, the magnitude of which is dependent upon the height of liquid column within the well above each such valve and the density of such liquid. The valve locations are usually several thousand feet below the ground surface, and failure of a single valve of the installation results in a time-consuming expensive reinstallation of the valves and actually entails in many 'instances a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>danger of losing the productive capacity of the well so that as a practical matter the valves must have a substantial percentage of reliability in order for them to enjoy substantial acceptance by the industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8x\">\u201c8. Repeated efforts were made in the gas lift <em>indnstry </em>over <em>a </em>period of nineteen years before the advent of the Garrett et al invention to utilize a flexible element charged with gas under pressure as the control for a gas lift valve as evidenced by tlie patents to Archer 1,687,317; Grisham 2,236,137; King 2,339,487; and Peters 2,342,301, but these valves, where usable at all, had application only in low liquid level wells because the high pressures found with high liquid levels damaged the flexible control elements of the valves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">\u201c9. Attempts to protect the flexible control elements from damage due to high pressures were made by Archer \u00bb * *. These patents show the recognition of the problem by the industry since the filing by Archer of bis application for patent in 1927, but these prior attempts failed to solve it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN8-\">\u201c10. Of these early attempts, there is no evidence of substantial commercial acceptance except as to the King patent. The King valve demonstrated to the industry the utility and advantages of a dome sealed off by a bellows and charged with gas under pressure as the control for gas lift valves in the limited well installations where it could be used. With the King valve, it was possible to maintain accurate remote control of opening and closing of the valve from the ground surface by varying the pressure within the well casing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"amq-dedup-0\">\u201c11. The King valve worked satisfactorily in low liquid level wells, but in high liquid level wells, debris frequently lodged between the seal elements 91 and 92 preventing a seal from being formed there-between. King\u2019s attempted bellows protection proved so unreliable in practice, because of debris getting between the seal elements, that as a practical matter the valve was relegated by tlic indusiry to use only in low liquid level wells where the pressures to be encountered did not materially exceed the pressure charge of the valve dome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkiP\">\u201c12. The first successful solution to the problem confronting the indusiry, as shown by findings 7 et seq. above, is found in the Garrett et al patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-0\">\u201c13. It was a novel concept on the part of Garrett and Peters to provide in a gas lift valve the combination of elements including a pressure chamber sealed off by a bellows to provide a pressure dome charged with high pressure gas and a liquid filled section adjacent the bellows with an apertnred partition between the pressure dome and bellows capable of being sealed off, thus protecting the bellows against high pressures with the valve still controlled by the segregated gas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"amc-dedup-0\">\u201c14. These elements of the control assembly in the Garrett et al patent are all sealed off from the well fluids and function cooperatively to produce a new result, namely, the solution of the above mentioned long existent problem. The gas pressure produces a force which is transmitted by the liquid to the bellows urging its flexure in a direction to seat the valve when the valve is in any but full cfpen position. When the valve moves to full open position, the element carried by the bellows seals the partition aperture to physically segregate the bellows from the gas under pressure, but the isolated gas still provides a force acting on the bellows in a direction to close the valve should the well casing pressure drop to approximately the magnitude of the charge of the gas in the pressure dome. Therefore, the segregation of the gas is physical only and not functional from the standpoint of controlling closing of the valve. This segregation of the gas simultaneously traps an incompressible backing of liquid to protect tlio bellows by equalizing the pressure across it regardless of the magnitude of the well pressure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-G\">\u201c15. It is this new combination of control assembly parts with the new cooperative functions of the elements in the assembly which provides the solution to the problem developed above, and which provides the new element having control for gas lift valves to all oil producing wells regardless of well depth or the height of liquid level within the well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsL3\">\u201c17. In the valve denned by the claims of the patent in snit, not only do the elements of the combination function collectively and cooperatively to solve the long existent problem and thereby produce a new result, but the function of the individual elements is different than their function when found in other combinations of the prior art. For example, in claims (i, 9, 10, 31, 32, and 13, the liquid plays a duel role of transmitting the control force of the charge of gas in the pressure dome to the bellows, and, also, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>when the liquid portion is trapped to provide the incompressible backing for the bellows, it plays the additional function of keeping the pressures on both sides of the bellows nearly equal to protect it against distortion. Both of these functions of the liquid are essential to completely solve the problem met by the valve. In all the claims, the apertured partition functions in combination with the element carried by the moveable end of the bellows to physically segregate the pressure dome from the bellows at selected times without interrupting the function of the gas under pressure of providing the control force for closing the valve even with the aperture sealed off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AzHZ\">\u201c20. Valves constructed in accordance with the Garrett et al patent (known as Garrett Type \u20180\u2019 valves) achieved immediate commercial acceptance upon-their appearances in the industry in May of 1946, with 21,812 valves having been sold by Plaintiff through April of 1952, with a dollar value of $3,336,427.00. The valves have been installed in wells deeper than 10,000 feet filled with 18 lb. mud, demonstrating the usefulness of the valves under all well conditions. The commercial adoption of the valves has been universal throughout the principal oil fields of the United States, Canada, Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7Py\">\u201c21. Of the prior art patents relied upon by the Defendant, no single reference shows or teaches the combination of elements of claims 9 and 11 of the Garrett et al patent, and no single prior art reference teaches the solution of the problem which confronted the industry from 1927 to 1946.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"amq-dedup-1\">\u201c22. Specifically the use of a pressure charged dome for a pressure responsive control for a valve in direct contact in combination with a liquid,with provision made for physically segregating the bellows upon its flexure in one direction a predetermined amount so as to substantially equalize the pressures upon both sides of the bellows regardless of the magnitude of the well pressure is not found in any single prior art reference, either from the standpoint of the structural combination or the teaching of the cooperative functions of the structural elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ahr-dedup-1\">\u201c27. The evidence fails to establish that the claims of the Garrett et al patent were anticipated by prior publications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARa\">\u201c29. Defendant has admitted constructing and selling their type \u2018A\u2019 valves of a structure substantially identical to that shown in its Bulletin 550, Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 57, and Defendant\u2019s advertisement \u2018World Oil\u2019 Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 60. These Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 57 and 60 each show a valve which is an element by element duplication of the valve shown in Pig. 5 of the Garrett et al patent, Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 53.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"av2-dedup-0\">\u201c30. Claims 9 and 11 of the'Garrett et al patent read verbatim upon the Defendant\u2019s valve in the identical manner that they are read upon Pig. 5 of the Garrett et al patent. Defendant\u2019s valve fully meets the literal requirements of the claims, and the Defendant\u2019s valve functions in a substantially identical manner, and is found to constitute an infringement of claims 9 and 11 of the Garrett et al patent which are considered representative .of the claims of the patent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
