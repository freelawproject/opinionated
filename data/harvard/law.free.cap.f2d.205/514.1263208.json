Nothing to the contrary now appearing, the denial but required him to perfect his appeal in the usual manner and he has failed to carry his burden to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>prove that he was denied due process of law. Schechtman v. Foster, 2 Cir., 172 F. 2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Furthermore, his bare assertion in' what is entitled a supplemental memorandum that he was refused permission by the state court to appeal from the dismissal of a subsequent writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>\u201cas a poor person\u201d is, for the same reason, insufficient to show any denial of due process and to discharge his burden to prove that he has been deprived of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Since he did not by appeal exhaust his state remedies, the denial of his petition for this writ was without error. United States ex rel. White v. Martin, 2 Cir., 197 F.2d 147; United States ex rel. Steele v. Jackson, 2 Cir., 171 F.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
