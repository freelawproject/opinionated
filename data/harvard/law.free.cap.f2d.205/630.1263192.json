We need not consider whether, in the light of our previous decisions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the allegations of petitioner\u2019s interest as a producer suffice to meet the jurisdictional requirements. For the allegations of interest as consumer <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> do meet them: (a) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>allegation that the ordet violates the statute discloses a \u201ccase of actual controversy.\u201d (b) The asserted consumer interest constitutes him a person, \u201cadversely\" affected.\u201d As we have elsewhere said, if Congress authorized the Attorney 'General' to bring suit to restrain a federal officer from exceeding his statutory authority, such a suit would be a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d satisfying the constitutional provision; it would therefore satisfy the first statutory provision before us here. As we have also said elsewhere, Congress, by authorizing certain persons within a described class \u2014 here those \u201cadversely affected\u201d \u2014 to bring actions to restrain such officers from transcending their statutory authority, validly creates a class of \u201cprivate Attorney Generals\u201d to vindicate the right of the United States against its wrongdoing officer.

On the merits, however, petitioner must lose, since there was substantial evidence to support the Administrator\u2019s-findings and conclusions, and therefore we cannot set the order aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Petitioner asks that, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371(f)(2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we stay the operation of the order and require the Administrator to reopen the hearing for the introduction by the petitioner of new evidence. The Administrator has already-written petitioner a letter (which is of record) discussing that proposed. evidence, and indicating that the Administrator would not change his decision on account of that evidence. We have considered the case as if the record contained that evidence and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>a formal ruling thereon by the Administrator along the lines of his letter.
