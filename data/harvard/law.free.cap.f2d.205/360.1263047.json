In December 1943, it purported to sell these contracts to MCA -Artists, Ltd., another booking agent, which we shall call \u201cMCA.\u201d The agreement between taxpayer and MCA provided that, after the assignment of contracts, they should be cancelled and MCA should make new contracts with the singer, and further, that MCA should pay taxpayer a percentage of the compensation 'received from \u25a0 the singer during stated periods following the transfer. The taxpayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>reported, for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1944, a long-term capital gain of $41,780.88, which it attributed to its \u201csale\u201d of the original contract with the singer. The Commissioner ruled that said amount constituted \u201cordinary income\u201d (under \u00a7 22 of the Internal Revenue Code) and not long-term capital gain (under \u00a7 117). The taxpayer disputes this finding as to $38,-860.53 of this sum. The Tax Court also found a deficiency in excess profits tax of $20,053.81. Taxpayer claims there is no liability for excess profits tax, because of revised excess profits credits determined by the Excess Profits Tax Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">1. We are unwilling, for the following reasons, to agree that there was a \u201csale\u201d here as that word is used in the Code:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) Exhibit 5, which itemizes the amount of income in question, shows that $5,740 resulted from bookings made pursuant to options exercised by a sponsor on contracts made by taxpayer with the sponsor prior to the transfer, and that $9,729 was attributed to performances under bookings which had been arranged by the taxpayer before the transfer. Thus at least $15,469 of the sum in dispute was the product of arrangements effected by the taxpayer previous to the transfer. The Tax Court was correct in saying that petitioner \u201cwas entitled to that income * * * and could not, by assigning the income, relieve itself of tax on that income.\u201d (2) As to amounts which may not have been produced by taxpayer\u2019s efforts, our recent decision in Commissioner v. Starr Bros., 2 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 673 is pertinent. There a manufacturer of drugs agreed to terminate a contract under which the taxpayer had the exclusive right to sell manufacturers\u2019 products in a certain area. In holding that the amounts received in consideration of the taxpayer\u2019s agreement to terminate were ordinary income, we said the decisive issue was \u201cwhether there was a \u2018sale or exchange\u2019 of such capital asset when the contract was terminated in 1943.\u201d We held that the release of the negative covenant not to sell to another was not a \u201csale\u201d and pointed out: \u201cWhen Congress has wished to tax as capital gains receipts which would not fall within the ordinary meaning of \u2018sale or exchange\u2019 of assets, it has dealt specifically with such transactions, * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">It might be suggested that the instant case differs from that of Starr Bros, because the latter involved a release of a binding negative covenant to the obligor, whereas here there was a transfer to a third person of the rights under the covenant. But we think the correct view is that here there was a release to the obligor of a negative covenant in order to allow a new covenant to be made with the third party. For a mere assignment of rights against the singer would not have satisfied MCA. It wished to be the singer\u2019s exclusive booking-agent and hence had to make new contracts with him: The agreement provided that such new contracts should be made and \u201cbe deemed to supersede, cancel, and take the place of\u201d taxpayer\u2019s contracts with the singer.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">2. Since the Excess Profits Tax Council\u2019s jurisdiction in \u00a7 722 matters is final, subject to the authority of the Commissioner,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Commissioner had not passed on the Council\u2019s findings, the Tax Court correctly held that it could not apply this relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117(a) (4): <em>\u201cLong-term capital gain. </em>The term \u2018long-term capital gain\u2019 means gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months, if and to the extent such gain is taken into account in computing net income; * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\">.
