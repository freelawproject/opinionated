Appellants say the term is \u201ca mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goqds in commerce\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(f) of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, 60 Stat. 429 (1946), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">The District Court found in substance that this term has not become distinctive of appellants\u2019 goods. It found that appellants\u2019 predecessor used it before them; and appellants \u201chave made great efforts toward policing\u201d it; but it now designates a type of meat that comes from many different sources. The evidence supports these findings. Appellants do not deny that the term \u201cCube SteaJk\u201d is often used to designate a type of meat regardless of source. Notwithstanding that the term originally designated appellants\u2019 machines and the product of these machines, appellants did not acquire an exclusive right to apply the name after it became generic and no\u2019 longer distinctive of their goods. Singer M\u2019f\u2019g Co. v. June M\u2019f\u2019g Co., 1896, 163 U.S. 169, 16 S.Ct. 1002, 41 L.Ed. 118; Kellogg Co. v. Nat. Biscuit Co., 1938, 305 U.S. 111, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">We need not consider whether, as the District Court thought, it necessarily follows that, \u201cSince \u2018Cube Steak\u2019 is the generic name of a variety of meat, it is equally the generic name of the machine which makes that variety of meat.\u201d If the use of the words \u201cCube Steak\u201d as a trade-mark were limited to the machines and if it were found, on sufficient evidence, that customers for the machines regarded the mark as pointing distinctly to appellants as the producers, perhaps a limited registration might he possible. As a common law case affording protection of this limited character, see Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., D.C.S.D.N.Y.1921, 272 F. 505. The cases of Singer M\u2019f\u2019g Co. v. June M\u2019f\u2019g Co., supra, and Kellogg Co. v. Nat. Biscuit Co., supra, read with Hanover Starr Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 1916, 240 U.S. 403, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713, and United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., 1918, 248 U. S. 90, 39 S.Ct. 48, 63 L.Ed. 141, are not pieclusive of such limited registration, particularly when they are considered in the light of the liberalizing provisions of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>case the statute itself authorizes limitations and conditions upon registration: 60 Stat. 430 (1946), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1057(a). See, also, Walgreen Drug Stores v. Obear-Nester Glass Co., 8 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 956, 960, certiorari denied, 311 U.S. 708, 61 S.Ct. 174, 85 L.Ed. 459, rehearing denied, 311 U.S. 730, 61 S.Ct. 391, 85 L.Ed. 475. But, as indicated in Kellogg Co. v. Nat. Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. at page 118, 59 S.Ct. at page 113, the application of this doctrine of secondary meaning requires that not merely \u201ca subordinate meaning\u201d but \u201cthe primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public,\u201d here those in the market for the machine, \u201cis not the product but the producer.\u201d Appellants failed to show clearly that this is the factual situation. On the contrary, the finding of the court that appellants \u201chave not shown that the mark \u2018Cube Steak\u2019 as used by them, has become distinctive of plaintiffs\u2019 [appellants\u2019] goods in commerce\u201d, is entirely consistent with the evidence, even though \u201cgoods in commerce\u201d be considered as the machines only and not the tenderized meat, and the public be considered only as those who might purchase the machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\">.
