He. says he has done so. We take this to be conclusive. Petitioners would not be prejudiced even if he had failed, as they contend, to consider the matters in question at the time he denied the motion, since, his consideration of them now leads him to the conclusion he reached then.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
