A renewal at the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend was also denied. The refusal to permit the addition of a third claim more than three years after the complaint was filed was clearly justified on the ground of laches and we do not think that there was any abuse of discretion. See 3 Moore, Federal Practice p. 835 (2d ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
