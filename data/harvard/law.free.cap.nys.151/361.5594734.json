Green v. Davies, 182 N. Y. 499, 75 N. E. 536, 3 Ann. Cas. 310. Section 529 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that the defendant is not excused from verifying his answer to a complaint charging him with \u201cany fraud whatever, affecting a right or the property of another,\u201d would, if valid, require this answer to be verified. Section 523 of the Code excuses a verification where the party pleading would be privileged from testifying as a witness concerning an allegation or denial contained in the pleading, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>pleading cannot be used, in a criminal prosecution against the party, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged therein.\u201d *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The provision quoted, however, does not grant full immunity, and therefore violates defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 12 Sup. Ct. 195, 35 L. Ed. 1110; People ex rel. Taylor v. Forbes, 143 N. Y. 219, 38 N. E. 303; People ex rel. Lewisohn v. O\u2019Brien, 176 N. Y. 253, 68 N. E. 353. The language of the statute considered in the Counselman and Lewisohn Cases is as broad or broader than in the section of the Code under consideration. We therefore think that the provisions of section 529, above quoted, are not valid, where the answer is to a charge of a criminal offense. The defendant need not, therefore, verify his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
