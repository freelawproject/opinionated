F. Springer and informed an employ\u00e9 (Emma Herbet) that his wife was a candidate in such contest, and requested her to give any coupons that she did not want to use in said contest to his wife; fourth, that the relator entered the hardware store of one Tuthill, and requested him to give to relator\u2019s wife what was known as a voting coupon given to advertisers in the newspaper conducting said contest. These acts are alleged to have been in violation of paragraph 50, rule 29, of the rules and regulations of the police department, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-9\">\u201cParagraph 50. Without the express permission of the police commissioner, members of the police force are forbidden to make presents, bestow testimonials, collect or receive money or anything else from citizens or others, circulate subscription papers or books, or sell tickets for any purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">The charges, so far as embraced in the specifications relating to the requests made of Herbet and Tuthill, are disproved by their testimony and have no support whatever. Goldman testifies that the relator said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-11\">\u201c \u2018Mr. Goldman, my wife sent these papers over to you; would you be kind enough to put these in your parcels when you deliver them to your trade?\u2019 I said: \u2018I certainly will, Mr. Boch; why shouldn't I? Mrs. Boch and my wife are very intimate with each other.\u2019 He said: \u2018You will do that, will you?\u2019 I said: \u2018I will do that for Mrs. Boch.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">The relator\u2019s recollection of the transaction differs from that of Goldman; but, conceding for the present that the transaction was as stated by him, I do not believe that the paragraph in question was intended to cover such a case. Under a strict construction, a policeman would not be permitted to make a present to his wife or to his child, or to collect or receive money justly owing him, without first procuring the permission of the police commissioner. The section ought not to be so absurdly construed or enforced, and it is not necessary that it should be in this case, because Goldman\u2019s version of the transaction is not supported by a fair preponderance of the evidence. The conviction and imposed fine should not be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>Writ sustained, determination annulled, and fine remitted, with $50 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\">JFNKS, P. J., and STAPLETON, J., concur. THOMAS, J., dissents. BURR, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
