Defendant produced several witnesses who testified that the car did stop at Twentieth street, and that plaintiff did not attempt to cross the track until defendant\u2019s car was only a few feet (from 6 to 45, according to the various witnesses) from the place where plaintiff endeavored to cross the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-16\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> It is extremely questionable whether, on all the evidence, the verdict could be sustained; the preponderance of evidence seeming to be in favor of the defendant. It is not necessary, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>to consider the question of the weight of evidence herein for the reason of errors in the refusal of the learned court to charge requests made by defendant\u2019s counsel. Defendant\u2019s first request was that the court charge the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">\u201cThat if they believe that the motorman did all that a reasonably prudent motorman could do under the circumstances, after it became apparent that the plaintiff was about to cross his track in order to stop his car, then they should find a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">This refusal to so charge was reversible error. Again, defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\u201cThat if they find the street car was moving fast and was 10 feet away from the plaintiff when the plaintiff attempted to drive his horses across the track in front of the car, then their verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The refusal to so charge, as requested, was' reversible error. It is well established that an attempt to cross a car track at a short distance in front of a rapidly approaching car is contributory negligence, as matter of law. See Lynch v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 88 App. Div. 604, 85 N. Y. Supp. 180; Hamilton v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 6 Misc. Rep. 382, 26 N. Y. Supp. 754; Freeman v. Brooklyn Hts. R. R. Co., 82 App. Div. 521, 81 N. Y. Supp. 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
