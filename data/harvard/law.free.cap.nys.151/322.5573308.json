This motion, for a resettlement of the order, calls attention to facts which, in our judgment, should take this case from the ordinary \u25a0 rule. The disbursements, as taxed, amount to $303.67, which are principally for printing the record. A great part of the printed record was occupied by the defendant\u2019s effort to establish that the officials of Albany county, charged with the duty of preparing jury lists and drawing a jury, would not fairly perform that duty, and with the plaintiff\u2019s reply to that charge. Defendant wholly failed in that contention. Under the circumstances, it seems proper that the costs and disbursements awarded to the appellant should abide the event of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">The. motion is therefore granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
