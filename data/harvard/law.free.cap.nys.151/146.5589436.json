Since the report of the commissioners was made and confirmed, the Court of Appeals has held that damages cannot be awarded for such change in the grade of the railroad. In re Application of Grade Crossing Com\u2019rs, 209 N. Y. 139, 102 N. E. 552. In view of this decision, .it is manifest that it was error for the commissioners to receive the evidence as to the effect of the change of the railroad grade upon respondents\u2019 property and to award damages on that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> AVe are also of opinion that in the decision referred to it has been held that, although awards for damages due to change of the railroad grade had been previously sustained by that court in Matter of Grade Crossing Com\u2019rs, 59 App. Div. 498, 69 N. Y. Supp. 152, affirmed without opinion 165 N. Y. 659, 61 N. E. 1129, still no rule of property was affected by the overruling of such former decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and that, following what we understand to be the later decision of that court above referred to, we must hold that no rule of property prevents the application in this case of the rule of damages so laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">For these reasons, the order confirming the commissioners\u2019 report must be reversed, and the report of the commissioners set aside, and a new hearing ordered before new commissioners to be appointed at Special Term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
