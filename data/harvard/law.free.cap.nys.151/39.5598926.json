However, as the defendant does not object to the judgment rendered against him for conversion, but appeals from an order denying his motion to amend the judgment by striking out the provision for a body execution, we must consider that the plaintiffs sufficiently proved their cause of action for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">. The Municipal Court Act does not authorize an arrest in every action for conversion, and in this case the defendant is not subject to arrest unless the action is for a \u201cwillful injury\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 property. Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 56. Ordinarily, of course, the facts proving the conversion may be sufficient, also, to show that the injury was willful; but in this case the course of dealings between the parties was such that the defendant was apparently led to the honest belief that he had a right ro retain goods returned to him upon any account assigned to the plaintiffs, unless there was a balance due to the plaintiffs upon all the accounts transferred to the plaintiffs. There seems to be no contention but that the decision in this case rests upon a rather difficult point of construction of the assignments between the parties, and inasmuch as the defendant was apparently acting in good faith, openly, and under a color of title, I do not think that we can hold that the technical conversion was a willful injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The judgment should therefore be modified, by striking out the words providing for a body execution, and the order denying the motion for the relief be reversed, with costs to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
