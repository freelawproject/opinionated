J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACW\">The Public Service Commission and the city of New York appeal from the appraisal and award of commissioners in condemnation of certain property taken for subway construction in the borough of Brooklyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is insisted, first, that there is error in the application of the rule of damages, in that the commissioners failed to deduct from the owners\u2019 award the damage which they found was sustained by their tenant. The rule itself is, I think, well settled in accord with- the appellants\u2019 contention. Matter of City of New York (Delancey St.) 120 App. Div. 700, 105 N. Y. Supp. 779; Matter of Daly, 29 App. Div. at page 287, 51 N. Y. Supp. 576; Lewis on Eminent Domain (3d Ed.) \u00a7 719, citing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">We have neither opinion nor statement of the commissioners indicating the theory or the process of their awards. -But the report contains certain definite amounts, awarded respectively for specified property rights. To the owners was awarded for permanent easement $33,600, for temporary easement $14,656, and for use of the estate $1,680. To the lessee was awarded for destruction of lease and for fixtures $10,400, composed of the items $5,400 and $5,000, respectively. The able counsel for the appellants concedes that there should have been an award for the damage to land, and that the commissioners added correctly thereto $14,656 for the value of the building. But his proposition is, as I have said, that they should have deducted from the sum of those two items the said damage of $5,400. Proof that this was not done rests admittedly, upon the assumption that the commissioners adopted a valuation of the expert witness called by the appellants. That witness testifies that the damage to the permanent easement was $47,656. The counsel deducts therefrom his valuation of the buildings, $14,656, so that the remainder is $33,000, while the compensation as determined by the report is $33j600. \"As the commissioners awarded $5,400 to the tenant, it is argued that they could not have deducted the $5,400. The difference of $600 between the said $33,000 and $33,600 is explained by the counsel in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">\u201cIt is quite apparent that the commissioners added \u00a7600 to the city\u2019s testimony as to the damage to the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">But there is no proof that the commissioners made such an addition, or any addition. It is only \u201capparent\u201d in the sense that, if the commissioners adopted the values of the city\u2019s witness, there was a discrepancy of $600 that must be accounted for in some way.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">There is no proof that the commissioners did not deduct the $5,400, but the conclusion that they did not do so rests upon the proposition that the commissioners adopted the city\u2019s witness\u2019 said valuation of $47,656. Why should we assume that the commissioners followed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>figures of the city\u2019s expert witness? We have as much right to assume that they adopted the figures of the owner\u2019s expert witness. Kay, if it appear that upon such assumption the commissioners could have applied the correct rule, the assumption is justified, in that it is harmonious with the presumption that they did so. Harlem River &amp; P. R. R. Co. v. Reynolds, 50 App. Div. 575, 64 N. Y. Supp. 199; Haight v. Village of Peekskill (2d Dep., Gen. Term), 21 N. Y. Wkly. Dig. 80; Matter of Thompson, 14 N. Y. St. Rep. 522, affirmed 127 N. Y. 685, 29 N. E. 150. The owners\u2019 expert witness testifies that , the damage to the permanent easement was $53,512. If we deduct therefrom his valuation of the building (which agrees exactly with that of the city\u2019s witness and that found in the report), $14,656, the remainder is $38,856. If from this sum, in obedience to the rule, there is a deduction of the tenant\u2019s $5,400, the result is $33,456, which is but $144 less than the said award by the commissioners of $33,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The counsel comments that the award exceeds the total damage estimated by the owner\u2019s expert witness by $144. But it is a familiar principle that the commissioners are not bound by the testimony of witnesses. Matter of Town of Guilford, 85 App. Div. 207, 83 N. Y. Supp. 312, and authorities cited. The commissioners report that they viewed the premises. See Matter of N. Y. El. R. R. Co. (Westervelt), 58 Hun, 611, 12 N. Y. Supp. 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is insisted, second, that no award should have been made to the tenant for the destruction of fixtures. For it is contended that \u201cthese articles were all \u2018trade fixtures\u2019 and were personal property.\u201d I think that these articles were within the scope of the compensation to be made. They are \u201ca part of the realty, so long as they remain fixtures; and damages are recoverable, if they are destroyed or injured in value. Edmands v. Boston, 108 Mass. 535. See Jackson v. State of New York, 213 N. Y. 34, 106 N. E. 758; Lewis on Eminent Domain, 728, citing authorities. And see Matter of Willcox, 142 App. Div. 680, 127 N. Y. Supp. 777; Matter of City of New York, 192 N. Y. 295, 84 N. E. 1105, 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 423, 127 Am. St. Rep. 903; Matter of City of New York (N. R. Water Front), 118 App. Div. 865, 103 N. Y. Supp. 908, affirmed 189 N. Y. 508, 81 N. E. 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The owners (and landlord) contend that the award, for permanent and temporary easements should be paid to them, but assert that \u201cthey have no interest whether the two&gt; awards should be paid to the tenant or not.\u201d Our disposition of the case upon the lines of the present opinion for affirmance would seem to satisfy them, inasmuch as they pray that the order be affirmed. The point of the landlord, that the tenant was not entitled to any compensation for the lease, is not well made. The proposition is that the lease contained a fire clause, providing that if the same should be partially destroyed by fire there should be repair, etc., \u201cbut, in case of the total destruction of the premises, by fire or otherwise, the rent shall be paid up to the time of such destruction, and then and from thenceforth this lease shall cease and come to an end,\u201d etc., and that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d covered this exercise of the right of eminent domain. But I think that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d \u2022 must receive an ejusdem generis interpretation. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the rule stated in People ex rel. Huber v. Feitner, 71 App. Div. at page 481, 75 N. Y. Supp. 738, citing authorities. See, too, Lewis v. Smith, 9 N. Y. at page 520, 61 Am. Dec. 706; People v. Elfenbein, 65 Hun, 434, 20 N. Y. Supp. 364. This is also evident from the history of the so-called fire clause in leases in this state. See Suydam v. Jackson, 54 N. Y. 450; Johnson v. Oppenheim, 55 N. Y. 280. Curiously enough, Earl, C., in describing the common-law liability of the tenant in the first case cited, uses the word \u201cotherwise\u201d as I think it is used in the said clause of the lease. 54 N. Y. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The lease, as between the lessor and lessee, was not destroyed \u201cby fire or otherwise.\u201d Of course, it was destroyed when the exercise of the power of eminent domain was made, but only then.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">I recommend affirmance, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
