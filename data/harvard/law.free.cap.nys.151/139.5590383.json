This question must be determined by evidence. If there is no conflict of testimony, and no room for different inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts, its ability to pay becomes a question of law. If there is conflicting evidence, or if different inferences may be drawn therefrom, its ability to pay becomes a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If, at any time subsequent to the issuing of said certificates, such ability to pay existed, the obligation thereon became due. Plaintiff was therefore entitled to a complete discovery of the books of defendant for the entire period between the date of issuing said certificates and the date of the commencement of the action. Code, \u00a7 803. There is an inconsistency in the order as made at Special Term, which limits such discovery to two years. Plaintiff was entitled to a full discovery, or to none at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">So much of the order as is appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, permitting plaintiff a discovery for the entire period between February 23, 1895, and the date of the commencement of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
