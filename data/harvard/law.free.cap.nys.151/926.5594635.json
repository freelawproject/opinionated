Henry Carr Auditing Company, accountant, dated November 8, 1913; that said balance sheet showed the sum of $88.50 net due from J. Kirschenbaum to the copartnership; that thereafter, and in violation of his agreement, and against the protest of the plaintiff, the defendant allowed said Kirschenbaum the sum of $50, in addition to the sum of $35, on account of a claim for professional services rendered to Frank, the copartner, which sum of $50 was not included and contained in the balance sheet made by said accountants, by reason of which the plaintiff was damaged in the sum of $25.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-3\">The defendant\u2019s demurrer on the ground that the complaint does not State facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action should be sustained. Under the authority given the defendant by the copartners, the defendant was not warranted in allowing the sum of $50 to the debtor. The defendant\u2019s authority in making allowances to firm debtors was, as alleged in the complaint, limited to those appearing on the balance sheet; and as the allowance complained of was unauthorized, the plaintiff has not been damaged, for the copartners retain their right of recovery in an action against the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, and demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to amend his complaint within five days upon payment of costs of the appeal.
