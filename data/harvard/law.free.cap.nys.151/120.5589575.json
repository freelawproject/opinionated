At the time it was declared a bankrupt it had a construction plant in the county of Niagara, and was then and prior thereto had been engaged in construction work on the Erie Canal under a contract it had with the state. As a part of its plant used in the construction work, to the title to which defendant succeeded on his appointment as trustee, were certain horses and mules. After defendant\u2019s appointment he during a period of some 14 months continued the business of the corporation in completing the contract, using its plant, including the animals above referred to, for that purpose. At various times during the period in which these animals were so used they were'by defendant\u2019s employes, or agents, voluntarily or negligently permitted to escape upon plaintiff\u2019s premises and graze thereon. For these trespasses plaintiff has recovered his verdict in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">It does not appear that the defendant was authorized by any order of the bankruptcy court, as provided by section 2, subd. 5, of the Bankruptcy Act, to continue the business of the bankrupt. In the absence of proof of that fact, we think the defendant\u2019s liability, if any, for the damages so caused, was personal, and not in his representative capacity as trustee. Decillis v. Mascelli, as executrix, etc., 152 App. Div. 304, 136 N. Y. Supp. 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
