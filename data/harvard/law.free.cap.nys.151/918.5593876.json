Defendant claims that, if the bandage had been adjusted properly and in the usual fashion, the patient\u2019s hand would have been fastened tightly to the body and in no danger of being cut. He admits that before cutting .he made \u2022 no examination to ascertain where the hand was, or what was concealed under the point where he applied the shears, claiming that \u201che had a right to assume that it (the bandage) was properly put on\u201d; also that \u201cI think the whole hand was exposed, but I did not see it; I had the impression that the bandage was outside of the upper part;\u201d also that it was merely good fortune that the infant\u2019s hand was not cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-17\">The hurry of work in a public dispensary does not excuse the lack of ordinary care. Defendant could not assume that the hand was in <em>3, </em>safe position, and rely on that, when the fact could be readily ascertained by himself before applying the shears. The finding of negligence was warranted by the evidence. The alleged prejudicial remarks of plaintiff\u2019s counsel do not appear in the record, and the verdict is not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-18\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
