H. Davidow Sons Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">Plaintiff testified that one day, after he had entered into defendant\u2019s employment under said written contract, he had a conversation with the president of the defendant company, in which he stated that he had been told the contract was no good and that he wanted a contract for a year, and that defendant\u2019s president then agreed to an oral modification of the contract so as to make it a hiring for one year. Plaintiff then continued working for defendant for three weeks, when defendant\u2019s president discharged him, stating that he was not satisfied with his work. Plaintiff, in his cross-examination, admitted that defendant manufactured a better grade of goods than he had theretofore designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, which motion was denied, and an exception taken. The motion was renewed at the close of the entire case, and a motion was also made for the direction of a verdict, which motions were then denied, and no exception taken to'such ruling. The denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, as well as at the close of the entire case, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-18\">The evidence, as introduced by plaintiff, of an oral modification of the written contract, did not alter the provision of the contract that the services rendered thereunder were to be to the satisfaction of the defendant. The services to be performed by plaintiff under the contract,</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>both as originally executed and as orally modified, involved the exercise of taste and'skill as an expert designer, and the provision that the services rendered should be \u201cto the entire satisfaction\u201d of the employer constituted the employer the sole judge thereof. See Crawford v. Mail &amp; Express Publishing Co., 163 N. Y. 404-408, <em>57 </em>N. E. 616; Diamond v. Mendelsohn, 156 App. Div. 636, 642, 643, 141 N. Y. Supp. 775; Ginsberg v. Friedman, 146 App. Div. 779, 781, 131 N. Y. Supp. 517; Brown v. Retsof Min. Co., 127 App. Div. 368, 371-373, 111 N. Y. Supp. 594; Fuller v. Downing, 120 App. Div. 39, 42, 104 N. Y. Supp. 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The cases distinguishing between honest dissatisfaction and mere subterfuge have no applicability to the facts of this case, there being no evidence upon which a jury could properly find want of good faith on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
