As a result of his efforts, defendant entered into a written contract of sale with a purchaser introduced by plaintiff. Upon the signing of the contract of sale, the purchaser delivered to defendant two checks for $100 each, and requested defendant to hold them for a few days, which defendant agreed to do. Subsequently the purchaser learned that an outstanding chattel mortgage had not been satisfied, and he then refused to complete the purchase. The checks referred to were deposited by defendant and returned and marked \u201cNot sufficient funds.\u201d Defendant thereupon elected to rescind the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Since no fraud was claimed, and the plaintiff was not responsible for the owner\u2019s failure to satisfy the chattel mortgage, I am of the opinion that the agreement of sale was binding and enforceable. The plaintiff\u2019s right \"to commissions cannot be defeated by the subsequent .acts of the parties. Kutyn v. Sandrovitz (Sup.) 133 N. Y.
