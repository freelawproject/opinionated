Dorsch was convicted by a judge of the General Sessions of the Peace in and for the County of New York of disorderly conduct. From a judgment of the Court of General Sessions, affirming the conviction, he appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AptP\">Reversed, and defendant discharged.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-11\">The evidence was, in substance, as follows: One E. was on trial before the said Court of General Sessions upon a criminal charge. During the noon recess this defendant spoke to one of the jurors in E.\u2019s case in the corridor of the courthouse. The juror testified that the defendant asked him whether the jurors had come to any conclusion or formed any opinion about E-.\u2019s case, and said that they would find out that it was all a frame-up. The defendant admitted that he had spoken to the juror at the request of E.\u2019s wife and daughter, and that he had said that the ladies were necessarily anxious about the case and would like to know what the jury thought of it, but that the juror refused to discuss it. He\u201d said that he told the juror that, as the prosecuting attorney had had the case all the morning, it looked rather black for E., but that E. had never been convicted before, and that defendant did not think that he would be convicted when his testimony was heard. Defendant denied that he had said that the case was a frame-up, swore that he had never been in a courtroom before, had not tried to influence the juror, and did not know that he was doing wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-13\">The matter was brought to the attention of the trial judge in E.\u2019s case. He sat as a city magistrate, and convicted the defendant of disorderly conduct tending to a breach of the peace, in violation of section 1459 of the Consolidation Act (Laws 1882, c. 410), and sentenced him to a definite term of two months in the workhouse under the provisions of section 88 of the Inferior Criminal Courts Act (Laws 1910, c. 659, as amended by Laws 1913, c. 372).</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b704-14\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.
