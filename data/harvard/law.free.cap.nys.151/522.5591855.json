That statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-21\">\u201cSubdivision 1: No person or persons shall at- any time hunt, pursue or kill witii a gun, any of the wild animals, fowl or birds that are protected during any part of the year, or take with traps or other devices any fur bearing animals, or engage in hunting or trapping except as herein provided, without first having procured a license so to do, and then only during the respective periods of the year when it shall be lawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-22\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Counsel for defendants seasonably objected that the information did not state facts sufficient to constitute any crime, which the court overruled. Certain game protectors testified to hearing two shots fired on Shinnecock Bay; that they saw defendants rise up and walk along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the shore, enter a rowboat, and start out towards a wild duck floating on the water. On seeing the game protectors, defendants turned away, but stopped their boat when so hailed. In the rowboat were two shotguns and a red flag such as is used to attract ducks. Asked to show a gunning license, defendant Jacobs produced one of 1912. The defendants were the only persons in the vicinity. No one saw either defendant fire a shot, but, as the reports sounded, defendants were seen where the smoke was rising. There was also testimony that, at the arraignment before the justice, defendants first pleaded guilty. Defendants gave no testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The words \u201cthen and there hunting without a license\u201d were sufficient,, as they indicated the offense. People v. Wacke, 77 Misc. Rep. 196, 137 N. Y. Supp. 652. If the offense was the killing or wrongful taking of such game, the information should specify the animals so taken. By our Conservation Law for the protection of wild life, the offense is committed merely by the hunting or pursuit, without taking or killing. Hence it is not necessary to allege the particular game being hunted. The verb \u201cto hunt\u201d is defined as \u201cto chase or pursue game or other wild animals\u201d; and this information plainly was so understood. An information for unlicensed hunting or pursuit need not, and could not accurately, specify what particular game the hunters were after. To contend seriously that this information might mean hunting tame domesticated ducks on Shinnecock Bay is too finely drawn. Dieterich v. Fargo, 194 N. Y. 359, 365, 87 N. E. 518, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There was no error in receiving testimony of a prior plea of guilty. Defendants had so pleaded, although thereafter, on their motion, the county judge had reversed this judgment and given them a new trial. ' The voluntary plea of guilty at the prior hearing was an admission of the failure to take out a license, which, with the other evidence, was properly left to the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">No error appearing, I advise that the judgment of conviction be of-' firmed. All concur; CARR, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
