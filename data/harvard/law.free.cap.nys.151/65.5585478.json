Johnston, deceased. The court also, on grounds that are not questioned, set aside the first sale, and directed a resale. The two lots of land in suit realized $6,400, which, less costs, was distributed among the parties according to their interests. As this sale was made within three years after the granting of letters of administration, it is urged that the moneys should have Been paid into court. Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1538. But this interlocutory judgment did not provide that the sale should \u201cbe free from the lien of every debt of such decedent.\u201d A final accounting of the estate had also been had before the surrogate. The court, therefore, could distribute the fund to those entitled, and was not called on to tie up the part of the proceeds representing the Estate of Henry C. Johnston.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> The referee\u2019s percentage for paying out moneys (section 3297) was rightly cast under Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 3253. The court gave allowances in all of 5 per cent, although plaintiff also taxed $60 statutory allowance. Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 3252. This was not error. By the words \u201ctotal allowances\u201d (Warren v. Warren, 203 N. Y. 250, 96 N. E. 417), which cannot exceed 5 per cent., Judge Werner meant those given by the court, and did not refer to the statutory allowance of $60 under section 3252 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which follows a recovery \u201cas a matter of course\u201d (O\u2019Neill v. Gray, 39 Hun, 566). While these proceedings were not exceptional or peculiarly difficult, the allowances aggregating 5 per cent, were clearly within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">The final judgment appealed from is affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
