Dunleavy\u2019s lad fetched a bottle of milk from Bernstein\u2019s grocery shop, and was sent back with the milk because it was unfit. Mrs. Bernstein refused to return the money paid. Then Dunleavy went to the shop, and there was a quarrel between him and the Bernsteins, man and wife. Mrs. Bernstein sent out a neighbor for a policeman. The relator responded to the call. He found Dunleavy there holding the door, but he did not witness any crime. Mrs. Bernstein said that Dunleavy had struck her with the bottle, and that she wished to have Dunleavy locked up, or to press a charge against him. The relator took Dunleavy, the Bernsteins, and their witnesses to the station house. On their way they met Shea, a patrolman, who had been summoned by young Dunleavy to the Bern-steins\u2019 shop, as there was a fight there, and he joined them. The party proceeded to the station house. The relator says that the Bernsteins\u2019 shop was not on his post, but was on Shea\u2019s post; that he turned the case over to Shea outside of the station house; and that then they entered the house, and that he told the lieutenant that he simply accompanied them in. The relator\u2019s explanation is that Dunleavy, who was \u25a0not a policeman, cried out to him, when he first arrived at the shop, \u201cI have all these people here under arrestthat there were charges and countercharges; that no crime was committed in his presence; and that he took them all to the station house \u201cto have it' settled practically.\u201d He testified to the trial deputy at the outset that he did not practically put Dunleavy under arrest, but that he told them all to come to the station house ;- it was a case of countercharges. We think that this was the exact situation, despite the fact that the trial commissioner, by constant badgering, made him \u201cconcede\u201d that he \u201cput them under arrest.\u201d He had no right to put any one of them under arrest without a warrant (section 177, Code of Criminal Procedure), and we believe that he did not intend so to do, and that he did not regard any of these people as under arrest when he turned them over to Officer Shea, or when he made his said statement to the lieutenant. If he did not, then there was no intentional violation of the rules invoked against him. We do not approve -of the manner in which this trial was conducted, for we think that it was unfair and oppressive to the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The determination is annulled, with $50 c'osts and disbursements, and the relator is restored to the force. All concur, except THOMAS, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
