It was error, we think, to receive evidence as to defendant\u2019s ownership of said easterly parcel, or as to its proposed development thereon of a steel plant. The possible future deepening of the river channel as far down as defendant\u2019s lands is too remote and speculative to be the basis of any award.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">The order confirming the commissioners\u2019 report and granting an extra allowance of costs should be reversed, together with the judgment entered thereon, said report set aside, and a new hearing and appraisal had before new commissioners, with costs to the appellant to abide the final award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-16\">The commissioners\u2019 award as arbitrators, as stated in their report, remains in full force and effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
