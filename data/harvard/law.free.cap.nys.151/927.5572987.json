It is entirely evident that all this is not included in the words of the above clause to \u201cpave with iron slag block, wood block, and granite block pavement.\u201d Such work as is not included in such words must be included in the other parts of the contractor\u2019s obligation. The words \"\u201csaid pavements\u201d in the maintenance part of the clause clearly refer to that part of the work included in the above-quoted words, requiring the tontractor to pave with three specified kinds of pavement, and, as said clause cannot include work other than paving with said three kinds of pavement, it seems very clear no other work was covered by the maintenance clause, and the sidewalks are not included therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Reference to other parts of the contract, specifications, and proposal strongly accentuates this view. In the proposal for estimates, opposite the estimated amounts of iron slag block and granite block pavements are written the words \u201cwith one year maintenance,\u201d and opposite wood block pavement the words \u201cwith five years maintenance,\u201d while no such words are opposite the amount of cement sidewalk, or sod to be furnished and laid, or any of the other items of work specified. This is a very significant indication of the intention and understanding of the parties. So the wording of clause 11 of the proposal makes strongly in the same direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">Judgment should be reversed, with costs, and judgment entered foi plaintiff for full amount, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">SHEARN, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
