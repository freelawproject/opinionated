The contract is a bill of lading calling for the shipment of goods from the port of New York to be delivered \u201cat the port of Genoa unto order or to his or their assigns.\u201d The margin of the bill of lading contained the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-14\">\u201cParty to be notified: Quirino Borelli Ortona, Sardinia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-15\">\u201cN. B. \u2014 When goods are shipped \u2018to order\u2019 it is desirable to have the above information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-16\">The bill of lading also contained the provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-17\">\u201cIt is mutually agreed: * * * 17. That this bill of lading, duly indorsed, be given to the steamer\u2019s agent in exchange for a delivery order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-18\">Two weeks after the steamer sailed, the shipper wrote the steamship company that the consignment should have been addressed, \u201cOrtona a Mare, Province of Chieti,\u201d and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-19\">\u201cI wish that you would kindly instruct your agents abroad to ship these goods to the address as corrected with the least possible delay and expense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-20\">Defendant\u2019s steamships do not touch Ortona a Mare, and the distance by rail between that place and Genoa is about 300 miles. On receipt of the letter, defendant mailed same to its agents at Genoa, who forwarded the goods by rail to Borelli at Ortona a Mare, taking therefor from the railroad a receipt without requiring the surrender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>of the original bill of lading, and upon arrival of the goods at destination the railroad delivered same to Borelli without the surrender of the bill of lading. The shipper drew a draft on Borelli for $84.11, the balance of the purchase price, but the draft was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\">The bill of lading was an \u201corder\u201d or negotiable bill of lading, which merely required the defendant to carry the goods to Genoa, the end of its route and place of final destination, and there deliver them \u201cunto order\u201d of the shipper; that is to say, to such person as might present the bill of lading there duly indorsed. If Borelli, the party named in the bill of lading as the one to be notified of the arrival of the goods, became the holder of the bill of lading, he could only require delivery at the place of destination mentioned in the bill of lading, Genoa, and he was bound to take the goods there and ship them to his own address at his own expense. Neither he nor the consignor could require the defendant to do this under the terms of the bill of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">The subsequent request of the shipper by his letter of September 23, 1912, requesting defendant to ship the goods \u201cwith the least possible delay\u201d and expense to Borelli\u2019s corrected address, 300 miles beyond the agreed place of destination, was not only something that defendant was in no way obligated to do, but was wholly inconsistent with the \u201corder\u201d bill of lading and outside of its terms, and was contradictory of and canceled the clause in the bill of lading requiring that the original, duly indorsed, be given to the steamer\u2019s agent in exchange for a delivery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">In fact, although the shipper had made the written request that the goods be forwarded from Genoa to Borelli\u2019s corrected address \u201cwith the least possible delay\u201d and expense on September 23, 1912, <em>the original bill of lading was held by the shipper in New York as late as November 22, 1912. </em>For the defendant to have awaited the arrival of the original bill of lading before delivering the goods to the railroad for shipment to Borelli would have involved two months\u2019 delay and the expense of storage for that period. Certainly this was inconsistent with the shipper\u2019s request to forward the goods from Genoa to Borelli\u2019s corrected address with the \u201cleast possible delay\u201d and expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The shipper\u2019s instructions are at least capable of being interpreted as waiving the clause in the bill of lading requiring the defendant to keep the goods at Genoa until the bill of lading was presented. An agent cannot be held liable for the ambiguous instructions of his principal, when he acts in good faith, particularly where the agency is undertaken without any consideration. In forwarding the goods beyond the agreed destination, without waiting for the bill of lading, the defendant acted at the shipper\u2019s request, as the shipper\u2019s agent, solely for his accommodation, and complied with the shipper\u2019s request in good faith, as the request might fairly be interpreted, and in so doing was guilty of no breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs, with the direction that judgment be entered for the defendant on the stipulated facts, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
