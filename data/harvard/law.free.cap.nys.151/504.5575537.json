Shortly after Landau entered into possession of the property, and in January, 1914, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against him and a receiver appointed. On June 17, 1914, said Landau was adjudged a bankrupt, and the same person who acted as receiver was appointed and qualified as trustee on July 1st. On July 28, 1914, all the assets of the bankrupt were sold, including the lease in suit, which sale was confirmed on July 29th. On that day the trustee paid to said landlord\u2019s agent $85, which was the amount of monthly rent specified in the lease. This proceeding was commenced on July 31st-; the petition alleging that the tenants were hold-overs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Although the landlord received the amount of the rent reserved each month, he contended that he permitted the receiver and trustee to continue merely as a tenant at sufferance, receiving rental, not according to the terms of the lease, but as for use and occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The trial judge refused to send to the jury the question as to whether rent was paid up to July 31st, but held that the trustee paid only for the exact time he was in possession, namely, to July 28th, and that it made no difference how much money he paid for such use and occupation. The check which paid the rent for the month of July was in the same form and amount as had been paid each and every month by the receiver, and on its face contained the words, \u201cFor rent of premises 336 East 103d street, July, 1914.\u201d It was accepted by the landlord\u2019s agent, and a receipt was given \u201cfor rent for the month of July.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The landlord having accepted rent for the entire month of July, the proceedings herein were prematurely instituted, and should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Final order reversed, with costs, and proceedings dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
