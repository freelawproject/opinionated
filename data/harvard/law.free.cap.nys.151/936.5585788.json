It does not appear that Cowen, who said he executed the assignment, was an officer of the corporation or in any way authorized to execute the assignment, and it was not proved that the assignment' was in existence\" at the time of the'beginning of the\u2018action. When asked when the assignment was made, the same witness said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-6\">\u201cI think it was about some time in November, about the day prior tc the. commencement o\u00a3 the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The proof was insufficient to establish ownership in the plaintiff at the time of the commencement of the action. Liberty W. P. Co. v. Stoner W. P. Co., 178 N. Y. 219, 70 N. E. 501. There is nothing in the return which would estop Cowen\u2019s, Incorporated, from suing the defendant on the claim. Bernstein v. Horth (Sup.) 85 N. Y. Supp. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is contended on the appeal, however, that the answer did not deny the assignment, and therefore the fact as alleged was admitted. Paragraph 3 of the complaint contains the single allegation of the assignment. The defendant, \u201canswering the complaint,\u201d denied, among other things, that he had \u201cany knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the paragraph marked third.\u201d While the form of denial is loose and inartificial, and is not to be commended, it seems to me that, in view of the single, definite allegation of paragraph 3, the denial was sufficient to require the plaintiff to prove the assignment. This was apparently the view taken by plaintiff\u2019s counsel at the trial; as far as appears, he never challenged the sufficiency of the denial. In Bidwell v. Overton (Com. Pl.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 274, cited by the respondent, the pleader merely <em>averred </em>that he had not knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to a specified paragraph of the complaint. Here the defendant <em>denies </em>that he has any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief of the paragraph in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
