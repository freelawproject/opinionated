J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACP\">The plaintiff in this action was in the employ of the Consolidated Gas Company, which was to install some machinery in an exhibition at Atlantic City. To accomplish this purpose, the gas company had purchased machinery of the Ingersoll-Rand Company, a corporation doing business in the city of New York. The plaintiff started with a motor truck on October 13, 1912, and stopped at the Ingersoll-Rand Company to load the machinery purchased. When he got there he found the machinery too bulky to be loaded upon his truck, and so the defendant was telephoned for to come and get this machinery and ship it to Atlantic City. Plaintiff and the employ\u00e9s of the Ingersoll-Rand Company waited until the wagon of the defendant came to ship this machinery. The machinery and the crate in which it was packed weighed 1,400 pounds and was heavier than two men could handle. There were but two men upon defendant's express wagon. Defendant\u2019s driver, after giving to the Ingersoll-Rand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Company a receipt for the shipment, attempted to load this crate upon the express wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">Defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that the driver stated that the defendant\u2019s wagon was not proper to ship such freight on, and that he said that he would go back to defendant\u2019s office and send a proper truck for that purpose, but that the Ingersoll-Rand employ\u00e9s, wishing to close up the shop, insisted that this crate should be loaded on this wagon and offered to help. There is evidence of the plaintiff tending to deny this statement. It is. testified to by the plaintiff that the driver asked those-interested in the shipment to give him a hand in helping, to load the crate upon the wagon that had been produced for the shipment, and that the employ\u00e9s of the Ingersoll-Rand Company and the plaintiff' undertook to help get the crate upon the express wagon. While engaged in this work a chain which supported the tailboard of the express wagon gave way, the crate rolled over, and the plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It seems to have been conceded, and I think properly, that unless plaintiff could be stated to be in the employ of the defendant at the time of the accident there is no evidence to justify a finding of defendant\u2019s negligence. I am inclined to think, upon this testimony, that a finding that defendant was negligent even as against an employ\u00e9 would be against the weight of evidence. The evidence is undisputed that this wagon was new, had been purchased about six months before from a manufacturer well known in the trade, that this chain which broke had been painted before-it was delivered to the defendant, and that the break was occasioned by a fault in the welding of the chain, which had been placed upon the wagon before delivery to the defendant ; and there is no evidence to justify a finding that by any ordinary means of inspection such fault could have been discovered after the chain had been painted, and it is quite clear from the evidence that, had this fault not existed, the accident would not have happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The basis, however, upon which plaintiff seeks to hold the defendant as his employer is that plaintiff was what is called an \u201cemergency employ\u00e9.\u201d This \u201cemergency employ\u00e9\u201d proposition is based upon the theory that where an employer charges his employ\u00e9 with the performance of a certain duty, and it appears that the force available to-perform these duties is not sufficient, or an emergency occurs which requires assistance for the employ\u00e9 to perform the duties with which he is charged, he is impliedly authorized to call on others to assist him,, and they thereby become employ\u00e9s of the original employer, and the employer is responsible for their negligence under such circumstances,, and assumes toward them the same obligations as to the regular employ\u00e9s. But I do not think that the facts in this case bring it within this principle. Here plaintiff and the Ingersoll-Rand Company and defendant were all engaged in shipping this crate to Atlantic City. Defendant had received a call to send a wagon to ship this machinery, but when the wagon got there with but two men it was found that the article to be shipped was of a weight and size which made the wagon improper, and that the two men who had been sent could not load the wagon. Both the plaintiff and the Ingersoll-Rand people were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>engaged in this shipment and were interested in having, the goods promptly shipped. They were not outside persons called in by the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s to help them perform some duty imposed upon them by the defendant. The plaintiff and the Ingersoll-Rand people were, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, asked to give the driver a hand in loading this crate upon the wagon. In performing that work they were not acting, on behalf of the defendant, but as much on behalf of the shippers of the crate. They were all engaged in the work of shipping this crate to Atlantic City. Plaintiff was a representative of the gas company, which had purchased the machinery and was engaged in having it shipped to Atlantic City. The Ingersoll-Rand people had sold the machinery to the gas company and were shipping it at its request. And when the driver of the express company requested plaintiff and the employ\u00e9s of the Ingersoll-Rand Company to -assist him in loading the crate upon the wagon, it was not as an \"emergency employ\u00e9\u201d or other employ\u00e9 of the defendant, but as a man engaged in making a shipment, and as much for their benefit as for the defendant\u2019s benefit. There was no evidence that it was the duty of the express company to load this crate upon its wagon, nor that it was bound to supply the labor necessary to put it upon the wagon, and I do not see that it assumed that duty. It was therefore apparent that the two men furnished by the express company were insufficient to load this crate, and/ the driver had the alternative of returning to the defendant\u2019s offices for additional assistance or for a proper truck, or to request the shipper or its employ\u00e9s to assist him in loading, the wagon. Such request was not, I think, at all analogous to the cases upon which plaintiff relies, where it is held that an outsider, requested by an employ\u00e9 to assist him in the performance of his duties, becomes an \"emergency employ\u00e9,\u201d but is a case in which the shipper and the express company unite in loading the wagon and making the shipment, and in which case the employment was not by the express company.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">I think, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, made at the close of the case, should have been granted, and that the judgment, therefore, should be reversed, and the complaint dismissed, with costs to the appellant, and judgment directed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">LAUGHLIN, SCOTT, and DOWLING, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b767-7\">HOTCHKISS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AacU\">(dissenting). I think the judgment should be affirmed. The Ingersoll-Rand Compan)'- had sold the machine td the gas company, and was not shown to have the slightest interest in its shipment. The driver\u2019s alleged desire to secure a different kind of conveyance strikes me as of no importance. The strength of the wagon that was sent was not questioned at the trial, unless it be in the matter of the tailboard chain, which in sound condition was shown to have had a tensile strength of nearly four times the weight of the machine to be shipped. So far as I can see,.the only superiority of the truck the driver proposed to substitute lay in the fact that it had a winch, which might have facilitated loading, but would \u2022 have. added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>nothing to safety. But inasmuch as concededly he waived his objection to the use of the wagon, if the testimony of defendant\u2019s driver that he sought to secure a more appropriate vehicle was of any materiality, it is sufficient that his statement was -contradicted and his credibility was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">There was no duty resting on the employ\u00e9s of either the IngersollRand Company or the gas company to assist in the loading. Defendant had accepted delivery on the floor of the former company, and as evidence thereof had given its receipt to plaintiff, representing the gas company. Defendant\u2019s legal duty to load was then fixed, and this duty plaintiff neither waived nor assumed any responsibility for, as is shown by the testimony of Dougherty, who swore that defendant\u2019s driver alone bossed the loading,. Whether the facts established an emergency, as defined by the trial court, whether plaintiff was a volunteer, and -whether the defect in the chain was ascertainable by reasonable inspection, were all questions for the jury on conflicting evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
