An application for an order is a motion. While it would have been better practice to have serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ed a formal notice of motion to open the default, returnable at the time of the argument of the motion to preclude, it is clearly apparent that the defendant was not prejudiced by the lack of the usual notice. It is not claimed that full opportunity to controvert the plaintiff\u2019s excuses for default was not afforded. It would have been a senseless proceeding to have made an order based on a default when the court had before it at the very time proof that the default was excusable and also an application to open it on proper terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">When an order requiring a bill of particulars is not complied with, the default should not be lightly excused; but here there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Order affirmed, without costs, but with disbursements to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
