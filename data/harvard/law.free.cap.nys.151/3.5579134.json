The burden of explaining these alterations rested on the plaintiff, and the note should not have been received in evidence until such explanation was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-18\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff did not on\" his direct case attempt to give any explanation. The court interrupted the cross-examination of the payee, who had filled out the body of the note, and inquired concerning the apparent change of the amount of the note from \u201cseven\u201d to \u201cseventy-five.\u201d His explanation was that when he had written the word \u201cseven\u201d the ink gave out, and he dipped his pen in an inkwell. The remaining part of the note, \u201cat 549 W. 159 St. in payment for,\u201d appears, however, to be written with the same pen and ink as the portion preceding the \u201cty-five.\u201d The figure \u201c5,\u201d \u201cty-five,\u201d \u201cand plumbing\u201d all appear to have been written with a different pen and ink from the other written portion of the note. The explanation as to the erasure of- the words \u201clegal services\u201d and the writing of the words \u201cRepairs Boiler\u201d is also inadequate. The payee stated that the maker of the note, when he handed the note to her for signature, wrote the words \u201clegal services,\u201d that he removed them with ink eradicator, and wrote over the words \u201cRepairs Boiler\u201d; and yet the words \u201cin pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ment for,\u201d which immediately precede the alteration, are concededly in his handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In the interest of justice, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
