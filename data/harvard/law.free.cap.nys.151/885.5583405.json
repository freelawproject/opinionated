The contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-17\">\u201cThe party of the first part [plaintiff] shall have the right to cancel this agreement at any time prior to its expiration upon giving to the party of the second part at least five days\u2019 notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Defendant refused to furnish any advertising, and, when sued, claimed that the contract was unilateral, void, and Unenforceable for lack of mutuality because of this cancellation provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The mere fact that one party reserves the right to terminate a contract upon notice does not deprive the contract of the element of mutuality. McCall Co. v. Wright, 133 App. Div. 62, 117 N. Y. Supp. 775, affirmed 198 N. Y. 143, 91 N. E. 516, 31 L. R. A. (N. S.) 249. The cases in equity involving cancellation clauses in baseball players\u2019 and actors\u2019 contracts are not in point. In equity there is a distinction between a mutuality in the obligation of contracts and a mutuality of remedy under them. While the reservation of the right to cancel a contract may deprive the party for whose benefit it is made of relief in equity in the nature of specific performance, it does not render the contract void. This is a mere action at law upon a valid contract. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
