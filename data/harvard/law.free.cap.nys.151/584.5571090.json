The plaintiff alleges, in addition to other acts of negligence on the part of the defendants, that at the time plaintiff entered defendants\u2019 employment he was an infant between 14 and 16 years of age, and that defendants wrongfully and unlawfully took him into their employment, in violation of the Labor Law (Consol. Laws, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>31), without the production of a certificate in accordance with the requirements of the Labor Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">One of the principal issues of fact bearing upon the question of defendants\u2019 negligence, and dwelt upon by the trial justice in the opinion filed in the case, was as to the age of the plaintiff. The defendants introduced proof tending to show that plaintiff was over 16 years of age at the time of entering defendants\u2019 employment. The alleged newly discovered evidence, upon which the motion for a new trial was based, consisted of information furnished by a school board in Winnipeg, Canada, to the effect that in January, 1910, plaintiff was registered in one of the schools in Winnipeg as being then 12 years of age, and that again in the same school he was registered on September 1, 1910, as of the age of 13 years; also information furnished by the principal of another school in Winnipeg that on the 31st of January, 1910, plaintiff was registered in said school in Winnipeg as 12 years of age, which would make the age of the plaintiff, at the time he entered into defendants\u2019 employment, between 16 and 17 years; and also information in the shape of a certificate of the health board of New York City showing the birth of another child of plaintiff\u2019s mother, who she testified, was two years younger than the plaintiff, as occurring in 1899, which would make the plaintiff\u2019s age, as determined in connection with her evidence, between 16 and 17 years at the time of his employment by defendants. Plaintiff, in opposition to the motion, presented an affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s mother, attempting to controvert or explain the facts set forth in the moving papers; but the explanation is entirely of an unsatisfactory and unconvincing character.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The evidence which the moving papers allege the defendants can produce on a new trial, if furnished in the form of competent proof, would seriously affect plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, and, in view of the inconsistent and unconvincing character of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and the subsequent affidavits filed in opposition to this motion, the interests of justice require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Order reversed, judgment vacated, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. Appeal from the judgment dismissed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
