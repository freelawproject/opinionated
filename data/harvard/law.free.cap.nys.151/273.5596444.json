Proc. \u00a7 768, providing that on the hearing of a motion relief shall not be denied because of insufficiencies in the moving papers which can be cured on the hearing, etc., and the default should be opened, without imposing as a condition the payment of taxable costs and motion costs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b309-15\">[Ed.

The calendar was renumbered, and the cause was renumbered 2607. It appeared in the Law Journal on the call calendar for Friday, October 23, 1914, and was marked \u201cReady,\u201d it does not appear how. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>served any notice of readiness for trial, nor received any notice that defendant was ready for trial. Under the amended rules neither party can answer \u201cReady\u201d orally on the call of the City Court call calendar, as the amended rule reads: \u201cThe calendar will not be called in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s moving affidavit is criticized as inartificial, in that its literal meaning is alleged to be that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not personally receive notice that defendant was ready for trial. But as there is no proof of the service or filing of any notice of readiness by defendant, to sustain this criticism would substitute technicality for justice in contravention of section 768 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Order modified, by striking out the words \u201con condition that plaintiff, within six days after the service of a copy of this order, with notice of entry thereof, pay to defendant\u2019s attorney all taxable costs to date, besides $10 costs of opposing this motion; otherwise, motion will be denied\u201d \u2014 and order, as SO' modified, affirmed. No costs of appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
