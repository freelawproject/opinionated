The business of the concern was lithographing. The inventory showed the assets of the assignor to be $59,123.13. By converting these assets into cash, $53,404.61 was realized. The assignee continued the business of the concern from the date of the assignment down to May 22, 1914, a period of nearly four months. This continuation of the business produced gross receipts (counting in the $11,619.92, outstanding accounts) of $35,092.59; but it cost $32,878.29 to operate the plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>during that time, so that there was only a net profit of $2,214.30. But it is not certain that there will be any profit, for only $23,472.6? in cash has been produced by operating the plant. The balance is outstanding and uncollected. In fact, the $53,404.61, realized from the liquidation of the assets which were turned over to the assignee has been depleted, as a result of operating the plant, down to $43,447.77, for this was the amount in his hands before he paid any of the disputed claims. Out of this amount the assignee has paid his attorneys $5,000. He asks to be allowed to take to himself on account of his fees $3,000, and to pay to the \u201ccommittee of one,\u201d for expert services, $1,921.93. Each of these three items are disputed and contested by the appellants. - The matter came on before the County Judge, and he approved of the assignee\u2019s report, including the attorney\u2019s fee, and directed the payment of the other two items.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The account of the attorneys is very long, including 80 pages of the record, and it is very minute; but a careful examination of it leaves one in doubt as to the quantity and quality of the <em>legal </em>services rendered. One member of \"the firm of attorneys seems to have attended at the office of the assignor nearly every day, and to have remained all day from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. Just why this was necessary is not very well disclosed. The character of this - account and the size of the bill presented, compared with the size of the estate, requires, we think, that the attorneys explain it more satisfactorily, and submit to an examination and cross-examination in open court. We do not criticize the claim. The attorneys will, very likely, be able to establish it; but, in view of what has been said, we think its payment should be deferred until the fin^l accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Mr. Wedekind, the \u201ccommittee of one,\u201d claims to have performed services for which the committee of creditors agreed that he should have 2% per cent, of the assets. This percentage, up to date, amounts to $1,921.93. There is yet more to be reckoned. That such, an arrangement was made is not at all clear to us from the record; but, if it was made, it is not binding upon the court. It is the duty of the court to protect the other creditors, not a party to this agreement, even if the agreement was in fact made. Therefore the court must inquire whether the claim is just. The statute makes no provision for this expenditure; \"however, if it was proper and necessary, it will be upheld. The record is very meager as to the nature of the services rendered by Wedekind, or as to the necessity of their being rendered. As near as we can determine, he managed the business while .it was being run from February 3d to May 22d. But the profit derived from a continuation of this business, as has been seen, was only $2,214.30. If all the outstanding accounts are not collected, perhaps there will be no profit. The continuation of the business brought into the hands of the assignee gross receipts of $35,092.59, upon'which a commission of 7% per cent, for the assignor and the \u201ccommittee of - one\u201d had to be reckoned. A computation of this additional commission will show that it amounts to more than the slender profit on the continuation of the business, so that, if the management of the business was Mr. Wedekind\u2019s only duty, he was a detriment, rather than a profit, to the estate. But all this, perhaps, can be explained by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Wedekind. It is not, however,'explained in the record before us; and Mr. Wedekind in his brief recognizes this, for he says the record is \u201csomewhat meager as to the kind of services which he rendered.\u201d We therefore conclude that Mr. Wedekind should also make satisfactory explanation, and should submit to an examination and cross-examination in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Without further comments, and for reasons set forth above, we think the payment of the assignee\u2019s commissions should be deferred until the final accounting. There is no apparent reason why this estate should not be closed up speedily, and that is why we are ordering the consideration of these claims deferred until the final accounting, rather than to make more expense by ordering a reference now.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We appreciate that only two creditors are objecting; but there are several other creditors, who, although not objecting, have not actually consented, for they have, apparently, given the matter no attention, and from the record there seems to be some merit in these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">When the matter was before the learned County Judge he overruled the objections; but, had the appellants on that occasion appeared and made vigorous protest, as they did on the appeal, he would, very likely, have heeded their argument. Their opposition at that time appeared, undoubtedly, quite perfunctory, so that they have in a manner necessitated this appeal; therefore they are entitled to no costs, here or below.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The order should be reversed, and the motion denied. All concur, except WOODWARD, J., who dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Order reversed, without costs, and matter remitted to the county judge for further hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
