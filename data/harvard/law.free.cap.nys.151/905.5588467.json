The appeal raises the questions on the evidence as to negligence and absence of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed by its chauffeur and helper that they started from a point on 133d street, west of Madison avenue, intending to go south on Madison avenue. About 7 or 8 yards from the crossing they saw the car approaching about 30 yards south of 134th street <em>\u201cjust coming at full power.\u201d </em>The helper put up his hand for defendant\u2019s car to stop. The car struck the truck\u2019s front spring and scraped by in front of the truck. Defendant\u2019s motorman made no effort to stop his car. When the truck was 10 feet from the track the car was 25 feet away,, coming full speed \u201cas fast as they can go.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s chauffeur says the helper held up his hand, and \u201cI was blowing the horn; that is all I could do.\u201d This is not true. He should have slowed down or stopped. \u201cI stopped as soon as I could, <em>when I seen he was not going to stop.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">Defendant\u2019s witnesses say the truck started up suddenly and ran into the side of the car near the rear, as it was slowing down to take on a passenger. According to plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, the men in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>charge of the truck saw the car coming at a high rate of speed and kept right on, contenting themselves with signaling the car to stop until too late to avoid the collision. Neither party had the right of way. It was as much their duty to avoid a collision as of the men in charge of the defendant\u2019s car. In Tully v. New York City Railway, 127 App. Div. 688, 111 N. Y. Supp. 919, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff * * * was as much bound to look out for herself as the motorman was. She could not, having observed a car approaching, heedlessly cross the street and pay no attention to it, because the motorman had as much right to assume that she would keep out of the way of the car as she had to assume that the motorman would so control the car that it would not injure her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Both parties, on plaintiff\u2019s evidence, kept oh relying on the other\u2019s giving way. If both were negligent, plaintiff cannot recover. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on plaintiff\u2019s case should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment directed for defendant, dismissing the complaint, with costs, and costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
