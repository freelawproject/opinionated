His right to such percentage depends on defendants\u2019 having first acquired these stocks. Merely being entitled to such stock, without getting it, does not enable plaintiff to enforce his demands, which are for a fractional part of something already in hand or under defendants\u2019 control. This the amended complaint avers in the alternative: \u201cHave acquired and received, or became legally and duly entitled to acquire and receive.\u201d Such alternative allegations may be good, when plaintiff can recover upon either alternative; and this form of pleading must rest on the second of the two alternatives, as the case so made is not stronger than its weakest aspect. Here the 10 per cent, sued for only comes due when the stocks have been acquired, not when defendants may have a good chose in action for their recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">The order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
