Further negotiations were carried on through plaintiff\u2019s counsel, which did not result in any agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">There was no acceptance by plaintiff of defendant\u2019s advertised terms, and no meeting of the minds between plaintiff and defendant in connection therewith, such as would constitute a valid contract between plaintiff and defendant. Though the machine was ultimately recovered through information furnished by plaintiff, such information was not furnished by plaintiff to defendant, but to the district attorney\u2019s office, and the recovery of the machine was due to the efforts of the district attorney\u2019s office. Plaintiff, having failed to prove any contract with the defendant and subsequent performance \"thereof, has failed entirely to make out a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
