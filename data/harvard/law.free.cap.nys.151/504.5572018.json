Such an action was not brought either as regards the capacity in which the plaintiff sued or the subject-matter of the action. Whether the grandson could successfully assert an interest in the property may depend upon extrinsic facts not before us. But upon the record now appearing, the title is not marketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">The order should be reversed, and the motion of the purchaser to be relieved of the purchase and for a return of the deposit, with such interest as it has earned, granted, together with reasonable expenses of examining the title to be approved by the court at Special Term and payable from the proceeds of any sale that shall be had on the judgment, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
