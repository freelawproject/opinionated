As defendant was thereupon entitled to an adjournment of his case to await the release of his counsel from that engagement, the default was taken without justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-17\">Order opening default modified, so as to provide that the motion is granted without terms, and without costs of motion, and, as modified, affirmed.
