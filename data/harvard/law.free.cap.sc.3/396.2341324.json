The statement contains the whole case, and is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-13\">\u201c This was an action brought by the plaintiff, A. Detheridge, a citizen of Kentucky, against R. PI. Earle, defendant, a citizen of South Carolina, in the Common Pleas for Greenville County, South Carolina, and tried before His Honor James L. Orr, September Term, 1871, on a promissory note, dated 5th day of April, 1861, for two hundred dollars, due at one day. -The case came on for trial on the 14th of September, 1871, and was submitted to the Court and jury for investigation. The note upon which the action was brought was admitted by the defendant, R. H. Earle, and no discount or payment pleaded or claimed. The amount of the note, principal and interest, on day of trial, was three hundred and forty-six dollars and eighteen cents. And this the plaintiff claimed and asked from the Court and jury. After argument of plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s counsel, his Honor the Judge charged the jury that in conformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>to strict law, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the whole amount of the debt, principal, and interest as was claimed by the plaintiff, but that the jury might exercise a discretion as other juries had done, by giving only one-half or the amount offered plaintiff, to wit: ($170.72.) one hundred and seventy dollars and seventy-two cents. His Honor the Judge also charged the jury that in those cases which were tried in Edgefield, South Carolina, and appealed from, and new trials granted, because the juries had not found the full amount, that he had tried the same cases since under the orders for new trials, and that the juries found the same verdicts as those appealed from, or verdicts for only one-half of the debt and interest. After this charge of the Judge, Hon. James L. Orr, the jury retired and brought in and rendered a verdict for one hundred and seventy dollars and seventy-two cents, ($170.72.) From this verdict the plaintiff appeals to the Supreme Court, because the verdict is not supported by the facts in evidence as above stated, and because of the erroneous charge of the Judge. This statement of facts the plaintiff, through his attorney, proposes to the defendant\u2019s attorney for settlement, and upon this statement the plaintiff bases his appeal.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-5\"><em>Stokes, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALj\">filed a brief containing the following points and authorities:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">1.

By Section 348 of the Code, an appeal upon the law only lies from a judgment entered at a special term, unless the trial be had before the Court or Referees. When the trial is by jury, their finding can only be reviewed by a motion for a new trial under Section 349; and if the moving party is not satisfied with the decision of the special term on the motion, he should appeal from the order. An appeal from the judgment does not bring such an order under review, except so far as the consideration of the questions of law raised at the trial, and the appellant\u2019s exceptions there taken may have that effect. Upon appeal from the judgment, the finding of the jury must be deemed final and conclusive as to the facts.\u201d \u2014 N. Y. Sup.

On an appeal from a judgment on a verdict by a j ury, <em>the appellant cannot </em>be heard <em>upon the question whether the verdict is contrary to evidence. </em>That question can only be raised on a motion for a new trial, or on an appeal from an order on such <em>motion.\u201d </em>\u2014 Anthony vs. <em>Smith, </em>4 Boswell, 503.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">\u201c On an appeal nothing can be examined except what might have been considered on a -writ of error formerly.\u201d \u2014 N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjO1\">This was an action on a promissory note, dated</p>\n<p id=\"A9I2\">April 5, 1861, payable one day after date. The case comes to this Court on appeal, because of the unjust, erroneous and unwarranted charge of the presiding Judge, which led the jury to bring in a verdict contrary to the law and the evidence. I cannot see any reason why a solemn contract with a good and sufficient consideration should be interfered with, because it was made previous to, or during the progress of the late rebellion, unless it was made with reference to \u201c Confederate States notes, or their equivalent.\u201d It is not claimed, or attempted to be shown, that the note in question was so made. Therefore, it was the duty of the jury, according to the law and evidence in this ease, to bring in a verdict for the whole amount found to be due. All persons have rights which all Courts of justice will respect. Under our system of jurisprudence, no State has the right to impair the obligation of a contract, much less has a Court the right to destroy or partially destroy solemn obligations made between, citizens. To permit persons to get rid of paying one-half of their just, honest and equitable debts, because there has been a rebellion in the State, is no more nor less than offering a premium for such rebellion. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>urged by respondent that, in order to give this Court jurisdiction to review on appeal, a motion for a new trial should have been made .to the Court below. When an appeal is taken in due time, after judgment entered by the Court below, and it is found, as in this case, such judgment is contrary to the law, a new trial will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The motion is granted, and a new trial ordered to proceed, according to the rule laid down in this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-6\"><em>Willard, </em>A.
