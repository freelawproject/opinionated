Boyce, plaintiff, against Robert C. Shiver and William Shiver, defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-14\">The case will be understood from the following statement of facts, and extracts from the testimony of the plaintiff, taken at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-15\">The bill in this suit was filed 28th April, 1868, to set up an equitable lien to a house and lot in Columbia, known as the \u201c Assembly \u201d or \u201c Shiver \u201d House, and the following are the material facts: February 15,1858, the plaintiff sold said house and lot to George T. Mason for $6,500. The conveyance was duly signed and sealed, but, by agreement, was not to be delivered until the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ment of the purchase money. Mason entered upon and held possession of the premises until November, 1860, when he transferred all of his interest to the defendant, William Shiver, for $8,000, his indebtedness to the plaintiff at that time being $6,180, besides interest. It was then agreed between the plaintiff, Mason, and the defendant, William Shiver, that the latter should be substituted as purchaser in the place of Mason, and should assume the debt of Mason, amounting to $6,180 and interest; and that upon the execution of a conveyance by the plaintiff to William Shiver for said house, William Shiver would give his bond for the purchase money and a mortgage of the property, to secure the payment of it. Upon this agreement, William Shiver went into possession, and, by various payments, reduced his debt, January 5, 1866, to $1,658.35. On that day the plaintiff duly executed a conveyance for the house and lot, and forwarded it to William Shiver, together with a bond for the balance of the purchase money, and a mortgage of the property, to be executed by William Shiver, and to be returned to the plaintiff; and although frequently requested to do so, William Shiver failed to execute the mortgage until November, 1866, when it was returned to the plaintiff, and was not recorded by him, because, as he alleges, the date was too remote to admit of registry within the time prescribed by law. The plaintiff, therefore, sent to William Shiver a second mortgage, which was executed April 12, 1867, and was not recorded by plaintiff, because, as he alleges, of the death of his attorney, who had charge of his papers, the plaintiff then being out of the State. In the meantime, June 19, 1866, William Shiver caused the conveyance from the plaintiff to himself to be recorded in the proper registry; and July 19, 1866, he confessed a judgment to his son and co-defendant, Robert C. Shiver, for $5,419, with interest from 25th June, 1866, which was entered up, and a <em>fieri facias </em>was lodged the same day in the Sheriff\u2019s office for Richland County. By virtue of this execution, and after the filing of this bill, the Shiver House and lot were sold at Sheriff\u2019s sale to Robert C. Shiver for $2,500. The indebtedness of William Shiver, and on which the judgment was confessed, consisted of $1,500, advanced by Robert C. Shiver to William Shiver within three months prior to January, 1866, and also sundry notes of William Shiver, discounted by two banks in Columbia, and which were paid by Robert C. Shiver a few days before the confession of judgment. The payment cf said notes was made in the bills of said banks, purchased by said Robert C. Shiver, at 25 or 28 cents on the dollar, money in Columbia then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>commanding an interest of from 5 to 10 per cent, per month. The notes discounted by the banks and paid by Robert C. Shiver were renewals of originals made prior to January, 1861. Robert C. Shiver was induced, as is alleged, to pay the bank notes, in consideration that William Shiver should thereupon confess judgment to him for the aggregate of said notes, and the advance made of $1,500. The bill charges that Robert C. Shiver was. a joint purchaser with William Shiver of the \u201c Shiver House,\u201d and was fully cognizant of all the facts and transactions connected with said purchase up to the confession of judgment; that the recording the conveyance and the confession of judgment were with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, and that Robert C. Shiver was a participant in such fraud. And the prayer of the bill is that the judgment confessed by William Shiver may be set aside as fraudulent and void, or if it be not Avholly vacated then that so much of the amount of the same as consists of the bank notes may be reduced to the sum actually paid for them, that the mortgage made by William Shiver to the plaintiff may be set up as a <em>lien </em>prior to the judgment confessed to Robert C. Shiver; and that the defendant, William Shiver, be foreclosed of his equity of redemption in the mortgaged premises, and that the same be sold to satisfy the mortgage debt. The defendants, severally, deny that Robert C. Shiver was in anywise interested with his co-defendant, William Shiver, in the purchase of the house and lot; and Robert C. Shiver says he never heard, of the mortgage until some time after the confession of judgment to him, and he avers that it was long subsequent to the said confession of judgment that he had any knowledge of the fact that the conveyance was not to be recorded until the bond and mortgage were fully executed ; and that all knowledge or notice of the existence of said mortgage was derived from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and long after the confession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">Rev.

These papers were transmitted either to Spartanburg or Columbia \u2014 \u25a0 I think to Spartanburg; and I submit a letter of' his from Columbia, dated 12th February, 1866, acknowledging the reception of the papers, in which he assures me they shall be executed and properly done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>[This letter, with others used at a former hearing before Judge Boozer, who died before pronouncing his decree, was lost in his hands, but its contents, as above stated, were admitted.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">Rev.

Dr. Boyce: \u201cI received payment upon the property from Col. Wm. Shiver, on the 2d day of November, 1860, $500. This was the only payment in good money that was ever made to me. On the 6th day of February, 1863, I consented to take $1,000 in Confederate money; made no objection to doing so. On the 14th October, 1863, I received $1,000 in Confederate money; also, on, the 19th December, 1863, I received $1,500 in Confederate money. In the spring of 1864, Col. Wm. Shiver came to me and said that by the Funding Act of the Confedera te Govezmment, <em>h </em>is wife would be compelled to lose a considei\u2019able amount of the earnings of her hard labor, unless I would consent t.o take whatever old currency she might have at its face, or take the amount in Confederate four per cent, bonds. I then regarded myself as being very well ol\u00ed I had always had a high personal regard for Mr. and Mrs. Shiver. I had received acts of kindness <em>from Col. </em>Shiver, and as a matter of generous action, I consented to take whatever amount he might send me in four per cent, bonds. He sent me $3,000 of such bonds, which were credited on his bond as of the date of 6th April, 1864. These were all the payments I ever received on the bond.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">His Plonor, the Circuit Judge, after stating the facts, concluded his decree as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-9\">Clover, J. In setting up his equitable <em>lien, </em>the plaintiff contends that the judgment confessed to Robert C. Shiver should be set aside as fraudulent; and this depends upon the fact whether Robert C. Shiver had either actual or constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage. If he had, he was, both at law and in equity, as much affected by it as he would have been by registry. Such notice must be clear and undoubted, amounting in effect to evidence. The mere want of caution is said not to amount to notice, unless a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>shall wilfully abstain from inquiry, after such information as should lead a prudent man to ascertain the truth. \u25a0 The distinction is recognized between notice to rebut an equity, and notice, as in this case, to supply the defect of registration. To supply the want of registration,\u201d says Chancellor Harper, \u201c the notice must be full, explicit and clearly <em>proved.\u201d </em>\u2014 City <em>Council </em>vs. <em>Page, </em>Sp. Eq., 212. In <em>Price </em>vs. <em>White, </em>Bail Eq., 216, Coleoek, J., announcing the judgment of the Court, says: \u201cI am not aware of any case, either in the Court of Equity, or in the Court of Law, in this State, where anything short of direct notice has been considered equivalent to recording; and I am one of those who think that the Court went too far, even in admitting that.\u201d The defendants, in their answer, respectively deny that Robert C. Shiver was anywise interested with his father in the purchase of the Shiver House and lot; and there is no evidence to overcome these denials, which are directly responsive to the allegations of the bill. So, too, respecting actual and constructive notice. The fact of such notice had by Robert C. Shiver is distinctly averred in the bill, and is explicitly denied by the answer of Robert C. Shiver. It is not proved by the evidence of the plaintiff, on his examination in Court, and is directly disproved by the evidence of Robert C. Shiver, who was examined as a witness; and, according to the evidence of William Shiver, who, so far from informing Robert C. Shiver of the mortgage or the agreement concerning it, he, on the contrary, assured him that there was no incumbrance whatever on the property. The allegation of the bill, that there was actual or constructive notice, being expressly denied by the answer, and no proof having been offered by witnesses, nor by corroborating circumstances and a witness, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of his answer denying notice. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">It was contended that a mortgage, incomplete for want of registry, may be set up as an equitable lien, and cases were referred to establishing and enforcing such liens in equity against subsequent creditors without notice. It is not necessary to notice the several classes of these imperfect securities mentioned by Mr. Adams, (Adams\u2019 Eq., 122,) not only because there has been no uniformity in the decisions of the different States of the Union in regard to the effect of such liens, but because our statute law, in respect to unregistered mortgages, has materially affected the principles applicable to such equitable liens. In England the doctrine has been long established, and acted upon, that although the equitable lien will not prevail against a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>notice, yet that a Court of Equity will enforce it against subsequent creditors; and many cases may be found in our reports up to 1843 decided upon the same principle.\u2014 <em>Welsh </em>vs. <em>Usher, </em>2 Hill Ch., 167 j Chancellor Harper refers to <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Wheeler, </em>(2 Ves., 564,) and other cases decided in England and South Carolina, where agreements for mortgages, incomplete for want of delivery, &amp;c., have been established as equitable liens against prior judgment creditors. These cases, however, were decided before the passage of the Act of 1843, (11 Stat., 256,) which provides \u201c that no mortgage or other instrument of writing in the nature of a mortgage of real estate shall be valid so as to affect the rights of subsequent creditors or purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless the same shall be recorded in the office of Register of Mesne Conveyance for the District wherein such real estate lies, within sixty days from the execution thereof.\u201d If, therefore, the provisions and policy of this Act are of force, it cannot be contended that an equity can arise in favor of an unregistered mortgage, which the Act declares invalid, both against creditors and purchasers; and I apprehend that no case can be found since the passage of the Act of 1843, where a mortgage, not recorded within the prescribed time, has been held to be a preferred lien against a subsequent judgment creditor without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">The plaintiff also contends that Wm. Shiver\u2019s indebtedness, by the notes discounted by the two banks in Columbia, was contracted long before his engagement to execute the mortgage; that by acquiring the ownership of said notes, no new debt against Wm. Shiver arose, but the old indebtedness was merely continued and transferred, and that Robert C. Shiver is not, therefore, a subsequent creditor of Wm. Shiver, in the meaning of the Act of 1843. As between the banks and Wm. Shiver, the indebtedness was not in its origin subsequent to his engagement respecting the mortgage; but as between him and his son, Robert C. Shiver, it certainly was. There was not merely a contract between Robert C. Shiver and the banks as to the transfer of the notes, but there was another and a distinct agreement between him and his father, Wm. Shiver, which\u2019in substance was, that in consideration that Robert C. Shiver would take up the bank notes, and therefore relieve the endorsers from their liability, he, Wm. Shiver, would confess a judgment for an amount embracing the advance made by Robert 0. Shiver and the principal and interest of the bank notes, without regard to what he had paid for them. One of the motives of Wm. Shiver, in asking the aid of Robert C. Shiver, was to relieve his endorsers, and that was to be effected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the satisfaction of the notes. The advance of $1,500 and the bank notes was a debt acknowledged by Wm. Shiver, and for which he confessed the judgment; and without proof of a fraudulent intention thereby to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s lien, or to defeat, hinder or delay the collection of his debt, I apprehend the Court would not vacate the judgment <em>pro tanto, </em>by reducing it to the amount actually paid by Robert C. Shiver for the bank notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">It is ordered that the bill, as against Robert 0. Shiver, be dismissed with costs, and without costs as against Wm. Shiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">The plaintiff appealed on the grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">1. Because the question was, not of the registration of a legal mortgage, but of the lien of an equitable mortgage, insusceptible of registration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">2. Because the agreement of the defendant, Wm. Shiver, to execute a legal mortgage created an equitable mortgage on the 5th day of January, 1866, the day on which the plaintiff executed the conveyance, and delivered it, with the bond and mortgage, to be executed by the said Wm. Shiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">3. Because an equitable mortgage is a lien, superior to any other claim, except that of a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-10\">4. Because no legal mortgage susceptible of registration was ever executed by the said Wm. Shiver to the plaintiff until long after his confession of judgment to the defendant, Robert C. Shiver, and the recording of the conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-11\">5. Because the Act of 1848 does not apply to equitable mortgages, but to legal mortgages susceptible of registration, the language of the Act being, <em>\u201c </em>mortgage, or other instrument of writing in the nature of a mortgage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-12\">6. Because, even if the Act did apply to equitable mortgages, the indebtedness of Wm. Shiver to Robert C. Shiver does not fall within its provisions, the debt of $1,500 being admitted to have been created before, and not after, the 5th day of January, 1866, the day on which the equitable mortgage was created, and the other debts being mere payments by Robert C. Shiver of antecedent debts of Wm. Shiver\u00bb which merely put him in the place of the antecedent creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-13\">7. Because the relation of father and son between the defendants\u2014 the admission by the defendant, Robert C. Shiver, that he had knowledge of the transaction between his father and the plaintiff until after the war; the fact that he was the custodian of his father\u2019s papers, of which the unexecuted bond and mortgage formed a part; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the fact that the conveyance of the plaintiff to Wm. Shiver was delivered by Robert C. Shiver to the Clerk for registration, was paid for and taken out by him; the extreme haste with which the debts of Wm. Shiver were purchased by Robert C. Shiver, the conveyance recorded, and the confession of judgment made and entered up, together with the positive evidence of the plaintiff \u2014 fix notice upon Robert C. Shiver, and affect him with the fraud charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">8. Because, in any event, his Honor should have rejected the antecedent debt of $1,500, and reduced the remaining indebtedness to the amount actually paid for it by the defendant, Robert C. Shiver, and the plaintiff should have had the benefit of such reduction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">9. Because, inasmuch as the property was sold under the execution of the said Robert C. Shiver, and purchased by him <em>pendente lite, </em>his Honor should have ordered an inquiry as to the value thereof, and given to the plaintiff the benefit of any excess therein over and above the indebtedness of the said Wm. Shiver to the said Robert C. Shiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">10. Because the property, having been sold, <em>pendente lite, </em>did not bring its real value, and his Honor should at least have ordered a re-sale in order to ascertain its true value in relief of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-8\"><em>Pope, </em>for appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-9\">That what is known as the \u201c vendor\u2019s lien,\u2019\u2019 a lien given'by the law itself to secure the payment of the purchase money of real estate sold and conveyed, <em>(Maehreth </em>vs. <em>Symmons, </em>15 Yes., 342,) has not existed in this State since the decision in <em>Wragg </em>vs. <em>Comptroller General, </em>2 DeS., 508, we fully concede. Upon no such ground do we stand. Our position is that the transaction between William Shiver and the plaintiff, in reference to the sale and conveyance of the Shiver House, and ihe mortgage to be given to secure the payment of the balance of the purchase money, created an equitable mortgage of the property which the plaintiff has the right to enforce against Robert C. Shiver \u2014 Hill, on Mortg., 647; Adams\u2019 Eq., 123.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-10\">It is clear, upon the facts, that William Shiver practiced a gross fraud upon the plaintiff, and it is equally as clear, upon the law, that the transaction created an equitable mortgage which bound him and the <em>land. </em>\u2014 Russell vs. <em>Russell, </em>1 Lead. Cas. in Eq., 541 ; <em>Read </em>vs. <em>Simmons, </em>2 DeS., 552; In the matter of <em>Howe, </em>1 Paige, 125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-11\">Then as to Robert C. Shiver. If he held as a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, the plaintiff would be concluded; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>but his position is not that of purchaser but of creditor. The question then arises, and it is the principal question which the case presents, whether a subsequent creditor, without notice, is protected against an equitable mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\">That the law, as it stood prior to the Act of 1843, did not protect such a creditor, is clear upon the authorities, and the fact that he obtained a judgment for his debt, before he had notice of the lien, added nothing to the strength of his equity. Assume that the debt to Robert C. Shiver was contracted after the lien in favor of plaintiff was created; assume that the judgment was confessed before notice of the lien was given ; assume all this, and yet, according to every reported case, the lien must prevail, notice having been given before the purchase at Sheriff\u2019s <em>sale. </em>\u2014 Basset vs. <em>Nosworthy, </em>2 Lead. Cases in Eq., 33; <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Hollingsworth, </em>1 Strob., 103 ; <em>Bank </em>vs. <em>Gourdin, </em>Sp. Eq., 20 ; <em>Dow </em>vs. <em>Her, </em>Sp. Eq., 417 ; <em>Massey </em>vs. <em>Mcllwain, </em>2 Hill Ch., 428; Pow. on Mortg., 459. The subsequent general creditor without notice has no equity as against the equitable mortgagee, because the former has no interest or lien of any kind, whereas the latter has a specific lien amounting to an estate or interest; the subsequent judgment creditor has no such equity, because his lien is general, and, therefore, inferior ; a general lien binds all that the debtor owns, but it binds only his interest or estate in any particular piece of property, whatever that interest or estate may be. If the interest or estate be subject to liens, the judgment binds only what remains after such liens are satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">A purchaser at Sheriff\u2019s sale, even if he be a third person, is bound by all the equities, whether he had notice of them or not, that bound the judgment <em>creditor. </em>\u2014 Freeman vs. <em>MeBane, </em>2 Jones\u2019 Eq., (N. C.,) 44; <em>Bank </em>vs. <em>Campbell, </em>2 Rich. Eq., 179; <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>Hollingsworth, </em>1 Strob. Eq., 103; <em>Winslow </em>vs. <em>Chiffelle, </em>Harp. Eq., 19; <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Fields, </em>4 Yes., 396. But, in this ease, the plaintiff in the judgment was the purchaser; he paid no money; his bid went as a credit upon the judgment, and he had notice of the equity before the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-7\">It is clear, then, that Robert C. Shiver is not protected by his position as purchaser at Sheriff sale, nor by his right as a subsequent judgment creditor, and it is equally as clear that as a subsequent general creditor without notice \u2014 assuming him to be a subsequent creditor \u2014 he is not protected against the plaintiff\u2019s equitable mortgage, unless the law has been changed by the Act of 1843,11 Stat., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>256, \u2018which provides il that no mortgage or other instrument of writing in the nature of a mortgage of real estate, shall be valid so as to affect the rights of subsequent creditors or purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless the same shall be recorded * * * within sixty days from the execution thereof.\u201d This Act does not change the law in relation to equitable mortgages ; it relates only to legal instruments \u2014 to \u201c mortgages or other instruments of writing in the nature of <em>mortgages.\u201d </em>\u2014 -22arper vs. <em>Barsh, </em>10 Rich. Eq., 154. The instruments which these terms embrace, are those well known legal instruments called mortgages, or some legal \u201c instruments of writing\u201d of the same nature. An equitable mortgage is a very different thing ; it grows out of a transaction, whether written or not, or partly written and partly verbal, or it may grow out of acts \u2014 it is a lien given by the law and not by the contract of the parties. How can a mortgage arising from a \u201c mere deposit of title deeds,\u201d or from the \u201c implied agreement of the parties,\u201d or from the \u201cjustice of the case,\u201d (1 Hill, on Mortg., 647; Adams\u2019 Eq., 123,) be recorded ? But the rule is general \u2014 it applies to all equities, whether arising from deeds or acts or otherwise. Such equities are \u201c wholly without the scope and operation of the recording <em>Acts. </em>\u2014 LeNeve vs. <em>LeNeve, </em>2 Lead. Cas. Eq., 137 ; <em>Grime-stone vs. Carter, </em>3 Paige, 421.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">It is clear, then, that the Act of 1843 does not include equitable mortgages. It follows that the law applicable to the case before the Court is the law as it existed when that Act was passed. By that law an equitable mortgage was good against subsequent creditors without notice, and as Robert 0. Shiver can occupy no higher or better position than that of a subsequent creditor, his defence falls to the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-7\">[The counsel also contended, upon the evidence, that Robert C.

That the mortgage contemplated was never executed until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>April, 1867, and was, therefore, \u201cinsusceptible of registration\u201d at an earlier date \u2014 was palpably the result of the plaintiff\u2019s own supineness and <em>laches.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-5\">3. By the Act of 1843, subsequent creditors are placed upon the same footing with subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice; and if the latter would prevail against the plaintiff\u2019s alleged equitable mortgage, as is conceded, so also must the former.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">4. The Act of 1843 is in terms directly applicable to the mortgage contracted for between the plaintiff and the defendant, Wm. Shiver; and the opposite exposition of the statute would be in effect to offer a premium for its disregard and violation, and reward for <em>laches </em>and negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-7\">5. If the equitable mortgage claimed by the plaintiff was created by the agreement for the legal mortgage, then that equitable mortgage must be regarded as having come into existence on the 2d November 1860, and not on the 5th January, 1866. And as to his demand of $1,500 for moneys advanced, Robert C. Shiver, the defendant, is, therefore, a creditor of Wm. Shiver subsequent to such equitable mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\">6. But if the demand of $1,500 for moneys advanced were deducted from the amount of the judgment confessed by Wm. Shiver to Robert C. Shiver, there would still remain of the judgment debt $3,919, exclusive of interest, a sum exceeding by more than $1,400 the price ($2,500) at which the Shiver House and lot were sold by the Sheriff under that judgment; and if this beso, then it is wholly immaterial whether the demand of \u00a71,500 arose before or after the plaintiff\u2019s alleged equitable mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-9\">7. The payment by Robert C. Shiver of Wm. Shiver\u2019s notes held by two of the Columbia banks, did not serve merely to \u201c put him in the place of the antecedent creditors,\u201d (the banks,) but, on the contrary, by the express terms of the agreement between Robert C. Shiver and Wm. Shiver, operated to satisfy.and extinguish those notes, and to create a new and distinct debt against Wm. Shiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-10\">8. Between Robert C. Shiver on the one side, and the plaintiff and Wm. Shiver, or either of them, on the other, there existed no relation of trust or confidence which disabled R. C. Shiver from contracting with Wm. Shiver as he did respecting the notes held by the two Columbia banks, and the consideration he (R. C. Shiver) should receive for paying and satisfying them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-11\">9. Notice to R. C. Shiver of the mortgage contracted for between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the plaintiff and Wm. Shiver was not only not proved, but was fully and effectually disproved; and as the Circuit Judge has so decided, and the evidence upon which he acted has been wholly omitted from the appellants\u2019 brief, the question of notice, it is respectfully submitted, ought not even to be .entertained by the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\">10. The plaintiff\u2019s application to have the mere agreement for a legal mortgage set up as an equitable mortgage, is an appeal to the jurisdiction of the Court to decree the specific execution of contracts; a jurisdiction never exercised when the plaintiff has not shown himself \u201cready; desirous, prompt and eager to perform the contract,\u201d nor when the decree would operate harshly and inequitar bly, or against public policy. \u2014 1 Story Eq., \u00a7\u00a7 776 and 709; <em>Seaton </em>vs. <em>Slade, </em>7 Ves., 265, (Am.

The injury, of which the plaintiff complains, has been brought upon him by his own <em>laches </em>and negligence, and he is precluded from relief by the principle of law, that \u201c whenever one of two innocent persons must suffer by the acts of a third, he who has enabled such third person to occasion the loss must sustain <em>it. </em>\u2014 Lick<em>barron </em>vs. <em>Mason, </em>1 Smith Lead.

Ev., \u00a7 207 ; <em>Vermont </em>vs. <em>Delaire, </em>2 Des., 323.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b534-7\">Sept. 3, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AOJ\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b534-8\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACfi\">The equity of the plaintiff, as presented by the brief, is certainly of a high character, and it was due to his zealous counsel, who pressed their conviction of the right of their case in an able and learned argument, that we should not only give it a full consideration, but examine with care the various views by which a reversal of the Circuit decree was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">If it were within our power to administer what we might regard as justice, measured alone by our individual conception of it, we most probably would conclude that the plaintiff was entitled to all that he claimed by his bill. But it is not within our province to substitute our own notions of abstract right, in the place of the well established rules which have been prescribed for our adoption by the wisdom of the law, fortified, as they have been for ages, by their acceptance as the proper standard for the regulation and control of property, and sanctioned by the experience and wisdom of the judicial luminaries who have been called on to enforce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Impotent and vain, too, would be the endeavor to prevent injustice, by limiting or modifying the application of legal principles by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>our own considerations of equity, regardless of the well defined and accepted rules decreed by \u201c the great masters \u201d who have built up a science with principles now almost as' well defined and ascertained as those of the common law itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The decree determines the question of fraud in favor of the defendant, R. C. Shiver, and we see nothing in the evidence which shews that he had any notice of the circumstances attending the execution of the title by the plaintiff to his father, William Shiver. The deception which he practiced on the plaintiff cannot affect the judgment, if R. C. Shiver occupied the position of a subsequent creditor without notice, for there was no duty or obligation which could place him in the relation of a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">It becomes, therefore, necessary to enquire whether the said R. C. Shiver stood as an antecedent or a subsequent creditor of the said Wm. Shiver, on the 19th July, 1866. Assuming that, as to the \u00a71,500, he was an antecedent creditor, there would yet remain of the judgment \u00a73,919, besides interest, an amount exceeding the price at which the premises were sold. This arose from the indebtedness of the father to the son, on account of the transaction with the banks, and the character of this claim we will therefore alone consider. It does not appear from the brief on what cause of action the confession of judgment was founded. We are prevented from supposing that it was on the notes of Wm. Shiver transferred by the bank to R. C. Shiver, which might raise a question of some interest as to the position in which he could be regarded in respect to them, for the bill alleges that \u201c he paid the debt of his father in bank notes at par, for which he had paid not more than twenty-five cents on the dollar,\u201d and prays, among other things, that if the confession cannot be vacated for fraud, <em>\u201c </em>it may be reduced to the amount actually paid for the notes of William Shiver.\u201d If he satisfied these notes at the request of his father, which does not appear to be controverted, the liability of the father to him arose at the time of the payment, and from that period alone was he a creditor. A confusion has arisen as to his relation, by viewing him at times as the purchaser of the debts from the bank, which is at variance with the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">It was competent for William Shiver to contract with his son for the payment to him of the full amount due on the notes, if he would pay and satisfy them. Holding, therefore, that as to this portion of the debt, he occupied the position of a subsequent creditor, and that the debt is to be estimated at the sum recognized by both of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the only further enquiry is, whether the agreement of William Shiver with the plaintiff, Boyce, amounted to an equitable mortgage, and if so, whether it can prevail against the said R. C. Shiver, as such a creditor without notice?</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The doctrine of lien, by equitable mortgage, either arising from imperfect attempts to mortgage, or to devote specific property to the payment of a particular debt, or established \u201cas implied from the agreement of the parties, or the justice of the case,\u201d or even created by the deposit of title deeds, has long prevailed in England, and has been recognized by our Courts. The principle is not confined to the lien by mortgage only, but extends even to agreements for sale of real estate, and permits the equitable interest thus raised to prevail against a subsequent creditor, though holding by a general lien. In fact, in the case of the <em>Bank </em>vs. <em>Campbell, </em>2 Rich. Eq., 191, effect was given to the equitable interest against the legal title of a purchaser deriving it from a sale under a subsequent lien. To what extent this Court might be willing to adopt the principle there announced, it is not necessary now to determine, for the plaintiff\u2019s counsel here, so far from insisting on the doctrine therein declared, concedes \u201c that by general principles, and without reference to recording acts, no equity can stand against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice.\u201d R. C. Shiver, however, does not occupy that position, for he purchased while the cause was pending, and can therefore be regarded only as claiming as a subsequent creditor, without notice, and must stand or fall by the consequences which follow that relation. The plaintiff, according to the rule maintained, both by the Courts in England and this State, is entitled to the relief which he seeks, unless estopped by the provisions of the Act of 1843, 11 Stat., 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">It is contended for the plaintiff that equitable mortgages are not within the recording Acts. This is true so far as they are recognized as creating rights in themselves, binding all who Were parties to their creation, and, so far as they do Dot come within the letter or spirit of any legislative prohibition, which refuses to give effect to a perfect, legal mortgage, unless recorded as by law provided and required. Before the Act of 1843, a written mortgage, complete in form, but not recorded, was preferred to a subsequent creditor without notice. A mortgage, conferring only an equitable right, frequently incapable in itself of being recorded, was good, too, against such subsequent creditor, but neither could take precedence of a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration without notice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The plain and manifest object of the Act was to destroy the distinction in the position of the subsequent creditor and purchaser, and to place them both on the same footing. While this is not denied as to those claiming under mortgages in legal form, it is insisted that the Statute works no change in the mortgage which, by the very nature of it, cannot be recorded. To say that the validity which the Legislature withholds from a legal mortgage, for want of recording, shall be given to an equitable mortgage, which may be known only to the parties interested in it, and then often relying on human testimony for its purposes and intention, would be to charge the lawmaking power with an inconsistency too gross and violent to be entertained for a moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The wisdom and policy which dictated the Act, to suppress the mischief it was intended to subdue, must be extended to all contracts and agreements through which an equitable lien by way of mortgage can be asserted. The consequence of imparting validity to unrecorded mortgages wrought most injurious consequences, by depreciating the value of real estate, which to some extent depended on the facility of the means of ascertaining its title.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In a country where land is often changing hands, freed from, and unfettered by the laws which confine it to hereditary succession and descent, the admitted policy is to afford a ready mode of discovering all changes in the title, or incumbrances upon it. This is not only impaired, but prevented by giving effect to secret conveyances, which are seldom brought into notice until some innocent party is to be injured by their introduction. The proposition of the plaintiff seeks to place an equitable mortgage upon a better footing than a duly executed mortgage. It is admitted that if the plaintiff had a complete mortgage of the land, it could not prevail against the defendant, R. C. Shiver, for want of recording; why ? because he had no notice of it; and yet it is claimed at the same time, that his unwritten equitable mortgage,* growing out of the transaction between him and William Shiver, is to operate to the prejudice of R. C. Shiver, who, in ignorance of it, became his creditor. It would seem that the proposition, by its mere statement, refutes itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\"><em>Grimestone </em>vs. Carter, 3 Paige, 437, referred to as an authority, proceeded upon the ground that the purchaser had notice of the possession which was sufficient to put him on enquiry. It was a priority sought against a subsequent purchaser without notice, which it is admitted in the argument, for the motion before us cannot prevail in this State. So far as the case is to have any force as estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>lishing an equitable claim, it will be remembered that the Chancellor (p. 439) remarks that such claims are \u201c expressly excepted from the provisions of the Statute (1 R. S., 762, \u00a7 38,) requiring conveyances to be recorded.\u201d So far from any disposition to extend the provisions now existing by law, in favor of secret liens, we feel that the highest considerations of public policy require that they should be held within their prescribed bounds. There is not a single modern writer, whose opinion carries weight, who does not regret that the Courts ever favored the introduction of secret liens on property, and many of the most eminent Judges of England, while they felt bound from precedent and authority to sustain them, denied the wisdom and policy of the rule which permitted them, and but few Judges in our country, whilst also following the authority of names which preceded their own, have failed to , declare their determination not to extend them beyond the limits to which they have been carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We live in a day of enterprise and commerce, and no lien on property of any character should avail unless an opportunity is afforded to the public to be informed of-it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">It is asked \u201cif it was the intention of the Act of 1843 to cut up by the roots the whole doctrine of constructive trusts, as administered by this Court ?\u201d While we answer that such may not have been its purpose, we at the same time hold that effect cannot be given, as against a subsequent creditor without notice, to an agreement or transaction through which an equitable lien is asserted and claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The case is a hard one on the plaintiff, who, in his dealing with William Shiver, has exhibited a generous and liberal, though a misplaced confidence, but we cannot deprive the son of his right because the father has violated his trust to the plaintiff, who possessed him with the legal title, and thus permitted him to gain credit on the faith of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We do not think, however, that it is a case for costs against the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">It is ordered that the motion be dismissed \u2014 William Shiver to pay all the costs, and in case of his inability to do so, each party to pay his own.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-10\"><em>Willard, </em>A.
