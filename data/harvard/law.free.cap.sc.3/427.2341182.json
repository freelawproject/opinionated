The rule, dated March 6, 1871, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201cOn motion of Campbell &amp; Seabrook, for Charles M. Furman, trustee, and on reference to the decrees and orders heretofore made in these cases, which appear to have been consolidated upon the last named case, and on hearing the statement of Isaac W. Hayne, Esq., it is ordered, that the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company do shew cause, if any they have and can shew, at the Court House, before me, at Chambers, at 10 o\u2019clock A. M., on Saturday, the eleventh day of March instant, why the costs of Charles M. Furman, trustee, shall not be taxed, not only as costs in the cause between party and party, but also as costs between solicitor and client, against the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, together with any just allowances the said Charles M. Furman, as trustee, may be entitled to have.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-5\">\u201cAnd why the same shall not be referred to a special Referee to tax and assess the same, and report to this Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">The rule was granted upon the following affidavit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-7\">\u201c I. W. Hayne, being sworn, makes oath, that not long after the filing in Richland District of the bill of complaint in the name of C. M. Furman, trustee, in behalf of certain bondholders, against the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, he was requested by Governor Orr to give his attention, as Attorney General, (which office affiant then filled) to the case, for the protection of the interests of the State. Affiant was instructed to co-operate with Mr. C. D. Melton, Solicitor of the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, and to advise with him, as the interest of the road and the State coincided, and when, in the discretion of affiant, it was proper to do so, to intervene in behalf of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-8\">\u201cGovernor Orr had the matter much at heart, and was urgent that affiant\u2019s best efforts should be made to defeat the purposes of the bill. After being put in full possession of the case, affiant was of opinion that the allegations of the bill, its prayer and purpose, placed Mr. Furman, the trustee, in a false position \u2014 a position inconsistent with his duties as President of the Bank of the State, selected as agent of the State, to protect the interests of the State\u2014 the very interests which Governor Orr had called on affiant to sustain. As a friend of Mr. Furman, affiant desired that he should put himself right, and, as counsel in the cause, affiant thought it important that the interest represented by him should not have the weight of Mr. Furman\u2019s name and authority against it. After one of affiant\u2019s visits to Columbia upon this business, but before the Attorney General became a party to the record, affiant sought Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Furman, and explained the whole matter to him. Mr. Furman said that he had never read the bill* or given it a thought. He had simply allowed the use of his name, as he supposed he was bound to do under the provisions of the trust deed, but was then fully aware that it was necessary that \u2019 he should explain his position. Affiant told him that it was in contemplation to file two cross bills, and that he, Mr. Furman, would be a necessary party to each, and that this would afford the opportunity he desired for explanation. Affiant advised him to employ a lawyer of his own to represent him to the end of the controversy, and to avoid any further complications. He assented, and named James B. Campbell as his solicitor. Affiant immediately saw Mr. Campbell, explained the case to him, and subsequently, throughout the conduct of the three cases,to wit: C. M. Furman, Trustee, <em>ns. </em>the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company; Huger &amp; Phillips <em>vs. </em>the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, C. M. Furman <em>et \u00e1l.\\ </em>and I. W. Hayne, Attorney Generalas. Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, C. M. Fur-man <em>et al.\\ </em>Mr. Campbell, on the part of the Trustee, affiant in behalf of the State, and Mr. Melton, representing the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, acted in harmony. Affiant is of opinion that this harmony aided greatly in obtaining from Chancellor Lesesne the order of injunction which brought about the final adjustment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">\u201cAffiant will add that before Governor Orr went out of office, he sent to \u201c Hayne &amp; Son,\u201d (not the <em>Attorney </em>General,) as \u201c a retainer and <em>on account of fee\u201d </em>in this case, $250. \u201cHayne &amp; Son\u201d were continued as solicitors, representing the same interests, after the accession of Governor Scott, by his authority and by the assent of the Attorney General; but up to this time have received no further remuneration. They have never consented to the order of Judge Boozer, and were never consulted as to the discontinuance of the causes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">\u201cAffiant, who is senior partner in the firm of \u201c Hayne &amp; Son,\u201d further states, that the consent order by which the two cases originating in Charleston were to be heard in Columbia, \u201c at the next term of the Court,\u201d along with the ease originating there, was not at the time considered as a permanent removal of these causes. On the contrary, Mr. Magrath, who represented complainants in one case, and affiant, who was complainant in the other, after consultation together, decided to oppose every attempt at a permanent removal of the causes, and, if there was to be a consolidation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>determined to claim, that the Columbia case should be sent to Charleston. #</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-5\">\u201c It was never intended to <em>remove the records, </em>except for the purpose of the trial <em>at that term, </em>and they were accordingly brought back, and are <em>now </em>here.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-6\">So much of the return to the rule as relates to the only point considered by the Court is recited in the order and statement below given, and need not be here repeated. The case having been heard by his Honor the Circuit Judge, he filed the following order and statement, dated April 4, 1871:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-7\">Graham, J. This was a hearing on the return to a rule to show cause why the costs of Mr. Furman, Trustee, should not be taxed against \u201c The Greenville &amp; Columbia Railroad Company,\u201d as between solicitor and client.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-8\">The return sets forth the following order, and shews for cause why the rule ought to be discharged, <em>\u201c </em>that said order stands unimpeached and undischarged ;\u201d \u201c that no appeal therefrom, nor exception thereto, has been taken by the relator ;\u201d \u201c that said order, unless modified or set aside, or otherwise changed, operates as a discontinuance of all these cases, and that the relator, Mr. Furman, has no longer any standing in this Court in connection with the above mentioned cases.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-9\">The Order is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-10\">\u201c THE STATE OF SOUTH <em>CAROLINA,}</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlQ\">Richland County. }</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABG\">Tw ......... <em>In </em>Equity-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-12\">Charles M.

I cheerfully comply with this request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-13\">The first named case was commenced in Richland District, now County, in May, 1867.

That under the order of Chancellor Lesesne, of 1st April, 1868, all the cases were consolidated and pending in Charleston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-8\">2d. That the order of 25th May, 1868, only appointed a hearing in Richland, and did not remove or transfer the cause from Charleston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-9\">3d. That no hearing having been had \u201cat Columbia, at the ensuing term of the Court of Equity for Richland District,\u201d the order for hearing there was at that term of the Rihhland Court, namely, 19th June, 1868, discharged and the hearing continued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-10\">4th. That the discharge of the order necessarily worked a discharge of the hearing at Columbia; that the words, \u201cand the hearing continued,\u201d could mean nothing less, because the discharge of the order took away the jurisdiction to hear two at least of the cases. To continue a case is to postpone it \u2014 -to continue a hearing would usually mean to go on with it, which it clearly did not mean here, but to postpone; and in connection with a discharge of the order giving jurisdiction, it meant an indefinite postponement, and remitted two at least of the cases to their proper jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-11\">5th. That if there had been any transfer, it was a transfer of the Richland case to Charleston, by the order consolidating them taken, at Charleston, 1st April, 1868, which all the parties acquiesced in and acted on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-12\">6th. That there having been no transfer of the records when the order of August, 1869, was made, and the law having been changed, the Circuit Judge of the Fifth Circuit had no jurisdiction of the causes in the Fifth Circuit; consent, even if there had been any, could not give jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-13\">' The respondents insisted that the proper and only remedy, if any, for the rights, if any, of the relator, must be had under the order of Judge Boozer, or by some modification or enlargement of it, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>by appeal from it, or by some new and independent suit, action or proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">I sustain their view, and it is thereupon adjudged and ordered that the rule be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">The relator, Charles M. Furman, appealed from the order of His Honor Judge Graham, and also from the order of His Honor Judge Boozer, filed at Columbia, August 17, 1869, upon which the first named order rests, for the reasons and grounds urged before His Honor Judge Graham, and restated in his statement of the case appended to his order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">1. Because His Honor Judge Graham erred in not deciding that the order of Judge Boozer, of August 17,1869, was irregular for want of notice, want of consent, and want of jurisdiction in two, at least, of the cases, and, as he claims, in all of them, and that the same was therefore not of force to discontinue or dismiss the cases pending at Charleston, but in that respect null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">2. Because, if said order is in fact binding while standing of record and unchanged, it ought to be set aside for the reason that it was irregularly and unfairly taken, without notice, without consent, and without jurisdiction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-9\"><em>Campbell </em>&amp; <em>Seabrook, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-10\"><em>Chamberlain, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b445-11\">Aug. 7, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Arc\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b445-12\">Willard, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV_\">The above entitled cases were discontinued under an order of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, made by Judge Boozer, August 17, 1869, in which a final disposition of all questions of costs was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">On the 6th of March, 1871, a motion was made in the First Circuit in behalf of C. M. Furman, trustee, complainant in the suit first above named, for a taxation of his costs as against the Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company, and as between himself and his attorney, and for such allowance as he might be entitled to, and for the appointment of a special Referee to tax and assess the same. The motion was denied by an order made by Judge Graham on the 4th of April, 1871. This decision of Judge Graham is based on the ground that the order of Judge Boozer was final as affecting the application before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">The present appeal is from the order last mentioned, and advances the proposition that the order of Judge Boozer should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>been disregarded as null and void, or, that it should have been set aside as irregular, unfairly taken, without notice, without consent, and without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">No ground whatever is presented, by the case before us, for holding that Judge Boozer\u2019s order was null and void. It professes to be based on the consent of the solicitors in the case of <em>Furman </em>vs. <em>The Greenville and Columbia Railroad Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">If such consent was actually given, it bound the present appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">It was claimed, however, that no such consent had, in point of fact, been given. If such was the case, the course of the party was, in due time, to move the Circuit Court, where the order was made, to correct any misapprehension of the facts that may have misled the Court in making the order. It was not correct practice to ask the Circuit Court of a different Circuit from that which made the order, either to disregard it or to set it aside for irregularity, nor to bring the order, by appeal, into this Court, without making it the subject of consideration by the Court that passed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The conclusions of Judge Graham are unobjectionable upon the state of facts brought before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The order should be affirmed, and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-10\"><em>Moses, </em>C. J., and <em>Wright, </em>A. J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
