All of which the plaintiffs say is a breach of the trusts of that municipal office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>for the benefit of these plaintiffs and others, to which the said body is committed by its charter of incorporation aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\"><em>Ninth. </em>That these plaintiffs and others have not been consulted by said body in the obligations so assumed, and securities so issued ; that they have not assented to the imposition of any such charge upon them, or taken any benefit or advantage therefrom ; that the transactions to the said investments in railroads, and to the said securities asserted to have been issued thereto, have been between the said City Council, for the time being, and others, parties unknown to these plaintiffs; that the charge upon these plaintiffs to the said securities so issued as aforesaid, amounts to very nearly one-half the value of all the property held by these plaintiffs, and others, within the limits of the said city; and the plaintiffs, not participating personally or by procuration in the said transactions, out of which this charge arises, have had no chance of answer or defence, but are liable at any instant of delay in the payment of the sums exacted, to execution upon their property; and without this, irreparable injury to result from such powers of execution, can assert their rights in no other form against this most unwarrantable exactio i.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\"><em>Tenth. </em>That the holders of the said stock so issued by the said City Council, in breach of trust as aforesaid, are very numerous.

Cunningham, who stand in the same rights as all other holders of said stock, and who, for themselves and others, are charged to defend the matters alleged in this complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">Wherefore the plaintiffs pray judgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-8\">1.

City Council demurred to the complaint, on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Phillips and Cunningham severally answered, and plaintiffs demurred to the answers, because the facts therein stated are insufficient to constitute a defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">His Honor the Circuit Judge held that the questions involved in the case were concluded by the decision in <em>Copies </em>vs. <em>Charleston, </em>(10 Rich., 491,) and the Act of 1854, (12 Btat., 375,) and it was ordered and adjudged that the demurrer of the defendant, the City Council, be sustained, and the summons and complaint be dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">The plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-8\"><em>Brewster, Spratt &amp; Burke, Cohen, </em>for appellants, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-9\"><em>Corbin, City Attorney, Phillips, J.

R.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AYl\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b504-11\">Moses, C. .J.</author>\n<p id=\"A46\">We have considered with much interest the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants. It evinces industrious research and elaborate investigation, and brings to bear upon the motion, in a strong and terse form, every possible reason that could be urged in its support. Regarding the point made, as directly decided by the case of <em>The State ex rel. James Copes </em>vs. <em>The Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Charleston, </em>(10 Rich., 491,) we have rather held it our duty to consider, whether any controlling policy has been shown, which should induce us to overrule it. A decision which has been accepted and conformed to for over fifteen years \u2014 made, too, by the unanimous concurrence of the Court of Errors, composed of all the Chancellors and Judges of the State, should not be disregarded, unless the necessity for its reversal is clear and apparent. Relying on its authority, the public has dealt with the securities to which it referred, as valid and binding on the City Council of Charleston, and now to declare them issued without the sanction of law, would deluge the State with a flood of litigation, the consequences of which would affect it for at least a half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>century. Not only the wealthy capitalist, but the poor widow and orphan, who, by the faith reposed in the said decision, invested their all in these stocks, would feel the heavy blow which a decision against the validity of the ordinances under which they were issued would inflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">If, in overruling an ordinary case made in a State Court by Judges who preceded those who have now the honor of occupying the places which they long held, with so much credit to themselves and satisfaction to the country, the utmost deference should be extended, and the greatest caution exercised to ensure a correct conclusion, how certain and satisfactory should be our conviction, before we ventured practically to set aside an authority, on the faith of which so many important engagements and contracts have been made. Even if our legal judgment differed from that pronounced in the said case, looking to the disastrous pecuniary consequences which would follow, we would.not, under the circumstances, feel ourselves justified, in any adjudication tending to its reversal, without a judicial necessity which could not be avoided. Stability in the law is of public consequence. A case depending on similar facts, should be decided by the one that has preceded it. If law depended upon principles, there can be no difference in their application to like cases. It is said in Ram. on Legal Judgment, 114, \u201c A reason constantly adverted to as a ground on which to adhere to a former decision, is the importance of certainty in the law. Another reason is the great importance that there should be. an uniformity of decision in the different Courts of Westminster Hall. A third reason is the probability that many transactions have taken place upon the footing of the former decision.\u201d Lord Kenyon, in <em>Schumann </em>vs. <em>Wetherhed, </em>1 East, 541, said, \u201c I should be sorry to see one decision in 1798, and a different decision on the same facts in 1801;\u201d and in Ram., 33, 34, a reference may be found to the many cases where a rule that has become settled law has been adhered to, although inconvenience has followed its observance, or it has been enforced although another rule may appear upon general principles more reasonable and more just.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Our American commentator, Chancellor Kent, second to none of the modern jurists' \u2014 one whose learning has contributed to the elucidation of the general principles of the law, and whose decisions are referred to as the great lights by which those who have succeeded him in the administration of justice are to be guided \u2014 in the 21st Chapter of his work, in the strong but concise language peculiar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>him, bears his own testimonny to the importance of adhering \u201cto a solemn decision as the highest evidence which we can have of the law applicable to the subject.\u201d ' Recommending what he there says, and adopting it as the rule by which we must be here governed, we cannot forbear to quote the following from his expressions, applicable to the point on hand: \u201cIf judicial decisions were to be lightly disregarded, we should disturb and unsettle the great landmarks of property. When a rule has been once deliberately adopted and declared, it ought not to be disturbed, unless by a Court of Appeals or Review, and never by the same Court, except for very cogent reasons, and upon a clear manifestation of error; and if the practice were otherwise, it would be leaving us in a state of perplexing uncertainty as to the law. The language of Sir William Jones is exceedingly forcible on this point: \u2018no man,\u2019 says he, \u2018who is not a lawyer would ever know how to act, and no man who is a lawyer would, in many instances, know what to advise, unless Courts were bound by authority as firmly as the Pagan Deities were supposed to be bound by the decrees of fate.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">It is ordered that the motion be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-6\"><em>Willard, </em>A.
