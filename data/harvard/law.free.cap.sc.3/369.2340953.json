That the provisions of the said Section 8, Article IX, of said Constitution, and the provisions of the said Act of March 1st, 1870, have repealed so much of the said Act to extend the limits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>City of Charleston, as exempts all lands, slaves, horses, carts, &amp;c., which may be exclusively employed in agriculture, from city taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">Y. By an Act of the General Assembly of said State, entitled \u201cAn Act to regulate the assessment and taxation of personal property in the City of Charleston,\u201d approved March 1, 1870, it is provided that \u201c the Act entitled \u2018 An Act to provide for the assessment and taxation of property,\u2019 \u201c approved September 16,1868, shall be extended to the City of Charleston, for the purpose of assessment and taxation of personal property, so far as the same shall be applicable, &amp;c. Under the authority of the said Constitution and Acts of General Assembly, hereinbefore recited, the City Council of Charleston ratified an Ordinance on the 22d day of March, 1870, entitled \u201c An Ordinance to raise supplies for the fiscal year ending December 31st, 1870,\u201d the first and second Sections of which are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">\u201c Sec. 1. That the City Appraiser is hereby authorized to assess a tax of two cents upon the dollar of the value of all real and personal property in the City of Charleston, for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the city government for the current fiscal year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">\u201c Sec. 2. The taxes assessed under this ordinance, except such as are otherwise directed, shall be payable in three equal parts; one part on or before the 10th day of April next; another part on or before the last day of June next; and the third part on or before the last day of September next.\u201d Pursuant to the said Ordinance the City Council of Charleston, through the City Appraiser, assessed the tax of two cents upon the dollar, of the value of all real and personal property of the said Arthur B. Rose, amounting to (211) two hundred and eleven dollars, notice of which tax was duly given to the said Rose, and payment thereof demanded; but neither the said tax or any part thereof was paid at the time or times required by the provisions of the Ordinance aforesaid. Said taxes not having been paid as required by law, the City Treasurer of said city added a penalty of 20 per cent, thereon, as required by the 43d Section of the Ordinance of the said City Council, entitled \u201c An Ordinance to provide for the assessment and taxation of property,\u201d ratified the 10th day of February, 1870, which Section is in words as follows, to wit: \u201c When the taxes, assessments and penalties charged against any parcel or lot of real or personal property, shall not be paid on or before the day prescribed by the ordinance, a penalty of 20 per cent, thereon shall be added by the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Treasurer; and if said taxes and penalty shall not be paid within thirty days next thereafter, or collected by distress or otherwise, the penalty and said taxes shall be treated as the delinquent taxes on such real or personal property to be collected in the manner that is or may be prescribed by law; and if the amount of such delinquent taxes, assessment and penalties shall not be paid within thirty days next thereafter, the delinquent taxes, assessments and penalties of the current year shall be due, and collected by the sale of such real or personal estate in the manner that is or may be required by law;\u201d and certified the said tax and the penalty added by him thereto to George Addison, City Sheriff, who thereupon \u25a0 proceeded to collect the same as required by the 48th Section of the Ordinance last aforesaid, which Section is in words as follows, to wit: <em>\u201c </em>When the taxes and assessments charged against any party or property on the Property Return, shall not be paid on or before the day prescribed by Ordinance, or where the remainder of such taxes and assessment shall not be paid, on or before the day prescribed by the Ordinance thereafter, together with the penalty on such remaining unpaid, the City Sheriff, to whom the same shall be certified by the City Treasurer\u2019, shall proceed to collect the same by distress or otherwise, as may at the time be prescribed by law, together with a penalty of five per cent, on the amount so delinquent, which penalty shall be for the City Sheriff as a compensation for making such collection.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">YI. These defendants deny that the exemption from taxation provided for by the said Act, to extend the limits of the City of Charleston, is in the nature of a contract with the owners of articles enumerated therein, as exempt from such taxation, and they say that if such exemption were in the nature of a contract, it was for a limited period only, and to continue for so long a period as might seem proper to the Legislature of said State. The said period of exemption from taxation as aforesaid, expired at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, of said State, if not before; and from and since said day all property within the corporate limits of said city, except such as is exempted from taxation by said Constitution, is liable to municipal taxation by these defendants. And the actings and doings of these defendants under said Acts of the General Assembly, and said ordinances, are in strict conformity to law, and they ought not to be prohibited from collecting the taxes lawfully assessed by them as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">Wherefore, these respondents, having fully answered, pray that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>they may be hence discharged with their reasonable costs and charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">The Circuit Court Judge made the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">On reading and filing the suggestion and answer in the above entitled cause, and after hearing counsel for the relator and motion for writ of prohibition, and the counsel for the respondents in opposition thereto: Ordered, That the relator\u2019s suggestion in this action be dismissed and motion be denied with cost, and that an order be entered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">The same order was made in each of the other cases, and the relators, severally, appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-8\"><em>Magrath, Barker, </em>for appellants,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANm\">contended that the Act of 1849 was not repealed, either by Section 8, Art.

The property of the relator is taxable by the State and by the City Council of Charleston, unless exempted by law, because \u201c all subjects over which the sovereign power of the State extends, are objects of <em>taxation.\u201d' </em>\u2014 McCulloch vs. <em>The State of Maryland, </em>4 Wheat., 316; <em>Weston </em>vs. <em>The City Council of Charleston, </em>2 Pet., 462 ; <em>Thompson </em>vs. <em>Pacific Railroad, </em>9 Wall., 579; <em>People </em>vs. <em>Commissioners of Taxes, </em>21 H.

The exemptions provided for by the Act of 1849 were not perpetual, but subject to modification by future legislation or by necessary implication, and, therefore, 'were not contracts, or if contracts were determinable at the will of the State. \u2014 In the matter of the <em>jReciprocity Bank, </em>17 How.

The rule of taxation imposed by the Act of 1849 was not uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>form, inasmuch as it exempted certain kinds of property from taxation in one portion of the City of Charleston while it left the same kinds of property subject to taxation in other portions of the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\">4. The rule of taxation laid down by the Act of 1849 was unjust and oppressive, as it exempted persons holding certain kinds of property, in a certain portion of the city, from a public burden, common to all citizens, without exacting from them a <em>bonus </em>or an equivalent duty as the price of such exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-6\">5. The unequal, unjust and oppressive rule laid down by the Act of 1849, has been abolished, and the just and equal rule of the Constitution and the Act of March 1st, 1870, has been substituted therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-7\">6. The exemption of property situate on Charleston Neck, from the burden of taxation to pay the debts of the old city, was an exercise of the power of State sovereignty.

See <em>Gilman </em>vs. <em>Oity of Sheboygan, </em>2 Black, 510.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-8\">7. The exercise of the power of State sovereignty, in providing for a uniform rate of taxation of all property within the City of Charleston, to pay such debts as well as others common to the city, is not in violation of the Constitution, as impairing the obligation of a contract, or as being an <em>ex post facto law. </em>\u2014 Satterlee 'vs. <em>Matthewson, </em>2 Pet., 380; <em>Locke </em>vs. <em>Neiu Orleans, 4 </em>Wall., 172; <em>Carpenter </em>vs. <em>Pennyslvania, </em>17 How., 461.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-9\">The power of taxation, or the exemption therefrom, is not secured by contract between the State\u2019and its citizens. \u201c Nor are taxes contracts between party and party, either express or implied; but they are the positive acts of the government, through its various agents, binding upon the inhabitants, and to the making or enforcing of whick their personal consent, individually, is not required.\u201d\u2014 <em>Pierce </em>vs. <em>City of Boston, </em>3 Met., 520.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-10\">8.

That all the debts of the city, now in existence, shall be charged on the property now possessed by the city, and paid by those now liable for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u201c 2d. That all taxes to be levied upon that part of St. Phillip\u2019s Parish hereby incorporated with the city, within ten years next succeeding such incorporation, shall be applied exclusively in manner following, that is to say, first to pay a proportionable part of the general expenses of the corporation, and next to the special and proper benefit and improvement of that part of St. Phillip\u2019s Parish hereby incorporated with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u201c 3d. That all lands, slaves, horses, carts, &amp;c., which may be exclusively employed in agriculture, shall, while so employed, be exempt from taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The fourth condition is in respect to the erection of wooden buildings, and has no bearing on the question raised by the suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The second Section of the Act provides <em>\u201c </em>that all the property belonging to the city of Charleston shall be vested in the corporate body to be formed by the annexation herein provided for, subject only to the claim of the present creditors of the city for payment of their demands out of the coffers or revenues of the same, and that all the laws and regulations of force in the city of Charleston shall stand, and be binding over that part of Si. Phillip\u2019s Parish hereby incorporated with the city, subject only to the foregoing considerations and restrictions, and to such modifications as may, from time to time, be made therein by future legislation, or by necessary implication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The relators severally allege that they are owners, either of real or personal property, exclusively employed in agriculture, and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>empt from city taxation, which the Council is about to enforce under its Ordinance of March 22, 1870, entitled \u201cAn Ordinance to raise supplies for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1870.\u201d \u2014 City Ordinances, 1870, p. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Unless the A ct of 1849 pan be construed to confer a perpetual exemption, founded on contract, it is subject to repeal or modification, by the Legislature, as its judgment may best direct. Where that department of the government, within the sphere of its constitutional limits, exercises the functions which properly belong to it, either to the imposition of restrictions upon the people of the State, or discharging them from exactions it had the right to demand, its action is to be referred to its inherent sovereignty, and not to any compact in the nature of a contract. What single element, necessary to the constitution of a contract, is embraced in the Act? What is to be found in it, or in the history of its enactment, to show that the inclusion of the new territory in the corporation was with the express consent of the residents, who were to be brought within the operation of the city charter, on the condition that \u201ctheir property, employed in agriculture,\u201d was to be exempt from taxation? What was the consideration moving the State to the contract ? The assent of those who were to be made corporators was not necessary to its passage, or to its validity. No power within their means could have prevented the execution of the intention of the Legislature. If the General Assembly did not desire, suddenly and unexpectedly, to impose a burthen on the agricultural industry of the Parish about to be annexed to the city, from which it had, heretofore, been free, and, therefore, exempted it from taxation, to what consideration will the relators refer for their claim to its perpetual enjoyment? The \u201cconditions and restrictions,\u201d which the Act imposed as limitations on the power of the corporation over the enlarged boundaries to which its jurisdiction was to extend, are set up as a surrender of a sovereign right on the part of the State. The Legislature was dealing with the corporation in the extension of the city boundaries, and prohibited it from taxing those in the condition of these relators. It was a restriction on a right which they otherwise legitimately could have exercised. What excluded the Legislature from now releasing the corporation from the imposed restrictions ? The Legislature was dealing with the corporation, which certainly makes no complaint of the violation of the supposed contract. The main distinction between public and private corporations is that, over the former, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the Legislature, as the trustee or guardian of the public interests, has the exclusive and unrestrained control; and acting as such, as it may create, so it may modify or destroy as public exigency requires or recommends, or as the public interest \u201c will be the best sub-served.\u201d\u2014Angell <em>&amp; </em>A. on Corp., \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Mr. Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, p. 192, says: \u201cThe creation of municipal corporations, and the conferring upon them of certain powers, and subjecting them to corresponding duties, does not deprive the Legislature of the State of that complete control over their citizens which was before possessed. It still has authority to amend their charters, enlarge or diminish their powers, extend or limit their boundaries, consolidate two or more into one, overrule their actions whenever it is deemed unwise, impolitic or unjust, and even abolish them altogether in the legislative discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The principles upon which the decision in the case of <em>The Rector, </em>&amp;c., <em>of Christ Church, &amp;c., </em>vs. <em>County of Philadelphia, </em>24 How., 300, rested, well apply here. In 1833 the Legislature of Pennsylvania exempted from taxation the real property and ground rents belonging and payable to Christ Church Hospital, so long as the same shall continue to belong to said hospital. In 1851 it required that all property, real and personal, belonging to any company or association which is now by law exempt from taxation, shall hereafter be subject to taxation as other property is now by law taxable. It was held that the last law was not in violation of the Constitution of the United States, as tending to impair a legislative contract; that it is in the nature of such a privilege as the Act of 1833 confers, that it exists <em>bene placitum, </em>and may be revoked at the pleasure of the sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The suggestion seeks a prohibition on the further ground that the tax raised under the Ordinance of March 1, 1870, is \u201cto be' applied, amongst other things, not only in payment of debts contracted under authority of law, but also in payment of debts of the said city contracted previously to the 19th December, 1849.\u201d This objection was not referred to in the argument on behalf of the relators. It proceeds upon the assumption that the Act of 1849 is a covenant on the part of the State with the owners of the land, and, therefore, not subject to repeal or modification. It involves the general principle on which the relators claim exemption from the tax now about to be enforced against them, and, as it cannot be sustained, this must fall with it. Holding that the restriction imposed by the said Act on the City Council, in the imposition of taxes on the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>and personal property of the relators employed in agriculture, was subject to revocation at the pleasure of the Legislature, it only remains to enquire whether the prohibition has been repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Unless the Constitution of 1868 qualified the power of the Legislature over municipal corporations, in the matter of taxation, it retained all the authority which it had in that respect up to the time of its adoption. The modification, too, is not to be presumed \u2014 it must be direct, apparent and undisputable. Speaking of the power of taxation, Ch. J. Marshall, in <em>Providence Bank </em>vs. Pittman, 4 Pet., 561, says: \u201cBut as the whole community is interested in retaining it undiminished, that community has a right to insist that its abandonment ought not to be presumed in a case in which the deliberate purpose of the State to abandon it does not appear.\u201d In <em>Philadelphia and Wilmington Railroad Co., </em>vs. <em>Howard, </em>10 How., 393, Taney, C. J., said: \u201c This Court, on several occasions, has held that the taxing power of a State is never presumed to be relinquished unless the intention to relinquish is declared in clear and unambiguous terms.\u201d As \u201cthe City Council is invested with the same powers to impose taxes on legitimate subjects of taxation as the State itself possesses,\u201d <em>(Bulow and Potter </em>vs. <em>the City Council of Charleston, </em>1 N. &amp; McC., 527; <em>Cruikshanks </em>vs. <em>Same, </em>1 McC., 360,) the same rule must apply to the taxing power within the bounds conceded to it by the Legislature. So far from the Constitution laying any restraint on the powers of the Legislature over municipal corporations in the matter of taxation, the first Section of ninth Article requires that \u201c the General Assembly shall provide by law for a uniform and equal rate of taxation.\u201d The eighth Section of the same Article provides that \u201c the corporate authorities of Counties, townships, school districts, cities, towns and villages, may be vested with power to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes, such taxes to be uniform in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same.\u201d It would be without avail to look to the Constitution of 1868, for any abatement of the power which the Legislature could before lawfully exercise over municipal corporations in the matter of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The only enquiry which remains, is whether the Legislature directly or by implication has repealed the Section of the Act of 1849, under which the exemption here is claimed ? The Act of March 1, 1870, entitled \u201cAn Act to enforce a uniform system of assessment and taxation by municipal bodies,\u201d (14 Stat., 410,) declares \u201c that all municipal corporations chartered under, or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>laws of this State, and vested with power to lay and collect taxes, are hereby authorized and required to assess all property, real and personal, within their corporate limits, at its actual value, and lay all taxes thereon at a uniform and equal rate: <em>Provided, </em>That all property, and no other, exempted from taxation by the third Section of the Act entitled \u2018 An Act to provide for the assessment and taxation of property,\u2019 ratified the 15th day of September, A. D. 1868, shall be exempted from taxation by municipal corporations and the second Section declares \u201cthat all Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent with this Act be and the same are hereby repealed.\u201d The said Act certainly does not exempt any property from its operation, save that which is covered by the proviso. As to the property liable to taxation, it leaves nothing discretionary with the corporations, for it requires \u201c an assessment of all property within their corporate limits at its actual value,\u201d and that they shall \u201c lay all taxes thereon at a uniform and equal rate.\u201d The language is so full and comprehensive \u2014 the intent so apparent, and the repugnancy to the Act of 1849 so entire \u2014 that human ingenuity, exercised to its fullest capacity, must fail to reconcile them. If the property of these relators is within the corporate limits of the city of Charleston, it is by express enactment subject to taxation \u201c at its actual value and at a uniform and equal rate.\u201d The intent of the Act of 1870 was to secure the \u201c uniform\u201d system of taxation required by the Constitution. If the Act of 1849 still continues of force, the system so contemplated could not be enforced in the municipal corporation of Charleston.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">If there was a doubt remaining as to the utter inconsistency of the two Acts, it should be satisfied by the language of the proviso, which exempts from municipal taxation the property specified in the third Section of the Act of 1868, \u201cand no other,\" and the property of the character of that held by these relators, as set forth in the suggestions, is not included in the said Section.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">It is claimed that the said property of these relators is exempt from the tax sought to be enforced against them, by the effect of the words to be found in said 8th Section of Article IS, which are as follows : \u201c And the General Assembly shall require that all the property, except that heretofore exempted, within the limits of municipal corporations, shall be taxed for the payment of debts contracted under the authority of law.\u201d To construe the word \u201c heretofore \u201d in the connection with which it is found, as referring to all property before exempt, would be in disregard of the mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>fest purpose of the convention in the system of taxation which it was establishing for the State, and for those corporate bodies which, by its authority, exercised the power of imposing it. The State was required to enact laws to carry out certain directions as to exemptions. With this exception, it retained its discretionary right in the exercise of the taxing power. The word \u201c heretofore \u201d must be held to refer to the property exempted by that portion of the Constitution which precedes the Section in which it is found, and to be accepted in the sense of hereinbefore.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The motions in the several cases are refused, and the appeals dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-6\"><em>Willard, </em>A.
