The case is recited in the order appealed from, which is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-10\">\u201c The plaintiffs in this action are the children and sole heirs at law of Amelia V. Hooper, deceased. Their mother, the said, Amelia V. Hooper, upon the death of a former husband, Dr. Franklin Massey, became entitled under his will, to the land (445 acres) now in dispute. The plaintiffs and the defendant both claim to derive title from her \u2014 the plaintiffs as heirs at law by descent, and the defendant by purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-11\">\u201c On the 24th day of November, 1845, the said Amelia V. and Dr. Edward J. Hooper, in contemplation of their intermarriage, which occurred soon after, entered, it seems, into a contract, under seal, in Lowns County, Alabama, by which the said Edward J. promised and agreed, on the occurrence of the marriage, to convey by deed all of the estate, both real and personal, of the said Amelia V., to Samuel B. Massey, of Lancaster, S. C., since deceased, \u201c to have and to hold the said property, both real and personal, to be deeded as aforesaid, as trustee for the said Amelia V. Massey, for her sole and separate use and behoof, subject to her discretion (query, direction) and control, free from all debts, liabilities or incumbrances of the said Edward J. Hooper, whatsoever.\u201d But it does not appear that, in pursuance of this contract, any such deed was ever executed by said Edward J. Hooper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-12\">\u201cOn the 7th day of January, 1850, the said Samuel B. Massey, professing to act as attorney in fact of the said Edward J. Hooper and wife, executed (without reciting in what manner authorized) a deed of conveyance of the land in question, in their names, to one James Faulkner. But it does not appear that he was authorized by deed or power of attorney to make the conveyance; nor does it appear that Mrs. Amelia V., the wife, ever relinquished her right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>of inheritance in the land. The deed to Faulkner was not produced, but the record thereof in the Register\u2019s office is unaccompanied by any such power or relinquishment of inheritance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">\u201c After their marriage, it seems, Dr. Hooper and wife lived on the land for about two years, and then removed to North Carolina, where they were residing in 1850, when the deed to Faulkner was executed. Dr. Hooper died some time in that year, (1850,) and his widow having survived him until October, 1851, died in Alabama, leaving her children, the plaintiffs, all infants, the eldest not having attained the age of twenty-one years until December, 1861, and the remaining two being still infants at the time this action was commenced. It appears that the execution of the deed to James Faulkner was followed by possession of the land by him, which continued up to the time of his death, the date of which is not fixed by evidence. After his death it was sold by his executors and purchased by the defendant, John Adams, to whom a deed of conveyance wms executed, dated February the 19th, 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">\u201c After Dr. Hooper and wife removed from this State, Mr. S. B. Massey appears to have acted as their general agent. The defendant, or rather the executor of James Faulkner, who had been vouched, relied on the presumptions arising . from the marriage agreement, the lapse of time, the conduct of Mr. Massey, and upon Faulkner\u2019s possession of the land to support his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">\u201cI thought, and so instructed the jury, that these were insufficient to amount to evidence that Mrs. Hooper had ever been divested of her title to the land; and inasmuch as the infancy of the plaintiffs protected them against any right Faulkner might have acquired by his possession, they should find a verdict for the land in favor of the plaintiffs. They, nevertheless, found for the defendant, and the plaintiffs made this motion for a new trial. After hearing argument on the motion, I am still of opinion that the verdict is unsupported by evidence, and the motion must prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">\u201c I further instructed the jury that the presumption arising from twenty years\u2019 lapse of time, that anything which ought to have been done to perfect a title should be presumed to have been done, was answered by the production of the deed from S. B. Massey, under which defendant claimed, according to their own testimony; that the title could not pass in that way, and only could have passed by the intervention of a Court of Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\"><em>\u201c </em>It is, therefore, ordered that a new trial be granted, and verdict heretofore rendered be set.aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The defendants\u2019 attorneys excepted to the order, and now moved this Court to set aside the same:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">1. Because the lapse of time since the date of the marriage settlement between the said Amelia Y. and Dr. E. J. Hooper, executed in Downs County, Alabama, on the 24th day of November, 1845, -whereby the land in dispute was to become vested in the said S. B. Massey as trustee for the said Amelia Y., accompanied by the subsequent possession of Massey, Faulkner and Adams, are sufficient in law to authorize the presumption that Hooper and wife did execute to S. B. Massey, under the terms of the marriage agreement, such a deed as authorized the said S. B. Massey to convey a good title to the said James Faulkner, in the manner in which he did convey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">2. Because, under the circumstances of this case, the law will authorize the presumption of the execution of any paper necessary to protect the title of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">8. Because, after such a lapse of time, and the circumstances of the case, a ratification of the deed of S. B. Massey to Faulkner may be presumed to have been made by Mrs. Hooper after the death of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">4. Because, the terms of the said marriage agreement being that the said S. B. Massey should hold the land subject to \u201c the direction and control\u2019\u2019 of the said Amelia Y., the authority of the latter to convey, as may be implied from the circumstances, was sufficient to render valid the conveyance from Massey to Faulkner as made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">5. Because, the legal estate in the said land, being, by the terms of the said marriage agreement, vested in the said S. B. Massey, the subsequent conveyance of the land by Massey is valid in law, and the plaintiffs cannot, <em>in this Court, </em>seek to question or to set aside the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-10\">6. Because his Honor, the presiding Judge, erred in asserting \u201cthat the infancy of the plaintiffs protected them against any right Faulkner might have acquired by his possession \u201d of the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-11\">7: Because twenty years\u2019 adverse possession (or a less time with circumstances) by Faulkner and Adams, is sufficient in law to raise a presumption of title, even as against infants; and the testimony of Mrs. Faulkner, that her husband <em>purchased </em>the land in 1848; and the testimony of John Short, that Faulkner <em>had </em>the land in 1849, was'sufficient to warrant the. jury in believing that Faulkner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and Adams had actual or constructive possession for twenty years, or over, previous to the 8th of January, 1869, the date of the entry of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">8. Because Faulkner\u2019s title was ratified by the plaintiff, B. F. Massey, at least to the extent of any interest he may have had in said land: 1st, by his implied assent to its sale as the estate of Faulkner, in November, 1862; 2d, by his becoming surety to the purchaser (Adams) for the payment to Faulkner\u2019s estate of the purchase money; 3d, by his acquiescence in the possession of Faulkner and Adams from December, 1861, (the date of his majority,) to the 8th of January, 1869, the date of the entry of this suit; and, in any event, the share in said land to which the plaintiff, B. F. Massey, may have been entitled, of right belongs to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">9. Because the testimony of A. J. Kibler, that he had delivered to Adams several papers, constituting what he believed to be a good chain of title, and the testimony of Adams that his papers were scattered, and some of them destroyed during the war; coupled with other facts in evidence going to show that the plaintiff, B. F. Massey, and the defendant, Adams, have the same interest in this action \u2014 both antagonistic to the estate of Faulkner \u2014 were sufficient, with lapse of time, to warrant the jury in presuming that Faulkner had a good title, the evidence of which had either been suppressed or destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">10. Because the ruling of his Honor the presiding Judge, in granting a new trial, is, in other respects, contrary to law, and the verdict of the jury is supported both by the law and the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-8\"><em>Kershaw, </em>for appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">The exceptions make the points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-10\">1. That the jury had a right to presume a power of attorney from Hooper and wife to S. B. Massey, to convey the land in dispute to James Faulkner, in the manner that he did, and that Mrs. Hooper relinquished her inheritance in proper form during coverture, or released the same after the death of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">2. That the jury had the right to presume that the land was conveyed to Massey, according to the terms of the marriage contract, and that one of the provisions of the presumed deed was that the land could be conveyed by Massey, as the attorney of the parties, under the direction of Mrs. Hooper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-12\">3. That the jury had the right to presume that a deed was executed to S. B. Massey, in pursuance of the marriage agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>whereby the legal estate passed to Massey, and his sale to Faulkner, and the possession under it, was sufficient to vest the title to the land in defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">4. That the jury had a right to presume any possible circumstances necessary to perfect the title of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">5. That in any event, the plaintiff, B. F. Massey, is excluded from the recovery of his share of the land, having stood by and suffered the defendant to purchase the land, and even became his surety fox- the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">1. James Faulkner purchased the land in question in 1848. Faulkner, probably, had it in 1849; was certainly in possession in 1850; S. B. Massey, as attorney for Hooper and wife, executed the deed under which defendant claims, January 7, 1850; Massey acted as the general agent of Hooper and wife; he had charge of the premises ; he was the brother-in-law of Mrs. Hooper ; the uncle and guardian of the plaintiffs; it was understood that he had power to sell the land ; Kibler, the executor of Faulkner, gave the papers appertaining to the land to the defendant, and believes they made out a complete chain of title; one of plaintiffs is the son-in-law of defendant, and now lives on the premises, and is surety to defendant\u2019s note for the purchase money; defendant owes the purchase money, with interest from November, 1862; it is to his interest that the plaintiffs should recover. Hooper died in 1850, and his wife in October, 1851. Did these circumstances authorize the jury to presume Massey\u2019s authority and Mrs. Hooper\u2019s renunciation of inheritance or release ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-8\">The maxim \u201c <em>Omnia presumuntwr rite esse aeta\u201d </em>applies. \u2014 Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 729.

But had Mrs. Hooper even relinquished her inheritance, in strict compliance with the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that Act, still, inasmuch as the certificate of such relinquishment was certainly not recorded in the Clerk\u2019s office, within six months, indeed not at all, it would have been utterly ineffectual as a conveyance of her title. \u2014 See Act of 1795, 3 Stat., 302; 1 Faust, 7; <em>Hillegas </em>vs. <em>Hartley, </em>1 Hill\u2019s Ch., 106.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">5th. The jury, in the judgment of the Circuit Judge, erred in presuming the fact to be that Mrs. Hooper\u2019s title had been conveyed to Faulkner. The Judge, therefore, committed no error in granting the new trial. \u2014 Whitaker, V. 2, pp. 790, 791; <em>Hyot </em>vs. <em>Thompson, </em>Ex\u2019or., 19 N.

Y., 524.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b271-6\">March 16, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A7s\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b271-7\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD2\">The action was trespass to try title, A verdict was rendered by the jury in favor of the defendant, and, on the motion of the plaintiffs, an order for new trial was granted by the Circuit Judges, which the appeal to this Court seeks to set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The Judge, in his charge, instructed the jury to find for the plaintiffs. This direction they disregarded, and returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The only question proper for our consideration, is whether there was error of law in the order granting the new trial. If it was founded, either wholly or in part, on a conclusion from the fact contrary to that of the jury, then, according to the well established principles governing the Court in regard to appeals, in which propositions of law do not arise, we cannot <em>interfere.</em>\u2014Miller vs. <em>Schuyler, </em>20 N. Y., 522 ; <em>Byrd, et al. </em>vs. <em>Small, </em>2 S. C., 388. The defense involved two positions, and if either was sustained, it was sufficient to prevent a recovery by the plaintiffs : First, a seizure in fee in the defendant, by a regular chain of title not developed on the trial, but to be presumed from circumstances in testimony as a question of fact; and, second, the presumption of whatever may be necessary to confer a good and perfect title from an adverse possession of twenty years. While the conclusion raised by the presumption in the first instance may be rebutted by evidence, that which the law makes from long possession has acquired an artificial force so strong, that it must prevail to induce belief, though such, belief may not be the result of actual conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">We are obliged to infer that the jury either regarded the circumstances proved as sufficient to satisfy them of the execution of the proper deed and power from Hooper and his wife, or supposing that full twenty years had elapsed from the commencement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the possession on which the defendant relied, they entirely discarded the instruction of the Judge, that the infancy of the plaintiffs protected them against the presumption which might otherwise jorevail in favor of such tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As this ruling of the Judge forms a ground of exception, on the part of the defendant, and is so much relied on in favor of the motion he submits, it is proper that it should not be passed over without examination. As the question is purely one of law, for the purpose of the argument we will assume that Adams, the defendant, and those under whom he claims, had possession for full twenty years, before action brought. If the appellant can sustain the position .that the presumption of title from possession is sufficient to avail against minors, claiming the land in their own right, and that the disability of infancy cannot protect them against such presumption, then there was error in law, on the part of the Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Upon what rests the presumption of right from long possession ? It is, that the occupancy was adverse, and the forbearance of those having the legal power to interfere, is claimed as a recognition of the title presumed to have been conferred through a deed from the \u00a1mrty last seized. An infant, however, is regarded in law as incapable of knowing or enforcing his rights. The consent or acquiescence which, in the case of an adult, may be considered as contributing to deprive him of his rights, can never be urged against an infant. To say, then, that, by not asserting his claim, he is barred by a presumption which rests on a supposed consent, is to impugn the very principle on which the disability of infancy is founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The cases which, in the argument, were referred to from our books, where the presumption was allowed, although the party last seized left infant children, made no issue between such children and third persons; the Court properly held that the presumption in favor of the claimant could not be resisted by the disability which might protect the infants if they were before it. In <em>Gray </em>vs. <em>Bates, </em>3 Strob., 502, one of the cases, O\u2019Neall, J., delivering the opinion of the Court, says: \u201c With this presumption, Milledge, the infant, has nothing to do. It takes nothing from him ; it operates against Jackson, who was last seized of the land in dispute. It is very true that if lapse of time be set up against an infant, it cannot have any effect until he be of full ageand in the other, <em>Stockdale </em>vs. <em>Young, </em>Colcock, J., says : \u201c It is only necessary to remark that the fact of the grantees having left a son, who died in 1792, leaving twm infant children, could not affect the possession, as they neither entered nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>claimed, nor in any wise rebut the presumption of a conveyance from the grantee.\u201d There seems to be no reason why the disability of infancy should operate as a protection of title to property, save in the particular instance where the minor asserts or claims it. The disability is a protection for him, and those who claim through him, not to be used for the benefit of any others.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The proposition contended for by the appellant has been decided both in the Courts of Law and Equity of this State to be without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">It was held in <em>Riddlehoover </em>et al. vs. <em>Kinard, </em>1 Hill. Ch., 378, that the possession of property for twenty years confers title as against all persons who were not under legal disabilities, and after that period a Court will presume whatever may be necessary to give efficacy to the possession. In <em>Gray </em>vs. <em>Givens, 2 </em>Hill. Ch., 514, Judge Harper, as the organ of the Court, said : \u201c I think it has not before been questioned, but that the time during which the party to be affected has been under a disability must be deducted in computing the lapse of time in analogy to the Statute of Limitations.\u201d The same principle was recognized in <em>Godfrey </em>vs. <em>Schmidt, </em>et al , Chev. Eq., 57. The Court in <em>Larule </em>vs. <em>Crosland, </em>4 Rich., 540, applying the rules which had governed the cases herein already cited, held \u201c that where a party claims a right to an easement through another\u2019s land by adverse use for twenty years, and during a part of the time, though after the commencement of the adverse use, the land was owned by infants, that period must be deducted in the computation of the time, and if twenty years do not remain, the right is not established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">These authorities are sufficient to shew that the appellant has failed to establish error in law in the instruction of the Court in the particular referred to. Concluding, therefore, that no error of law is contained in the order, but that it involves a difference of opinion between the Judge and the jury on the facts, and the results legitimately deducible from them, we are not at liberty to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">According to the stipulation on the part of the appellant, if the order be affirmed, the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment absolute against him, and the second sub-division of Sec. 11 of the Code of Procedure, Revised Stat., 517, requires that such judgment shall be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">It is accordingly ordered and adjudged that the motion be dismissed, and that the plaintiffs in the said cause have judgment absolute against the defendant, and that the proceedings be remitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to the Circuit Court for the County of Lancaster for such further proceedings as may be necessary to render the judgment hereby given effective and complete, as provided by the Section of the Code referred to.</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-5\"><em>Willard, </em>A.
