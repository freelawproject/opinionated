Collins, Anna Child, and others, defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-13\">The brief, upon which the case was heard on the appeal, contained copies of the bill, answers and exhibits, the evidence, oral and written, taken by a Referee, the opinion and decree of the Circuit Judge, and the notice and grounds of appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-14\">The questions made in the Supreme Court, and there decided, will be understood from the judgment of that Court; and the opinion and decree of the Circuit Judge, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-15\">Orr, J. The bill in this case was filed 26th July, 1869, to set aside certain receipts executed by James M. Siillivan, guardian, William Hickson and wife Martha, George W. Collins and wife, (now deceased,) to William M. Thomas, late Commissioner in Equity for Greenville, and to set aside and annul the receipt of T. Henry Stokes and wife Abigail, endorsed on the bond of defendants Tolberts, 31st October, 1865, \u201csatisfied, so far as my wife\u2019s interest in this bond is concerned,\u201d and also their loose receipt for three thousand dollars in gold, in <em>satisfaction </em>of their claim on the bond of the Tolberts, and for account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>George W. Tolbert purchased at Commissioner\u2019s sale the Cambridge land of the \u201c Shaw estate,\u201d for the sum of fifteen thousand one hundred and eighty-nine dollars, containing 915 acres, on the 6th day of February, 1861, payable in two equal annual installments, with interest. He gave his bond for the purchase money, with R. R. Tolbert, his father, and John R. Tolbert, his sureties. George W. Tolbert, the principal in the bond, (now deceased,) filed his answer to the bill 9th November, 1869, to which reference may be made, and which has been adopted by John R., the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">The last installment of the bond fell due 6th February, 1863, and at least one of the parties in interest (Collins) desired that the bond should be paid. Thomas, the Commissioner in Equity at that time, wrote to Tolbert. After a correspondence between them, George W. Tolbert requested Thomas to advance the money due on the bond, and that he would reimburse him for such advance by the sale of cotton he then had on hand. The money due on the bond (or nearly all of it) was advanced by S. Thomas, the father of the Commissioner, and on the 6th of February, 1863, Thomas paid to Collins and wife four thousand five hundred dollars, and, by receipt of same date, to Hickson and wife four thousand five hundred dollars, and on the day of , 1863, to Dr. James M. Sullivan, the sum of $606.31, and on the day of June, 1863, to Dr. James M. Sullivan, as guardian,.-the sum of $1,132.66, making the aggregate paid to him in his own right and as guardian, the sum of $1,738.97..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">These payments nearly extinguished the interest which the above named parties had in the bond. After the payment there remained due to Collins and wife $139.93 ; to Hickson and wife $139.93; and to Dr. Sullivan and his wards the sum of $249.51. No payment was made in satisfaction of the interest of T. Henry Stokes and wife (the only other distributees) till after the war. He agreed to receive Confederate money from Thomas for his wife\u2019s interest, but after the money had been raised by Thomas, Stokes refused to receive it from him, and no payment on his wife\u2019s interest was made until after the termination of the war; when they received from Tolbert $3,000 in gold, equal (in October, 1865,) to $4,800 in United States currency, in full satisfaction of his w'ife\u2019s interest in the Tolbert bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-8\">The facts found in this case are, that the arrangement made between George W. Tolbert and William M. Thomas, late Commissioner in Equity, was fair, upright and <em>bona fide; </em>that Tolbert ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>plied to him to advance the money to the heirs of the \u201cShaw land\u201d for him on the bond ; that he advanced to George W. Collins and wife the sum of $4,500 ; to William. Hickson and wife $4,500 ; and to James M. Sullivan, individually and as guardian, <em>$1,738.97; </em>leaving due to the above parties only the sums heretofore set forth. That the above parties all received the money from Thomas, gave him unconditional receipts for the same, and used it; that these receipts are all dated in 1863, and that the present bill to cancel them was not filed till 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">That Collins and Hickson were importunate to have the Tolbert bond collected as soon as due. That no fraud, imposition or misrepresentation was practiced by Thomas on Collins, Hickson, or Sullivan ; that they received the money with full knowledge of the fact that he was advancing it for G. W. Tolbert, principal in the bond ; that the claim now set up by Sullivan, Collins and Hickson is an after thought, which would never have been conceived if Confederate money and bonds had not become valueless; that when they received the money their receipts were given for the several sums specified, and extinguished their respective interests in the Tolbert bond to that extent. That no collusion has been found between Thomas and Tolbert, to injure or defraud the parties having interest in the Tolbert bond ; nor are any of the acts of Thomas in the whole affair proved to be <em>mala fides; </em>that Thomas, at the July Term of the Court for Greenville, 1863, the first Court held after the arrangement made with his father, reported the same, exhibiting the payments to Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, and the assignment of the bond to his father, S. Thomas; that it was a public and official report, and silences the complaint and clamor of Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, that they had no cognizance that the money was raised otherwise than by payment by the Tolberts ; and that they slept on their rights from July, 1863, to July, 1869, when this bill was filed. That Thomas, having advanced or procured the advancement of $10,738.97, and procured, in good faith, receipts of the parties above named for that amount, proceeded to make a settlement with George W. Tolbert, the principal in the bond; upon which settlement, on the 31st Oct., 1865, Tolbert paid him the sum of $2,600 in gold, equal at that time, to $4,160 in U. S. currency, in full satisfaction of the money advanced by or through Thomas, to pay Hickson and wife, Collins and wife, and Sullivan, guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">As to T. Henry Stokes\u2019 demand to have the settlement between himself and G. W. Tolbert opened on the grounds of fear, fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>and misrepresentation \u2014 a settlement made 31st Oct., 1865, when he signed a receipt on the bond, acknowledging satisfaction of the bond so far as his wife had an interest in it, and the joint loose receipt of himself and -wife for the sum of three thousand dollars in gold, in satisfaction of her interest in the bond \u2014 it is even more preposterous than that set up by the other parties interested in the bond. The facts found with reference to his claims are, that George W. Tolbert paid him and his wife the sum of $3,000 in gold, equal in U. S. currency to $4,800, on 31st Oct., 1865 ; that in consideration that it was paid in cash, without hazard, litigation or expense, they accepted it in full satisfaction of the wife\u2019s share or interest in the bond of Tolbert; that no fraud or misrepresentation was practiced upon him by either of the Tolberts ; that before accepting their offer, he went to Abbeville and informed himself of the pecuniary condition of the Tolberts; and being thus informed, he accepted the offer, expressed himself well satisfied with the arrangement before and after the money was paid, and congratulated himself on receiving on the bond a sum so much greater than that paid to the other parties in interest in Confederate money in 1863 ; that the compromise was fair and honest when made; that T. H. Stokes was not put in fear to make the settlement, and that neither fraud nor misrepresentation were practiced upon .him. It is further found that there remains due and unpaid to Collins and (then wife) now step-daughter, Anna Child, on bond, $130.93, with interest from the 6th February, 1863, one-third thereof to Collins and two-thirds to Anna Child ; the same amount to Hickson and wife, with interest from same time; to Dr. J. M. Sullivan, in his own right, $56.53, and as guardian of all his children, $193.04, with interest on same from 6th February, 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">It is, therefore, adjudged that the defendant, John R. Tolbert, as administrator of the estate of George W. Tolbert, pay the parties aforesaid the said sums of money remaining unpaid on the bond of G. <em>W. </em>Tolbert, with the interest thereon; the payments to be made from the assets of the estate of said G. W. Tolbert, and if insufficient, then to be paid by the said John R. Tolbert, as executor of R. R. Tolbert, and by the said John R. Tolbert, in his own right. It is further adjudged, that T. Henry Stokes and wife, Abigail, have been fully paid and satisfied the interest of the said Abigail in the bond of George <em>W. </em>Tolbert, and that the settlement made by them with said Tolbert is final and conclusive, and that they are not entitled to have the settlement opened, or to the relief prayed for, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that the bill, as to said T. Plenry Stokes and wife, be dismissed at their costs. It is further adjudged, that John B. Tolbert, administrator of G. W. Tolbert, pay the remaining costs in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">The plaintiffs gave notice of appeal, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">The plaintiffs give notice to the defendants and their attorneys, and to Wm. A. McDaniel, Escp, Clerk of said Court, that the plaintiffs appeal from the decree of Hon. James L. Orr, in this case, filed 16th October, 1871, and will make their motion at the next sitting of the Supreme Court in Columbia, to modify the same so far as it disallows their claim to rescind the receipts given by the said James M. Sullivan to the defendant, Wm. M. Thomas, and to hold the obligors of the bond given by George W. Tolbert, B. B. Tolbert and John B. Tolbert, responsible for the full share of the said James M. Sullivan, in his own right, and as guardian of his said children, in said bond, to wit: One-fourth part of one-half of the principal and interest of said bond amongst them, on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">1. Because the said Wm. M. Thomas, whilst Commissioner in equity, executed, without any authority whatever, the pretended and fraudulent assignments endorsed on said bond, respectively, first to S. Thomas and then to Wm. M. Thomas, and again to Wm. M. Thomas, as attorney of S. Thomas, and said assignments being in fact and law fraudulent, could confer no rights whatever on the respective assignees, nor could -they authorize the obligors of said bond to pay any portion of said bond to said assignees, or either of them; and that in fact the said obligors never paid said Wm. M. Thomas, whilst Commissioner, any part of said bond, except the two first credits endorsed thereon, to wit: One of $676.70, and the other of $322. And the said obligors are liable to pay the entire balance of said bond, deducting the $3,000 they paid to T. Henry Stokes and wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">2. Because the allegations of the bill, that William M. Thomas falsely and fraudulently misrepresented to the complainants and the other parties entitled to the proceeds of said bond, that the Tolberts paid him said bond in Confederate money, was fully proved by the testimony in the cause, and the said obligors, with a full knowledge that they had not made said payment, and had not authorized him to do so, adopted the fraud of said William M. Thomas, and in fraud of plaintiff\u2019s rights proceeded to make payment to him to the extent of $2,600 in gold and four bales of cotton, after Thomas was out of office, and they should have been held liable for said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>payments, as well as the balance of said bond, less the $3,000 paid to T. Henry Stokes and wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">3. Because the said bond, in law and in fact, to the extent before indicated, should, under the proof in the case, have been regarded and treated by the Court as due and unsatisfied, and the obligors liable therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">4. Because, it is respectfully submitted, that the decree of the Court, to the extent complained of, is not only without evidence, but is in opposition to it and the law of the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-7\"><em>Sullivan &amp; Stokes, </em>for appellants :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-8\">1.

If we had allowed this as correct, it should then have been settled by the Judge; or, if we amended, he should have allowed or corrected, and then referred to the Judge.

Ignoring the law, and the reason for it, he throws before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the Court all of the facts, for a general review, and, having done this, his grounds of appeal are equally comprehensive.

Thomas, as Commissioner in Equity of Greenville District, taken on the sale of lands by such Commissioner, under a decree for partition. At such sale the defendant, G. W. Tolbert, became the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The bill prays an account as against W. M. Thomas, G. W. Tolbert as principal, and J. R. Tolbert, as security thereon, and also as executor of R. R. Tolbert, deceased, his co-surety. The parties originally entitled to the balance of the money secured by the bond, over and above that part claimed by the complainants, are made parties defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The bond in question was executed by G. <em>W. </em>Tolbert, Robert R. Tolbert and J. R. Tolbert, payable toW. M. Thomas, Commissioner. in Equity for Greenville District, and bears date, February 6, 1861. It is conditioned for the payment by G. W. Tolbert to W. M. Thomas, Commissioner, or his successors or assigns, the sum of $15,189, \u201cin one and two equal and successive installments,\u201d with interest from its date. It was delivered to and held by the defendant, W. M. Thomas, in his official character as Commissioner in Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Two payments, endorsed upon the bond, appear to be undisputed. One is for $676.70, made February 6, 1861, and the other for $322, made February 10, 1863.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">There are two other receipts endorsed upon the bond, the first of which is affected by the present controversy. They are, in words and figures, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">\u201cGreenville, S. C., 31st October, 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\u201cReceived of G. W.

These authorities cannot be understood in their bearing on the point made, unless a distinction, affecting the powers of this Court, is attended to, of which respondents appear to have lost sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The Supreme Court of this State is a Court for the correction of errors at law, having appellate jurisdiction only in cases of Chancery.\u2014Const., Art. 4, Sec. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">What is meant by appellate jurisdiction as contradistinguished from jurisdiction to correct errors at law? What is the class of cases described by the expression \u201ccases of Chancery,\u201d as employed by the Constitution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The answer to these questions will explain a matter frequently misunderstood.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">The fact that a Court for the correction of errors at law, as distinguished from one possessing general appellate power, was unknown in this State prior to the Constitution of 1868, accounts for the misapprehension that has existed in many minds as to the precise character of the jurisdiction of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">The change that was affected in the jurisdiction of the Court of last resort -was noticed in the <em>State </em>vs. <em>Bailey, </em>1 S. C., 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">What \"was meant by the expression, \u201cappellate jurisdiction,\u201d as employed by the Constitution, must be determined with reference to the fact, that such a jurisdiction was known in the State, as possessing certain characteristics at the adoption of the Constitution, and was in exercise by the Courts displaced, and had been so exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>cised for many years previous thereto. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals was of that character. That Court had authority to review the decision of a Circuit Judge or Chancellor, as to any matter of law or fact decided by him. It also had authority to set aside the verdict of a jury on any ground that affords to a Court of original jurisdiction authority to set aside such a verdict. In the exercise of such jurisdiction it was governed by fixed principles. It would not disturb the decision of a Judge as to a question of fact when the determination of the fact rested upon doubtful or disputable proofs, but sustained the conclusions of fact of the Court below7, unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">But, although, this and similar limitations were to be considered in the exercise of the powers of the Court of Appeals over judgments, decrees and verdicts, sf ill so far as the question was one of jurisdiction merely, it may be affirmed that that Court had authority to set aside any conclusion of law or fact, whether made by a Circuit Judge, a Chancellor, a jury, a Referee, or a Commissioner, on the ground either of error of law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">All this was embraced in the idea of appellate jurisdiction, as that term was understood at the adoption of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Article 4, Section 4, denies this power to the Supreme Court, in the amplitude in which it was enjoyed by the Court of Appeals, limiting it to \u201c cases of Chancery.\u201d In all other cases, except those embraced within the original jurisdiction of the Court, such as <em>mandamus </em>and the like, and \u201c cases of Chancery,\u201d this Court was to act as a Court for the correction of errors of law alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In order to ascertain the limits of our authority under this grant of jurisdiction, we have only to ask what are errors of law? To determine what is an error of law, capable as such of being corrected in a Court for the correction of errors at law, we must have recourse to the decisions of Courts of that class in England and the United States. It is not necessary, in the present case, to consider that question farther, for, as will be seen, the power we are called upon here to exercise is part of the appellate power reserved by the Constitution to the Supreme Court in \u201ccases of Chancery.\u201d It may be said, however, that errors of fact, or wrong conclusions of fact, drawn from proofs or evidence, are not embraced within the term \u201cerrors of law,\u201d but belong toa distinct category, namely, errors of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The jurisdiction and powers of this Court are as full as those of the late Court of Appeals and Court of Errors, as it regards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201c cases of Chancery.\u201d It can revise any decision on the ground of errors of law or fact. It is, therefore, necessary to understand what cases are embraced within the expression \u201c cases of Chancery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">It must be premised that the jurisdiction of this Court, so far as it was ascertained and fixed by the Constitution, is unaffected by the provisions of the Code of Procedure or any olher statute law. Again, the terms employed to mark out that jurisdiction must be taken in the sense in which they were understood at the time the Constitution was adopted. Thus, for instance, the term \u201c cases of Chancery,\u201d at that time, meant cases of a class of which the Court of Chancery could entertain jurisdiction, although since that time the Court of Chancery has been abolished and its jurisdiction conferred upon the Court of -Common Pleas, yet what was intended to be described as \u201ccases of Chancery\u201d then, must be determined now, not with reference to the present state of jurisdiction and forms of procedure, but by the enquiry whether any given case could have been regarded, at the adoption of the Constitution, as a \u201c case of Chancery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">When the nature of the right in controversy, or of the relief sought in any case is such that, prior to the Code, it would have been appropriately pursued in the Court of Chancery, it will be regarded as within the expression \u201c eases of Chancery,\u201d and under the appeal given by the Code this Court will exercise over such case a j urisdiction to correct errors both of fact and law. The circumstance that .forms of proceedings, as it regards law and equity, are assimilated under the Code, does not affect the jurisdiction of this Court as established under the Constitution; but we look to the substantial character of the controversy before us for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of our powers in relation to such case, rather than to the nature of the Court from which the case comes, in the technical mould into which the case is cast.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">To avoid confusion of terms, it is proper to remark that the term \u201c appeal,\u201d as used in the Constitution, bears a different signification, in some respects, from the same term as employed by the Code. The Code applies the term \u201c appeal \u201d to the proceeding by which aDy judicial determination is carried from an inferior to a revisory jurisdiction. Whether the powers of the revisory tribunal in the given ease are those of a Court for the correction of errors at law, or those of an appellate tribunal, as understood in the sense of the Constitution, the steps by which the Court is reached are, in the sense of the Code, an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>As against the jurisdiction established by the Constitution, the Code could not convert this Court into an appellate Court in the sense understood by the Constitution, nor has it attempted to elfect such a change.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Under the view presented above it is unimportant to refer to the fact that the present suit was commenced by bill in the former Court of Chancery, for had it been commenced under the Code, the nature of the case and of the relief sought would have brought it within our jurisdiction to correct errors of fact in cases of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">It is essential to have in view the foregoing distinctions as to the nature of our jurisdiction and powers, in order to ascertain what is meant by a \u201c ease,\u201d as that term is used in Rules 55, 56, 57 and 59, of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">As the use of the word \u201c case,\u201d in its technical sense, as applied to the statement of the proceedings upon the trial of an issue of fact, is new in this State, it may be advantageous to fix the sense in which that term is used in the Rules above mentioned. The term \u201c case \u201d is used in three distinct senses in the Rules of the Supreme and Cir. cuit Courts, and in common speech. It is used in the most general sense as the equivalent, merely, of cause or suit, as describing the subject-matter of a proceeding in a Court of Justice. Again, in a technical sense, as employed in the Circuit Court Rules above enumerated, where it signifies a statement of the proceedings on the trial of an issue of fact. There is still a third sense in which the same term is used, an instance of which occurs in Rules 5, 7 and 8, of the Supreme Court. As used in the last mentioned Rules it describes the paper book made up for the use of'the Supreme Court, containing all proceedings in the Court below necessary to the understanding of a matter to be submitted to the judgment of the Supreme Court, and the proceedings taken by way of appeal to bring the case into the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">It is only with the term \u201c case,\u201d as used in the Circuit Court Rules, also enumerated, that we have to do with in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">To meet the objection, that no case has been made to authorize a review, it becomes necessary to ascertain what is essential to a case, as contemplated by the 55th Circuit Court Rule. Section 354 of the Code makes it the duty of the appellant to cause a copy of the judgment roll to be transmitted to the Appeal Court. Section 315 defines what shall constitute a judgment roll, as follows: \u201c1st. In ease the complaint be not answered by any defendant, the summons and complaint, or copies thereof, proof of service, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>no answer has been received, the report, if any, and a copy of the judgment. 2d. In all other cases, the summons, pleadings or copies thereof, and a copy of the judgment, with any verdict or report, the offer of the defendant, exceptions, case, and all orders and papers in any way involving the merits and affecting the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The judgment roll of the Court below, evidenced by the proper certificate of the Clerk of such Court, is what the Supreme Court acts upon. Nothing extrinsic to the judgment roll can be brought before this Court, as a ground of impeaching any judgment of the Circuit Court. Of course this remark is inapplicable to the case of an appeal from an order, when the matter to be considered is not evidenced by a judgment roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">It will, therefore, be observed, that in the case of an appeal from a judgment, whatever is relied upon, in order either to impeach or support such judgment, must, in the first instance, go upon the record of the Court below, and become part of the judgment roll, and must be transmitted to the Supreme Court as part of such judgment roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The judgment roll being the proper evidence of the proceedings of the Court below, in the case of an appeal from a judgment, the roll should contain all that is essential to a review of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Before the blending of legal and equitable jurisdictions, the term \u201c case <em>\u201d </em>was applied to the narrative of the proceedings on the trial of an issue of fact, at <em>nisi prius, </em>on which a motion to set aside or enter a non-suit, or for a new trial, either for error of law or fact, or both, or for other appropriate relief, could be made, in a Court of original jurisdiction. It embiaced the testimony and any verdict found upon it, any motion for a non-suit and the order made upon such motion, and any exception taken to such order. If matter of law was to be considered, on the motion for a new trial, the rulings or charge complained of were introduced, and the fact invariably noted, in respect to each separate ruling and each specific matter charged that was a subject of objection, that the party prejudiced thereby excepted in time to such ruling or charge. If the error complained of was, that the Judge refused to charge a proposition of law to which his attention was specifically called, such fact was set forth and a note made that the party aggrieved gave notice in time of an exception to such refusal to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">A statement thus prepared, containing the evidence, or facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>proved, the rulings and charge of the Judge, and the exceptions thereto, is what is described in Rule 55 of the Circuit Court as a \u201c case containing exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Code extended these modes of setting forth the matter to be reviewed to proceedings in equity. The term \u201c case,\u201d as used in the Code, describes a statement of the proceedings on the trial of an issue of fact, whether tried before a jury, or before Referees, or before the Court; embracing proof, oral or written, and the verdict, finding, report or decision thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">If matters of law and fact are to be considered together upon it, then it should be what has already been described, a ease containing exceptions. If'matters of fact are alone to be considered, the exceptions are omitted. If matters of law are alone to be considered, then it is only necessary that it should present the rulings, charge, or decision complained of, the exceptions taken thereto, and so much of the evidence, or facts proved, as may be requisite to show the nature of the error complained of and its effect or bearing on the finding, decision and judgment based upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">When an issue of fact is tried before a jury, the case prepared to review the proceedings can generally conform to the customary forms employed in such cases, of which samples are given in the standard books of forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Where it is tried before a Court, or Referees, the form is usually modified to represent the course of procedure, but substantially is unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">While the tendency arising from the practice of a learned profession has always been towards the use of fixed forms, where that is practicable, and while the Courts have always encouraged that tendency, still it has been found impracticable to hold practitioners to artificial accuracy in this respect. If a case is a clear and intelligible history of all proceedings important to a review of a cause, it is all that can be insisted upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The record before us presents the bill and answers, the testimony taken before a Referee, and the decision of the Circuit Judge and his final judgment thereon. The order of reference does not appear, but, as no objection is made affecting its propriety, its absence is unimportant. It is not alleged that the proceedings in the case are not fully brought before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">The propositions advanced by the respondent, to show that the appellant has not brought a proper case before this Court, are based upon the erroneous supposition that this Court cannot, in a case like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the present, do more than to correct errors of law committed by the Circuit Court. The whole case turns upon the decision of questions of fact. It is alleged by the plaintiff that the evidence adduced does not support the judgment. This Court is perfectly competent to examine the judgment of the Circuit Court, and to say whether that judgment is supported by the pleadings and evidence, inasmuch as it is a case within the constitutional description \u201c cases of Chancery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The eases cited by the respondent from the New York Courts have generally no bearing on the present question, as they relate to the method of preparing a case when matters of law alone are to be taken to the appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">It is argued that what is brought into this Court as a ease has not been duly settled and filed in the Court below. If there were any irregularity in the preparation, service or settlement of the case, the place to take advantage of that was in the Circuit Court, as it is a record of that Court, and, therefore, should be subject to its control until removed into this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">As to its being filed below, it is only necessary to say that the Clerk of the Circuit Court has returned it into this Court as filed in his office, and there is nothing to the contrary laid before us. If irregularities in the appeal papers are complained of, that ought to be done before the Court proceeds to hear argument on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The respondent\u2019s next objection is, that there is no judgment filed. He contends that what is presented to us as a judgment is not, in fact nor law, a final judgment in the case. It must be conceded that the judgment brought before us is not complete according to the meaning of the Code. The Circuit Judge follows the practice which has heretofore prevailed in equity in this State. He files an opinion on the questions passed upon by him, embodying with it a judgment. After stating his conclusions in the matters of fact passed on by him, his opinion concludes as follows: \u201c It is therefore adjudged,\u201d &amp;c. The judgment that follows these words is not complete, for it does not set forth the amount due on the bond ; but to make certain its purport, in that respect, it is necessary to refer back to that portion of the opinion that ascertains the amount due on the bond. Thus the judgment is not complete without being accompanied by the opinion. Again, the judgment directs that J. R. Tolbert \u201c pay the remaining costs in this case,\u201d but does not fix the amount of those costs. As it regards the failure to enter into the judgment the amouDt of costs to be paid, it must be regarded as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>want of compliance with Section 337 of the Code, that provides that the amount of the costs, allowances and disbursements, when ascertained, shall be inserted in the entry of the judgment, but as this is to be done on the motion of the prevailing party, he cannot complain of the incompleteness of the judgment, in this respect, as he had it in his power to make it complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The practice of combining the conclusions of the Circuit Judge with the reasons assigned for arriving at such conclusions, and with the judgment in a single paper, so that that portion intended to operate as a judgment, cannot be fully understood without being accompanied by the opinion at length, does not comport with the requirements of the Code. A judgment is the action of a Court, ascertaining some act to be done, or forborne by a party. Thegrounds and reasons upon which the Court proceeded are no part of its judgment, using that term in its technical sense. Under the Code (Sec. 304,) the judgment is to be entered in a judgment book. It was not intended that this judgment book should contain thegrounds and reasonings upon which the judgment was based. When a ease is tried by the Court, as this was, althongh heard upon evidence taken before a Referee, the conclusions of the Court upon the questions of law and fact are to be made up by the Court and filed. The reasons for arriving at such conclusions may accompany the conclusions themselves, but they should not destroy their categorical character. The statement of the conclusions of law and fact is not, in technical form, a judgment, but is presumed to afford data sufficient to prepare a judgment in form. ' Section 291 of the Code distinguishes the separate character of the decision and the judgment. It says: \u201cJudgment upon the decision shall be entered accordingly.\u201d Sometimes, as when there are complicated relations among the parties, or collateral interests to be adjusted to the disposition made of the main controversy, it is important that counsel should be heard after all matters disputable under the pleadings are finally disposed of, and before judgment final is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It is highly inconsistent in practice to embody the conclusions of law and fact in the judgment. The record is unnecessarily encumbered, the labor of'examining it and the cost of transcribing it increased, without any accompanying advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">It is evident that the paper produced was intended as a final judgment. If it is not such a judgment in form as the party was entitled to, that is no ground for preventing the opposite party from setting it aside. It is true, that if the judgment was not intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>as final, it would be premature to appeal before such final judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The present judgment disposes finally of all questions made by the pleadings, and must be regarded as final, in the sense of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The evidence adduced gives rise to certain conclusions that will be next stated. Certain facts are undisputed, and will be first stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The bond was taken by the defendant, Thomas, solely in his official character as Commissioner in Equity. While holding the bond in suit, in such official character, he paid to J. M. Sullivan, on account of the claims of the complainants, and to the defendants, Collins and wife, and Hickson and wife, as distributees, a large sum of Confederate money, which was received by them as so much money on account of their respective distributive shares of the fund secured by such bond, the receipts taken upon such payments all bearing date February 6, 1863.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">These payments were not endorsed upon the bond as so much money paid for the benefit of the obligors of the bond, but were entered in the official cash book of the Commissioner as payments made by him in that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">These payments did not extinguish the interest of Sullivan, Hickson or Collins, but left still unsatisfied a portion of their demands against the amount secured by the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">These payments were <em>not made or </em>intended by defendant, Thomas, as an advance on account of the bond, or as satisfying the bond to any extent, as between Thomas and the obligors, but was intended by Thomas as a purchase of the bond either for the use of his father or himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">That subsequent to such payment being made, Thomas assigned the bond in form to S. Thomas, his father, who subsequently reassigned it to the defendant, W. M. Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">That at the determination of defendant, Thomas\u2019 official term as Commissioner in Equity, he did not turn over the bond to his successor in office, but retained it, claiming to hold it as his private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">That on the 31st of October, 1865, a settlement was made between the Tolberts and Stokes\u2019 wife, by which the interest of the latter was extinguished by the payment to Stokes and wife, by the Tolberts, of a sum fixed upon by way of compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">That on the last mentioned day a settlement was made between the defendant, Thomas, with the Tolberts, under which the Tolberts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>paid to defendant, Thomas, $2,600 in gold, the receipt given therefor by defendant, Thomas, containing the following language: \u201c In full payment of my interest in the matter of the shares of Hickson and wife, Collins and wife, and James M. Sullivan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">That upon such payments being made, the defendant, Thomas, delivered the bond, with the receipts of Stokes and himself endorsed thereon, to his successor in office as Commissioner in Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The clear weight of evidence establishes the following fads, which will be separately stated with a reference to the evidence on which the proof of such facts respectively rests:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">1. The Confederate money paid by the defendant, Thomas, to Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, as set forth in the receipts, dated February 6th, 1863, was the money of the defendant, Thomas, and was so paid for his own account and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The answer of Thomas takes the position that the money advanced . was his own. His testimony taken upon interrogatories leads conclusively to the same inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">A return made by defendant, Thomas, as Commissioner in Equity, on the 8th of July, 1863, was relied on as evidence. By this return defendant, Thomas, is debited as follows: \u201cFebruary 10th, 1863, received from S. Thomas, assignee of bond, $15,631.43.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Assuming the competency and truth of this entry, and it would appear that this bond in suit was sold at that date to S. Thomas, and the sum of $15,631.43 received in cash on such sale, although the date of the entry, February 10th, does not agree with the dates of the payments to the distributees, the latter appearing from the receipts to be February 6th, yet if that amount of cash was actually received from S. Thomas, it might be fair to infer either that the money received from S. Thomas was actually paid to the distributees, or that the money advanced by defendant, Thomas, was replaced by that derived from the sale of the bond to S. Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">It was very properly contended that the statement made by the defendant, Thomas, could not be employed as evidence in his favor of the facts affirmed by himself; but there is a difficulty in accepting the statement that is substantial rather than technical. The entry in question is clearly contradicted by the answer and the testimony given by defendant, Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">In his answer, after stating the fact of an advance to the distributees in terms that admit of no other conclusion than that the funds advanced are his own, he says, as to the property in the bond: \u201c Regarding himself as the sole owner of the bond, he did not trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>fer it to his successor in office, but retained it. Being in debt to his father, and desirous of adjusting his private affairs for the emergencies of the battle field, he assigned the bond, as stated in the bill, to his father, and upon settling with him, re-assigned it, as he thought he had a perfect right to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">According to this statement of the answer of the defendant, Thomas, the consideration of the transfer of the bond was not an amount of money, representing the value of the bond, paid by S. Thomas on the purchase of the bond as so much money of the estate. On the contrary, the consideration of the transfer to S. Thomas, as here stated, is a personal indebtedness between father and son, in no way connected by any allegation or proof with the transactions the subject of the present question. The matter assigned by the answer as part of the ground of assigning the bond to S. Thomas, tends to show that the bond could not have been assigned at the date stated in the return of July, 1863, namely, February 10, 1863. It is stated by the answer that the assignment of the bond was in part induced by the fact that the defendant, Thomas, was preparing for the \u201c emergencies of the battle field.\u201d As late as July, 1863, he was acting as Commissioner in Equity, and it is to be inferred from the testimony of J. P. Moore, his successor as Commissioner in Equity, that he continued so to act down to January, 1864. The improbability that defendant, Thomas, would be engaged nearly a year before the expiration of his term of office in making preparations for the \u201cemergencies of the battle field,\u201d is converted into a clear inference to the contrary by the statements of the answer, and the silence of the evidence on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">That portion of the answer above cited clearly indicates that the retention of the bond, on leaving the office of Commissioner, was an act precedent, in the order of time, to its assignment, to his father. Such a construction is essential to an understanding of the narration of events, evidently intended by the answer to be set forth in the order of their occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The answer of the defendant, Thomas, as to part of the amount of money in his hands for the purpose of paying the demands of the distributees, gives an account of the mode in which it was procured irreconcilable with the fact alleged by the return, that it came, in cash, in one sum, from S. Thomas, upon a sale and assignment of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The part of the money here alluded to is that alleged to have been raised for the purpose of paying the interest of Stokes and -wife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The answer states that this money was borrowed. Defendant, Thomas, in his testimony, says as follows : \u201c I made the arrangement with Hamlin Beattie by which the draft would be honored in favor of the Stokes\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The date of this borrowing is sufficiently fixed by the letter of defendant, Thomas, to T. Henry Stokes, as about April 13, 1863. There is no view that can be taken of the evidence last referred to, that can reconcile it with the statement in the return of July, 1863, that the defendant had in hand, as Commissioner, in February, 1863, an amount, in cash, sufficient to pay the distributees.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">There is no proof that the money paid by defendant, Thomas, to the distributees, or any part ofit, came fromS. Thomas, his father. Both the statements of the defendant, Thomas, and of the Tolberts, agree that it ivas not advanced by the latter, nor by Thomas as the agent of the Tolberts. We have already seen that the answer of Thomas is inconsistent with such idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The answer of G. W. Tolbert admits, distinctly, that the arrangement made with Thomas to pay him the proceeds of cotton sold for the purpose of refunding the amount advanced by Thomas was not carried out. The settlement between the Tolberts and the defendant, Thomas, in October, 1865, shows two things : first, that no advance of money had theretofore been made by the Tolberts to Thomas on any such account; and, second, that the Tolberts regarded the defendant as holding the bond in his own right, as acquired with his own money, and not as standing to them in the relation of an agent who has advanced money for the account of his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">It will be necessary, in this connection, to refer to the letters or admissions of the Tolberts, for the purpose of establishing the proposition under consideration. This admission will be important, when considering how far the Tolberts are affected by the transactions of defendant, Thomas, in dealing with the bond as his private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">2d. The amount advanced and paid to complainants and defendants, Hickson and wife, and Collins and wife, was accepted by the parties solely on the representations of the defendant, Thomas, that the money tendered to them had been paid into his hands by the Tolberts, in satisfaction of their bond, and such representations were false, and were made to induce the parties to accept the Confederate money for the benefit of the defendant, Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The defendant, Thomas, is entitled to the full benefit of the alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>gations of his answers upon the issue of fact, such weight to be determined after examining them in their relation to the evidence adduced from other sources. The answer states that the transaction as there stated was explained to Collins, acting on his own account and in behalf of Hickson and wife. It also states that defendant explained the whole matter to J. M. Sullivan. The nature of these explanations is not directly stated, and can only be inferentially made out. The answer in this respct is too vague to be entitled to much weight, even standing by itself. It is, however, directly contradicted by the testimony of Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, and no satisfactory explanation of these discrepancies is given in the testimony of the defendant, Thomas, who had an opportunity upon his examination of giving the true version of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">J. M. Sullivan testifies as follows : \u201cThomas wrote to me that the money was paid, and that he would make Stokes take his share; that Tolbert had sold his cotton, and had paid in the money. I then took it, as he said that all had taken it except Stokes and his wife. I would not have taken the money if I had known that Tolbert had not paid the money. Thomas led me to believe that Tolbert had paid the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">G. W. Collins testified as follows: \u201cThomas told me that the Tolberts had paid for the place at 'Ninety-Six, and that the money was in the office, and to call and get it. I received Confederate money from Thomas. I would not have taken the money had I known that the money had not been paid by the Tolberts. He told me that the Tolberts had sold their cotton for Confederate money. I told him that I would not take it at all, except for the fact that the young men were in the army. He told me that he had notified all the parties that the money was in the office. I did not receive the whole amount; there was about |150 behind.\u201d Collins, on being recalled, repeated this testimony in a more circumstantial and stronger form.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">W. Hickson, in his testimony, says: \u201c That defendant, Thomas, stated to me that the Tolberts had paid the money on their bond for the Shaw land, and wanted me to receive it, as he desired to get it out of his hands. I told him I did not want it, and preferred they had waited till the war was over, as I did not care to take that debt in Confederate money; but he thought as it had been paid by the Tolberts, that I ought to receive it as a citizen desirous of maintaining the Confederacy. In consideration of these facts I yielded, and received it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The defendant, Thomas, had an opportunity to contradict this testimony of Collins, for it appears, by his own statement, that he had seen that testimony before giving his own. Upon his examination he testified as follows: \u201c Until I saw Collins\u2019 testimony the other day, I always believed that he knew all about the transaction that I advanced money for Tolbert; I believe he did know it.\u201d This is all that is said in reply to testimony involving a charge of fraudulent misrepresentation. The testimony of defendant, Thomas, involves no legal responsibility for its truthfulness, as it is the mere statement of his belief on unimportant and irrelevant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">It will be observed that in the testimony just recited, it is said that the money was advanced for Tolbert. This statement is contradicted by the answer of defendant, Thomas, and the well established fact that on the final settlement between Thomas and the Tolberts, Thomas was treated as the owner of some portion of the interests of Sullivan, Hickson and Collins in the bond ; and according to the face of the receipts, the object of the settlement was to extinguish these interests in the hands of Thomas to such extent, and not to refund to Thomas money advanced by him as the agent of the Tolberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The foregoing evidence is all that has any important bearing on the second conclusion of fact above stated, and it leads to such conclusion, not upon doubtful proofs, but by .a clear and overwhelming mass of testimony, met by no contradiction such as the nature of the testimony demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Even if, at the time that Thomas made the representation that the parties to the bond had paid the same, he had good ground to expect that they would do so within a reasonable period, the representation that they had done so must still be regarded as false. On the disappointment of such an expectation, had Thomas laid the facts before the parties in interest and allowed them an opportunity of rescinding or adhering to the arrangement, such action might have ignored a fraudulent motive in Thomas. On the other hand, having left the parties under the influence of the original misrepresentation, a fraudulent intent must be presumed, from the fact that the advantage to be derived from their receiving Confederate money could enure only to the benefit of Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">3d. The defendant, Thomas, from the time of such payment, held the bond in suit, claiming the same as his individual property, until it was returned to his successor in office in October, 1865, notwithstanding his office as Commissioner in Equity, in the meantime, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ceased, and his successor in office had qualified and was in the discharge of his duty. The ground of this conclusion has already been stated in what was said relative to the first conclusion of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">4th. The settlement of the defendant, Thomas, and the Tolberts, in October, 1865, was, as between themselves, a voluntary settlement by way of compromise, intended to extinguish so much of the interest of Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, as had vested in the defendant, Thomas, in his individual right, and was not intended as a settlement between the defendant, Thomas, as obligee, and the Tolberts as obligors of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Neither the defendant, Thomas, nor the survivor and representative of the Tolberts, seek to disturb the settlement of October, 1865. On the contrary, they rest upon it as a finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The defendant, Thomas, in his answer, insists that in this settlement he \u201creceipted the Tolberts for his interest only in the bond, and received therefor, in gold, about what the money he advanced to Tolbert was worth.\u201d The answer of George W. Tolbert says that \u201c he then entered upon negotiations with the said Thomas for settlement of his interest, and agreed upon the terms; and a receipt in conformity with the agreement was entered upon the bond and signed by the said W. M. Thomas, in which he acknowledges the receipt of the sum of twenty-six hundred dollars in gold, in full of his interest in the bond, as above set forth.\u201d He further says: \u201c The receipts were entered upon the bond with the knowledge of the said James P. Moore, the Commissioner, and as defendant believes, with his approval. The bond was then left with the said Moore to be filed with the record. The defendant then regarded the bond paid. He is now surprised at the allegation of the bill of unfairness, collusion and fraud.\u201d Both parties to the settlement thus rely upon it as final, but differ as to the effect of the settlement \u2014 the one holding that only this interest of Thomas was extinguished, and the other that the bond w7as, in effect, paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Tolbert, in that portion of his answer just referred to, makes no other statement, as to the terms and intention of the parties, than that afforded by the receipt, and sets forth, substantially, such receipt, stating that it was in conformity to the agreement with Thomas on the subject. It has already been observed that, in speaking of the negotiation that led to this agreement, he refers to it as a negotiation in regard to Thomas\u2019 interest in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The receipts themselves sustain the conclusion that the subject-matter of the settlement was Thomas\u2019 interest in the bond, be that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>what it might; that there was no expressed nor implied understanding that Thomas\u2019 interest extended beyond the amount of money-advanced by him, and that if Tolbert arrived at a different conclusion as to the effect of the settlement, it arose from his own understanding of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">That, in making these settlements, Tolbert did not regard Thomas as acting in any official character, is evidenced by the fact that, at the time he settled with Stokes, he requested Moore, the Commissioner in Equity, to be present at the signing of the receipt, evidently relying on the presence of Moore as essential to the validity of the transaction, so far as it had any official significance, and the settlement with Thomas was subsequent to that with Stokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">5th. At the time of this settlement, the right of the defendant, Thomas, to the possession of the bond, as regarded the Commissioner in Equity, was in contest under a rule to show cause, at July Term, 1864, why that bond should not be returned to the Commissioner\u2019s office, and that such rule was obtained by Mr. Moore, upon the representations of R. R. Tolbert of misconduct on the part of the defendant, Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">These facts are testified to by Mr. Moore, who states that, after the issuing of this rule, he heard nothing more about the Tolberts\u2019 bond until October 31st, 1865. That the Tolberts had- distinct notice of the pending of this rule, is not shown directly by the evidence; but it appears by the letter of R. R. Tolbert, dated February 19th, 1864, that the writer was aware that Moore was making efforts to get possession of the bond, or intended to make such effort, for he says : \u201c As soon as you can get the notes let me know, and I will come to your office and settle.\u201d The notes, here spoken of, evidently means the bond in suit, for that is the only subject to which the letter relates.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">As it regards the rights of the complainants as against the Tolberts, there are certain other conclusions of fact arising from the pleadings and proofs that will next be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">6th. It is not established, either by direct proof nor by any necessary inference from the matters proved, that either of the Tolberts had notice until after the payments made to Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, of the use of improper means to induce the acceptance of such payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">7th. The defendants, the Tolberts, are chargeable with notice, at the time of the settlement, of the transactions that had previously occurred between the defendant, Thomas, and Sullivan, Hick-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>son and Collins, and which are the grounds of the present claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Moore testifies that previous to February 19th, 1864, R. R. Tolbert applied to him for a statement of the amount due on the bond, as he wanted to pay it. That not being able to find the bond, he so informed him by letter, in reply to which he received from R. R. Tolbert, the letter dated February 19th, 1864. This letter recognizes the fact that the defendant, Thomas, in making these payments, was acting in his own interest, as it denies any agency or authority in Thomas, derived from the Tolberts, to make such payments. Moore states that on the 3d of March, 1864, R. R. Tolbert tendered to him $17,900, in Confederate currency, in payment of the bond, which he refused to receive. Moore says he \u201cshowed Mr. Thomas\u2019 account book and explained to him the entry made by Thomas, that it purported to have been done at the instance and request of G. W. Tolbert. Mr. Tolbert replied that George had not requested Thomas to do so, as he was George\u2019s agent, and he had been trying to get Thomas to take Confederate money and Thomas had refused, alleging as his reason for refusing that the parties to whom the money was going had refused to receive Confederate money from him. Mr. Tolbert was very indignant towards Thomas, and said that Thomas had no authority from George, nor from himself, to have made the arrangements he had made about the bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">G. <em>W. </em>Collins says: \u201cIn March, 1865, on my way to Florida, I stopped at the house of Tolbert, tie asked me if Thomas had paid off the parties for the Cambridge lands? I told him I had received $4,500, and I presumed the others had received theirs, as Thomas had told me he had notified them that the money had been paid in and was ready. He replied that Thomas had no authority for paying off the bond; that he was the agent for his sons. This was R. R. Tolbert, who is now dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The foregoing testimony stands uncontradicted, and shows that all the important facts upon which the complainants base their claims to relief, were brought to the notice of the Tolberts before the settlement with Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In addition to the foregoing, it is evident that the Tolberts knew, at the time of the settlement with Thomas, that the latter had no lawful right to the custody of the bond, or to represent any other interest in the transaction than bis individual interests. This is evidenced by the letter of R. R. Tolbert to Moore; also by the fact that the Tolberts did regard the settlement with Stokes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>complete without the presence of Moore, the legal custodian of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">8th. The settlement with Thomas was without the concurrence or consent of Moore, and with full knowledge of his rights in regard to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Although Moore was present at the settlement of the Tolberts with Stokes, yet it must be concluded that he was not concluded, and did not authorize or consent to the settlement with Thomas, for the reasons: 1st, That fact is material to the case of the Tolberts as a means of showing payment on the bond, but is neither alleged or proven. 2d. Moore\u2019s testimony excludes such fact. He states that Tolbert stated to him that he had settled with Thomas at the time he demanded the bond, on the ground of its being paid. Moore\u2019s position is disclosed in the reply he made to Tolbert\u2019s question as to what he thought about the matter. He says: \u201c I replied 1 did not know what course Plickson, Collins and Dr. Sullivan would pursue in the matter. If they did nothing, it would be an end of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The foregoing conclusions have been stated with more than ordinary particularity and care, for the reasons that they differ materially from those of the learned and experienced Judge who tried the cause, and for the further reason that the transactions involve the conduct of an officer holding a high position of trust connected with the administration of justice, and it is due to the Court, whose authority he has misused, that the closest scrutiny should be made with the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The conclusions of law, based upon the foregoing facts, will next be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The Confederate notes tendered by Thomas to Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, were not a legal tender, and laid them under no obligation to accept them in lieu of good money. The duty imposed on Thomas was to enforce the bond, by converting its obligation into good money, and paying it to the distributees according to their respective demands. This duty was not wholly performed. In lieu of strict performance, Thomas offered them a commodity regarded by the community as money, but not possessing the character of a legal representative of money value. This Confederate currency had some commercial value, because it could readily be converted into that which had intrinsic value.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">If Sullivan, Hickson and Collins are to be regarded as having voluntarily accepted the Confederate currency, then their accep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>tance stands on the footing of a contract, ba'sed on the value tendered as its consideration. The terms of the acceptance did not, on that assumption, extinguish the whole demand under the bond, but only to the extent of the nominal value of the Confederate currency received, leaving in them a right to have the bond enforced for the Satisfaction of the residue of their demand. Acceptance being in the nature of a contract, is avoided by any misrepresentations made, that induced the opposite party to accede to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The representations made by Thomas were false, and induced the parties, acting on the belief that they were true, to accept <em>the </em>Confederate money as <em>pro tanto </em>performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The parties misled had a right to rescind, and on tendering a return of the amount received by them, to be re-instated in their original right. Not having done so, they are to be charged with the value of the Confederate money at the time of its receipt, but are to be regarded as re-instated as to the residue of their claim as it stands at the time of their acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">As affected by the settlement between Thomas, Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, the right of the respective parties stood as follows : the obligors, or their representatives, were liable to pay the full amount due on their bond, over and above the payments previously credited upon it. <em>'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The complainants, and the defendants, Hickson and wife, and Collins and wife, had the right to demand the enforcement of the bond, and to receive the balance that -would be found due after deducting the actual value of the Confederate currency received by them. Stokes and wife had a like right to have the bond enforced for their benefit. Thomas had a right, as equitable assignee of Sullivan, Hickson, and Collins, to demand out of the proceeds of the bond, an amount equal to the actual value of the Confederate money paid to Sullivan, Hickson and Collins. Thomas had also, as Commissioner in Equity, authority to hold the bond, and to take measures to secure its enforcement. The right to hold the bond and enforce it did not reside personally in Thomas, but in the office held by him, and at the termination of his official term that right passed to his successor in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The retention of the bond by Thomas was a trespass that conferred no rights upon him, and could afford no security to those dealing with him, for the bond disclosed the true claims to its pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>session, and the law charged all parties with a knowledge of the legal consequences resulting from its legal character.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The Tolberts cannot be regarded in law as having dealt with, nor did they in fact deal with Thomas in any other than a personal character, and in regard, alone, to such personal rights as he might have acquired through the transaction with Sullivan, Hickson and Collins. We have seen that all that Thomas thus acquired was a claim as equitable assignee of Sullivan, Hickson and Collins, of so much of their original demand as equalled the value of the Confederate currency paid to them. The Tolberts acquired just this, and no more, in their treaty with Thomas; nor have they any equity broader or more comprehensive than this; for they are chargeable with notice of the misconduct of Thomas in his dealings with Sullivan, Hickson and Collins.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The settlement with Stokes was final unless impeached on sufficient grounds, and no such grounds are presented in the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The amount due upon the bond should be computed, with interest, including the demands of the complainants and of the defendants, Hickson and Collins, and including the claim of Stokes and wife, as originally established, and also including the payments endorsed on the bond prior to the payment made by Thomas to Sullivan, Hickson and Collins. From the amount thus computed must be deducted the value of the Confederate currency paid to and received by the complainants, and the defendants, Hickson and Collins, with interest to the date of judgment. Judgment must be given for the amount thus ascertained according to the respective rights of the complainants and the defendants whose claims are in whole or in part unsatisfied according to the principles of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The decree of the Circuit Court must be modified accordingly, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-9\"><em>Wright, A. </em>J., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b571-10\"><em>Moses, </em>G.
