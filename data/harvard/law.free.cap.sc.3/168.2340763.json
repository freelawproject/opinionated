A. Moses should not, at any one time, during the aforesaid term of ten years, engage in working over one-third part of the said tract. The third to be so worked to be selected by the said O. A. Moses, and such selection to be made as often as the said 0. A. Moses might desire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">That immediately after the execution of the said agreement, the defendant, Moses, entered upon the said land, and commenced mining for phosphates thereon, and has continued to do so to the present time, and has erected offices, houses and other buildings on said land; that, in November or December, 1869, he, the said Moses, granted to the defendants, Bradley and Coe, the right to dig and mine, for a long term of years, upon so much of the said plantation as lies to the west of the North Eastern Railroad track, and bound them to pay him one dollar per ton for all phosphates dug by them, and to dig not less than 5,000 tons per annum ; that the said Bradley and Coe have entered upon said plantation under their said agreement with Moses, and are prosecuting mining operations thereon, and have dug therefrom large quantities of phosphates, and sold the same; that the said Moses is about to open fresh mines upon that part of the said tract lying to the east of the North Eastern Railroad track, and work the same for his own benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">The bill charged that the assignment by Moses to Bradley and Coe was illegal, and a fraud upon the plaintiff, and extinguished all his right and interest in said tract of land, and that'the plaintiff was entitled to an account of all the phosphates dug by the defendants on said tract, and the profits and produce thereof; and it prayed that an account be taken of all such phosphates, and of the proceeds of the sales thereof, and that the defendants be enjoined from working the mines in said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">The defendant, Moses, filed an answer and demurrer, and the defendants, Bradley and Coe, an answer and plea to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">On July 1st, 1870, an order, by consent, was made, appointing I.

Hayne, Esq., referee in the caxxse, and referring it to him to hear and determine all the issues therein ; and on the 26th day of the same month and year, he made his report, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>A bill of complaint was filed in this case on the 25th January, 1870, under the old system of pleading, in the Court of Common Pleas for Charleston County, on the equity side. On the 23d February, an answer and demurrer were filed by Ottolengui A. Moses, and an answer and plea by W. L. Bradley and C. C. Coe. A question was raised at the hearing as to the extent and effect of the demurrer \u2014 the plea seemed to have been lost sight of.. Ultimately, however, it was expressed as the desire of all parties, that the case should be decided <em>on its merits, </em>without regard merely to technical points of pleading. I proceed, therefore, at once to the case as presented by the evidence and the admissions of the parties. Horace Massot is now, and on the 24th April, 1868, and long anterior thereto, was seized and possessed of a tract of land in Charleston County, containing about one hundred and thirteen acres, and more particularly described in an instrument to which I shall presently refer. On the day and date above specified, the said Horace Mas-sot joined with Ottolengui A. Moses in a deed of indenture, wherein the said Horace Massot \u201c of the first part,\u201d in consideration of $2,000 cash, \u201cgranted, sold and conveyed,\u201d to A. O. Moses, \u201cof the second part,\u201d to him, \u201c his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, the right and privilege of entering in and upon, by himself and his agents, all and every part of said lands,\u201d for the purpose of \u201csearching for mineral and fossil substances, conducting mining operations to any extent,\u201d and \u201cfor working, removing, selling,\u201d and, as his property, \u201c to use and appropriate, for the term of ten (10) years,\u201d all the minerals, phosphates, &amp;c., \u201c that may be found or contained in any part\u201d of said land. It was contended, on the part of the plaintiff, that the instrument admitted to be a deed of grant was, in effect, a <em>license </em>merely, and \u201c granted, sold and conveyed \u201d not a tangible estate, either real or chattel, but simply an interest in the nature of an <em>\u201cincorporeal hereditament\u201d </em>It was admitted that the license was irrevocable, and that such an interest was <em>assignable, </em>but it was insisted that it was a necessary incident to such an interest that the assignment should be <em>entire, </em>and that an attempt to divide the interest was in derogation of the rights of the original grantor, and worked a forfeiture or <em>extinguishment </em>of the \u201cright and privilege\u201d of the party attempting the division. On the other hand, it was contended, on the part of defendant, that the indenture of the 24th April, 1868, \u201c granted, sold and conveyed\u201d the phosphates themselves, and that the thing conveyed was tangible and corporeal, and the indenture gave an interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>which, during the term of ten (10) years, could be disposed of in all respects as property, and might be divided to any extent the owner pleased. The result of the case turns upon the construction of the deed. The gravamen of the complaint, and the only matter insisted on in argument, is the transfer by 0. A. Moses of a <em>part </em>of his interest (whatever the nature of that interest might be) to <em>Bradley, </em>whose agent C. C. Coe is, as well as one Gildersleeve, and the fact that Bradley, through these and other agents, has, <em>under an agreement loith Moses, </em>set up on complainant\u2019s premises, phosphate works <em>separate </em>and <em>distinct </em>from those worked by Moses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">In terms the deed conveys only a \u201cright and privilege of entering\u201d the premises of complainant for certain specified purposes. Among these \u201cpurposes\u201d are the \u201cworking, removing, selling,\u201d and, as his \u201c'property, to use and appropriate,\u201d \u201cfor the term of ten years,\u201d the phosphates, &amp;c., \u201c which may be found,\u201d or are \u201c contained in any part of all that plantation.\u201d There is, it is plain, no <em>direct </em>conveyance of a mine or mineral, or phosphates, or of anything <em>corporeal. </em>The conveyance is, as I have said, of a \u201c right and privilege.\u201d But in analogy to the familiar doctrine cited from Coke by the counsel for defendants, that a grant of the <em>profits </em>of land carries the land itself, I was at first inclined to hold that the grant of \u201c the <em>right </em>\u201d <em>to take as his property </em>\u201d the phosphates \u201c contained in any part of all that plantation,\u201d carried the <em>phosphates themselves. </em>In the case <em>of Stewart vs. Gar-nett, </em>3 Sim., 398, it was decided that a devise of the rents and profits of a plantation in Jamaica gave an absolute property, in not only the land, but the slaves, stock, planting implements, &amp;e. The Vice Chancellor says \u201cthe devise of the rents, issues and profits of the estate is the same as a devise of the <em>estate itself.\u201d </em>The counsel for complainant seemed to think that the grant being but for a term of years would make a difference. But the case of <em>Legard </em>vs. <em>Hodges, </em>3 Brown Ch. Rep., 531, was a pledge of profits not perpetually, but until \u00a310,000 should be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">After a thorough examination, however, of the authorities cited by counsel for complainant, I have been constrained to yield this pre-possession, and, in view of the consequences which follow, <em>I add that I yield most reluctantly.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-7\">The case of Lord Mountjoy, as reported by Lord Coke, near three hundred years ago, reads as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-8\">\u201cThe Lord Mountjoy, seised of the manor of Canford in fee, did by deed indented and enrolled, bargain and sell the same to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Browne in fee, in which indenture this clause was contained : Provided, always, and the said Browne did covenant and grant to and with the said Lord Mountjoy, that he, his heires and assignes, might dig for ore in the lands (which were great wasts) parcell of the said manor, and to dig turfe, also for the making of allome. And in this case three poynts were resolved by all the Judges. First \u2014 that this did amount to a grant of an interest and inheritance to the Lord Mountjoy to digge, \u00abfee. Secondly \u2014 that notwithstanding this grant, Browne, his heires and assignes might dig also, and like to the case of common <em>sauns nombre. </em>Thirdly \u2014 that Lord Mountjoy might assigne his whole interest to one, two or more, but then if there be two or more, they could make no division of it, but worke together with one stocke; neither could the Lord Mountjoy, &amp;c., assigne his interest in any part of the wast to one or more, for that might work a prejudice and a surcharge to the tenant of the land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">The terms of the deed in that case, as given by Anderson, J., who presided at the trial, are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">Lord Mountjoy \u201c did license and authorize Richard Leycole, for and during the term of 31 years next, to search, open, dig, cast up and work for all manner of mines, minerals, mettals, liquors and commodities whatsoever, in any of the mines, minerals and possession whatsoever, of the said manor, and the same to convert to his use during the said term, yielding therefor yearly to the Lord Mountjoy the full moiety or one-half,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\"><em>Doe </em>vs <em>Wood, </em>Barn. &amp; A., 2, 724, decided in King\u2019s Bench, in 1819, is equally explicit. This was a grant to A. and his \u201c partners, fellow adventurers, executors, administrators, and assigns, of free liberty, license, power and authority to dig, work, mine, and search for tin, tin ore, &amp;c., and all other metals and minerals whatsoever,\u201d and the same <em>\u201c </em>there found\u201d to \u201c dispose of to their own use,\u2019\u2019 for the term of twenty-one years. Chief Justice Abbott held that this deed operated \u201c as a license merely.\u201d He says, \u201c the purport of the <em>granting part </em>of this indenture, is to grant, for the term therein mentioned, a liberty, license, power, and authority to dig,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c throughout the lauds therein described, and to dispose of the ore to the use of the grantee, his partners, &amp;c. \u201c That is,\u201d he continues, <em>\u201c </em>no more than a mere <em>right </em>to a personal chattel when obtained, in pursuance of <em>incorporeal privileges, </em>granted <em>for the purpose of obtaining it.\u201d </em>This case cites and confirms Lord Mountjoy\u2019s case, decided 200 years before. The case of <em>Cheatham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>vs. <em>Williamson, 4 </em>East, 469, decided in 1804, is likewise cited and approved. It is in the latter case that Lord Ellenborough says that no case can be found where one who has only a liberty of digging for coals in another\u2019s soil has an exclusive right to the coals, so as to enable him to bring trover against the owner of the estate for coals raised by him, and Lord Ellenborough recognizes Lord Mountjoy\u2019s case as authority, and declares it decisive of this point. He adds that \u201c those who compared it to a grant of common <em>sauns nombre </em>used that ai the strongest instance to show that it could <em>not </em>be an <em>exclusive right. </em>In the case of <em>Grubb </em>vs. <em>Bayard, </em>2 Wallace, Jr., Reports of eases in Circuit Court of the United States, in Pennsylvania, Justices Grier and Kane presiding, the effect of the following deed was considered: \u201cAnd the aforesaid David, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, doth covenant, promise, grant and agree to and with the aforesaid William, his heirs and assigns, that he, the said William, his heirs and assigns, shall and may, from time to time, and all times hereafter, dig, take and carry away all iron ore to be found within the bounds of the said David\u2019s tract of land, containing 282 acres, provided he, the said William, his heirs and assigns, pay unto the said David, his heirs or assigns, the sum of sixpence (Pennsylvania currency,) per ton, for every ton taken from the premises of 282 acres aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ade\">Of this deed in a former case before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Judge Roberts had said, \u201c it is a grant of twenty acres of land in fee simple, and also a grant of an incorporeal hereditament, for a distinct and different consideration, in the remaining part of the tract of two hundred and eighty-two acres. The right to raise ore is an <em>incorporeal hereditament, </em>granted for a valuable consideration, and <em>is not, </em>as has been contended, a <em>license revocable at the will of the parties.\u201d </em>The point, was distinctly made in argument, that \u201c the words were essentially different from those in Lord Mountjoy\u2019s case.\u201d \u201c How,\u201d counsel asked, \u201c can one man dig, take and carry away, all iron to be found,\u201d within a certain tract, \u201c consistently with the same right in another man ?\u201d The grant, it was claimed, on this difference, <em>excluded </em>any concurrent right to dig on the part of the owner of the soil. It was decided otherwise, and decided, further, that it could not be divided or apportioned. Judge Grier, in his separate opinion, expresses himself as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">\u201c A right or privilege to dig and carry ore from the land of another is an incorporeal hereditament- \u2014 -a right to be exercised on the land of another. It is a license, irrevocable, when granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>on sufficient consideration. It may be demised for years or granted in fee; it is assignable. The grantee or assignee of such a license, right or privilege, to be exercised in the land of another, has no such title to the ore that he can support trover against the owner of the land, for ore or coal raised by him. On this subject, I may adopt the words of Lord Tenterden in one of the cases relating to mines quoted at the bar. This indenture, in its granting part, does not purport to demise the land or the metals, or the minerals therein comprised.\u201d Again, he says, \u201c is the right granted, one that is exclusive of the owner of the soil ? Much stress has been laid upon the word all in this grant, as having the effect of making it exclusive. But so important a restriction cannot be deduced from so equivocal an expression. The deed has been drawn up by a very able conveyancer. ITe seems to have had <em>Lord Mount-joy\u2019s </em>case in his mind at the time. He employs none of the apt and well known terms or phraseology to indicate an intention of giving an exclusive right as against the grantor himself. The grant of a right to dig, take and carry away \u2018 all\u2019 iron ore to be found within the bounds, &amp;c., shows the extent of the license but not its exclusiveness. The grantee may dig, take, &amp;c., of any or all the ore he can find on the land, but he has no exclusive right in <em>any </em>of it till <em>he finds </em>it and <em>digs </em>it. It is a right without stint as to quantity, and <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case likens it to the grant of a right of common <em>sans nombre </em>which does not exclude the owner. This is a point decided in <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case as reported by Coke, Leonard and Godbolt.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-4\">On a subsequent day, Judge Grier, speaking for the Court (himself and Judge Kane) says: \u201c We decide that the thing granted is <em>not </em>the iron ore contained in the land of defendant; but an incorporeal hereditament, a right, or license qr liberty, well described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration as a \u2018 right and privilege to dig, take and carry away,\u2019 all or any iron ore to be found in the land of defendant. It is a license irrevocable, which may be demised for a term of years, or assigned in fee. ******* That the effect of the word \u2018 all\u2019 in this grant is not to give an exclusive right <em>as against the grantor. </em>It describes the <em>extent to </em>which the license may be exercised, not its exclusiveness. It is a grant of a right to take ore without stint, and is aptly compared to a right of common in gross <em>sans nombre, </em>which does not exclude the lord or owner of the land out of which it is granted. That such a right is <em>indivisible, </em>and unless the plaintiff, as assignee, is clothed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>whole, he has nothing, <em>and cannot support this suit as against the owner of the land.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">\u201c And, lastly, that the case of the Lord Mountjoy as reported by several authoritative reporters, and among them by Lord Coke .in his Commentary, is directly in point on both parts of the case, and rules it. Its authority has never been questioned; and the application of its doctrines to this case results in a conclusion which accords with our reason and our sense of justice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">I cannot, in the same cordial terms with Judge Grier, express the <em>\u201c accord \u201d </em>of my own mind with the conclusions arrived at.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">To my mind there is a clear distinction between common of pasture, and of estovers and piscary, and a right to <em>mine. </em>The pasture is to be <em>used </em>by the <em>commoner\u2019s cattle, </em>and the wood to be <em>burned </em>by the <em>commoner </em>or his <em>household; </em>even the fish were expected to be <em>consumed; </em>but ores, minerals and phosphates are essentially <em>articles of sale, </em>and the supply may be indefinitely extended. The capital invested in the enterprise, much more than the number of assignees, regulates and controls the amount of the minerals removed. The \u201c surcharge,\u201d it seems to me, in case of a mine, is very much of a fiction. I go further; this very case shows that all considerations of expediency and public policy are with the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">Mr. Massot, it appears, has had, according to the argument of his counsel, (sustained, I think, by the authorities adduced) a <em>concurrent </em>right to dig and sell phosphates with Mr. Moses, even on the one-third to which the license of Moses extends. There is, it will be remembered, a proviso in the deed that Moses should not work more of the land than one-third, at any time. And the counsel of the defendant seemed to concede that as to the other <em>two-thirds </em>of the tract the complainant had, and still has, such right. Why has the right never been exercised by complainant ? Mr. Moses, on the contrary, has pursued his own mining, we presume,' with profit, and has made an arrangement with Mr. Bradley, sub-licensee, by which he, Moses, is to receive $5,000 a year, and leave, I presume, a large margin of profit for Mr. Bradley, in addition. These contracts and sub-contracts, it strikes me, benefit the community by stimulating enterprise. As to the original grantor, if his whole grant, which is admitted to be assignable,'had been assigned absolutely, <em>as he had a conceded right to do, </em>to some one <em>great capitalist </em>or some one <em>rich corporation, in what respect would Massot\u2019s condition be bettered thereby \u00b6</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">But, sitting in the exercise of judicial functions, I must adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ter the law as I find it, and the eases, in my judgment, are conclusive as to the points stated below; and the inconveniences and hardship arising from this construction, if it does not in fact express what was the intention of the parties at the time of the deed, may, at all times, be obviated by the insertion of a few additional words in the granting part of the deed. Let the grant be of the minerals and phosphates themselves, followed by the right to dig, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">1. That the indenture of the day of entered into by Ottolengui A. Moses and Horace Massot, conveys no property in the phosphates contained in the land, but merely a \u201cright and privilege,\u201d to dig, use and sell them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">2. That this right and privilege is not <em>exclusive </em>in Moses, but to be enjoyed by him <em>concurrently </em>with the same \u201cright and privilege \u201d belonging to Massot as the owner of the soil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">3. That even if the \u201c right and privilege \u201d were <em>exclusive, </em>they are in their nature <em>incorporeal.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-9\">4. That though it may not be true, universally, that <em>all </em>incorporeal hereditaments are incapable of division or apportionment, yet it is true that a right to <em>dig, use and sell minerals, </em>unaccompanied by a graDt of the minerals themselves, cannot be divided or apportioned; and that though assignable, the assignment must be entire, and of a single interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\"><em>5. </em>That an attempt to assign- <em>in part, </em>or to assign <em>several separate </em>interests, is illegal, and the <em>contract void.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">6. If necessary, I should be compelled to hold, further, that, at law, the attempted assignment of a divided interest by Moses <em>extinguished </em>his right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">It is quite a relief, however, that I am not called on to decree under the principle last announced. The principle of extinguishment, as applied to mining licenses, does not enlist the sanction of my judgment, and is utterly opposed, I think, to the equities of this case. I do not consider the principles of equity as abolished by the New Code of Procedure. There may arise cases when it will be difficult to say whether a suitor seeks redress in <em>equity </em>or at <em>common law. </em>But this, beyond all question, is an equity ease, and equity will <em>not </em>decree <em>&amp; forfeiture. </em>The complainant will have had all the redress which, in my opinion, he could in equity demand of Moses, when his licensee, the said Moses, turns over to him the amounts received by him under the void assignment to, or contract with, the sub-licensee Bradley. To that extent I feel constrained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to go, as to defendant Moses.

I should be pleased to stop with an order enjoining and restraining the defendant, Bradley, and his agents, from further operations.

J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AbP\">In the decision below, and in the argument at the bar, an important feature of this case has not received the attention due to the importance of its bearing. The line of argument pursued assumes that the question, whether the defendant, Moses, acquired under the grant of Massot an exclusive right as against the grantor, to the minerals contained within the premises described, for the period of ten years, is to be decided by first determining whether the thing granted was in its nature corporeal or incorporeal. It is contended that the grant created, at most, either a mere license, or an incorporeal hereditament, and authorities are cited to show that in such cases the grant does not include the right of the grantor to exercise, concurrently, a similar right to that conferred by his grant or license. The objection to this line of argument is, that it lays too great stress on the technical import of the words of conveyance, and gives too little attention to the actual intent of the parties, as evidenced by the entire instrument. The true inquiry is, what, from the construction of the whole instrument, was the nature of the right, power or property intended by the parties to be vested in the grantee ? Having ascertained, from this source, the nature of the thing granted, it will not be difficult to ascertain whether it is corporeal or incorporeal, nor to find the technical terms appropriate to describe such interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The instrument in question is, in form, a deed, signed, sealed and witnessed as such. Massot, in consideration of $2,000, grants, sells and conveys to Moses, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, \u201c the right and privilege of entering in and upon, by himself or his agents, all or any part of. the land hereinafter described, for the purpose of searching for mineral and fossil substances, conducting mining operations to any extent the said party of the second part may deem advisable, and for working, removing, selling, and, as the property of the party of the second part, to use and appropriate, for the term of ten years from the date of these presents, all organic or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>inorganic minerals, rocks, fossils, marl, or so-called phosphates, that may be found on, by any person or persons, or contained in, any part of all that plantation or tract of land,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>Moses is further to have the right to cut and remove trees, wood and timber, when he shall deem it advisable and advantageous, such trees, wood and timber to remain the property of Massot, who is to have the disposal and profit thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The deed contains the following proviso: <em>\u201cProvided, further, </em>That the party of the second part (Moses) shall not, at any onetime during the aforesaid term of ten years, engage in working over one-third part of the said tract, the third to be worked to be selected by the party of the second part, and said selection to be made as often as the party of the second part may desire.\u201d The deed further conveys, for the like period, a general right of way, with the privilege of constructing railroads and other roads, and machinery, to be used in the extraction, preparation, manufacture and transportation of the organic and inorganic substances in question, with the right to remove the same at the expiration of the term aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">What distinguishes this grant from that in <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, (Co. Litt., 165,) and in all the other cases relied on as decisive against the exclusive nature of the grant, is contained in the expression \u201c that may be found on, by any person or persons, or contained in, any part,\u201d &amp;c. The term, \u201c any person,? must be regarded as including the grantor, so that if the grantor, in an attempt to exercise the same right as that conferred, should find any such substances upon the premises described, such act of finding would complete the title of the grantee or his assigns to the substances so found under the express terms of the grant. It might, perhaps, be said that this applies only to substances .\u201cfound on,\u201d but not those \u201ccontained in \u201d the premises. This construction cannot prevail, for it would contravene the general intent of the instrument. It is clear that, as to some part of the minerals, the right of the grantor is excluded, and to that extent something more than \u00e1 right in the nature of common is conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">How far, then, does this exclusion extend ? It is evident that the parties did not intend to make a distinction, as to the character of the grantee\u2019s title, between the minerals lying on the surface of the ground and those contained within it. Such a distinction would be inconvenient and senseless. If, then, it was intended that the grantee should have the same right in respect to the one class as to the other, the particular expression under consideration must be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>garded as characterizing the grantee\u2019s right, as to the whole, as exclusive of the grantor and all other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">This view is aided by the fact that the consideration of the deed was an entire sum of money demandable absolutely under the deed, and which may be assumed to include a valuation, fixed by the parties, on all minerals that the grantee was authorized to remove from the premises, and might, by possibility, remove therefrom, during the term of ten years, and by the further fact that the deed, by its terms, professed to sell and convey the material itself, as well as the right to search for and take it.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">It is not necessary to rest this case upon the whole ground taken in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>31 Penn., 475. In that case the grant was held to exclude the grantor on the ground that the consideration, being an entire sum paid for the right conferred, evidenced an intent to sell the whole mineral content as such. Independent of the character of the consideration, the language of the grant, in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>was substantially the same as that in <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case. The opinion in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton </em>does not seek to unsettle the authority of <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, but finds grounds of distinguishing the cases, in the fact that different inferences are to be drawn, as to the intended exclusiveness of the grant, from the respective considerations in the two grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In the case before this Court, the construction of the grant does not depend wholly on the character of the consideration, as we have already seen. It is, however, a circumstance in the case, and, therefore, it is in place to enquire, whether the fact that the consideration is an entire sum demandable at the delivery of the deed, and intended as compensation for the right granted, tends to show an intent to convey an exclusive interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Apart from the limitation of ten years, if the subject-matter of the grant had been personal property, instead of land, it would have passed an exclusive right of property to the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">A bill of sale for a valuable consideration, paid of all the goods of a certain kind in a certain warehouse, or all the quarried stone or mined ores, in a certain field, would show an intent to transfer a perfect title. Should the vendor, at the same time, confer a license upon the purchaser to enter upon his premises, and to search for, and remove the property, its effect would be to enlarge still further the right of the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Although the subject-matter of the contract be land, still, if capable of severance, so as to become personal property, the parties are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>not precluded, by any rule of law, from treating it, in its unsevered condition, as personalty, and transferring title <em>accordingly.</em>\u2014Clark vs. <em>Way, </em>11 Rich., 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">These propositions are not disputed by <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, nor by any of the English or American cases following its authority; but, on the other hand, are supported by many cases of undoubted authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">To all such contracts and grants, whether relating to realty or personalty, the test that has been applied, is the intent of the parties. The difference between the two cases is this: that certain words sufficient to manifest such intent, in the case of personalty, are not deemed sufficient for that purpose in the case of realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The proper conclusion from these cases would seem to be, that grants of a right to enter the lands of the grantor and sever therefrom and appropriate its products or mineral contents, are subject to a presumption not applicable to the case of a sale of personalty, that the grantor did not intend to exclude his own proprietary right to a concurrent enjoyment with the licensee of the power granted. If this view is correct, any words evidencing an intent on the part of the grantor to part with his proprietary rights over the subject-matter to which the grant relates, would rebut such presumption. What force, then, should be given to words tending to evidence an intent on the part of the grantor to exclude himself from the enjoyment concurrently with the grantee of the right conferred ? So far as the existence of such a presumption bears on the question, the obvious answer is, that the same force should be given to the expressions employed that would be given had the subject-matter been other than realty. The presumption, indeed, demands some positive evidence of an exclusive intent, but does not influence the force of the evidence of such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">If the foregoing propositions flow from the principles of law, and are compatible with the adjudicated cases, then we have a clear rule to govern us in seeking the construction of the grant in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">We have only to ask what the parties had in contemplation as the right intended to be created, giving to the terms, or expressions employed by them in a technical sense, that technical force and effect conferred upon them by the adjudicated cases entitled to have weight as authority. We have now to look into the current of decisions to verify the grounds of our conclusions ; but that we may the better understand their bearing and force, it is proper to observe some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the features in the various instruments which have received judicial construction as bearing on the question of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In all the grants of mining rights, from the earliest reported, cases down to the present time, there is a striking similarity in the terms used to describe the character of the rights intended to be conferred. It is described, substantially, as a right to enter certain designated premises, and to search for minerals, to mine or work them, appropriate and sell them. In some cases the premises may be used for manufacture only to the extent of preparing the raw material for use or sale ; in other cases, like the case in hand, the right to use the premises for the purpose of manufacture is unlimited, as to the nature and extent of the manufacturing powers. The right uniformly embraces authority to go upon the land of another, and perform there certain acts which could only be justified under authority, derived from the owner, of severing from the land certain portions of the body of the land, so as to become personal property, and appropriating the same as against the right of the owner and all other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Such a right may exist perfect in the hands of a grantee, and yet not exclude the right of the grantor or owner to take from the land like substances, for his own use, so that he does not obstruct or impede such operations as the grantee may have set on foot, in virtue of his grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Although the right to mine in the lands of the grantor, may extend to all minerals, or to all of a given class, yet that does not exclude the grantor from appropriating minerals of that description, provided he does not obstruct the operations of the grantee. In a word, the possession of a right to go upon the lands of another to search for, sever, remove and appropriate any or all minerals, or any or all of a given class, does not exclude the owner of the land from taking to his own use, minerals of the same character and class from the premises embraced in the grant. Nor does the fact that such right is, by the terms of the grant, an assignable interest in the hands of such grantee, operate to the exclusion of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">When, however, the grant evidences an intent to exclude the grantor, such intent provides whether the grant extends to all mineral substances, or to all of one or more classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">There are three modes in which the intent to exclude the grantor has been expressed: first, by terms importing a sale and conveyance of the minerals, as such, in which case the grantor\u2019s right is ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>eluded, by a necessary implication, from, the possession of full proprietary right on the part of the grantee; second, by words of conveyance, conferring on the grantee exclusive power over the subject-matter of the grant; and, third, by provisions excluding the grantor from the performance of acts appropriate to him as owner of the land, where the effect of such exclusion is to leave unlimited control in the grantee of all materials to which the mining right relates.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">An intent to exclude the grantor, though, not expressed in the body of the deed, may be implied from the nature of the consideration. The fact that the grantee is bound to pay for the substances appropriated by him according to the quantity realized, at an agreed rate, whether in kind or in money, does not, of itself, disclose an intent to exclude the grantor. But if the consideration appears to include a value fixed by the parties on the whole mineral deposit, and is demandable absolutely under the contract, without depending on the value of the actual result from the mining operations of the grantee, the grant is regarded as a sale of the mineral, and, as to it, the grantor is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We will now look into the cases, in order to verify the deductions from them already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\"><em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case (Co. Lit., 165,) determines that a reservation of the right to take minerals and turf, although existing as an assignable and heritable interest, does not necessarily exclude the owner of the land. In that case, there were no words expressive of an intent to exclude the owner of the land, independent of the nature of the thing reserved. It is true, the reservation must be regarded as made upon consideration, but the consideration, whatever it may have been, was not in a form enabling the Court to conclude that, in fixing that consideration, the parties had acted upon a real or assumed valuation of all the materials subject to appropriation under the terms of the reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The authority of this case has been recognized in this State, in <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>Way, </em>11 Rich., 624; in Pennsylvania, in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>31 Penn., 624, and <em>Funk </em>vs. <em>Haldeman, </em>53 Penn., 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\"><em>Wilson </em>vs. <em>McKreth </em>(3 Burr., 1824,) holds that one may have, as against the owner of the land, an exclusive right to take the turf. It is worthy of notice that, from all that appears in that case, the right of the plaintiff may have been limited to so much as he should require for a particular use. The question of exclusiveness was not treated in that case as at all dependent on the question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>whether, in its nature, the right conferred was corporeal or incorporeal, but wholly on the terms of the grant or prescription under which it was claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><em>Chitham </em>vs. <em>Williamson </em>(4 East., 469,) followed <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case. Lord Ellenborough says, in that case, \u201cno case can be named where one who has only a liberty of digging for coals in another\u2019s soil, has an exclusive right to the coals, so as to enable him to maintain trover against the owner of the estate for coals raised by him.\u201d This is far from saying, that such an exclusive right cannot be created by the use of suitahle language in the grant. It is only authority for saying, that exclusion will not be implied from the naked fact of a grant of that nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood </em>(2 Barn. &amp; Ald., 724,) contained nothing to take it out of <em>Lord Mountjojy\u2019s </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The question was, whether the grant operated as a demise or a license merely. The discussion of the question by Abbott, C. J., shows, that the question of exclusiveness, as settled by the language and intent of the grant, was regarded as laying at the foundation of the question, whether the instrument could take effect as a demise. It was not in terms a demise, and could only be made to operate as such, when the right intended to be conferred was of such a nature as to be the proper subject of a demise. The consideration of that grant tended rather to strengthen than rebut the presumption, that the grantor did not intend to divest himself of the entire property of the minerals, for, instead of its being an entire sum, including the value of all materials subject to appropriation under it, it Avas a reservation of a share of the minerals, as such. The idea of a grant, operating as a sale or demise of the minerals themselves,, is distinctly recognized, and the cas\u00e9 before the Court distinguished from one resting on a grant of that nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">It is fairly inferable from the case, that had the grant conferred an exclusive right of mining for a term of years, it would have been regarded a demise, although the subject-matter was not an opened mine, but merely minerals contained in the land. This proposition is as distinctly recognized as it could Avell bo, without being directly ruled by the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\"><em>Muskett </em>vs. <em>Hill, </em>2 Bering., N. C., 694, while adhering to <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>goes a step further, holding, under a grant closely resembling that in <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>that a license of that character could operate as a grant in respect of minerals taken under its authority, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>therefore constituted an assignable interest in the hands of the licensee. <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>Way, </em>11 Rich., 624, applied the principles of <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case to the case of a right to take timber in the land of another. The applicability is put distinctly on the ground that the grant contained no words of exclusion. <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>31 Penn., 475, is a leading Pennsylvania case bearing on this question. The adjudications of the Courts of that State, in this branch of the law, are entitled to great consideration, both for the extent and value of the mining operations that have been affected by such adjudications, and for the great learning and experience of the Judges from which they have emanated. Apart from the nature of the consideration of the grant in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>it was distinctly ruled by <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case. Judge Woodward, who delivered the opinion of the Court in a previous case between the same parties, both in that case, and in <em>Funk </em>vs. <em>Haldeman, 53 </em>Penn., 229, recognized the authority of <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, as reported by Lord Coke, under the weight of authority that had, both in the English and American Courts, sanctioned its rulings, but held that the grant then under consideration was to be regarded as a sale, for a valuable consideration, of the absolute and exclusive right to all the coal under the grantor\u2019s land. The opinion in the recent case reported in 31 Penn., 475, was delivered by Judge Strong. This opinion does not so distinctly appear to place the decision on the ground of the nature of the consideration paid, but that such was the turning point of the ease distinctly appears in <em>Clement </em>vs. <em>Youngman, </em>where the same Judge states the point decided in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton. Clement </em>vs. <em>Youngman, </em>40 Penn., 341, contains this important expression : \u201cIn <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton </em>we held that a grant of an unlimited right, litle and privilege to dig and take away the coal, in a designated tract of land, to any extent the grantee might think proper, and for a consideration, presently paid, was a grant of the coal itself, and not merely a license or incorporeal right.\u201d To this view of <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>the Court declares itself as adhering. The grant in that case related to two distinct kinds of material to be found on the premises, namely, iron and limestone. The Court held that the agreement was not intended by the parties to confer an absolute right to either the ore or the limestone, on the ground that, as it regards the ore, the only consideration stated was an agreement to pay for the amount of ore actually taken, and as to the limestone, no consideration of any kind was stipulated for, besides the limestone was only to be taken to be used in the manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>facture of iron from the ore. This case is in entire harmony with <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, and is distinguishable from <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton </em>by the fact that there was no consideration stipulated for, that implied a sale of all the minerals of the designated kinds on the premises. It holds that an agreement to pay a stipulated price for the minerals actually taken, estimated upon the quantity taken, is not such a consideration as implies a sale of the whole mineral content. In this last respect the case resembles <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>with the exception, that the consideration stipulated for, in that case, was a share of the minerals, instead of a fixed equivalent in money. This case treats the question as to whether the right granted is corporeal as depending upon the intention of the parties as to its exclusiveness, as derived from all parts of the instrument construed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><em>Glonninger </em>vs. <em>Franklin Coal Co., </em>55 Penn., 7. The grant in this case was held not to be exclusive on two grounds: first, the consideration was a merely nominal sum ($6.50); and, second, the right to take coal was limited to the amount required by the grantee for his use as a blacksmith. In construing that part of the grant that operated to limit the amount to be taken, the Court took into account the state of knowledge, as to the value of coal, and its uses at the time of making the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Graves </em>vs. <em>Hodges, </em>55 Penn., 564, holds that an agreement to pay a stipulated price per ton for ore taken, does not import an exclusive privilege. <em>Grubb </em>vs. <em>Bayard, </em>2 Wall., Jr., 81, where the consideration was also an amount stipulated to be paid per ton for the mineral taken, holds that the grant was not exclusive. Thus we find, in eases entitled to weight as authority, the proposition that when the grantee has unlimited authority over the subject-matter of the grant, a consideration consisting of an entire sum, including the valuation fixed by the parties upon the whole mineral content of the land, or of the class of minerals to which the mining right relates, demandable absolutely under the contract, furnishes evidence of an intent to confer an exclusive right on the grantee. On the other hand, the proposition is not disputed by any of the cases regarded as of leading authority on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">This conclusion appears entirely reasonable. No presumption of an intent to reserve any part of the thing granted ought to prevail against ground of reasonable inference, that the price received by the grantor is an equivalent for the whole thing granted. Certainly in equity such a presumption could not be allowed to prevail over the manifest equity disclosed by the nature of the consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>We are not called upon in this case to decide that the fact of such a consideration, standing by itself, is sufficient to characterize the contract as intending an exclusive right, but as in the present case there are other evidences of such intent, we are only required to hold that the existence of such a consideration tends to establish an exclusive intent. We hold, therefore, that the grant to the defendant Moses was intended to, and did in fact, exclude the grantor, Mas-sot, from all right to appropriate to himself any of the mineral substance to which the grant relates during the term of the contract, and <em>from </em>conferring such right upon any other person, as against the grantee or those of right claiming under the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Had Moses\u2019 right been unlimited as to time, the grant would have operated as an absolute sale and conveyance of the mineral itself, as in the case of <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton. </em>The limitation of the right to ten years prevents it from having this effect, but does not change the character of the grantee\u2019s authority during that period, such authority being that due to a full proprietorship of the minerals during the term. The words \u201c sell and convey \u201d cannot have their full effect, in consequence of the limitation in point of time, but in conjunction with other expressions of the grant, they serve to fix the character of the grantee\u2019s power and right, as a full proprietorship, during such term. This conclusion is not affected by the limitation imposed, as to the extent of the surface to be worked at any given time, as that limitation does not impair the right to work the whole, but limits the use of the surface of the ground as an incident to the operation of searching for and removing the minerals.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">It is clear <em>that the </em>grant operated as a demise of the minerals for the term of ten years, and, therefore, the interest of the grantee was divisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Three things are necessary to a demise ; first, a proper subject-matter; second, possession for a term of years: and, third, a right to the profits during such term. The argument in behalf of the plaintiff is, that the powers conferred by the grant does not relate to any thing corporeal, of which possession may be had. If this conclusion be established, it would result, as contended for by the plaintiff, that the power being incorporeal, it was indivisible, and the defendant, having attempted to divide it, had destroyed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The answer to this argument is supplied by the authorities, as well as by the reason of the case. The law of England, on this subject,is stated by Mr. Bainbridge, in his work on the Law of Mines and Minerals, 163. He states that minerals contained in the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>although unopened, as well as opened mines, are capable of forming \u201c a distinct possession or inheritance,\u201d and that if it was requisite that livery of seizin should be made of them, still they are susceptible of such livery. That author does not cite the authority of adjudicated cases to these propositions, as fully as might be expected. It is, however, not unlikely that this view of the law, so distinctly shadowed forth in <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Ald., 924, should have been practically acted upon without further controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>the question was whether ejectment would lie in the case of unopened mines, by one having the right to mine, though not entitled as owner or lessee of the land. If property of that kind had been incapable of sustaining a possessory title, the answer to the action would have been complete without any further enquiry, in order to ascertain the intention of the parties to the grant. The fact that the Court regarded it as important to ascertain whether the parties intended it as a demise, shows, conclusively, that it was capable of acting as a demise, if the parties so intended. This case leaves no doubt as to how the law of England stood, and if no other authority for so doing existed, Mr. Bainbridge would have been justified in stating, in the manner in which he has stated it, the law of that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"><em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>31 Penn., 475, holds that, by the law of Pennsylvania, minerals unsevered, are land, capable of being held and transferred, apart from the ownership of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">This determination necessarily involved the idea, that a possessory title could be had \u201c in minerals in place,\u201d and, therefore, we should infer that a grant or conveyance, intended by the parties to operate as a transfer of property of that character, for a term of years, accompanied by an exclusive enjoyment of the profits thereof, would create a demise. There are, however, expressions in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>and <em>Clement </em>vs. <em>Youngman, </em>that involve this deduction in some perplexity, as it regards the effect of the Pennsylvania cases. In these cases stress was laid on the fact that the right of the grantee was wholly unlimited in respect of time, quantity and use. It is not difficult to see the bearing of that fact in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>for there the conclusion that the grant operated to exclude the grantor rested on the fact that the parties intended a sale and conveyance. It was important to show that the entire interest in the coal was transferred. But it would not seem to follow that there was no other mode by which the grantor could have conferred an exclusive right on the grantee, than by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>making an instrument that was capable of operating as a sale and conveyance absolute of the whole content of coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The difficulty as to the construction intended by the Pennsylvania cases arises from expressions employed in the opinions. The opinion of Judge Woodward, reported in 31 Penn., 475, is clear upon this point. He sought to rest the case upon the inferences arising out of the consideration. From the consideration he inferred a contract of sale of the whole content of coal. His language is, \u201c he sold for a valuable consideration all he had in sixteen acres, and all the coal in his other land. I say all, because the grant is limited to no time or quantity or purpose or person.\u201d The absence of a limitation as to time is here referred to as defining <em>how mueh </em>was sold, and not for the reason that such a limitation would be necessarily decisive against the grant operating as exclusive against the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Judge Strong, in the opinion in the second case that arose between the parties to <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>sought to place the right of the grantee on quite different ground from that previously taken by Judge Woodward. His theory of the case, started with the proposition that \u201cminerals in place\u201d were land, and might be transferred as such. He then lays down the principle, that a conveyance of the whole profit of land is a conveyance of the land itself. In order to apply these principles to the case in hand, it was requisite to show two things: first, that coal was a profit of land ; and, second, that the grantee acquired a right to the whole profit of coal. In answering the objection that coal being but part of the profit of the land, the principle could not bh applied, he holds that the subject of the grant being coal, the whole usufruct and dominion were granted. In other words, coal in place was, in itself, land, and might be conveyed as such. It is difficult to understand why, if coal is land, it should be necessary to treat it as merely a profit of land. According to this view a sale of coal was a sale of land <em>eo nomine. </em>Why, then, resort to a principle which is only important when the laud, as such, is not conveyed? <em>To </em>the operation of this principle he ascribes the conclusion in <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, <em>Cheatham </em>vs. <em>Williamson, Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood </em>and <em>Grubb </em>vs. <em>Bayard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">An examination of the eases last mentioned will show that the idea that a conveyance of the profit of land is a conveyance of the land, did not enter into the grounds of decision in those cases. Of <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, Judge Strong says that the grant was of \u201c only sufficient for a single specified purpose, viz: the manufacture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>alum and copperas.\u201d And thus it was not in conflict. In other words, if the right in that case had not been subject to that particular limitation, it would have been held to exclude the grantor. It is far from clear that the grant in <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, so far as it related to ores, was subject to the limitation that clearly applied to the turf; at all events, that solution was not indicated in the case as reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">It is very clear that Lord Ellenborough did not so understand <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, when, in <em>Cheatham </em>vs. <em>Williamson, </em>he deduced from that case the proposition, that one having a liberty of digging for coals in another\u2019s land, has not an exclusive right to the coals, as against the owner of the soil. Had the grant in <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case been unlimited, as to the purpose for which the grantee should take the turf or minerals, it still would have been only \u201c a liberty of digging\u201d in another\u2019s soil, and the remark of Lord Ellenborough would be equally applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The comment made by Judge Strong, on <em>Cheatham </em>vs. <em>Williamson, </em>that that case was decided upon the idea that livery of seizin was indispensable, does not appear to be sustained by the report of that case in 4 East. Lawrence, J., says \u201c the covenant, therefore, can only operate as a grant, but will not pass the land itself without livery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The allusion to the want of livery arose from the fact that E. Hyde was only the owner of the equity of redemption, and had not the legal estate in him, and as the right to mine was reserved in his deed, it was necessarily unaccompanied by livery, for E. Hyde, not having the legal estate, could not make livery. The remark of Lawrence, J., if entitled to be regarded as disclosing the point of the case, falls far short of making the assertion that such an interest as an exclusive grant would have created was incapable of being attended by livery.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Judge Strong\u2019s comment on <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>(2 Burr, and Ald., 719,) fails to elicit the full import of that case. It was not the fact that the grant was limited to a term of twenty-one years, that was the ground of holding it a license. The question was whether it was a demise or license. If a demise, it would be the limitation of a term of years that would make it such. That, of course, then, was not the turning point as between a demise and a license. Abbott, C. J., states the question as follows: \u201c One of the questions was whether this indenture operated as a demise of the metals and minerals, so as to vest in the lessee a legal estate therein, during the term, upon the condition mentioned, or only a license to work and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>get the metals and minerals that might be found within the limits described.\u201d Here is a clear conclusion that a legal estate in the mines and minerals might be created for a term of years, and so far as to operate as a demise. The question was, then, had the parties done so? The conclusion of the Court was, that by the terms of the grant the grantee did not take a present interest in the minerals as proprietor, but that his proprietary right arose only when the minerals were severed from the land. It will be borne in mind, that in that case the grantor retained an interest in the minerals themselves in the form of a share of all minerals raised. That decision clearly rests on the idea that the grant was not exclusive, because it was nothing more than a liberty to dig for minerals in the land of another. Had there been anything in the granting part of the deed, or in the consideration, showing that the parties intended it to be exclusive, it is clear that it would have been upheld as a demise. This shows clearly that the limitation, as to time, was not the turning point in the case. That case professed to follow <em>Lord Mount-joy's </em>case, and we are at liberty to conclude that the construction put upon the grant was the result of the principle settled in that case. This view se\u00e9ms to strengthen the idea that has already been advanced in regard to <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, that the Court allowed a presumption, in the absence of 'words of exclusion, that the grantor did not intend to divest himself of his proprietary right as owner of the land, but to admit the grantee to a participation in certain of those rights. The conclusion of Judge Strong is summed up in these words: \u201c When the intent is to give the entire usufruct, and power of disposal, the legal title must be held to pass.\u201d Standing by itself, this proposition is not controverted, nor was it necessary .to go beyond the mere affirmation of that proposition in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton. </em>But it does not follow that because the entire usufruct and power are limited to a term of years, that a legal estate by way of demise will not pass. It will be observed that Judge Strong speaks of \u201c the entire usufruct and power of disposal.\u201d There is a well defined distinction between a deed of the usufruct and the power of disposal as it regards its competency as an actual conveyance of the land to which it relates. A deed of the usufruct of land can only convey the land itself under the operation of a rule of construction enlarging the terms of the deed beyond their direct import, on the principle of implication. Not so in the case of a deed conveying the \u201cpower of disposal,\u201d when such a conveyance is made for the use and enjoyment of the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In the latter case, the subject of the grant is dominion over the land. All that a deed purporting to convey the land, specifically, can pass, is the dominion over the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The deed does not affect the physical attributes of the land, or confer on it any quality fitting it to become subject to the dominion of the new owner. It simply transfers to the grantee what the grantor previously possessed. \u201c Power of disposal is dominion over the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">When, therefore, the deed conveys both the usufruct and power of disposal, it is unnecessary to resort to the rule, that conveyance of the whole usufruct is the conveyance of the land itself, for the deed acts at once, by a principle of interpretation within itself, asa conveyance of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Regarding coal as land, the deed in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton </em>did not merely convey the usufruct of land, but conveyed complete and absolute power of control over land, for the use and enjoyment of the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">For the same reason, had that deed conveyed the same power of control and disposal for a term of years, it would have created a demise. It is quite evident, from the summary already quoted, as made in <em>Clement </em>vs. <em>Youngman </em>as to the point ruled in <em>Caldwell </em>vs. <em>Fulton, </em>that the Court, on mature consideration, was disposed to adhere to the conclusion that the true point of distinction between that case and <em>Lord Mountjoy\u2019s </em>case, was the difference in the inferences to be drawn from the considerations of the respective grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">No one disputes the validity of a lease of opened mines, nor that such a lease covers the stratum or vein of minerals, so far as embraced within the lands described, and is not limited to the openings, which are merely conveniences for getting access to the mineral, nor to the superficial occupation of the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Extensive workings may serve to develope the value of a stratum or vein of mineral, but are not essential to complete the legal idea of property in such substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The legal conception of land is that of a right, within the limits of law, to control some part of the earth embracing its surface and content.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">In general, conveyancing deals only with the surface of the ground, and, accordingly, we have come to consider surveyors\u2019 lines as the true boundaries of property. If we find difficulty in conceiving of the ownership of a vein of mineral as land, it probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>arises from the fact that we cannot conceive of the outlines of such property being traced by surveyors\u2019 lines. But this is a mere superficial idea of land. A man\u2019s possessions, as the owner of land, is a solid body of rock, soil and water, bounded by planes instead of lines. There is no good reason why he should not, if he chooses, divide his possessions with those who can make a more advantageous use of it than he can make, by horizontal planes, or oblique planes, so long as the law can comprehend and effectuate his purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Such is the practice of mankind, and it is due to the practice of the law that its ideas should keep pace with the habits and usages of practical life.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The notion of accessibility forms no part of the idea of land, yet the difficulty that arises in attempting to form a legal conception of a vein of mineral as land, springs from the idea of its inaccessibility. As it regards livery of seizin, it is not, now-a-days, a question whether the owner of the soil can reach it, in order to perfect a symbolical delivery, but whether the statute of uses can reach it so as to give effect to a deed of bargain and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The interest of Moses being a demise, it was competent for him to divide it, and, therefore, the ground of the bill fails, and it must be dismissed with cost.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-8\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
