J. Donaldson, as Receiver of the Bank of Camden, S. C., plaintiff, against William E. Johnson and Wm. D. McDowall, defendants. The case will be understood from the decree of the Circuit Judge, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-14\">Melton, J. The plaintiff in this cause was, on the 17th day of February, 1870, appointed the Receiver of the Bank of Camden, South Carolina, pursuant to the provisions of an Act of the General Assembly, approved March 13, 1869, entitled \u201c An Act to enable the banks of the State to renew business, or to place them in liquidation,\u201d (14 Stat., 212,) and became vested, by the terms of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Act, with power and authority \u201c to take charge of the property and assets of the bank, and to make a final settlement of the accounts of the bank.\u201d On the 8th of March, 1870, he made demand of the defendants, who were the former President and Cashier of the bank, for the delivery to him of the property and assets of the bank. With this demand the defendants refused to comply, and this complaint is filed by the plaintiff, and prays relief: 1st. That the defendants do discover all and singular the assets of the bank. 2d. That they surrender and deliver to the plaintiff all and singular the said property and assets. 3d. That they account for and pay over to the plaintiff all moneys by them received from the collection, sales or other disposition of the property of the bank. 4th. And that the defendants be enjoined from any further dealing with, or interfering with, the property or assets of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">The defendants allege, in answer to this complaint, that at the time the plaintiff was appointed as Receiver, the Bank of Camden was in liquidation, and that they were themselves the Receivers, having been so appointed by the Circuit Court, and that, as Receivers, they were rightfully in possession of the property and assets of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">The facts in relation to this defence are these: On the 17th of April, 1869, a bill was filed in the Circuit Court for Kershaw, by William E. Johnson and others, the President and Directors of the Bank of Camden, S. C., against the Bank of Camden, S. G., and others, being the stockholders and creditors of the bank, which was&gt; in effect, a bill to marshal the assets of the bank, to call in the creditors thereof, and to enjoin them from otherwise proceeding against the bank. By an order in the cause, dated May 14th, 1869, the complainants were required by public advertisement for three months, in newspapers of Charleston, Columbia, New York and Camden, to call upon all creditors to present and establish their demands at the banking house of complainants, in Camden, on or before the first day of September, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">On the 22d day of September, 1869, a report was filed in said cause by the defendants, as President and Cashier, in reference to the condition of the bank and the claims presented; upon the hearing of which the following order was made by his Honor Judge Boozer, then presiding:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-8\">\u201cUpon hearing the report of the President and Cashier of the Bank of Camden, S. C., filed in this cause, it is ordered that the claims presented against the said Bank of Camden, on or before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>first day of September, instant, in accordance with the order heretofore made, be paid out of any of the assets of said bank, the President and Cashier acting as Receivers to this end, with such further authority, as the Board of Directors may rightfully confer as to collections, sales of property, and-so-forth, as may be necessary. It is further ordered that the said Receivers proceed to the final settlement of the Bank of Camden, S. C., and that they report to every term of this Court their actings and doings under this order until discharged by the further order of this Court. That, after paying the claims already rendered against the bank, and any others which, coming in hereafter, may be ordered to be paid by this Court, the said Receivers distribute the remaining assets among the stockholders of said bank y&gt;ro <em>rata. </em>That, until discharged, the said Receivers shall be entitled to receive the compensation now allowed them by the Board of Directors of said bank. That the cost of these proceedings be paid by said Receivers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">By the terms of this order, the defendants claim that they were appointed the receivers of the said bank. They, however, gave no bonds as such. And it further appears that, on the first of November, 1869, they made to the Comptroller General a statement of the property, assets and liabilities of the bank, in which they say, \u201c we are the officers of the said bank which we claim to be,\u201d and sign their names as President and Cashier. (See the report of the Comptroller General to the General Assembly, November, 1869, pages 124 and 125.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">On the other hand, it appears that at date of December 1, 1869, the President communicated to the Comptroller General that the bank was in process of liquidation under the directions of the Court, and that the assets were then in the hands of the defendants as Receivers of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">Taking the view which I do of the force and effect of the provisions of the Act of 1869, it is unnecessary for me to adjudge whether the defendants were, in fact, the appointed Receivers of the Court, for I should hold, even if this fact were unquestioned, that this appointment could operate only provisionally, and must yield to the subsequent appointment of the plaintiff, which was made in accordance with the provisions of that Act. It is avowed in the complaint, and not denied in the answer, that the Bank of Camden was, by reason of its condition, within the operation of the Act of 1869, that is to say, that it was a bank incorporated by the authority of the State; that by said authority it had failed to comply with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>corporate privileges by refusing to pay its bills; that at the time of the passage of the said Act, it was failing so to do; and that it continued to violate its charter until the first of December, 1869. It is further averred,and not denied, that the appointment of the plaintiff as Receiver was duly made, in accordance with the provisions of said Act, and that he filed his bond with good and sufficient security, which was approved by the Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">In making this appointment, the duty imposed upon the Circuit Judge was, in terms, imperative. The necessary facts being shown to exist, the only discretion with which he was invested was as to the selection of the person upon whom to confer the appointment. If this discretion were now to be exercised, with my present knowledge of what had been already ordered by the Court, I would hesitate to supersede, by a new appointment, those who had already been charged with the duty of making a final settlement of the affairs of the bank, or if it were in my power to reconsider my action, I would feel bound to give the most respectful consideration to the protest of the stockholders and creditors against their removal, which are filed with the answer. But the appointment has been made, and were it now manifestly an improper one, it is not in my power to reconsider it. The order by which it was made was not a judicial act. The power to make it might as well have been conferred upon the Governor or upon the Comptroller General, as upon the Judge of the Circuit. Having been made, it is now beyond his control, and must carry with it the full force and authority confirmed by the Acts of the General Assembly, the authority \u201c to take charge of the property and assets of the bank.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">It is, therefore, adjudged,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">1. That the defendants do discover all and singular the property and assets of the Bank of Camden, South Carolina, which were in their possession at the time the demand therefor was made by the plaintiff, and that they forthwith file with the Clerk of the Court, a schedule thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">2. That the said defendants do surrender and deliver over to the plaintiff all and singular such property and assets as are now in their possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">3. That the said defendants do account for and pay over to the plaintiff all moneys by them, or either of them, collected, on any of the choses in action of said bank since said demand was made, or realized from any sale or other disposition of any of the property and assets of said bank since said demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>4.

And if the capital stock should be divided, leaving any debts unpaid, every stockholder, receiving his share of the capital stock, would, in equity, be held liable <em>pro rata </em>to contribute to the discharge of such debts out of the fund in his own hands. This, however, is a remedy which can be obtained in equity only; for a Court of common law is incapable of administering any just relief, since it has no power of bringing all the proper parties before the Court, or of ascertaining the full amounts of the debts, &amp;c.\u201d \u2014 2 Story Eq., \u00a7 1253.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-11\">\u201c It is not easy, in a great variety of cases, to say what the precise duty of a trustee is; and, therefore, it often becomes indispensable for him, before he acts, to seek the aid and direction of a Court of <em>Equity. </em>\u2014 lb., \u00a7 1267.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-12\">\u201c It is incumbent upon a trustee to satisfy himself, beyond doubt, before he parts with the possession of the property, who are the parties legally entitled to it.\u201d \u2014 -Lewin on Trustees, 365.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-13\">\u201c A trustee cannot be expected to incur the least risk, and, therefore, if all the equities be not perfectly clear, he should decline to act without the sanction of the Court, and he will be allowed all costs and expenses incurred by him for that purpose, * * *.

This upon the familiar ground of preventing a multiplicity of suits, and thus to save unnecessary expenses and costs. The case stands as that of a trustee in possession of funds upon which numerous parties have conflicting claims, and who calls them together to interplead and to determine their claims among themselves, being ready himseFto disburse the fund according to the result.

If \u201cthe Judge of the Circuit\u201d had the power to confer the appointment, it must stand, without regard to the consequences wffiich the appellants anticipate will materially affect the interests of the creditors, and possibly the stockholders, of the corporation which they claim to represent.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The Act of March 13, 1869, (14 Stat., 212,) was to change the anomalous relation in which the incorporated banks of the State, which had failed to meet their issue, stood to the source from which they had derived their existence, and to the public, who had become their creditors by holding their bills. It was due to the community with which they had dealt, if they were unable to comply with the conditions intended, and provided as a security for the proper fulfillment of the duties enjoined by their charters, that their corporate rights should terminate. The Legislature, with a commendable liberality, extended the time for their resumption of specie payment to the first of December following the passage of the Act, and in the event of the failure of any bank to accept the proposed alternative, the performance of which was to exempt it from the operation of the Act, the Judge of the Circuit in which such bank was situated, was required to appoint a suitable person as Receiver, to take charge of its property and assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We are not now to determine whether the mere fact of such appointment worked a forfeiture of the charter of such non-complying bank, nor whether, without resistance on the part of such bank, according to the forms of law, a forfeiture would follow, nor whether the appellants here can contest the fact of forfeiture, when, in their answer, they do not claim that their bank, on the first of December, 1869, had performed all the conditions demanded by the Act to give continuance to its charter. The objection to the exercise of the power by the Judge of the Circuit, urged by the appellants, rests entirely on the assumption \u201c that the Act of 1869 did not apply to a bank in liquidation under a decree of the Court before the time at which the Act was operative by its terms.\u201d The other points made are only incidental to this, as, for instance, that the power of the Judge was entirely superseded by the previous appointment of a Receiver in the cause pending in the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The whole design of the Act could have been readily defeated by all the banks on which it was intended to operate if this exception can prevail. If a bill had been filed after the passage of the Act by any of the suspended banks, admitting its insolvency and the violation of its charter, and praying that it might be put in liquidation and a Receiver appointed, it is hot clear that a proceeding set in motion by such defaulting bank to sever itself from the power of the Judge of the Circuit in the particular conferred by the Act, would have proved a successful result. The Receiver to be appointed under the Act had prescribed duties to perform in regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>to the State, which would not be incumbent on a Receiver appointed by a Court in the course of a ease, unless required by its order. The appellants, however, so far from seeking, by their bill, the appointment of a Receiver, ask that the President and Directors be protected in the management of the institution \u201c according to the course they have been pursuing, except it be by the order and direction of this honorable Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">A Receiver is usually appointed on the application of a party having a claim \u201cin some case of equitable property.\u201d It is never sought of a Court by a debtor having his own assets in his own hands. He generally considers himself perfectly competent for the management of his property, and the best judge of how it shall be apportioned among his creditors. The bank, already the custodian of its funds, would gain nothing by its application to the Court to allow it to be the possessors of its own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The administration of the affairs of this bank was never assumed by the Court. It in no way undertook to vary or transfer the possession of the assets, or to change the relation in which its Directors stood to the bank or to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">An order had been made in the cause, requiring the \u201c creditors of the bank to present statements of their claims, designating the number of their bills or notes of each denomination, at the banking house of plaintiffs,\u201d by a certain day. The President and Cashier made a report of the demands filed, on which the Court ordered their payment \u201c out of the assets of the said bank, the President and Cashier acting as Receivers to this end, with such further authority as the Board may rightfully confer, as to collections, sales of property, &amp;c., as may be necessary.\u201d This conferred no more authority on the President and .Cashier, acting under the Board of Directors, than they had before, nor, on the other hand, did it restrict them in the exercise of any of their rights under the charter. The end to be accomplished by the appointment of a Receiver might be entirely frustrated, if the debtor should be selected as the custodian of the fund through which th\u00e9 creditor was to be paid. The Directors represented the bank. Parties are never proper-appointees as Receivers. Where would be the additional security for the assets, if they are nominally taken from the Directors as such, and yet retained in their hands as Receivers ? The Court cannot be supposed to have intended such an absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We are not, however, to be understood as affirming, that if, under the proceedings referred to, a Receiver had been appointed for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>corporation by the Court, after the passage of the Act of 1869, the statutory power authorized and required by the said Act would have beeu destroyed or impaired. The Receiver contemplated by the statute is not the ordinary provisional Receiver, appointed by a Court in the progress of a cause for the benefit of all the parties interested. Although appointed by the Judge of the Circuit, he is not, in a judicial view, the officer of the Court. If the Act had authorized the Governor to appoint the Receiver, it could scarcely be claimed that his nominee would be the officer of the Court, although all the incidents belonging to the position of the ordinary Receiver might attach to the office, and he would be answerable to the order and process of any Court having the right to administer the fund committed to his charge. He is not the creature of the Court in the sense in which the term is applied to the ordinary Receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">It is a mistake to suppose that the excercise of the power conferred on the Judge of the Circuit could in any event affect the preference which a creditor might have obtained in the course of legal proceedings in regard to the assets of this corporation, or at all interfere with the vested rights of any creditor. If these are in a condition in which they can be judicially recognized, they must prevail, for they cannot be prejudiced by the mere execution of a power by one having the right to exercise it under statutory authority. As they are beyond the reach of the Legislature itself, they are still further beyond that of their mere agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, and dismissing the motion, has been heretofore filed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-7\"><em>Willard, </em>A.
