The court, in its orders overruling defendant-appellant\u2019s motions to quash service of process, certified in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1958) that the orders \u201c[involve] a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order[s] may materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation.\u201d This court granted leave to appeal from the interlocutory orders denying the motions to quash service of process, and consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-24\">Title 13, \u00a7 103, D.C.Code (1961) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-25\">\u201cWhen a foreign corporation shall transact business in the District without having any place of business or resident agent therein, service upon any officer or agent or employee of such corporation in the District shall be effectual as to suits growing out of contracts entered into or to be performed, in whole or in part, in the District of Columbia or growing put of any tort committed in the said District.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-26\">Our examination of the record convinces us that- the person on whom process was served was not an \u201cofficer, or agent or employee\u201d of the appellant corporation but was the president of a Maryland corporation which did business in the District of Columbia as an \u201cinde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>pendent manufacturers\u2019 representative,\u201d who, without obligation and as an accommodation to one of his suppliers, in this one instance had made certain inquiries and delivered certain forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">We need not consider whether the corporation was doing business in the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">It follows that the orders of the District Court must be and hereby are</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
