Until there has been an application to the District Court for an order, and that Court has denied the application or has failed to act in relation to it under circumstances amounting to neglect, no basis exists for this Court to take cognizance of the matter. And should the matter become cognizable on this basis, we would not undertake to grant relief, unless it appeared that the situation was one in which the District Court was without a power of discretion, or, if discretion was entitled to be exercised, that this had been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">The application of petitioner, which has been presented in the form of a letter, with pauperis showing, will be permitted to be docketed without payment of fee, but the issuance of a writ will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
