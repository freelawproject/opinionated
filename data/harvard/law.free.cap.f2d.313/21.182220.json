The contention of appellant that he is entitled to release has been earlier considered and denied by this court, Miller v. Taylor, 10 Cir., 290 F.2d 8, in an action presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>by appellant pro se and premised upon the identical factual background of the case at bar. However appellant is now represented by able counsel who earnestly asserts that critical facts existing in the procedural background of appellant\u2019s cause, although existing during our earlier consideration, were not presented to us and that the administration of justice requires this review. We agree that our earlier decision did not consider appellant\u2019s present contentions and that such contentions are not frivolous. We therefore allow the appeal in forma pauperis and take the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">On April 25, 1951, appellant began serving a fifteen-year sentence for bank robbery. In June, 1960, the District Court for the District of Kansas ordered appellant\u2019s release and respondent therein filed a timely petition for rehearing. Consideration of the petition for rehearing was held in abeyance pending this court\u2019s decision in Taylor v. Daniels, 10 Cir., 284 F.2d 135, rendered November 10, 1960. Meanwhile appellant had been released pursuant to the June, 1960, order but had been arrested and returned to confinement in September, 1960, in response to a violator\u2019s warrant issued by the United States Board of Parole under the authority of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4205.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Our decision in Daniels indicated error had premised the district court order of June 1960, granting release to appellant and thereupon that court granted respondent\u2019s petition for rehearing and ordered that the judgment \u201centered on the 6th day of June, 1960, be and the same is hereby vacated.\u201d Appellant now contends, by pointing to acceptable authority to the effect that a vacated judgment is a nullity and places the parties in the same position occupied prior to the entry of the vacated judgment, that he cannot now be lawfully confined pursuant to an action of the Board of Parole and further that if his present confinement is premised upon original commitment that he has fully served his statutory period upon allowance of good time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Although appellant\u2019s argument has initial appeal it lacks substantive merit. It is true that appellant became subject to the conditions of his release and the provisions of the Parole Act by reason of the court order of June, 1960, but had his release been effected in the regular course of time under the statute, rather than through the compulsion of a special proceeding, he would have similarly come under the surveillance of the Parole Board. It is the release of the prisoner prior to the expiration of the imposed sentence which provokes the duty and power of the Parole Board. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4164. And it is the fact of release and not the instrument of release that triggers jurisdiction in the Board of Parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Good time allowances do not reduce the sentence but only enable the prisoner to serve the latter part of his-sentence outside prison walls, Lopez v. Madigan, 179 F.Supp. 742 (D.C.N.D.Cal.), aff\u2019d 9 Cir., 273 F.2d 617. They are contingent upon the prisoner\u2019s continued good behavior in prison until they are sufficient to effect his release under supervision, Aderhold v. Perry, 5 Cir., 59 F.2d 379; United States ex rel. Johnson v. O\u2019Donovan, 7 Cir., 178 F.2d 810, and they are subject to forfeiture for his conduct after release, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4165.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Thus it is held that the release of a prisoner prior to his serving his maximum sentence is merely \u201can extension of the prison walls\u201d and his total record under disciplinary restraint, whether in prison or on parole, determines the time of confinement pending the termination of his sentence, United States ex rel. Rowe v. Nicholson, 4 Cir., 78 F.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Appellants\u2019 sentence was imposed at the time of his conviction and has-continued unchanged since that time. He was permitted by reason of the accumulation of good time allowances, albeit error was made in the computation thereof, a conditional release minimizing the restraints upon him. The entire program of confinement and attempted rehabilitation was a unity, which failed' because of appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the conditions necessary to his ac~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ceptance of statutory release. Although the original court order permitted a premature release, it did not affect appellant\u2019s status as a prisoner. And the subsequent vacation of that order likewise did not affect appellant\u2019s status as a prisoner on conditional release, for he had already incurred by his own actions a forfeiture of the grace accorded him. Such a forfeiture could have occurred by reason of his own conduct in prison and was not influenced by the supervisory control of the Parole Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">For these reasons, this court held that the fact that the prisoner was released due to erroneous application of the formula did not affect the jurisdiction of the Board to revoke the conditional release, Miller v. Taylor, 10 Cir., 290 F.2d 8. And for these reasons, the subsequent correction of the error did not render the actions of the Board pursuant to a statute a nullity. The trial court correctly ruled that appellant\u2019s petition was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
