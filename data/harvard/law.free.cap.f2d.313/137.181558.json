TAYLOR, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Appellant was tried and convicted of an oifense in violation of Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On appeal to this court appellant specifies as error the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial and the denial of his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-28\">Appellant\u2019s principal defense witness, Edward James Landry, was interrogated by the trial judge who also made a comment in regard to the testimony of this witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On cross-examination of the same witness the Assistant United States Attorney propounded an argumentative question to which an objection was made by defense counsel and sustained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The witness had previously testified in regard to his criminal record referred to in this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"> The question presented here is whether, because of the trial court\u2019s participation in the examination of the witness, Edward Landry, and the cross-examination of this witness by the prosecuting attorney, the appellant was deprived of a fair trial. Appellant contends that the court\u2019s examination of his key witness and his comment showed a hostile attitude toward appellant and was so prejudicial to his defense that he did not have a fair trial. An examination of the court\u2019s interrogation of the witness reveals that he was attempting to ascertain what facts were within the knowledge of the witness. If any prejudice resulted it was due to the witness and not the trial judge. It is within the province of a federal trial judge to interrogate witnesses and also to comment on their testimony if he so desires. The comment of the trial judge made at the conclusion of his interrogation could be interpreted only to mean that even though he did not give the testimony much credence the jury might give it more than he did. In effect, the court stated that it was for the jury to believe or disbelieve the testimony of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In charging the jury the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury in regard to its function as the sole finder of the facts from the evidence. He also instructed the jury to disregard any questions or answers to which an objection was sustained by the court and that the jurors were the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight their testimony deserved. He further instructed that the jurors were not to be controlled by any opinion or comment that the court may have expressed nor by the arguments of counsel. He cautioned the jury \u201cthat nothing in these instructions, nothing in the comments of the court during the trial of this case, nothing in any form of verdict prepared for your convenience, is to suggest or convey in any way or manner any intimation of any kind as to what I think your verdict should be. What the verdict shall be is the sole and exclusive duty and responsibility of you, the jury.\u201d It must be assumed that the jury followed the instructions of the court in resolving the case and in so doing the participation by the trial judge in the trial of the ease could not have been prejudicial. The record reveals that there is an abundance of evidence to justify the conviction. Any other verdict would not have been realistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">The problem presented here is analogous to the one presented in the case of Smith v. United States, 305 F.2d 197 (9th Cir., 1962), cert. denied 371 U.S. 890, 83 S.Ct. 190, 9 L.Ed.2d 124, and it is controlling here. Judge Hamley, speaking for the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">\u201cA federal trial judge, as has many times been said, is more than a moderator or umpire. He has the responsibility to preside in such a way as to promote a fair and expeditious development of the facts unencumbered by irrelevancies. He may assist the jury by commenting upon the evidence and this may include an appraisal of the credibility of witnesses, providing the comment is fair and the jury is clearly instructed that they are to find the facts and may disregard such comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-14\">\u201cIn fulfilling this responsibility during the stress of a criminal trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>few, if any judges can altogether \u25a0avoid words or action, inadvertent or \u2022otherwise, which seem inappropriate when later examined in the calm cloisters of the appellate court. But unless such misadventures so persistently pervade the trial or, considered individually or together, are of such magnitude that a courtroom climate unfair to the defendant is \u25a0 discernible from the cold record, the defendant is not sufficiently aggrieved to warrant a new trial.\u201d See also Duke v. United States, 255 F.2d 721 (9th Cir., 1958), cert. denied 357 U.S. 920, 78 S.Ct. 1361, 2 L.Ed.2d 1365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Appellant does not contend that the prosecutor\u2019s argumentative question standing alone is sufficient to warrant a reversal but does urge that the combination of the colloquy between the trial judge and the witness is sufficient. We do not agree. Cf. Darby v. United States, 283 F.2d 896 (10th Cir., 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away narcotic drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that' purpose by the Secretary [of the Treasury] or his delegate.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\"><em>. </em>Testimony of Edward James Bandry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201cMR.
