Lynd, Registrar of Elections of Forrest County, 5 Cir., 306 F.2d 222; United States v. Lynd, 5 Cir., 301 F.2d 818; Dinkins v. Attorney General of United States, 5 Cir., 285 F.2d 430; Kennedy v. Bruce, 5 Cir., 298 F.2d 860.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">In re Coleman, S.D.Miss., 1962, 208 F. Supp. 199, 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Our construction in Kennedy v. Lynd, supra, 306 F.2d at 226, of the requirement of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1974b that the demand for voting records \u201ccontain [s] a statement of the basis and the purpose therefor\u201d is supported by legislative history. Without collecting or citing more of that history, we quote from Senator Keating, one of the principal spokesmen for the bill in the Senate (106 Cong.Rec. 7767):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1V\">\u201cThe language added by the House Judiciary Committee in section 303 that the Attorney General\u2019s demand \u2018contain a statement of the basis and the purpose therefor\u2019 means only that the Attorney General identify in a general way the reasons for his demand. Clearly a sufficient statement would be the assertion that the demand was made for the purpose of investigating possible violations of a Federal statute. No showing even of a prima facie case of a violation of Federal law need be made. Mr. President, I believe that a majority of the Senate shares my understanding of the meaning of these provisions, but I thought it was important to make the record on this point abundantly clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">The present appeals are totally without merit, and the judgments are</p>\n<p id=\"A87\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
