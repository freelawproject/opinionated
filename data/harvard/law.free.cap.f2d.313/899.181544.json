Garelick has in stock and in dealers\u2019 hands a large supply of letters and numerals which it hopes to sell to boat owners. The Act provides (46 U.S.C. \u00a7 527a(c)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-7\">\u201cThe Secretary [of the Treasury] shall establish an over-all numbering system * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-8\">\u201c(3) The number awarded shall be required to be painted on, or attached to, each side of the bow of the vessel for which it was issued, and shall be of such size, color, and type, as may be prescribed by the Secretary * * * \u2019\u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">In December of 1958, after notice and hearing, regulations were promulgated in implementation of the Act. These regulations provided, among other requirements, that the letters and numbers should be \u201c * * * in block characters of good proportion * * * \u201d, 46 C.F.R. 171.05-5. In June, 1961, the Commandant, having discovered considerable misunderstanding of' the 1958 regulations, issued further regulations in which he attempted to clarify the terms used therein. These provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0C\">\u201c171.05-6 Definition of terms used in \u00a7 171.05-5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-10\">\u201c(c) In \u00a7 171.05-5 (b) the phrase \u2018block characters of good proportion\u2019 shall mean that the numerals and letters are vertical (not slanted) * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Garelick complains of this regulation because its stock of letters and numerals are not vertical, instead they are slanted twelve degrees off the vertical.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">Two issues are raised: Is the regulation interpretive and therefore without the requirement of notice and hearing, and has the Coast Guard abused its discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">In the hearing below, upon defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment the basic facts were agreed to by the parties, and samples of the plaintiff\u2019s merchandise were exhibited to the Court. In granting defendants\u2019 motion, the Court held the regulation of June 1961 to be interpretive in nature and, therefore, exempt \u25a0from the notice and hearing requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003, subsection (a). It further held that the regulation was neither arbitrary nor capricious. We agree with these conclusions. Gibson Wine Co. v. Snyder, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 135, 194 F.2d 329 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
