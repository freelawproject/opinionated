N. L. R. B., E10 F.2d 591 (9th Cir.) is misplaced. In Great Western the labor unions intervened in the proceedings and raised the restraint, coercion and constitutional questions. The first intimation of such grounds in the instant case was raised on the motion for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The motion of the Board is denied. See Partenweederei, MS Belgrano, and Rudolph A. Oetker v. George Weigel (9th Cir.), 313 F.2d 423. See National Labor Relations Act, as Amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e): \u201cNo objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
