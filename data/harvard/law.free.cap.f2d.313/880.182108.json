As a working manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>he supervised the operations of other employees in the shop, and worked as a barber when not engaged in such supervision.<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Prior to 1960, Terminal engaged independent contractors for cleaning the shops, under oral, month-to-month, fixed-fee contracts. Such cleaning included the washing and waxing of floors, polishing of mirrors and dusting of fixtures. This work was done at night, after the close of business, and was distinct from the incidental cleaning done during business hours by Terminal\u2019s shoe-shine, checking and \u201cbrush-boy\u201d concessionaires. The shop managers inspected the night cleaning work each morning before opening time and reported unsatisfactory results to the responsible cleaning contractor either directly or through Terminal\u2019s General Manager Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In 1960, Terminal cancelled the contracts of National House Cleaners, Inc. (\u201cNational\u201d) and Anchor Cleaning Company (\u201cAnchor\u201d), because of poor work and exorbitant prices. After two other contractors proved equally unsatisfactory, Todaro negotiated with Terminal and took over the cleaning himself under contracts similar to those of National and Anchor.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Whereas National and Anchor had used men belonging to the petitioner Union, the two replacements and Todaro were non-Union. In early March, during the course of Terminal\u2019s cancelling the contracts of National and Anchor, the petitioner Union began to protest that Terminal was depriving Union men of jobs by contracting with non-Union cleaners, and in the ensuing months attempted to persuade Terminal to resume the use of Union contractors. In a letter of August 11 to Terminal, the Union said it had heard that Terminal planned to use its own employees for the cleaning, and threatened to picket Terminal shops where Union men had been displaced. On September 6, Terminal replied that \u201ca change has been made for economic reasons\u201d and stated that cleaning employees \u201cwill be hired by a firm which is separate and distinct from our organization.\u201d The Union nevertheless began to picket Terminal at the Tishman shop on November <em>2, </em>and the Broadway shop on November 14. The picketing continued until November 28 when the Union agreed, after Terminal had filed the present secondary boycott charges with the Board, to cease for the pendency of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">At the time of the proceedings before the Trial Examiner, Todaro was the working manager of the Time and Life shop. He was also engaged in cleaning the Time and Life, Empire State, Tishman and Grand Central shops<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with a work force of two employees. The Examiner concluded that Todaro was an independent contractor for the cleaning operations and therefore the primary employer. He held the picketing illegal because an objective of the Union was to compel Terminal, the secondary employer, to cease doing business with Todaro and resume using Union cleaners, an objective proscribed by \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) of the Act. The Board adopted without change the findings and conclusions of the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">The question we face in this appeal is whether the record supports the Board\u2019s determination that Terminal was an \u201cother person\u201d than Todaro, within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) of the secondary boycott provisions of the Act, and therefore entitled to the rights of a neutral employer. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>We rely solely on the facts found by the Trial Examiner and adopted by the Board. They clearly show that Todaro was no ordinary independent contractor. He wore \u201ctwo hats,\u201d one as a regular employee of Terminal, the other as a contract cleaner of Terminal\u2019s shops. He did contract cleaning only for Terminal. The work was done exclusively on the premises of Terminal\u2019s shops. Todaro \u201coperated the business from the Time and Life Shop, where he received business mail, often used Terminal shop funds to cash checks of cleaning employees, used Terminal employment application forms when interviewing and hiring [night cleaning] employees, and procured business insurance through the Terminal insurance broker.\u201d Todaro js&amp;o had negotiated cleaning contracts on behalf of Terminal with the two unsuccessful contractors who preceded him. Part of Todaro\u2019s job as shopi manager was to inspect the night clean-/ ing and thus \u201chis control and supervisior of the cleaning employees overlappcc with his managerial duties, at least ii his own shop.\u201d Moreover, the following ^ excerpts from the Intermediate Report show that Todaro did not have an independent labor policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">The record shows that, after the Union began picketing, Todaro and Bauman [Terminal\u2019s president] conferred and agreed on a course of procedure vis-a-vis the Union which depended upon the effect of the picketing on the Terminal business * * *. This was agreement on a common labor policy * * *. I think it was largely dictated by Bauman * * *. [H]e outlined and controlled the strategy * * <em>*. </em>Although Todaro testified that he was still willing to sign up with the Union, but had not done so because he did not have enough cleaning work to make it feasible, I am satisfied that the \u201cfeasibility\u201d of that step was controlled largely by Terminal\u2019s decision whether it would be willing to adjust Todaro\u2019s contract to take care of the added expense of operating under a union contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">Arrangements of the type here disclosed must be scrutiniz\u00e9d by the Board with great care, because of the danger that they may be used by the real parties in interest as a device to achieve insulation from union activity. In Seafarers International Union, etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 105 U.S. App.D.C. 211, 265 F.2d 585 (1959), we described the breadth of the considerations which underlie the application of \u00a7 8(b) (4) and pointed out that that provision \u201cmust be interpreted and not merely read literally.\u201d And in Local No. 24, Inter. Bro. of Teamsters, etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 105 U.S. App.D.C. 271, 276, 266 F.2d 675, 680 (1959), where we dealt specifically with \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-10\">\u201cOf course, in an area so wide as is the field of labor relations, there are many situations in which the answer to a dispute under [8(b) (4) (B) ] is easily derived by the application of such legalistic formulae as \u2018independent contractors\u2019, \u2018co-employers\u2019, or \u2018allies\u2019. But it is equally clear that there is a zone of dispute in which such formulae are useless, and the answer must be derived by applying the intent of the statute to the facts in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">The inquiry in the present case was limited to whether Todaro was an \u201cindependent contractor.\u201d We think it clear, however, that Todaro\u2019s relationship to Terminal was in the \u201czone of dispute in which such formulae are useless\u201d and that \u201capplying the intent of the statute to the facts in the case\u201d required consideration of such facts as, for example, the history of Todaro\u2019s relationship to Terminal; the conduct of his cleaning business and its relation to Terminal\u2019s business; and Terminal\u2019s influence on, if not control over, Todaro\u2019s labor policy. In our view, these facts make inescapable the conclusion that Terminal was not a neutral within the meaning of the statute. The order of the Board must there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>fore be set aside and the petition for enforcement denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZd\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">WILBUR K.

Like other barbers and manicurists in Terminal\u2019s Manhattan shops, he was a member of Local 760, Journeymen Barbers, Manicurists, Hairdressers and Cosmetologists International Union of America. As a barber he was paid at the rate fixed by that Union\u2019s collective bargaining contract with Terminal, and as working manager he received $25 a week extra to compensate him for loss of customers, commissions and tips when engaged in supervisory activities, and $10 a week extra for services as cashier of the Time and Life shop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b950-13\">.

The Union challenges the Board\u2019s action in relying on the 1960 gross volume of business at all six Terminal shops to satisfy its self-imposed jurisdictional standard for retail enterprises of ?500,-000 gross volume of business per annum. Carolina Supplies &amp; Cement Co., 122 NLRB 88 (1958). The Union argues that the Board\u2019s statement in McAllister Transfer, 110 NLRB 1769, 1771-72 (1954), that it \u201cwill take into consideration * * * the operations of any secondary employers to the extent that the latter are affected by the conduct involved,\u201d limits computation of the jurisdictional amount to the gross volume of business of only the two Terminal shops actually picketed. We cannot say that the Board was arbitrary in including, for purposes of jurisdictional amount, the gross volume of the four shops not picketed, on the theory that they were \u201caffected\u201d by the dispute in that they were at least potentially if not directly involved.
