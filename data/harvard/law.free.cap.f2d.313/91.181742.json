Respondent-plaintiff, Teter, contends that the petition was not filed within the required 10 days from the entry of the order attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">Appeals from interlocutory orders in civil cases are permitted by \u00a7 1292(b) when a district judge in making an order states in writing that \u201csuch order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d The allowance of such appeals is discretionary with the Court of Appeals. Application to- the Court of Appeals must be made \u201cwithin ten days after the entry of the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-23\">The order on the motions was entered September 7, 1962, and did not contain the statement which the statute makes prerequisite to an appeal. On Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ber 18, 1962, Houston moved that the order be modified so as . to include this statement. The court on October 3,1962, entered a supplemental order containing the statement. On October 12, 1962, Houston filed in this court its application for permission to appeal from the interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The question is whether the 10-day limitation runs from September 7, the date of the original order, or from October 3, the date of the supplemental order. If the latter date controls, the appeal is timely; otherwise it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The circuits are split on the issue presented. The Third Circuit held in Milbert v. Bison Laboratories, 3 Cir., 260 F.2d 431, that a motion to amend an order to include the statement required by \u00a7 1292(b) must be made within the 10-day period provided by Rule 59(e), F.R. Civ.P.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and if not so made the time for application to the Court of Appeals is not tolled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Second Circuit has held that the time runs from the entry of the order containing the statement required by \u00a7 1292(b) rather than from the entry of the order so supplemented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit has assumed without discussion that the time runs from the order containing the \u00a7 1292(b) statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 1292(b) shows a congressional intent to protect against delays.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Third Circuit decision furthers that intent but presents procedural difficulties which we find insurmountable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">Rule 73(a) tolls the time for taking art appeal when timely motions are made under Rules 52(b) and 59. The material provisions of these rules apply to the\u2019 amendment of a \u201cjudgment.\u201d Rule 54? (a) defines \u201cjudgment\u201d to include \u201c * *\" any order from which an appeal lies.\u201d\" The original order was not a judgment because it was not appealable and, as it\u2019 was not a judgment, Rules 52(b) and\" 59(e) do not apply. Rule 60(b) has no-effect as it covers relief from a \u201cfinal judgment, order, or proceeding,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and' the original order here was interlocutory rather than final.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">No rule of which we are aware limits\u2019 the plenary power of a federal district-court which has made an interlocutory order to grant such relief from that: order as justice requires while the case: is pending before it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the-trial court had the power to supplement\u2019 the original order to include the \u00a7 3)292) (b) statement. When it did so, the- order became appealable and the appeal time' ran from the entry of the supplemental order. Otherwise the entry of the supplemental order is meaningless.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We-hold that the application was made within time.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-18\">Before MURRAH, PICKETT, LEWIS',.

Circuit Judges.</p>\n<author id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">We find that the interlocutory order from which the appeal is sought determines questions relating to service of process, jurisdiction, and venue; that there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and that an immediate appeal may materially advance the termination of the litigation. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">. Rule 59(e) provides: \u201cA motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\u201d Rule 6(b) provides that the time for taking any action under Rule 59(e) may not be extended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">.
