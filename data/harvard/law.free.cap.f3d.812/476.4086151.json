In his petition, Robinson challenged the sentence imposed following his conviction in 1998- in the Eastern District, of Missouri of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Robinson contends that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-21\">We have construed Robinson\u2019s motion as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal has not been brought, in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-22\">Section 2255 provides \u201cthe primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2241, on' the other hand, is used to challenge \u201cthe manner in which a sentence is executed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A petition filed under \u00a7 2241 that raises errors that occurred at or prior to sentencing should be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 877-78. However, under the savings clause, a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>erally imposed sentence may be entertained if the petitioner shows that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Robinson has the burden of showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002). He must show that his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim[s] should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); see <em>also Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Robinson wishes to challenge the legality of his sentence based on the reasoning of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <em>Al-leyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013); and <em>Persaud v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1023, 188 L.Ed.2d 117 (2014). His invocation of <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Alleyne, </em>is predicated on his contention that <em>Persaud </em>announced a change in the law. <em>Persaud </em>was not a substantive decision and, therefore, does not support Robinson\u2019s contention that the particular sentencing errors he complains of are amenable to \u00a7 2241 relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24; <em>see also </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
