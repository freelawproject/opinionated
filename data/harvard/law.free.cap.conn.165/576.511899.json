The defendant board\u2019s vote stated that \u201ca hardship exists and can be alleviated by the granting of a variance without materially impairing the effect of the Zoning Regulations.\u201d What particular hardship the board found to exist was neither specified nor suggested in its vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The record is devoid of any evidence to support a finding that there existed any unnecessary hardship or practical difficulties peculiarly affecting the premises in question. Proof of the existence of such a hardship is a condition precedent to the granting of such variances as were granted by the defendant board. <em>Berlani </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>160 Conn. 166, 276 A.2d 780; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 141, 215 A.2d 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
