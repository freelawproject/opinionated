The original complaint named as defendants Viola L. Surowiec and Thomas H. Skirm. The record does not disclose the capacity in which they were sued. The judgment recites, however, that subsequently two separate substituted complaints were filed, and that on October 15, 1971, the court ordered that the Windsor board of education, James Hagen, Paul Altermatt, William J. Sanders, Norine F. Kennedy, Frank L. Metcalf and Robert I. Berdon \u201cbe substituted as party defendants in place of Viola L. Surowiec and Thomas H. Skirm.\u201d These named individuals, substituted as defendants, thereupon moved that the cause be erased from the docket on the grounds that Berdon was treasurer of the state of Connecticut, that the others were members of the state teachers\u2019 retirement board, and that the action was against the state of Connecticut since these individuals were being sued for actions taken while acting in their official capacity as officers of the state and it did not appear that the state had expressly consented to or authorized the action. The court granted the motion and, as the judgment recites, ordered that the action be erased as to these specifically named individuals only. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The confusion apparent in the record is indicated by the language of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, which was taken \u201cto the supreme court of errors [sic] from the decision of the court granting the intervenors\u2019 motion to erase and plea in abatement.\u201d Since the record discloses no plea in abatement, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the judgment indicates that the parties who moved to erase were not intervenors as additional parties but \u201csubstituted as party defendants in place of\u201d the original defendants, we must decide the appeal on the record and judgment as presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On the record it appears that the motion to erase was properly filed; Practice Book \u00a7 94; <em>Perrys, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury Redevelopment Agency, </em>157 Conn. 122, 123, 249 A.2d 256; and was properly granted. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 298, 294 A.2d 290; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Parizek, </em>158 Conn. 304, 306, 259 A.2d 642; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Argraves, </em>146 Conn. 316, 319, 150 A.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
