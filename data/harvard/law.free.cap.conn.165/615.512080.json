That statute does not allow recourse to the courts unless the requirements of Chapter 568 of the General Statutes have been met.\u201d Chapter 568 is the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the sole issue thus raised is whether the court erred in ruling that the plaintiff had no recourse to the courts under \u00a7 7-433c unless the requirements of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act first had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The plaintiff, in arguing that the statute does not require proceedings under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and that it sets up a new, independent procedural avenue for claims of this type, cites its legislative history and the frustrations resulting from the treatment given by the compensation commissioners and, upon appeal, by the courts, to the statutory predecessors of \u00a7 7-433c. Particular reference is made by the plaintiff to Public Act No. 380, \u00a7 1, of the Public Acts of 1969, formerly \u00a7 7-433a, which this court declared unconstitutional in <em>Ducharme </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>161 Conn. 135, 285 A.2d 318, on the ground that the conclusive presumption created by the statute contravened the due process clauses of both the Connecticut and the United States constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Nothing, however, in its legislative history or in its statement of purpose, as cited by the plaintiff, persuades us that \u00a7 7-433c was intended by the legislature to require each municipality in Connecticut to create separate administrative machinery duplicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ing that already available under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for resolving claims by firemen and policemen and further to burden by additional litigation of such claims the courts as well as the municipalities. The statute specifically mentions the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in two places which, when read together, clearly provide in pertinent part that \u201c [n] otwithstanding any provision of chapter 568 ... he or his dependents . . . shall receive from his municipal employer compensation <em>... in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under chapter 568 . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The only procedural avenue mentioned for bringing claims is chapter 568, which outlines clearly the procedure to be followed by claimants for workmen\u2019s compensation before recourse to the courts is available. See <em>Ranta </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corporation, </em>271 F. Sup. 286, 287 (D. Conn.); <em>Pallanck </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>105 Conn. 591, 595, 136 A. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly sustained the defendant\u2019s demurrer on the first ground, as stated above, and since this conclusion is dispositive of the issue raised, it is not necessary to discuss the constitutional questions alternatively raised in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
