Scalo be required to transfer to the plaintiff certain shares of capital stock issued by the defendant corporation. The complaint, in the first count, alleged a dispute between the plaintiff and Scalo regarding certain capital stock issued by the defendant corporation. The second count alleged in part that the plaintiff is the owner of one-third of the corporation\u2019s outstanding shares of stock and that the principal asset of the corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>tion is a parcel of real estate situated in the town of Westport. A lis pendens was subsequently caused to be recorded on the Westport land records by the plaintiff affecting the above mentioned real estate. The defendant corporation, on January 23, 1973, made a motion to the court for \u201can order directing immediate cancellation\u201d of the lis pendens. On February 2, 1973, the court granted the motion. From this action the plaintiff has appealed. The plaintiff assigns as error the conclusion of the court (1) that the action brought by the plaintiff is not one intended to affect real estate and (2) its order directing the plaintiff to cancel the lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The issue dispositive of this appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion to cancel lis pendens\u201d which was filed by the plaintiff, for the reason that there is no statutory authority which permits such procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201cThe statutory authority under which a party to a cause of action intended to affect real estate may record in the office of the town clerk of the town where the property is situated a notice of the pend-ency of the action is \u00a7 52-325.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ravitch </em>v. <em>Stollman Poultry Farms, Inc., </em>162 Conn. 26, 30, 291 A.2d 213. The plaintiff in his brief argues that the \u201cfiling of a petition for winding up a corporation as in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>case here can drastically affect the status of the real estate owned by the corporation. The lis pendens filed on the land records simply put bona fide third parties on notice that the action was brought seeking such a dissolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In <em>Longstaff </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>66 Conn. 350, 34 A. 91, an application was made by a partner and granted by a judge of the Superior Court for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the partnership assets which included real estate. Certain creditors of the partnership sought to be made parties claiming that neither the receiver nor the applicant seeking the appointment of a receiver filed notice of the pendency of the action with the town clerk and that the appointment of the receiver was illegal. The court stated (pp. 358-59) as follows: \u201cUnder this statute [\u00a7 947, Rev. 1888, and now \u00a7 52-325] notice is required to be filed only in \u2018actions intended to affect real estate\u2019; and we do not think the application for the appointment of a receiver, in eases like the present, is an action intended to affect real estate, within the meaning of the statute. The action contemplated by the statute is one whose object and purpose is to determine the title or the rights of the parties in, to, or over some particular real estate, which is the subject-matter of the action. It prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ably includes all actions which involve and determine, as between the parties, the title to a specific tract of land, or which are brought to establish any estate, interest, or right of the parties in, to or over the real estate described in the complaint, or to enforce any lien, charge or incumbrance upon said real estate. The application in question was clearly not an action of this kind. Its subject-matter was not any specific real estate, concerning their title to which, or their rights in which the copartners were in dispute; it did not ask the court to determine any such title or rights . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In the present ease, the action clearly is not \u201cintended to affect real estate\u201d and only if it did does \u00a7 52-325 permit the filing of a lis pendens. Here, the action as brought does not seek a determination of the title or the rights of the parties as regards the real estate owned by the defendant corporation. Under these circumstances, the defendant corporation would be entitled to have the lis pendens discharged but only as provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The plaintiff makes the claim that the appropriate method of having the lis pendens declared invalid is by petition brought to the Superior Court under \u00a749-13. This statute is entitled \u201cPetition for discharge of mortgages or of ineffective attachment, lis pendens or lien. Damages.\u201d Subsection (c) thereof provides that when record title is encumbered by a lis pendens which \u201chas become of no effect,\u201d the owner of the property may bring a petition in the Superior Court seeking a judgment declaring the lis pendens invalid as a lien against such real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Here, as in <em>Ravitch </em>v. <em>Stollman Poultry Farms, Inc., </em>supra, we need not pass on the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the court proceeded correctly in entertaining the corporate defendant\u2019s motion, for this appeal may be determined on the narrower issue of whether the granting of the motion canceling the lis pendens was grounded on permissible considerations. As we stated in the <em>Bavitch </em>ease at page 33, the legislature has confined the conditions for the release of a lis pendens to those set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-322, 52-324 and49-13 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Section 49-13 (b) (now \u00a749-13 [c]) of the General Statutes, applicable to the present ease, provides in pertinent part that when record title is encumbered by a lis pendens which \u201chas become of no effect,\u201d the owner of the property may bring a petition to the Superior Court within the county in which the property is situated and, after proper notice and hearing, \u201cif such court finds the ... lis pendens . . . has become of no effect, the court may render a judgment reciting the facts and its findings in relation thereto and declaring such ... lis pendens . . . invalid as a lien against such real estate, which judgment shall ... be recorded in the land records of the town in which such property is situated . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Here, the court, in granting the motion of the defendant corporation \u201cto cancel lis pendens,\u201d could not act summarily on the motion presented to it. The lis pendens could only be released as authorized by statute. The claim made in the motion \u201cthat no authority appears in any statute authorizing recording of same in an action of this type\u201d may have merit in view of <em>Longstaff </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>supra, and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>doubt may be utilized in seeking the discharge of the lis pendens, but the procedure used by the defendant here in seeking to have the lis pendens discharged and the granting by the court of the defendant\u2019s motion does not meet the essential conditions prescribed by \u00a7 49-13 (b) (now \u00a7 49-13 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">There is error and the order granting the \u201cmotion to cancel lis pendens\u201d is hereby set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 52-325. lis pendens.
