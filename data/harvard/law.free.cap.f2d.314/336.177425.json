Furthermore, the testimony was offered for the purpose of contradicting a statement by a witness for the prosecution, made without objection, going to a collateral matter and there was no abuse of discretion in the ruling of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
