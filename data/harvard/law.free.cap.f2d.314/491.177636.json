He renewed and repaired old dentures and made new ones from old ones. He also sold \u201cFitTite,\u201d a paste substance for use of his customers. In response to defendant\u2019s advertisement, Burke and Gray, residents of Michigan and Illinois, respectively, ordered and were sent tubes of Fit-Tite with instructions for its use. They used the Fit-Tite as instructed and mailed their old dentures to defendant for construction of new ones. The dentures were sent by defendant to the Spencer Dental Laboratory and when the work on them was done defendant mailed the dentures to Burke and Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Since the sentence imposed is general as to Counts 1 and 3, and is within the limit of the punishment authorized for either Count, a valid conviction on either is sufficient to support the judgment, United States v. Karavias, 170 F.2d 968, 971 (7th Cir., 1948). Because we find no error in the judgment of conviction on Count 1, we shall not discuss Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">The Government\u2019s burden was to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the essential allegations of Count 1: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (a) the taking by Burke of an impression of his mouth and that he was unauthorized to practice dentistry in Michigan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (b) the \u201cconstruction\u201d by defendant of the denture from that impression, and (c) the mailing by defendant of the constructed denture from Chicago into Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">Defendant concedes that under Michigan law, the taking of an impression of teeth is the practice of dentistry and that Burke was not licensed to practice dentistry. But he argues that the Michigan statute could not constitutionally prohibit Burke from performing upon himself what would be the practice of dentistry if performed by him upon another; and that consequently Burke was not engaged in practicing dentistry when he took the impression of his own mouth. Defendant relies upon United States v. Johnson, 323 U.S. 273, 65 S.Ct. 249, 89 L.Ed. 236 (1944) and United States v. Johnson, 149 F.2d 53 (7th Cir., 1945), cert. denied, 326 U.S. 722, 66 S.Ct. 28, 90 L.Ed. 428 (1945). Both cases are authority for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\"> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 does not prohibit Burke from taking an impression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of his own mouth. It prohibits the mailing of dentures made from impressions taken by unauthorized persons into any state, like Michigan, seeking \u201cto protect their citizenry from the lay public\u2019s practice of dentistry,\u201d and the section is a cooperative endeavor to bolster state policy. United States v. Johnson, 149 F.2d 53, 54 (7th Cir., 1945).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cSuch legislation is constitutionally unchallengeable.\u201d Id. at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">This court, in Johnson, affirmed a defendant\u2019s conviction against the very argument made here about Burke\u2019s freedom to take the impression of his own mouth. Defendant, not Burke, is being prosecuted and we are not concerned here with whether Burke could be successfully prosecuted in Michigan for taking the impression. We are concerned only with defendant\u2019s mailing into Michigan the denture made from the \u201cimpression\u201d taken by Burke, where Burke\u2019s conduct was unauthorized by Michigan law. Burke\u2019s conduct is a link in the chain of events culminating in the offense defined in \u00a7 1821. The Michigan statute enters into the definition of the offense only for the purpose of identifying a state into which dentures may not be mailed. United States v. Patterson, 155 F.Supp. 669, 673 (N.D.Ill.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">There is no merit in the contention that the Government failed to sustain its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Burke took an impression of his mouth. It was not necessary that he take an impression as a dentist would.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, it is because these self-taken impressions would not be acceptable to licensed dentists that the states, having an interest in skilled dentistry as a necessary aid to the health of their citizens, proscribe the practice of laymen taking impressions. United States v. Johnson, 149 F.2d 53, 54 (7th Cir., 1945). It was enough for the Government to prove that what Burke said he did with Fit-Tite and his denture was taking an impression; and that the result of what he did, alteration of his old denture by adding Fit-Tite, was the basis of the \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cbetter fitting\u201d denture defendant constructed for him through Spencer Laboratory. The Federal Government could not further the state policy if it were necessary to prove that the impressions made by laymen were \u201cimpressions in the dental sense.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">There is no merit either in the claim of error in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the hypothetical question put to the Government\u2019s expert. We think there is sufficient evidence of the plastic quality of Fit-Tite, in defendant\u2019s instructions to customers,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which formed part of the question, to justify the ruling, which was well within the discretion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Finally, we see no prejudicial error in the cross-examination of defendant about his use of a fictitious name in operating his business. This was some evidence that he knew he should not be doing what was done, and was admissible, in the court\u2019s discretion, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>show guilty knowledge. That it and other assumed names were used by him in other businesses may have suggested fraud, but was nevertheless not error. United States v. Iacullo, 226 F.2d 788, 793 (7th Cir., 1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 966, 76 S.Ct. 435, 100 L.Ed. 839 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We have passed on all the points raised that are necessary for this decision, and find no error. For the reasons given, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 provides, in part, as follows: \u201cWhoever * * * uses the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of sending- or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>bringing into any State or Territory any set of artificial teeth or prosthetic dental appliance or other denture, constructed from any cast or impression made by any person other than, or without the authorization or prescription of, a person licensed to practice dentistry under the laws of the place into which such denture is sent or brought, where such laws prohibit; (1) the taking of impressions or casts of the human mouth or teeth by a person not licensed under such laws to practice dentistry; * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">.
