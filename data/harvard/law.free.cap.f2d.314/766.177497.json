The trial court granted leave to file the petition in forma pauperis, but summarily overruled the same on the grounds that the files and records conclusively showed that he was not entitled to any relief. We granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis and brought the case here on the trial record. Appointed counsel filed a brief supplementing the one filed by the petitioner, and orally argued the points submitted therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-24\">Upon examination of the record, we are convinced that the appeal is wholly without merit, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
