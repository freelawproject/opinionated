By its motion for summary judgment, subsequently filed, appellee recognized that \u201cthe complaint (was) based upon a claim founded upon an alleged life insurance policy issued by (it) to the plaintiffs\u2019 (appellants\u2019) assured.\u201d It further stated therein: \u201cThe fact is that no such policy was ever issued by the defendant nor delivered to the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged insured, Rose DeClue.\u201d It was also alleged in that motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-24\">\u201cThe relevant facts are disclosed by the answers to plaintiffs' interrogatories answered under oath by the Regional Director of Agencies of defendant, a copy of which is attached hereto in support hereof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>These facts demonstrate that the policy application was never acted upon by the defendant pending receipt of a physical examination to be taken by the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">\u201cThe application for the insurance, a copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated herein, demonstrates that the policy could not in any event take effect until the completion of a medical examination <em>(if </em>required); that <em>a physical examination was required, </em>and that the <em>plaintiffs were so informed </em>by the agent soliciting the policy, as appears from the sworn answers to the interrogatories. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201cThere appears to be no dispute as to the basic facts in the case, and there is no substantial issue as to the facts, and under them <em>plaintiffs are not entitled to recover more than the return of premium </em>tendered to them by deposit in court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">From the record here, it appears that the basic issue raised by appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was whether or not a \u201cpolicy was ever issued or delivered by (appellee) to Rose DeClue or ever became effective because the policy for which application was made was contingent upon and could not take effect until the completion of a medical examination, to which the proposed insured, Rose DeClue, never submitted * * As to that matter, appellee contends there was no genuine issue of material fact existing, and that it sustained the burden of proof cast upon it to demonstrate that fact. But it appears that the \u201canswers to plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories,\u201d relied on by appellee, were made \u201cunder oath by the Regional Director of Agencies of defendant * * * according to his best knowledge and belief.\u201d That being so, the answers to plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories are insufficient to sustain the burden of proof cast upon appellee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">\u201cOn a motion for a summary judgment the burden of establishing the nonexistence of any genuine issue of fact is upon the moving party, all doubts are resolved against him, and his supporting affidavits and depositions, if any, are carefully scrutinized by the court. The object of the motion is to separate the formal from the substantial issues raised by the pleadings, and the court examines evidence on the motion, not to decide any issue of fact which may be presented, but to discover if any real issue exists. * * * When affidavits are offered in support of a motion for summary judgment, they must present admissible evidence, and must not only be made on the personal knowledge of the affiant, but must show that the affiant possesses the knowledge asserted.\u201d Sprague v. Vogt et al., 150 F.2d 795, 800 (8 Cir., 1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Such has been the position steadfastly maintained by this Court in respect to motions for summary judgment under Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A. Cf. United Pacific Insurance Company v. United States, 296 F.2d 160 (8 Cir., 1961), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">As above noted, appellee by its motion for summary judgment recognized that a factual issue was presented by the pleadings (1) as to whether appellee ever acted upon the application for insurance; and (2) whether a \u201cphysical examination was required\u201d before the policy providing such insurance coverage could \u201cin any event take effect until the completion of a medical examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">It is admitted that the deceased, who made application for the policy of insurance sued on, paid the first year\u2019s premium therefor; and that she was given a \u201cconditional receipt\u201d reading, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">\u201cThe insurance for which application is made shall be effective on the date of this receipt or the date of completion of the medical examination (if required) whichever is later * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>From the deposition of appellee\u2019s \u201cAssistant Manager, Ordinary Underwriting Division\u201d the following facts appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">\u201cQ. Does your company write a policy where a physical examination is not required?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cQ. The policy that is finally issued on such application, is there any difference in the policy than that where a physical examination is required?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cQ. Does it act the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">\u201cQ. Who is it that determines when a physical examination is to be made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">\u201cA. The underwriter. Let me qualify that. The field force can determine that from our rules and regulations, on non-medical and medical parts. If it is not followed through, then we go ahead and determine if an examination is required or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">\u201cQ. Are these rules and regulations you refer to oral or written ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">\u201cA. They are written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-14\">\u201cQ. Are they furnished to all of your field representatives ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-16\">\u201cQ. Are you familiar enough with the company\u2019s procedure to know whether or not back in July 1960 the Festus office, which consisted of S. L. Finney and C. S. Stevens, whether or not they were furnished those rules and regulations ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-17\">\u201cA. They were.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">It is further established that the application for the policy of insurance in question was signed by the named insured and witnessed by Finney and Stevens, agents of the Festus, Missouri, office of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-21\">Hence, from the foregoing, it clearly appears that the rules and regulations of appellee referred to and compliance therewith by appellee\u2019s agents in their negotiations with the named insured were issues subject to evidentiary proof. There is no competent evidence appearing in the record here regarding that matter. Manifestly, under the facts above stated, an issue was presented as to whether the policy of insurance applied for was a medical or nonmedical' policy. That \u201cplaintiffs\u201d (appellants) were informed by appellee that \u201ca physical examination was required before such policy would become effective\u201d is of no moment. What dealings appellee\u2019s agents had with the named insured who signed the application for such insurance, their compliance with the rules and regulations of appellee, and appellee\u2019s subsequent acts in relation to the application for insurance, are factual issues, subject to proof, which very apparently could not have been determined on motion for summary judgment. Cf. Wolters v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, 296 F.2d 140 (8 Cir., 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-22\">For the above reasons alone, the judgment of the District Court must be reversed. We do not mean it to be understood that such are the only factual issues which could not be determined on motion for summary judgment on the record before us. Seemingly, there are other factual issues, but we need not demonstrate them here. They should become obvious to Court and Counsel at the trial of this case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-23\">The judgment appealed is reversed and this cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
