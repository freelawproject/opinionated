It asserted that such use of that name was an infringement of a trademark \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d used on Scotch whisky manufactured abroad by James Buchanan &amp; Company, here called Buchanan, and imported and sold by Fleischmann in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-20\">Jurisdiction in the court below was invoked by reason of the diversity of citizenship of the parties with the requisite amount in controversy, and also on the ground that it \u201carises under Acts of Congress relating to trademarks, [citing the Acts of February 20, 1905, and of July 5, 1946, hereafter referred to], and also asserts a related claim of unfair competition.\u201d Subsequently Buchanan filed a complaint in intervention against the same defendants adopting and incorporating therein Fleischmann\u2019s complaint and joining with Fleischmann in the prayer for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-21\">Fleischmann and Buchanan, together will be referred to herein as plaintiffs. After trial to the Judge, sitting without a jury, the court below entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law and a judgment finding generally for the defendants and against the plaintiffs, dismissing the action and awarding the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>fendants their costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">As the trial Judge noted in his opinion, the record presents no basic dispute as to the facts. Buchanan and its predecessor have blended and sold Scotch whisky under the name \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d since before the turn of the century, and have marketed the product in the United States -under that name for more than 50 years. Buchanan registered the name as its trademark for Scotch whisky in the United States Patent Office in 1908, and in California in 1911. The federal registration was renewed under the Act of 1946 in 1948. Fleischmann has been the sole importer of Black &amp; White whisky in the United States since 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">With respect to this Scotch whisky the trial court found as follows: \u201c8. \u2018Black &amp; White\u2019 Scotch whisky is a widely known Scotch whisky. It is the leader among Scotch whiskies. Its sales have exceeded one hundred million bottles during the tenure of Fleischmann and more than five hundred thousand cases have been sold in the six year period between 1951 and 1957, in California, more than half of which were sold in Los Angeles County where Ralphs does business. In the alcoholic beverage industry the name \u2018Black &amp; White\u2019 has come to mean Scotch whisky.\u201d During the six year period mentioned, the plaintiffs expended more than five million dollars in advertising their Black &amp; White Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Maier is a brewing company in Los Angeles, and Ralphs owns and operates a chain of grocery stores in that area. Maier brews a low price beer which it sells under a variety of different labels. In the summer of 1956, Ralphs was seeking to obtain an inexpensive beer for sale in its chain of stores under a label for Ralphs\u2019 exclusive use. The upshot was that Maier sold beer to Ralphs through a wholesaler under the label Black &amp; White. In December, 1957, Maier was notified by attorneys for Buchanan that they considered Maier\u2019s use of the Black &amp; White name a trademark infringement and unfair competition. Maier was asked to discontinue using the name. A similar notice was sent to Ralphs the following May. These demands were refused and this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Among the findings from which the trial court drew its conclusion that plaintiffs had not made a case against the defendants was Finding No. 28 as follows: \u201c28. There is no real competition between plaintiffs\u2019 Scotch whisky and defendants\u2019 beer. This lack of real competition renders it unlikely that there is, or will be, any confusion as to source in the mind of a buyer.\u201d This finding seems to suggest that Buchanan, as owner of a registered trademark, would be foreclosed from recovery if there was no real competition between plaintiffs\u2019 Scotch whisky and the beer. We think this finding indicates a misconception of the law here applicable, and of the significance of lack of competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">The earlier trademark Act, that of 1905 (33 Stat. 724 et seq.), provided that a right of action to suppress an infringement of a registered mark arose only if the infringement was used on \u201cgoods of the same descriptive properties\u201d as the registrant\u2019s goods. However, the Lanham Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 427, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq.) made plain that infringement might be found and prohibited, though the use of the registered mark was upon goods having different descriptive properties than those set forth in the registration, and though in consequence there was no actual competition between the parties. This Act prohibits use without the registrant\u2019s consent \u201cof any registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods or services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Thus the question to be determined here is whether the use by Maier and Ralphs of the name \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d on their beer \u201cis likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the source of origin of such goods or services.\u201d Before we examine the evidence here for the purpose of answering that question we must consider whether it is our function as an appellate court to furnish such an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Numerous cases in this and other circuits hold that under the circumstances here present, the question of the likelihood of confusion is one for us to decide. In Sleeper Lounge Company v. Bell Manufacturing Co., 9 Cir., 253 F.2d 720, 723, this court quoted with approval the quotation in Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy <em>&amp; </em>Co., 2 Cir., 199 F.2d 602, that \u201cwe are in as good a position as the trial judge to determine the probability of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">One reason for applying the rule of that case and of the other cases in accord cited in the margin<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is that this determination of likelihood of confusion partakes more of the character of a conclusion of law than of a finding of fact. The inference to be drawn from the undisputed facts here are \u201cderived from application of a legal standard.\u201d Lundgren v. Freeman, 9 Cir., 307 F.2d 104, 115.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant asserts that this function of determining the likelihood of confusion is for us, and this has not been challenged by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">We proceed then to the inquiry whether under the circumstances here shown the-use of the name Black &amp; White on defendants\u2019 beer is likely to cause confusion as to the source of origin. Another finding of the trial court which may tend' to explain the conclusion arrived at is-Finding 22 as follows: \u201c22. Scotch whisky and beer, although both containing alcohol, are goods of distinctly different properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">For the reasons previously noted this-finding is of no assistance in determining te question of likelihood of confusion. The Lanham Act has done away with the-old concept of \u201cgoods of the same descriptive properties.\u201d We think that the-trial court failed fully to appreciate this-effect as is evidenced by the fact that in the court\u2019s opinion which accompanied' its findings, reliance was made upon certain court decisions all of which antedated the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">In support of its contention that the-use of a name on unlike goods may be-enjoined, plaintiffs have cited here a substantial number of cases illustrating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that proposition.<footnotemark>2a</footnotemark> The defendants do not undertake to question those decisions but contend that they cannot be applied here because the mark \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d belonging to the plaintiffs is not a distinctive or \u201cstrong\u201d mark since the same name has been used on a great multitude of other products and for a variety of goods and services, and that as a result plaintiffs\u2019 trademark has been diluted and has lost its original distinctiveness and serves no purpose of pointing to goods from a single <em>source.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The defendants produced evidence showing that the name Black &amp; White had been applied and used by producers or dealers in a large number of different products. These included medicines, cosmetics, coffee, candy, bags, fountain pens, sheet music, hoof-rot remedy, corn meal, flour, soap, pencils, ginger ale, cotton prints, canned goods, and tobacco. Many of these marks were registered in the Patent Office and elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The record shows, however, that the name Black &amp; White has never been registered in the United States Patent Office for any alcoholic beverage other than Buchanan\u2019s Scotch whisky. In 1935, the St. Claire Brewing Co. of San Jose, California, began using the name Black &amp; White as a trademark for bottled beer and had registered the mark for use on</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">beer with the Secretary of State of the State of California. In 1936, National Distillers, which was then the sole importer in the United States of Buchanan\u2019s whisky, learned of St. Claire\u2019s use and in August, 1936, the St. Claire Brewing Company was notified on behalf of the American agents for Buchanan that the latter considered that St. Claire was infringing Buchanan\u2019s mark, and St. Claire was called upon to withdraw the Black &amp; White beer from the market. In response St. Claire stated that it did not sell whisky or other beverages of that kind but used the Black &amp; White label for beer and after calling attention <em>to the </em>other registrations of the name for coffee, flour, fruits, vegetables, medicines, etc., it disclaimed any infringement in view of the common use of Black &amp; White and the wide difference between Scotch whisky and lager beer. At that time suit against St. Claire was threatened but none was taken as St. Claire got into financial difficulties, went into the hands of its creditors, and ceased to use the name in 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">We think the record shows and the findings confirm that Buchanan had a trademark valid both at common law and under the applicable federal acts. If it be proper to speak of trademarks as being \u201cstrong\u201d marks or \u201cweak\" marks,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Buchanan\u2019s mark was assuredly a strong one. As used here, Buchanan\u2019s \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d is not a descriptive term, nor does it indicate anything that has the qualities of black and white. That which is black is something \u201cso dark as to have no distinguishable color\u201d; white is descriptive of something \u201cof the color of pure snow; reflecting to the eye all the rays of the spectrum combined; \u2014 the opposite of black or dark.\u201d The mark used here has no such connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Paraphrasing what we said of the trademark \u201cDutch Boy\u201d in National Lead Company v. Wolfe, 9 Cir., 223 F.2d 195, 199, we can say that the trademark Black &amp; White is not used \u201cotherwise than in a fictitious, arbitrary and fanciful manner.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was recognized in the findings of the trial court where in Finding 8, which we have quoted above, it was stated: \u201cIn the alcoholic beverage industry the name \u2018Black &amp; White\u2019 has come to mean Scotch whisky\u201d. This can have no meaning other than that it has acquired an arbitrary, fanciful, and secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The statement just quoted from Finding 8 has one corollary which necessarily follows from it, and which may be properly added to it; \u2014 the Scotch whisky, which the name Black &amp; White has come to mean, is Buchanan\u2019s Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">It is obvious that in approaching the question which is before us, as to whether the defendants\u2019 use of the name Black &amp; White on their beer is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods, we must recognize that the use of the name Black &amp; White in connection with some wholly unrelated products, goods or services, cannot possibly cause confusion or mistake, or lead customers to believe that the goods or services offered had any connection with Buchanan.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Thus, defendants produced telephone directories from such cities as Boston, New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, showing the use of the name Black &amp; White by numerous firms and businesses. These disclosed Black &amp; White Gleaners and Tailors ; Black &amp; White Trucking Company; Black &amp; White Chemical Company; Black &amp; White Dinette; Black &amp; White Hatters; Black &amp; White Garage; Black &amp; White Tire Company; Black &amp; White Market; Black &amp; White Funeral Home, and others. It also appears that there was a small chain of retail liquor stores in Oakland, California, called Black &amp; White. This was noted in the court\u2019s findings, which stated that Buchanan did not know of these liquor stores until after the suit was begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">With respect to St. Claire\u2019s use of the name Black &amp; White on its beer, appellants assert that such use had become past history at the times relevant to the matters here in suit. Appellants note that the bulk of the plaintiffs\u2019 promotion of their Black &amp; White product through advertising and otherwise, which brought about its recognized standing, was after St. Claire and its beer had ceased to exist. In this connection we think that appellant is correct. In view of the short time during which St. Claire used the disputed name we cannot infer any loss of plaintiffs\u2019 right or dilution thereof through the circumstances of such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Nor do we attach any importance to the fact, reflected in the findings, that the evidence discloses that in two instances Scotch whisky and beer having no common origin have been sold by different concerns under the same names. These names were \u201cBallentine\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBlack Label\u201d. These had nothing to do with any of the parties to this suit; what the circumstances of that double use were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>does not appear. If in the past two other brewers did the same thing to other distillers as Maier is here charged with doing to Buchanan, that would constitute no defense or justification for the defendants here. Cf. National Lead Company v. Wolfe, supra, 233 F.2d at p. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">And while we recognize that a multitude of persons engaged in supplying wholly different and distinct sorts of .goods or services and using the name Black &amp; White would not be chargeable with any wrong toward Buchanan or its trademark, yet there is an area in which the use of that name by others on products that are not Scotch whisky would plainly lead to confusion and mistake of the kind prohibited by the Lanham Act. An illustration of such use would be adoption of the name Black &amp; White by a distiller of Bourbon whisky. The question which we must answer is just where the line must be drawn between the uses of Black &amp; White that would be unexceptionable and those that should be enjoined because of the likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We have noted the recital in Finding 8 that \u201cin the alcoholic beverage industry the na3ne \u2018Black &amp; White\u2019 has come to mean Scotch whisky.\u201d We have also noted that this means Buchanan\u2019s Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Of course there may not be one in a hundred buyers of this whisky who knows that it is made by Buchanan or wholesaled by Fleischmann. Probably all that such buyers know is that Black &amp; White Scotch whisky has satisfied them in the past or that they have heard of it and the average purchaser would no doubt select for the use of his guests something with which he was familiar and thus purchase Black &amp; White whisky. What are we to say about the same purchaser who starts for home on a hot evening and decides to take home beer for refreshment? He stops at Ralphs and notes beer bearing the label \u201cBlack <em>&amp; </em>White\u201d in that store\u2019s stock. We think it to be plain that the likelihood of confusion and mistake is present here and is established by the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming that the trial court\u2019s finding that it is \u201cunlikely that there is, or will be any confusion as to source in the mind of a buyer\u201d is a finding of fact and not a legal conclusion, we hold that it is clearly erroneous.'</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\"> It is our view, and we so hold, that the average purchaser, as the couirts have described him, would be likely to believe, as he noted the Black &amp; White beer in Ralphs\u2019 stores, that the maker of the beer had some connection with the concern which had produced the well known Black &amp; White Scotch whisky. It is not material whether he would think that the makers of the Scotch whisky were actually brewing and bottling this beer, or whether it was being produced under their supervision or pursuant to some other arrangement with them. He would probably not concern himself about any such detail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>In Stork Restaurant v. Sahati, 9 Cir., 166 F.2d 348, 359, this court had occasion to comment upon the fact that the ordinary purchaser has only general impressions with respect to an original product or its name. He probably does not know the name of the maker who owns the trademark. In that case we said: \u201cThe law is not made for the protection of experts, but for the public \u2014 -that vast multitude which includes the ignorant, the unthinking and the credulous, who, in making purchases, do not stop to analyze, but are governed by appearance and general impressions.\u201d It was argued there that one driving by an unpretentious night club displaying the sign \u201cStork Club\u201d in or near San Francisco would hardly assume that the place was in any way affiliated with the celebrated New York establishment. This court then went on to say (p. 359) : \u201cIt may well be true that a prudent and worldly-wise passerby would not be so deceived. The law, however, protects not only the intelligent, the experienced, and the astute. It safeguards from deception also the ignorant, the inexperienced, and the gullible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">As the trial court noted, we are dealing here with operations in the alcoholic beverage industry. It seems to us that necessarily the use on defendants\u2019 alcoholic beverage of Buchanan\u2019s trademark would be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The circumstances under which Maier began the use of this name on its beer are such as tend to confirm our conclusion as to the likelihood of confusion. A salesman who had once worked for St. Claire Brewing Company suggested the name Black &amp; White to the head of Maier. Maier had been selling its beer to sundry customers under various labels and names and was then approached by one Molner, a wholesaler, with a view to procuring a beer which he could sell at wholesale to Ralphs Grocery Company under a name reserved for Ralphs only. Maier\u2019s general sales manager testifying, described the conversation with this wholesaler as follows: \u201cAnother thing discussed was the matter of a brand name that we could make available. At that time the only label we had available that we were not using or that was not in use by someone was Black &amp; White Lager Beer, which we had one or two sample labels which Mr. Mosiman had given me some time ago of the label Black &amp; White beer. We showed them to Molner and he brought up the question of Black &amp; White beer, or, rather, the name Black &amp; White also being used for Scotch. He was told that we knew there was a Black &amp; White Scotch. It\u2019s one of the most popular brands of Scotch. But that from our check that had been made, the name Black &amp; White had been used on beer as was evidenced by the label, the sample labels we had. It was not at the present time being used for beer any place else in the United States that we could determine. We knew it was not being used in California because we had checked with the Alcohol Control Board on price postings, and also that the brand was available \u2014 the brand name was available for use on beer. That was the end of it.\u201d When asked by counsel as to what he and the head of Maier considered with reference to the fact that there might be a conflict with Black &amp; V/hite Scotch if they adopted the name Black &amp; White for beer, he testified: \u201cI knew that there was and is a brand of Scotch Black &amp; White, and I knew it was on the market. I knew it was one of the most popular brands on the market of Scotch. I could see no confliction between them\u2014 any possible confliction on the part of anybody between a can of beer on the one hand and a bottle of Scotch on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>other, as to their being interchangeable, one product to the other.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKt\">The trial court found that Maier adopted the Black &amp; White label for beer \u201cin good faith\u201d. If by this finding the court meant to say that Maier thought that under the law it had the right to use the label, no fault can be found with it. It is plain from the testimony quoted above that Maier was laboring under the same mistake of law which we have noted in the trial court\u2019s findings, namely, that since the goods had distinctly different properties, there was no real competition between whisky and beer, and hence that defendants\u2019 adoption of the label would be lawful because no confusion would be likely. But if the finding of good faith is intended to mean that defendants did not intend to adopt Buchanan\u2019s Black &amp; White name or mark for the purpose of taking advantage of the aura of good will which surrounded the name, then the finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The manager knew that the Black &amp; White Scotch \u201cwas one of the most popular brands on the market\u201d and when the wholesaler brought up the question of Black &amp; White also being used for Scotch, the manager told him that he knew there was a Black &amp; White Scotch, \u201cone of the most popular brands\u201d. Without seeking any legal advice these officers of Maier simply decided for themselves that there was no relation between Scotch whisky and beer and decided to go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">We cannot conclude but that Maier deliberately adopted the name knowing that Black &amp; White was the name and trademark of Buchanan and they must have done so with some purpose in mind.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The only possible purpose could have been to capitalize upon the popularity of the name chosen. This popularity, they must have known, would extend to their product because the public would associate the name Black &amp; White with something old and reliable and meritorious in the way of an alcoholic beverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">It is well settled that plaintiffs were not obliged in order to make a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>against the defendants to prove a wrongful intent. Safeway Stores Inc. v. Rudner, 9 Cir., 246 F.2d 826, 829. But when the evidence does show or require the inference that another\u2019s name was adopted deliberately with a view to obtain some advantage from the good will, good name, and good trade which another has built up, then the inference of likelihood of confusion is readily drawn, for the very act of the adopter has indicated that ihe expects confusion and resultant profit. American Chicle Co. v. Topps Chewing Gum, 2 Cir., 208 F.2d 560, 562; Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 199 F.2d 602, 603; National Van Lines v. Dean, 9 Cir., 237 F.2d 688, 692. As was said in the last cited case: \u201c[I]f such an intent is shown, it raises a presumption that deception and confusion resulted.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Furthermore, Maier knew, just as we do, that it had open to it a whole dictionary full of words, an encyclopedia full of proper names, and a world atlas full of place names from which to select a non-offending label. The evidence shows that at the time Maier was using no less than 21 separate names or labels.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Appellees place much reliance upon the testimony of the witness Baumgarten. He was regional vice-president of Fleisehmann. He was called to testify among other things as to the general reputation of Buchanan\u2019s Black &amp; White Scotch whisky and as to the extent of advertising campaigns to emphasize the name Black &amp; White. On cross-examination he testified: \u201cNow, is it your contention, Mr. Baumgarten, that a customer would be confused in buying a can of Black &amp; White beer put out by the Maier people that he was getting a product of Buchanan\u2019s? A. No. The only two very isolated instances, I was asked in Southern California by people who were in the business, \u2018When did you people start making beer ?\u2019 And that is, as I said, only a couple of instances that that has happened. No, my answer is no to your question.\u201d Of course this is something more than a mere expression of an opinion by a witness. Baumgarten, as a regional vice-president of Fleischmann, would appear to be a person authorized to make admissions on behalf of Fleisehmann. The question is whether this statement, which concludes with a negative answer as to whether there would be confusion of the kind we have been here discussing, was in the nature of a judicial admission such as an admission in a pleading which would operate to put the plaintiffs out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">There are decisions to the effect that a party is bound by his own testimony in the sense that the same constitutes a judicial admission so that the court is under a duty to find the facts in accordance with the testimony. Such a holding is criticized by Wigmore, (Wigmore on Evidence, 3d ed., \u00a7 2594(a)), and the California courts have agreed with Wig-more and quoted his criticism with approval. Richey v. Pedersen, 100 Cal.App. 2d 512, 519, 224 P.2d 100, 105; Weingetz v. Cheverton, 102 Cal.App.2d 67, 78, 226 P.2d 742, 749. Mr. McCormick, (McCormick On Evidence, \u00a7 243) notes that by no means is every sort of testimony of a party to be treated as a conclusive or judicial admission. Among the exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>noted are cases in which the testimony of the party is in the nature of an opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">We are not confronted with the necessity of passing upon that question here for the reason that Baumgarten, although an officer of Fleischmann, was not an officer or agent of Buchanan, and under no circumstances could his testimony be binding upon it. Even if we were to go so far as to assume because of Baumgarten\u2019s testimony that Fleischmann could get no relief here that would not affect Buchanan\u2019s rights on this appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">When a newcomer takes the name Black &amp; White and makes a use of it on a product which in the mind of the buyer is related to or associated with the product of the original trademark owner, we think it may be said that confusion as to the source of origin is likely to result. The use need not be the same as, nor one in competition with the original use. The question is, are the uses related so-that they are likely to be connected in the mind of a prospective purchaser?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">This is a test which was early applied by the Second Circuit in a somewhat similar case. That court was one of those which prior to the Lanham Act gave to the 1905 Act a liberal construction which anticipated the changes that were written into the Lanham Act to which we have previously alluded.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That case was Aunt Jemima Co. v. Rigney &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 407, 409.<footnotemark>14a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">We think it must be said here, as in the Aunt Jemima case, supra, that beer and Scotch whisky, being both within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\"the alcoholic beverage industry, are \u201cso related as to fall within the mischief which equity should prevent.\u201d And, as .\u25a0suggested in the Yale Electric Corporation case, supra, we cannot hold that Maier\u2019s use is so foreign to that of Buchanan\u2019s as to insure against any identification of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">It is not incumbent upon us here to -express any opinion as to whether other uses of the name on products outside of the alcoholic beverage industry would or would not be infringement of the trademark. If the uses of the name by those who have thus registered it are so wholly \u25a0unrelated and foreign to plaintiffs\u2019 use as to insure against any possible identification of the two then those registrations .are immaterial and irrelevant here for that special reason. They could bring \u25a0about no possible dilution of the plaintiffs\u2019 trademark, for Buchanan could have done nothing about them. In any event, as we have previously indicated, the use of the name by others, whether wrongful or not, is simply immaterial to this case, as we held in Safeway Stores Inc., v. Rudner, supra, and National Lead Company v. Wolfe, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The court below, while stating that there is \u201can apparent conflict in the decisions\u201d undertook to cite in its opinion five cases which it thought supported its views.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is sufficient to say that we have carefully examined the cases thus cited and it is our opinion that they are all factually distinguishable from the case before us. It is elementary that in the decision of a case of this kind, involving the question of confusing similarity, each case must stand on its own facts, and prior decisions are of little assistance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>In addition it should be noted that the <em>decisions relied upon by </em>the trial court antedate the enactment of the Lanham Act and are distinguishable upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">This disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to consider appellants\u2019 argument that our case of Stork Restaurant v. Sahati, supra, is authority for the proposition that wholly apart from any likelihood of confusion as to the origin of a product, a trademark owner may enjoin use by another which results in dilution of the distinctiveness of the owner\u2019s mark. Since we have found likelihood of confusion here we need not consider this argument.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">And because we have found adequate legal support for our conclusion in the Lanham Act, we do not consider here the appellants\u2019 argument that the California law, statutory and decisional, compels the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We notice one conclusion of the district court (No. 13), which can have no bearing upon the decision of this case. That conclusion reads as follows: \u201c13. The \u2022defendants, by using the name \u2018Black &amp; White\u2019 on beer, have not infringed the plaintiffs\u2019 trademark rights in plaintiffs\u2019 combination mark of the words \u2018Black &amp; White\u2019 and two Seottie dogs.\u201d The facts are that Buchanan has two federal trademarks; \u2014 -one is the Black &amp; White mark which we have previously discussed, and the other, which it registered at a later date, consisted of the combination of the words \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d and a picture of a pair of Seottie dogs, one of them black and one of them white. The evidence shows that Buchanan had used both trade-marks on this whisky. The first one, \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d appears on the label on the front of the bottle; the combination trademark, \u2014 the Seottie dogs combined with the words Black &amp; White, \u2014 appear on the label on the back of the bottle. This action was brought for infringement of the first trademark using the words Black &amp; White alone. It is not alleged that the other trademark was infringed by the defendants and the fact that the Seottie dogs do not appear on defendants\u2019 beer is immaterial and irrelevant. Conclusion No. 13 is also irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The trial court found that the labels and containers used by the defendants were so distinct from those used by plaintiffs that they would not tend to deceive or confuse. Such variation as existed in the labels here is insufficient to protect the defendants against the injunction sought. An examination of the whole range of decisions in this field brings out one conclusion, \u2014 that an infringer seldom makes a Chinese copy of another\u2019s trademark, package or label. As stated in Saxlehner v. Eisner &amp; Mendelson Co., 179 U.S. 19, 33, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60, \u201cIt is not necessary to constitute an infringement that every word of a trade-mark should be appropriated. It is sufficient that enough be taken to deceive the public in the purchase of a protected article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">It is the general public, the unskilled purchaser, who is entitled to protection; and rin determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion we must remember that the members of the purchasing public have only general impressions which must guide them in the selection of products. We think that the purchaser of a carton of beer in Ralphs\u2019 grocery store would have no way of pulling from his pocket a precise copy of Buchanan\u2019s label to compare with the label on the beer. His general impression relates to the name \u201cBlack &amp; White\u201d and that is the extent of his knowledge ordinarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">We hold therefore that the court below was in error in denying the injunction prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court with directions to enter judgment in accordance with this opinion. The question of plaintiffs\u2019 right to an accounting, not having been dealt with on the previous trial, remains for decision by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\">. The manner in which this court has undertaken to exercise its function of determining for itself the question of likelihood of confusion is illustrated by the case of Safeway Stores v. Rudner, 9 Cir., 246 F.2d 826. In that case the trial court had found that there was no competition between plaintiff\u2019s retail grocery stores and defendant\u2019s retail furniture stores, and that there was no evidence of confusion between the two stores and no likelihood of confusion from the use by the defendant of the word \u201cSafeway\u201d, which had previously been the trade name of the plaintiff. Accordingly the district court denied the injunction. This court, reversing, held that the evidence showed that \u201cthere was a likelihood \u2014 a probability, if not a certainty \u2014 that, unless enjoined, appellee\u2019s use of the trade name \u2018Safeway\u2019 would greatly and irreparably damage appellant.\u201d Other cases in which this court has reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of injunction based on the trial court\u2019s finding of no likelihood of confusion are Mershon Company v. Pachmayr, 9 Cir., 220 F.2d 879; National Van Lines v. Dean, 9 Cir., 237 F.2d 688; Stork Restaurant Inc. v. Sahati, 9 Cir., 166 F.2d 348, and Audio Fidelity Inc. v.

At the time you adopted the name of Black and White for your beer, did you give any thought to the fact that that was the same name that was being used on the Buchanan whiskey? A. Well, I had the knowledge that it was a Black and White scotch. Q. Did you think about it affirmatively, give any consideration to it when you adopted this label? A. I thought of it, but I couldn\u2019t find any relation, none whatsoever between whiskey and beer. Q. Did you have any discussion on that point with anyone else? A. Possibly, just passing remark. Q. You have no definite recollection of it? A. Well, I said possibly was some comments, nothing of any importance. Q. Well, did you remember any such comment? A. Yes. I believe somebody mentioned, that I hear some remarks, a slighting remark, not any consequences that stayed in my mind. Q. You say \u2018a slighting remark\u2019; what do you mean by that? A. Well, I mean I drink scotch and I know Black and White. There is no question and there is a scotch product on the market Black and White. Q. You know that it is advertised extensively? A. Well, I don\u2019t know how .extensively. Occasionally I see on the billboards here and there. I don\u2019t know any degree in the State of California. Q. You have no recollection, I take it, of discussing with any lawyer the question whether there would be a conflict in the names? A. No. Q. The thought occurred to you personally? A. None whatsoever.

Although he referred to two instances in which people \u201cin the business\u201d asked when \u201cdid you people start making beer?\u201d he followed that with an emphatic repetition of his answer \u201cNo,\u201d to the question whether a customer would be confused, in buying a can of Black &amp; White beer, that he was getting a product of Buchanan\u2019s. Appellant argues that the reference to these two instances was evidence of actual confusion. Since the inquiry was made by those who were in the business and hence should know better, the trial judge may have been justified in believing that these inquiries were in the nature of jocular remarks used by way of banter. For this reason and because Baumgarten\u2019s opinion as to the issue to be decided by this court cannot bind us, we attach little weight to his testimony. Of course proof , of specific instances of actual confusion is unnecessary in cases of this kind. La Touraine Coffee Co. v. Lorraine Coffee Co., 2 Cir., 157 F.2d 115, 117; Abramson v.

In its practical application, the phrase \u2018goods of the same descriptive properties\u2019 was construed strictly by' some courts and liberally by others, with the inevitable result that no one knew precisely what it meant. Strict construction required that the goods be the same, and some courts held that there must be actual confusion of goods before relief could be granted. But many courts reasoned that if the goods were unlike but somewhat related, purchasers might mistakenly think that the goods of both parties emanated from the same source.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14a\">\n<p id=\"b227-17\">. The court held that the owners of the words \u201cAunt Jemima\u201d as a registered trademark for self-rising pancake flour were entitled to an injunction against the defendants who used the same name on their pancake syrup. The court said (247 F. at pp. 409 to 410) : \u201cIt is said that even a technical trade-mark may be appropriated by any one in any market for goods not in competition with those of the prior user. This was the view of the court below in saying that no one wanting syrup could possibly be made to take flour. But we think that goods, though different, <em>may </em>be <em>so relate\u00e9 as to fall within the mischief which equity </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>should prevent. </em>Syrup and flour are both food products, and food products commonly used together. Obviously the public, or a large part of it, seeing this trade-mark on a syrup, would conclude that it was made by the complainant. Perhaps they might not do so, if it were used for flatirons. In this way the complainant\u2019s reputation is put in the hands of the defendants. It will enable them to get the benefit of the complainant\u2019s reputation and advertisement. These we think are property rights which should be protected in equity.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The same court in Yale Electric Corporation v.

It was recognized that the manufacturer of locks did not make flashlights. The court said: '\u201cTherefore it was at first a debatable point whether a merchant\u2019s good will, indicated by his mark, could extend beyond such goods as he sold. How could he lose bargains which he had no means to \u00a3111V\u201d 'The court then proceeded to answer this inquiry and said (p. 974): \u201cHowever, it has of recent years been recognized that .a merchant may have a sufficient economic interest in the use of his mark outside the field of his own exploitation to justify interposition by a court. His mark is his authentic seal, by it he vouches for the goods which bear it; it carries his name for good or ill. If another uses it, he borrows the owner\u2019s reputation, whoso quality no longer lies within bis own control. This is an injury, even though the borrower does not tarnish it, or divert any sales by its use; for a reputation, like a face, is the symbol of its possessor and creator, and another can use it only as a mask. <em>And so it has come to be recognized, that, unless the borrower's use is so foreign to the owner\u2019s as to insure against any identification of the ttoo, it is unlaioful.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">We are not prepared here to go so far as the Second Circuit did in the Yale Electric case; we are not required to do so for plainly whisky and beer are more \u201crelated\u201d than locks and flashlights, and less \u201cforeign\u201d to each other.
