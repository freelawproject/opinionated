It is also admitted that while appellee, who was operating the winch, agreed to use \u2022due care, appellant had contracted to (keep the winch in good repair or else furnish a substitute. It further appeared that on at least three occasions prior to the accident appellee, finding the winch defective, had called appellant\u2019s attention to the fact. The court found that on each occasion appellant did some work on the winch, told appellee that it was sufficiently repaired, and instructed him to resume. Shortly after the last alleged repair the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Essentially appellant\u2019s position is that appellee had the \u201clast clear chance,\u201d and that the real cause of the injury was appellee\u2019s continuing to work. This issue could arise oniy if, following the last repair and directions to continue, appellee had learned that the repair had not been effective and had pursued, regardless. Without deciding whether such behavior under these circumstances would have permitted appellant to shift the burden of the loss to appellee, it is sufficient to say that the court did not find, and certainly was not compelled to find, that this was what happened. Indeed, we doubt if the evidence would even have permitted a finding that the defect again manifested itself until the accident. Appellant cannot complain that appellee relied upon its instructions. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
