I dissent from the denial of the Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-22\">2. Though I was one of the majority,, when this case was handed down on 21 September 1962, which held that the claims do not define\u2022 the invention witb the \u201cparticularity required by 35 U.S.C. 112,\u201d second paragraph, the petition has persuaded me that such holding was erroneous. The Patent Office memorandum-in opposition to the petition further convinces me that the decision made was erroneous. I therefore feel obliged to withdraw from the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-23\">While I agree with the points made in-Judge Smith\u2019s former and present dissenting opinions, I wish to make a few additional points relative to the law as. applied by the majority, to which end I write the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">My main objection to the court\u2019s opinion is the application made of General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp.,. et al., 304 U.S. 364, 58 S.Ct. 899, 82 L.Ed. 1402, (hereinafter \u201cWabash\u201d). I agree-that the Wabash claims were bad because, as the Court held, they were so-<em>broad </em>in their terminology that <em>they did not distinguish from the prior art, </em>but I do not agree with the majority here that part [A] of Fisher\u2019s claim is \u201ccomparable to\u201d the Wabash claims. The Wabash case rested in part on the Perkins Glue<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> case and I agree that the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>there were bad too, because they claimed <em>any </em>starch glue \u201chaving substantially the properties of animal glue,\u201d and were considered by the Court to claim any starch glue \u201cas good as\u201d animal glue.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The composition here seems to be one which cannot, as a practical matter, at the present stage of development of this art, be specifically defined by a formula. It is here being defined in terms of its properties \u2014 properties which, unlike Wabash, do distinguish it from the prior art; and, unlike Perkins Glue, they are not in terms merely of being \u201cas good as\u201d some <em>Imoum </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">In spite of the fact that the claim here is wholly unlike the claims in Wabash or in Perkins Glue (while very like the claims in the Parke-Davis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Merck <em>&amp; </em>Co.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cases the majority refuses to follow), it clearly appears that the sole ground of the majority\u2019s decision is the <em>dictum </em>in the Wabash ease about \u201cfunctional language at the exact point of novelty.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is not my interpretation alone; the Patent Office brief opposing the petition says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-6\">* * * <em>the basis </em>of the Court\u2019s decision * * * is that the claims \u201cdo not particularly point out and distinctly claim the alleged invention as required by 35 U.S.C. 112\u201d <em>in that they use \u201cconveniently functional language at the exact point of novelty.\u201d </em>[Emphasis mine.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">I wish to show why this is not enough to condemn a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">lt was this precise phrase from the Wabash case, as used again in the later Halliburton<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> case, 329 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 6, 91 L.Ed. 3, that was behind the writing into the statute of the 3rd paragraph of section 112, as I will show presently. But first I call attention to a passage in Wabash not mentioned in the majority opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-13\">\u201cA limited use of terms of <em>effect </em>or <em>result, </em>which accurately define the essential <em>qualities of a product </em>to one skilled in the art, may in some instances be permissible and <em>even desirable, </em>but a characteristic essential to novelty may not be distinguished from the old art <em>solely by its tendency to remedy the problems in the art </em>met by the patent. And we may <em>doubt </em>whether the <em>language used in Claim 25, </em>taken by itself, <em>conveyed definite meaning to those skilled in the art </em>of incandescent lighting.\u201d [My emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">Here it seems clear that the language of Fisher\u2019s claims, as well as the language of his specification, does convey definite meaning. As to the first sentence of the above quotation, truly the distinction set forth is a subtle one, but it seems to me that Fisher\u2019s claims define <em>qualities of his product, </em>not merely what his product is intended to <em>acconvplish </em>and are not merely in terms of <em>remedying problems </em>in the art. What was it his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ACTH product was to accomplish? The answer to that question will show what would be <em>true </em>\u201cfunctionality.\u201d A good example of such functionality is the Perkins Glue claims, a starch glue <em>\u201cas good as </em>animal glue,\u201d (my emphasis) as the Supreme Court read the claims. We have nothing like that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The majority opinion seems to me to be dogmatic on the point that \u201cfunctional language at the exact point of novelty,\u201d which I believe the majority mistakenly construes to mean at <em>any </em>novel point, is a clear rule and controls <em>this </em>case \u2014 and would control any other case involving claims which happen to contain that supposed vice. But such is not the law now, if it <em>ever </em>was, even at the time the Wabash case was decided. For the convenience of the interested, I have collected below extracts from commentators on some of the new aspects of section 112 in the Patent Act of 1952. I am aware that they mostly relate to combination, rather than composition, claims but I think they have a bearing here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the majority relies on Wabash, it does not rely on the <em>decision </em>made on the <em>facts </em>therein. It relies only on this phrase, \u201cfunctional language at the exact point of novelty\u201d which was dictum. That identical phrase was taken up in the Halliburton case by Mr. Justice Black and used as the basis of his decision in a combination claim case. Congress thereafter effectively overruled that case by enacting the third paragraph of section 112, as the following commentators\u2019 statements show. I think it may be said, therefore, that the quoted phrase, which the majority opinion here uses as the basis of its decision, is not the controlling principle of law it is assumed to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Here is what the commentators have said, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Stefan A. Riesenfeld, Professor of Law, University of California, writing in the April 1954 Univ. of Pa.Law Rev., on \u201cThe New American Patent Act in'the Light of Comparative Law: Part II,\u201d pages 731-2, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-11\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has exhibited a high degree of sensitivity against unduly comprehensive or indefinite claims and has invalidated scores of patents on this ground [citing, inter alia, Perkins Glue, Wabash, Halliburton, United Carbon [United Carbon Co. v. Binney &amp; Smith Co., 317 U.S. 228, 63 S.Ct. 165, 87 L.Ed. 232] except where greater definiteness was not reasonably to be required. It has frowned especially upon functional descriptions, at least where they are either wholly functional or functional at the exact point of novelty. [Citing Perkins Glue, Wabash, and Halliburton] Probably as a reaction against what seemed to be a dangerous trend and excessive formalism the framers of the new code inserted a special paragraph * * * designed to authorize within certain limits the use of functional expressions in patent claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXS\">\u2018functionality\u2019 in claim drafting does not seem to be tabu any longer, even though it relates to the \u2018most crucial element in the \u201cnew\u201d combination\u2019 [saying this was the vice of the claim in Halliburton] or goes to \u2018the precise point of novelty.\u2019 [Citing Faulkner v. Gibbs, 199 F.2d 635, 95 USPQ 400 (C.A. 9th 1952), and Wabash, supra.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">Prof. Riesenfeld, in the omitted portion, explained that the amendment was limited to combination claims and by making the omission I do not wish to create the impression he was speaking generally of all kinds of claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Also in 1954 the P. J. Federico Commentary in U.S.C.A. came out. Speaking of the last paragraph of 112, he said (at 35 U.S.C.A. Vol. 1, p. 25):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">\u201cIt is unquestionable that some measure of greater liberality in the use of functional expressions in combination claims is authorized than had been permitted by some court decisions, and that decisions such as that in Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Walker * * * 329 U.S. 1 [67 S.Ct. 6, 91 L.Ed. 3], * * * are modified or rendered obsolete, but the exact limits of the enlargement remain to be determined. The language specifies \u2018an\u2019 element, which means \u2018any\u2019 element, and by this language, * * * it follows that more than one of the elements of a combination claim may be expressed as different \u2018means\u2019 plus statements of function. The language does not go so far as to permit a so-called single means claim, that is a claim which recites merely one means plus a statement of function and nothing else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In the June 1955 George Washington Law Review, L. James Harris,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in \u201cSome Aspects of the Underlying Legislative Intent of the Patent Act of 1952,\u201d at p. 683, starts a 6-page discussion of functionality in claims. At the outset, he points out (fn. 126) \u201cThere has been some confusion in the past between the requirements for the description and those for the claims,\u201d citing the Wabash case as an example. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-8\">\u201cIn Section 112 the drafters attacked the functionality problem in several ways. To make it clear that claims were not intended to be a description of \u25a0 the invention, the clause relating to the claim in the section was made a separate paragraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Speaking specifically of the 3rd paragraph of 112, Harris says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-12\">\u201cHere for the first time is statutory recognition of the means clause which had grown up in claim drafting to cover the contribution of the inventor in certain cases where strictly structural terms appeared to be unnecessarily cumbersome or inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuEu\">\u201cThe Act now permits combination claims whether or not they are basic or [sic, means fo] have a means clause at the exact point of novelty. This does go farther than courts have gone in the past.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">See also In re Lundberg et al., 244 F.2d 543, 44 CCPA 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">I submit that it cannot be stated as a sound proposition of law that functional language cannot properly be used at a point or points, including the exact point, of novelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">The usual reasons for objection to functional language in claims are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-17\">1. The claim covers <em>everything </em>which would produce a stated result or effect. (Example: a \u201csingle-means\u201d claim.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-18\">2. The functional language gives the claim a scope such that it reads on the prior art. (Examples : Wabash and Shortell cases [In re Shortell, 173 F.2d 993, 36 CCPA 1013] cited by majority.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-19\">3. The claim is vague \u2014 the public cannot tell what would infringe it; it does not clearly define.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-20\">4. The scope of the claim is <em>unjustifiably </em>broad \u2014 it covers too much more than was actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>invented and disclosed by the applicant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The claims in the present case insofar as they contain statements of function do not seem to me to run afoul of any of these objections.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-25\">.

I say it is dictum because the Wabash claims were held to read on the prior art. Another important fact behind the <em>decision </em>in the Wabash case, seemingly overlooked, is that the product attempted to be claimed <em>was not adequately described in the specification. </em>The majority opinion appears to attach a <em>per se </em>stigma to the statements of function used by appellant in the instant claims; it fails to consider whether such statements are properly grounded in the description of the invention in the specification. Even prior to the enactment of the third paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, such a consideration was thought pertinent in cases like the instant case. See, e. g. the Wabash case at 304 U.S. 373, 58 S.Ct. 903, and cases cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b886-16\">. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v.

Federico, \u201cCommentary on the New Patent Act,\u201d 35 U.S.C.A.

Counsel to the Patent, Trademark and Copyright Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, the United States House of Representatives, directed and supervised the actual work of preparing the preliminary drafts and the bill that culminated in the Patent Act of 1952. [I quote this from a footnote in the article cited. For a more complete statement of the history of the writing of the Patent Act see a Southwestern Legal Foundation \u201cinstitute\u201d held March 21-22, 1963 to be published by the Bureau of National Affairs.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">. The majority observes that \u201cincluded in claim 12 is a concentrate which has <em>no </em>[emphasis the majority\u2019s] vasopressin activity.\u201d I cannot see how such an observation in any way logically relates to the propriety of the functional description of properties used by appellant. For example, if the words \u201cat least\u201d were removed from section [A] of claim 12, the claim would <em>not </em>include \u201ca concentrate which has <em>no </em>vasopressin activity.\u201d <em>The claim, however, icould still contain the same functional language objected to. </em>It appears to me, therefore, that the real objection the majority has to claim 12 is that it is unduly broad, <em>apart from </em>any consideration of \u201cfunctionality.\u201d But that was not a ground of rejection in the Patent Office and so is not before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b889-5\">SMITH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AC3\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In my opinion, the Petition for Rehearing should be granted and further consideration given to what seems to me to be a misapplication by the majority of General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., et al., 304 U.S. 364, 58 S.Ct. 899, 82 L.Ed. 1402.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The majority opinion arrives at the conclusion that the appealed claims are objectionably \u201cfunctional\u201d by what the Petition for Rehearing characterizes as \u201csome rather elaborate reasoning\u201d. The reasoning of the majority requires as its starting point the acceptance of a limited construction of the word \u201cpotency\u201d as meaning solely the \u201cability to effect a certain result\u201d. This construction was derived by the majority from a portion of the definition of \u201cpotency\u201d in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd Ed., 1949. The entire definition leads me to the conclusion that there is a basic fallacy in the majority opinion which arises from attributing too narrow a meaning to this term. This fallacy then leads to the conclusion, with which I do not agree, that the word \u201cpotency\u201d in the appealed claims defines \u201cwhat the concentrate will <em>do </em>rather than what it <em>is\u201d. </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The word \u201cpotency\u201d is used in the appealed claims as one of the accepted parameters which tells a person skilled in this art what the claimed adrenocorticotrophin hormone concentrate <em>is </em>in terms of its <em>strength </em>stated as \u201cpotency\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">I believe this position is supported by the complete definitions of the term in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd Ed., 1949, which defines \u201cpotency\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-13\">1. Quality or state of being potent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APi\">* * \u2022\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-15\">b. general efficiency or capability; power or energy more or less free to act or not; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-16\">c. specific efficacy or capacity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-17\">\u2022X- \u00ab X-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-18\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, 1961, gives another definition for \u201cpotency\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-19\">* * * c (1): chemical or medical strength or efficacy &lt;the &gt; of the drink&gt; &lt;the of the drug&gt; &lt;the material has lost its by being exposed to light * * *&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">A technical definition of \u201cpotency\u201d which those of ordinary skill in this art would apply to it is found in Hack\u2019s Chemical Dictionary, 3rd Ed., 1944, where its meaning in therapeutics is given as \u201cThe strength or power or activity of a drug.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-22\">The word \u201cpotency\u201d thus has shades and varieties of meanings which the majority does not appear to have considered. When used in its technical sense as it is in the appealed claims, it should be given a meaning which is consistent with that found in the specification. In the specification we find the word \u201cpotency\u201d is used throughout in what seems to me to be the therapeutic meaning ascribed to it by Hack\u2019s, i. e., \u201cThe strength or power or activity of a drug.\u201d Thus po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>tency of the claimed hormone concentrate is related in the specification to what is a \u201cgenerally accepted standard\u201d of The Technical Advisory Committee to the Study Section for Metabolism and Endocrinology of the National Institutes of Health. Throughout the specification, the term \u201cpotency\u201d is used in its therapeutic sense in relation to the standard units recognized by the committee as in the statements that \u201cThe purified fraction obtained has a potency of 97% of standard * * * \u201d; or \u201cThe final product has a potency which is 220% of standard * * Similar uses of the term are found in all the examples with the specific \u201cpotency\u201d characteristics given as a term of measurement of the strength or activity of the drug in terms of a stated precentage <em>of a defined and well recognized standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Thus, it seems to me that the reference to \u201cpotency\u201d, in the appealed claims is the same as specifying the concentration or strength of an acid or base in terms of its pH value, etc. It is, like most chemical and pharmacological <em>properties </em>of substances, expressed in terms of reference to an accepted standard. As such, it tells something about what the claimed product <em>is.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">As shown in the specification, the term \u201cpotency\u201d is a parameter recognized in the pharmaceutical art as one of the characteristics of the product which particularly points out and distinctly claims what it <em>is. </em>In my prior dissent I discussed the term \u201cposterior pituitary contamination\u201d as measured by particularly stated units of vasopressin and oxytocin activity. Such terms are the antithesis of the vague, indefinite and functional terms so frequently criticized by the courts. When used as terms of description, in the specification, such terms are legally sufficient to meet the requirements of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112; when used in the claims, such terms particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention and are legally sufficient to meet the requirements- of the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
