Thereafter, still strongly convinced that he should prevail, appellant continued to attempt to litigate the matter in the district court. He filed many papers in an effort to obtain relief under Rule 60(b). After a hearing, the court decided against him. Up to that point various lawyers had represented appellant. Now he has elected to appeal without counsel. We have examined the record carefully and are satisfied that the court below was correct in holding that a case has not been made out for relief under Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-18\">Appellant has asked that we send this case back to the district court to permit him to present additional matters there. While we recognize his sincerity and determination, we think he has had full opportunity to present his various contentions. There must be an end to litigation even though a litigant continues to be dissatisfied with the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-20\">The appellant\u2019s request that we send the case back for further proceedings will be denied and the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
