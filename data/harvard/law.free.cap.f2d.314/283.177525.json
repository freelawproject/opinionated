Education and Welfare that certain income received after 1946 was not derived! from a trade or business under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">Appellants, Maurice and Anna Lessin,. claim that interest from a promissory-note was income derived from carrying-on a trade or business, thereby entitling-them to receive credit on their social: security accounts for purposes of determining quarters of coverage, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7'\u201e- 413(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-18\">In 1954, appellants sold an apartment, building taking an interest bearing-promissory note for the purchase price. Appellants urge that the interest received on this note for the years 1956 and 1957 is income derived from a trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">The hearing examiner determined that appellants were not engaged in trade or business during the years 1956 and 1957' and that the amounts received representing interest on the promissory note-were not derived from any trade or business <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but income from investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-20\">The determination of what activities constitute carrying on a trade- or business and what is income derived! therefrom, within the terms of the act,, is dependent upon the facts of each case. This decision is for the agency in the-first instance and will be affirmed by a reviewing court if supported by substantial evidence. McDowell v. Ribicoff, 292 F.2d 174 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U. S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 240, 7 L.Ed.2d 135-(1961). There is substantial evidence-to support the decision of the Secretary- and no evidence to the contrary; the appeal thus presents no non-frivolous question.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-21\">The judgment of the District Court is-</p>\n<p id=\"AHy\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-14\">. The Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration denied appellants\u2019 request to review decision of the hearing examiner, thereby making the hearing examiner\u2019s determination the final administrative decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
