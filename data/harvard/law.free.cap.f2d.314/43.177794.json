Armstrong, Attys., National Labor Relations Board, for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-19\">Robert T. Thompson, Alexander E.

Smith Transfer Co. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 738; N. L. R. B. v. Stewart, 5 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 8; N. L. R. B. v. Poultry Enterprises, Inc., 5 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 522; and N. L. R. B. v. Southeastern Rubber Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">We are aware of and have recognized the dilemma in which an employer finds himself when an Union demands certification prior to an election. See N. L. R. B. v. Dan River Mills, Incorporated, 5 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 381. But the small employer here could have hardly been in doubt after a majority of his employees took to the picket line, and after he was fully advised as to the law. Cf. N. L. R. B. v. American Aggregate Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 559; Scobell Chemical Co. v. N. L. R. B., 2 Cir., 1959, 267 F.2d 922; N. L. R. B. v. Barney\u2019s Supercenter, Inc., 3 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 91; and N. L. R. B. v. Harris-Woodson Co., 4 Cir., 1950, 179 F.2d 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The order therefore must be and is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
