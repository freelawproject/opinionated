The mark is used on \u201cgrooved phonograph records.\u201d Op-poser-appellant, the prior user, asserted in its Notice of Opposition that the mark sought to be registered is confusingly similar to its registered trademark \u201cLIBRASCOPE.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The record consists of stipulated testimony which the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApX\">\u201cAccording to the testimony, op-poser, through its predecessor in title, first used the trademark \u2018LIBRASCOPE\u2019 in the year 1937 on a special type computer for determining the position and load center in an airplane. During the 1940\u2019s, opposer expanded its business under the mark to include other types of computers, and in the early 1950\u2019s to include other types of scientific instruments such as read/record heads for recording or reading digital computers and other data recording apparatus. In 1954, opposer introduced to the commercial market a \u2018LIBRASCOPE\u2019 demagnetizer, which is an electrical device for removing prior recordings from magnetic tape, thereby making the tape ready for reuse, and in the same year it began marketing, under the mark \u2018RECORD LIFE\u2019, a liquid preparation for the surface treatment and cleaning of photograph [sic] records. Applicant\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> trade name appears in the advertising and on the packages in which such preparations are sold. During the year 1956, opposer expended approximately $100,000 in the advertising of its various \u2018LIBRASCOPE\u2019 products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s record shows that it is engaged in the marketing of phonograph records, known in the trade as \u2018talking books\u2019 because they consist of complete renditions of books by theatrical artists, under the mark \u2018LIBRAPHONE.\u2019 Such phonograph records are generally sold by applicant to hospitals, libraries, schools, and like institutions, and applicant\u2019s advertising in newspapers and trade publications is directed to such institutional users. In connection with the sale of its recordings, applicant also advertises and sells record players, earphones, and turntable adapters under the trademark of the manufacturer thereof. In addition thereto, the record players also bear applicant\u2019s mark \u2018LIBRAPHONE.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">We agree with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">\u201c* * * opposer\u2019s magnetic tape demagnetizer and phonograph record cleaner, and applicant\u2019s phonograph records must be considered as products which would normally move through the same channels of trade to the same class of purchasers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>are of such character that they might readily be assumed to originate with the same producer if sold under the same or similar marks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Therefore, the sole issue presented is whether the mark sought to be registered, \u201cLibraphone\u201d and its design, so resembles the registered mark, \u201cLIBRASCOPE\u201d, \u201cas to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In comparing the <em>marks </em>as applied to the goods, the board concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201cWhile both applicant\u2019s \u2018LIBRA-PHONE\u2019 and opposer\u2019s \u2018LIBRA-SCOPE\u2019 contain the term \u2018LIBRA\u2019 as the prefix portion thereof, it is readily apparent that the prefix of applicant\u2019s mark is derived from and suggests the well-known Latin word meaning \u2018book\u2019. The prefix of op-poser\u2019s mark and/or trade name, as used in connection with its goods, would have no such connotation to purchasers thereof. Since \u2018LIBRA-PHONE\u2019, on the one hand, and \u2018LIBRASCOPE\u2019, on the other, otherwise differ in sound, appearance, and significance, it is concluded that, despite the common occurrence of the prefix \u2018LIBRA\u2019 in both, there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACz\">We do not agree with this conclusion. Even if we were to assume as the board did that the prefix \u201cLIBRA\u201d is in fact derived from the Latin word \u201cliber,\u201d it is unlikely that the average purchaser, whether he had a knowledge of Latin or not, would, in the act of purchasing the goods to which such marks are applied, take the time to analyze the marks so carefully and find, as did the board, the subtle and latent differences in meaning for the common prefix \u201cLIBRA\u201d. Even assuming that a purchaser would apply to the two marks the semantic analysis which gives rise to the different meanings found by the board, the fact remains that the word \u201cLIBRA\u201d in each mark is <em>identical in both sound and appearance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In comparing the marks in their entireties, it is our opinion that there are sufficient similarities between \u201cLIBRA-SCOPE\u201d and \u201cLibraphone,\u201d when applied to the goods, that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers is likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">While prior decisions usually are of little value in determining likelihood of confusion between any two specific marks, the marks here in issue, consisting of a common portion (\u201cLIBRA\u201d) and a terminal word of common meaning (\u201cPHONE\u201d and \u201cSCOPE\u201d), must be analyzed as this court did in the case of L. &amp; C. Hardtmuth, Inc. v. Fabrique Suisse De Crayons Caran D\u2019Ache S.A., 287 F.2d 599, 48 CCPA 873. In finding likelihood of confusion between applicant\u2019s \u201cTechograph\u201d and opposer\u2019s \u201cTechnicrayon\u201d and \u201cTechniflex\u201d, Judge Rich stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">\u201cWhatever may be said about the right hand ends of the marks, there is substantial identity in the left hand ends. \u2018Techni-\u2019 or \u2018Techno-\u2019 appears to be quite arbitrary as applied to pencils and there is but an insignificant difference between the two forms. It seems to us to be the striking or conspicuous or dominant portion of all of the marks as well as the portion of greatest trademark significance. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">When so analyzed, it is our opinion that there are sufficient similarities between \u201cLIBRASCOPE\u201d and \u201cLibra-phone\u201d, as applied to at least some of the goods of the respective parties that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers is quite likely. While we have no doubts as to this conclusion, should any doubt exist, it should be resolved against applicant, who as the later user, is the newcomer. L. &amp; C. Hardtmuth, Inc. v. Fabrique Suisse De Crayons Caran D\u2019Ache S.A., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ALMOND, Judge, dissenting, with whom WORLEY, Chief Judge, joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">It is with deference and regret that I find myself in disagreement with the decision of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">While appellee concedes that the board was not in error in concluding that appellant\u2019s surface cleaner for phonograph records could be sold through the same channels of trade and to the same class of purchasers as appellee\u2019s grooved phonograph records, it is significant, however, that the trademark \u201cLIBRA-SCOPE\u201d is not used on the surface cleaner. The appellant distributes this product under the trademark \u201cRECORD LIFE,\u201d dominantly displayed on the package container with the corporate name \u201cLibrascope, Incorporated\u201d appearing on the package in relatively minor dimensions. Presumably, the present corporate name of \u201cLibrascope Division General Precision, Inc.\u201d would now be substituted for the old name on this product. The corporate name is so utterly dwarfed in every aspect by the mark \u201cRECORD LIFE\u201d to persuade me to eliminate the exhibit and the product which it represents as having no ascertainable probative value in support of appellant\u2019s position on the issue of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">With the elimination of any material significance to be attached to the mark \u201cRECORD LIFE\u201d and the product marked, the only goods even remotely similar to appellee\u2019s phonograph records is appellant\u2019s tape demagnetizer. The difference between these goods is a factor I consider relevant to the issue of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The burden of the conflicting contentions of the parties revolves, in major part, around the similarity of the two marks, \u201cLIBRAPHONE\u201d with a row of books and a horn and \u201cLIBRASCOPE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">It is well settled that marks must be considered in their entireties. While it may be necessary to dissect marks in analyzing similarities and differences, the final determination of the issue requires a comparison of the entire marks. In re Dobeckmun Company, 286 F.2d 187, 48 CCPA 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Appellant contends that its mark \u201cLIBRASCOPE\u201d is both arbitrary and fanciful, thus imparting to it a measure of protection sufficient to exclude appellee\u2019s mark from the register. In this connection it is further stated that \u201cThe record herein is wholly silent as to any fact or claim that \u2018LIBRASCOPE\u2019 has any significance whatsoever or that it is anything other than a coined word.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">An examination of the record leads me to a different conclusion. The Meredith Instrument Company, founded in 1937, engaged in the manufacture and sale of a special type of computer for determining the position of the load center in an airplane. The trademark \u201cLIBRA-SCOPE\u201d was applied to such instruments in July 1937. In 1939 Librascope, Incorporated succeeded to the entire business of the Meredith Company, continuing the use of \u201cLIBRASCOPE\u201d as a trademark for its products consisting of various models of balance computers. In addition, on opposer\u2019s balance computers there is attached to the mark \u201cLIBRA-SCOPE\u201d and displayed prominently therewith the figure of a pair of scales in balance embellished with stars. It is reasonable to assume that the scale representation with stars bears and was intended to bear some relative indication as to the meaning of the mark \u201cLIBRA-SCOPE\u201d in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">Taking judicial notice of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged, one of the meanings attributed to Libra is \u201ca balance, the Roman pound\u201d in Latin. Another is \u201cA southern zodiacal constellation * * * represented by a pair of scales; the Balance.\u201d The word \u201c-scope,\u201d is defined as \u201ca combining form denoting <em>a means, </em>usually <em>an instrument.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">The conclusion, therefore, seems inescapable to me that neither mark is \u201carbitrary and fanciful.\u201d Each, dissected by prefix and suffix, is invested with dictionary meaning. Each, by entirety with its respective figure representations, suggests and connotes an object.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>It is my view that appellee\u2019s contention that \u201cLIBRAPHONE\u201d when coupled with the figure representation of a row of books and the speaker or horn suggests a library of sound, is a logical conclusion supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">I find sufficient support for the conclusion that the prefix \u201cLIBRA\" combined with the respective suffixes, \u201cSCOPE\u201d and \u201cPHONE,\u201d suggests dissimilar connotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The majority suggests that the average purchaser would not \u201ctake the time to analyze the marks.\u201d It seems to me that the average purchaser, on seeing the composite mark of a row of books and a speaker horn with the term \u201cLIBRA-PHONE,\u201d would have some connotation of <em>books. </em>The average purchaser need not know that \u201clibrary\u201d is derived from the Latin \u201clibrarius\u201d to associate the former word with books. Since appellee\u2019s goods have not the slightest connection with books of any kind, let alone the \u201ctalking books\u201d or a \u201clibrary of sound\u201d to which appellant\u2019s mark is applied, the term \u201cLIBRASCOPE\" would not have the same connotation as appellee\u2019s composite mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">I find no support of record for appellant\u2019s inference that appellee\u2019s selection of \u201clibra\u201d instead of \u201cliber\u201d was directed by a deliberate intention to trade upon appellant's good will. On the contrary, the stipulated testimony of the witness, Ditlow, president of Libraphone, Inc., discloses that appellee was not aware of appellant\u2019s name or trademark prior to its adoption of the trademark \u201cLIBRA-PHONE,\u201d since appellant was not known in the field of \u201ctalking books,\u201d and that appellee adopted the name \u201cLIBRA-PHONE\u201d from the Latin word \u201clibrarius,\u201d meaning \u201cbook,\u201d and the Greek word \u201cphone,\u201d meaning \u201csound.\u201d The record discloses no instance of confusion relating to the use of the two trademarks. I find no intimation, either by fact or circumstance, in refutation of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">For the foregoing reasons I would hold that, notwithstanding the common occurrence of the prefix \u201cLIBRA\u201d in both, the marks \u201cLIBRAPHONE\u201d and \u201cLIBRA-SCOPE,\u201d when considered in their entireties, differ so distinctly in sound, appearance and connotation that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">I have not left unnoticed the authorities cited by the majority and by counsel for the respective parties. Each trademark case must, in final analysis, stand on its own merits. Previously decided cases provide meager assistance in resolving the issue of confusion relating to future trademarks. Finn v. Cooper\u2019s Incorporated, 292 F.2d 555, 48 CCPA 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">I would therefore affirm the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-14\">.
