In view of the infringement action against opposer, based in part on the unregistered trademark \u2018CHEE-TOS\u2019, [sic] opposer believes it would be damaged by the registration of such mark by reason of the advantages that would accrue to applicant as plaintiff in the infringement suit by having a Federal trademark registration for \u2018CHEE-TOS\u2019, \u25a0[sic] such advantages, among others, being set forth in the Trademark Act of July 6, 1946, Sections 33(a) and 39; 15 USC 1115(a) and 1121.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">The pending infringement action referred to in the above-quoted allegation is Civil Action 9292, The Frito Company v. Morton Foods, Inc., U.S.D.C., W.D. Oklahoma, now pending on appeal to the Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">Thus, the issue here stated more precisely is: Whether the specified procedural advantages which accrue to the owner of a registered mark, constitute, as a matter of law, such \u201cdamage\u201d to the defendant in an infringement action as to support an opposition brought under Sec. 13 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1063)? <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">While we may agree with appellant that granting of a registration of the trademark in issue may give applicant some tactical advantage in the other litigation between the parties, we do not agree that this constitutes \u201cdamage\u201d to appellant in the sense contemplated by Sec. 13 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1063).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">The precise question to be determined in the pending civil litigation between the parties here appears to be whether opposer has the right to use \u201cehip-O\u2019s in the manner it is now being used. Thus, opposer is in effect here arguing that its right to use its mark in commerce would be impaired by giving applicant an alleged tactical advantage in pending litigation which seeks to determine whether opposer has such a right to use. Merely because applicant in the pending infringement action seeks an adjudication as to the legal rights of the parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>connection with the marks there involved, it cannot be said that such advantages as may be gained by applicant from the granting of a registration here will constitute \u201cdamage\u201d to the opposer in the sense of Sec. 13 of the Lanham Act, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board lists a number of its own prior decisions and prior decisions of the Commissioner of Patents <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as support for its holding that such facts as are alleged here by opposer do not constitute a showing of damage within the meaning of Sec. 13 of the Lanham Act, supra. We have reviewed these decisions and agree with this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-11\">.

In so stating the issue we have not overlooked the averment in the Notice of Opposition in which opposer has alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-15\">\u201c8. The Frito Company, applicant here, has filed an opposition against Morton Foods, Inc., Opposition No. 40,-:887, to oppose the registration to Morton Foods of the trademark \u2018chip-O\u2019s\u2019. In said opposition The Frito Company has alleged ownership of a family of trademarks ending in OS and TOS, including among others the trademark \u2018CHEE-TOS\u2019.\u201d [sic]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-22\">We do not think that this allegation states any cause of action of which cognizance can properly be taken in the present proceeding. Registration of its mark gives appellee no rights in any other mark. Appellee\u2019s filing of a trademark opposition involving appellant\u2019s application to register its mark does not constitute \u201cdamage\u201d to opposer as will be seen from our opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">.
