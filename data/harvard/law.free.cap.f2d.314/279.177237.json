The policy was periodically renewed and on October 9, 1956, for an additional premium, coverage was increased to 400 case histories. In December, 1956, a claim for the loss of about 200 case histories was paid without question. Drs. Maciulla and Casolaro became partners and the policy was assigned to them as such on August 10, 1957. The policy here involved, a reissue dated May 20, 1959, recited the same coverage which had been in effect since the increase to 400 ease histories.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">In March, 1960, 357 case histories disappeared from the appellees\u2019 premises. Proof of loss was furnished but as Aetna Casualty\u2019did not pay, this suit was instituted. Aetna Casualty appeals from a judgment for $29,631 entered pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">Aetna Casualty argues there was no meeting of minds as to the meaning of the expression \u201c400 case histories\u201d in the policy \u2014 the doctors had more than 5,000 such histories \u2014 and that therefore no valid insurance contract ever came into existence. It further contends the appellees failed to show the 357 case histories allegedly lost were in fact case histories insured by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Having writtten the original policy and the several renewals and having accepted the premiums thereon, Aetna Casualty cannot be heard to say the policy involved does not express an.agreement reached by the parties or that it is not sufficiently specific to be a valid contract. We think it covered any 400 case histories which might be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
