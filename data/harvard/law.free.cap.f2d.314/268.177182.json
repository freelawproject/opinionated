During his summation to the ju3^ defense counsel argued that the jury should not believe the undercover agent. Thereafter in the course of charging the jury the court admonished counsel for impugning the character of the agent. While some of counsel\u2019s references probably justified the court in intervening, the intervention which occurred was in terms which might well have led the jury to understand that the court considered counsel\u2019s entire argument on credibility unjustified and improper, thus in effect removing this issue from the province of the jury, to which counsel for the accused duly objected. For this reason we reverse. See Billeci v. United States, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 184 F.2d 394, 24 A.L.R.2d 881 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">A further contention is made with respect to a matter which is unlikely to recur in the event of a new trial, for which reason we do not pass upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-25\">.
