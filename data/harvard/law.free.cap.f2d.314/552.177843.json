Use since May 20, 1959, is asserted, with first use in connection with the sale of butter and subsequent and present use embracing butter, fluid milk, and ice cream. Appellant is a central cooperative organization whose member-users are farmers\u2019 cooperative dairies.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Dean Milk Company, appellee-opposer, filed Notice of Opposition alleging prior and continuous use of \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d as a trademark for its dairy products; and projecting the issue that appellant\u2019s mark so resembles the mark of appellee as to be likely, when applied to the goods of appellant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive the purchasing public as to the origin of appellant\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board refused registration and sustained the opposition<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the grounds that appellant\u2019s mark so resembles opposer\u2019s mark \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM,\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or deceive purchasers when applied to the goods in connection with which appellant\u2019s mark is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">The parties have stipulated the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">Appellee\u2019s business is that of marketing a wide variety of dairy products including milk, buttermilk, ice cream and ice milk. Its area of service embraces eight states with its products disseminated through local and interstate commerce. Since at least as early as 1950, it has marketed its dairy products in cartons bearing the designation \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d advertised extensively through all available media at. an annual cost in excess of $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-20\">Appellee\u2019s mark \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d is currently registered in eleven states, such registrations having been obtained prior to appellant\u2019s date of first use. However, the mark is not registered to appellee in the U. S. Patent Office. The Fisher Dairy and Cheese Company, a third party, is registrant of the mark \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d for Cheddar cheese food. According to appellant\u2019s unchallenged statement, appellee\u2019s registered trademark for the goods in question consists of a bird on a mail box.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-21\">Appellant\u2019s composite mark is currently registered in five states and has been publicized in the trade and in a number of publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-22\">The products of both parties are sold at retail on delivery routes and through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>stores to consumers as well as at wholesale to stores and restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">While the goods designated in appellant\u2019s application are limited to butter, the record discloses that appellant\u2019s mark is also used on a line of dairy products. There is no issue relating to prior use, nor is there any doubt that the products of the respective parties are substantially the same and that they are distributed to the same classes of purchasers through similar means. The sole issue is whether the appellant\u2019s mark so resembles that of appellee when applied to dairy products as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Appellant properly argues that the marks should be considered in their entireties. The mark applied for, it is urged, is a composite mark consisting of the words \u201cDAIRY CHARM\u201d in combination with a design and a slogan. It is stated that no request has been made to register the words alone and no claim is made to the words as a trademark separate from the design and slogan.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Appellee\u2019s opposition is based on an alleged use of \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d as a trademark, and that \u201cDAIRY CHARM\u201d is substantially similar to \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d since the word \u201cCHARM,\u201d common to both marks, is the dominant portion of the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The board was of the opinion that \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM,\u201d per se, was used by the opposer as a trademark. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0X\">\u201cThe containers for opposer\u2019s products do show that opposer uses the three elements \u2018DEAN\u2019S\u2019 within an oval, a bird on a mailbox and \u2018COUNTRY CHARM\u2019 but they do not show that all three elements ar\u00e9 always used as a single integrated mark. Opposer\u2019s containers show use of \u2018DEAN\u2019S,\u2019 not in an oval, separable from the other matter and on some sides of the containers the term \u2018COUNTRY CHARM\u2019 does not appear or even the word \u2018DEAN\u2019S.\u2019 Certainly, in the sale of ice milk, op-poser has used \u2018COUNTRY CHARM\u2019 separably from the other two elements. Opposer, in its advertising, identifies its products as \u2018COUNTRY CHARM DAIRY PRODUCTS\u2019 and in other ways emphasizes the term \u2018COUNTRY CHARM.\u2019 It is so well established, as not to require citation of precedents, that two or more marks may be used on the same goods and it is concluded that opposer uses \u2018COUNTRY CHARM,\u2019 per se, as a trademark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">It should be pointed out that the term \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d is used \u201cseparably from the other two elements\u201d in the ice milk carton only when the carton is unfolded and lying flat. In use, the two end flaps, one bearing the word \u201cDEAN\u2019S\u201d and the registered trademark of a bird on a mailbox, and the other flap bearing the words \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d are joined together to form the end of the carton.- Thus, all three elements appear together on each end and on each side of the ice milk carton. In no instance are the words \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d used separately as a trademark on the cartons.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Aside from this factual misconception, it would appear that the mark \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM,\u201d per se, is weak. A third party, Fisher Dairy and Cheese Company, is the owner of Registration No. 526,942 for \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d for Cheddar Cheese Food.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This registration was introduced by appellant along with 16 other third party registrations for \u201cCHARM,\u201d or some variation thereof, for food products. The board found that the registrations were \u201cinsufficient to prove that that term is suggestive of dairy products.\u201d While the registrations alone may not prove suggestiveness as to any specific food products, we feel that the registrations are some evidence entitled to consideration that \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d is a weak mark. Shoe Corporation of America v. Juvenile Shoe Corporation of America, 266 F.2d 793, 46 CCPA 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Appellee\u2019s argument that \u201cCHARM\u201d is the dominant portion of the marks of both appellant and appellee is not persuasive in view of the fact that the same word is used in at least eight of the third party registrations for food products. That only two of the registrations are for dairy products is a factor to be weighed in appellee\u2019s behalf. Nevertheless, the word \u201cCHARM\u201d for condensed milk and evaporated milk is also registered to a third party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The facts here are analogous to those presented in Goodall-Sanford, Inc. v. Tropical Garment Manufacturing Co., 275 F.2d 736, 47 CCPA 821, where it was found :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201c * * * that the word \u2018palm\u2019 is lacking in distinctiveness as a part of trademarks in the textile field and as such has only weak trademark significance. This is shown in the record here by ten registrations of third parties in which the word \u2018palm\u2019 appears as a part of these marks for clothing and related goods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The board appeared to be influenced by the fact that appellant refers to its products as \u201cDAIRY CHARM.\u201d Whether or not appellant is entitled to register \u201cDAIRY CHARM\u201d by itself is a question not before us. A composite mark consisting of the head of a cow in an inverted triangle, a representation of city buildings, and a slogan, as well as the words \u201cDAIRY CHARM,\u201d is sought to be registered. It is axiomatic that a trademark is to be considered in its entirety in determining the question of confusing similarity. It would seem that the total appearance of the mark, including the design features, would be relied on in purchasing butter, the goods for which registration is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In comparing the composite mark of the application with the mark \u201cCOUNTRY CHARM\u201d of appellee, the conclusion seems inescapable that the marks are not likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">For the foregoing reasons the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, concurs in result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-14\">.
