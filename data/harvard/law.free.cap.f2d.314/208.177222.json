The District Court, by its opinion recorded at 198 F.Supp. 198, reversed the decision of the Secretary and ordered payment of appellee\u2019s old-age insurance benefits claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The Secretary has appealed therefrom, claiming that the District Court erred in failing to treat his determination \u2014 that appellee had not satisfied the requirements for \u201cmaterial participation in the production or management of production\u201d as required by Section 211(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 411(a)) \u2014 \u201cas a conclusive factual determination, supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Hence the issue for our determination is whether under the undisputed facts here appellee established that he had an \u201carrangement\u201d with the cultivator of his farm land which provided for appellee\u2019s \u201cmaterial participation\u201d in the \u201cmanagement of the production of \u2014 agricultural\u2014commodities\u201d thereon and that he did in fact so participate. Hence \u201cwe have before us \u2014 a fully reviewable question of law,\u201d (Conlay v. Ribicoff, 294 F.2d 190, 194 (9 Cir. 1961) for the evidentiary facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom will provide an answer as to whether the Secretary has made a proper determination of the applicability of Section 211(a) (1) supra to the facts here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> In the light of the growing judicial decisions in the field of claims for old-age insurance benefits based on self-employment <em>income from farm </em>operations it would be superfluous for us to restate applicable law and the standards for our review of the Secretary\u2019s decision in the case at bar. Foster v. Celebrezze, 313 F. 2d 604 (8 Cir. 1963); Hoffman v. Ribicoff, 305 F.2d 1 (8 Cir. 1962); Conley v. Ribicoff, supra; Harper v. Flemming, 288 F.2d 61 (4 Cir. 1961); Henderson v. Flemming, 283 F.2d 882 (5 Cir. 1960); Boyd v. Folsom, 257 F.2d 778 (3 Cir. 1958). We think it sufficient to say that judicial review under the circumstances here depends upon whether the Referee's decision denying appellee\u2019s claim, which became the final decision of the Secretary, is supported by substantial evidence, as provided in Section 205(g) of the Act, supra. Judicial review under that section demands that a reviewing court satisfy itself \u201cthat the agency determination has warrant in the record, viewing that record as a whole, and a reasonable basis in law\u201d therefor. Boyd v. Folsom, supra, 1. c. 781. The performance of that judicial function can only be accomplished by a \u201ccase-to-ease consideration.\u201d Hoffman v. Ribicoff, supra, 1. c. 9; Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The facts in the case at bar may be tersely stated as follows: Appellee, a bachelor 76 years of age, owned 480 acres of land in North Dakota which he had dry-farmed for many years prior to 1951 or 1952. At that time, because of a heart condition, he made an \u201carrangement\u201d with Merle Gunlock, his adjoining neighbor, to farm his (appellee\u2019s) farm. That arrangement was oral and has always remained so. Although appellee and Gunlock \u201cnever did talk about a contract\u201d it is manifest that the \u201cmeeting of minds\u201d was that Gunlock would furnish the seed, do the seeding and cultivation and would pay one-half the combining, spraying and harvesting expense, appellee would pay the other half of such expense, maintain the two granaries on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the farm; that they would talk over the farm operations, but appellee would have final say as to decisions thereon; and the crop would be split three-fourths to Gunlock and one-fourth to appellee. However, that \u201carrangement\u201d was changed in 1956. Appellee then agreed to, and did thereafter, select and furnish all the seed, pay fifty per cent (50%) of the combining, spraying and harvesting and the cost of hauling the grain to the elevator where the crop was divided fifty-fifty. In Gunlock\u2019s own language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201c \u2014 we then started renting that way. \u2014 He (appellee) had to look after his interest then, you see\u2014 like he had to furnish the seed and he told me what he wanted summer fallowed, and he had to hire me to haul his share of the grain. He had to pay half the combining \u2014 spraying \u2014and more or less I was from then on \u2014 working for him (i. e. for appellee) .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">When the original arrangement was first made between appellee and Gunlock \u2014appellee was at his farm every week in the summertime and talked over with Gunlock the farm operations, i. e. about the seed to be sown, the planting thereof, the cultivation of the soil, spraying, weeding, what land was to be summer fallowed, and he was always present at harvesting. In 1956-1957, appellee visited his farm less often as he was required to give up his automobile on advice of his doctor who told him he should not drive alone with his heart condition. Yet he did visit the farm six to eight times during the planting and growing season, inspected the crops and talked over with Gunlock the cultivation, weeding and spraying for grasshoppers, and harvesting activities on the farm. Between visits to the farm he had a telephone available to discuss farm conditions with Gunlock, and did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">One issue here- is whether there was an \u201carrangement\u201d between appellee and Gunlock which provided for \u201cmaterial participation\u201d by appellee \u201cin the production of agricultural \u2014 commodities\u201d on his farm, within the ambit of 211(a) (1) supra. The Referee, in his decision which was adopted verbatim by the Secretary, concluded, \u201cthere is no evidence here of an \u2018arrangement\u2019 calling for material participation\u201d by appellee. In this connection, the Referee said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">\u201cIt is difficult for the hearing examiner to piece together from the alleged oral agreement under which the parties operated, any evidence that the parties had any \u2018arrangement\u2019 providing for material participation by the claimant. Of course, the oral agreement did not spell out any \u2018arrangement\u2019 for material participation. In the absence of any \u2018arrangement\u2019 the issue of actual <em>material participation </em>does not arise, Secondly, as aforestated, in the absence of any <em>\u2018arrangement\u2019 </em>activities which are purely voluntary on the part of the landlord do not count. However, for the sake of discussion, we will presume, without conceding, the existence of an \u2018arrangement\u2019 to materially participate, if we find <em>actual </em>material participation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Since the final decision of the Hearing Examiner was solely premised in a finding \u201cthat claimant did not materially participate in the production or management of production of farm commodities in either 1957 or 1958\u201d and there was no specific finding either way that appellee had an \u201carrangement to materially participate\u201d in the production, we think the only legal conclusion to be reached from the facts is that there was such an \u201carrangement\u201d between appellee and Gunlock, within the ambit of Section 211(a) (1) of the Act supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">It is manifest from the record here that throughout'the existence of the \u201carrangement\u201d between appellee and Gun-lock they conferred on all farming operations, that they never had any misunderstanding in respect thereto, that Gunlock considered his farming was to be in accordance to appellee\u2019s desires and that he considered appellee had to be satisfied in respect to his (Gunlock\u2019s) farming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>operations. This is made evident by Gun-lock\u2019s testimony when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">\u201cQ. Who would have the final say on spraying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cA. Well-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cQ. Let\u2019s assume that you and he didn\u2019t agree. He saw a few grasshoppers and \u2014 let\u2019s say, the whole thing\u2019s going to cost $75 to spray them \u2014 \u2018let\u2019s not\u2019. And you thought \u2018Let\u2019s.\u2019 Suppose that situation\u2014 who would \u2014 whose decision would control ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">\u201cA. Well, we\u2019ve never come to any understanding like that. I know \u2014I know when we were infested with grasshoppers there, why \u2014 why Martin (appellee) was the first one to suggest spraying, and, of course, I agreed upon it. And, of course, it was done by-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">\u201cQ. It was a joint decision in other words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">\u201cA. Not necessarily. He\u2019s the one that wanted to do the spraying, you see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">As a consequence, the Referee in his report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">\u201cWhen they did consult on this question they were in agreement, and a joint agreement was made to spray by airplane. The tenant conceded that in case of conflict the final decision in this area was with the claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Appellee\u2019s positive testimony is: \u201cI do all the inspecting and management necessary on my farm. I have the right to and do make all final management decisions.\u201d Although by his other testimony he did not spell out in detail all the directions and control of a managerial character performed by him, the only reasonable inference to be made from all the facts appearing in the record is that he did act in a managerial capacity. From a consideration of the record as a whole it appears that appellee and Gunlock did discuss and talk over all matters relating to the fa:rm operations; that they always agreed thereon, but appellee very apparently had the final decision in all areas of such operations under the \u201carrangement\u201d he had with Gunlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">From the record here, there is no proof of facts to sustain the Referee\u2019s conclusion that the relationship of landlord and tenant existed between appellee and Gun-lock. There is no manifestation by act, word or deed, that the \u201carrangement\u201d between those parties provided for any \u201cletting\u201d or \u201cleasing\u201d of appellee\u2019s farm to Gunlock, whereby the latter was ever put in \u201cpossession\u201d of the farm to the exclusion of full enjoyment and right of possession remaining in appellee. The legal inference from the facts is that \u201cpossession\u201d of the farm land, at all times, remained in appellee, the owner thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">In 52 C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 797, p. 721, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-17\">\u201cIf the language used in the agreement imports a present demise of any character by which any interest in the land passes to the occupier or if the agreement confers upon the cultivator the exclusive possession of the premises, the relation of landlord and tenant will, as a general rule, be created, whereas if there is a joint occupation or an occupation which does not exclude the owner from possession the contract is a mere letting on shares, and the relation of landlord and tenant is not created thereby, the occupier being a mere cultivator or cropper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">In accord: Gibbons v. Huntsinger, 105 Mont. 562, 74 P.2d 443 (1937); Hampton v. Struve, 160 Neb. 305, 70 N.W.2d 74 (1955) ; Paulson v. Rogis, 247 Iowa 893, 77 N.W.2d 33, (1956); Davis v. Burton, 126 Mont. 137, 246 P.2d 236 (1952); Wilke v. Simon, 46 S.D. 422, 193 N.W. 666 (1923); Minneapolis Iron Store Co. v. Branum, 36 N.D. 355, 162 N.W. 543 L.R.A.1917E, 298 (1917); Marken v. Robideaux Grain Co., 56 N.D. 94, 216 N. W. 197 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-19\">Ordinarily, in the absence of a specific agreement therefor; a partnership will not be inferred between a landowner and the cultivator of his land.- But, a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tract for the cultivation of land on shares such as here established, may constitute a joint adventure between appellee and Gunlock whereby they jointly engaged in cultivation of the farm land in question, the one furnishing the land and management and the other the labor and machinery, both sharing the expenses of cultivation, spraying and harvesting, and agreeing to divide the crops. Such agreement possesses every element of a joint adventure in the operation of farm land. See 52 C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 798, p. 723. All that is essential to a legal absolutism concerning that matter is to find the intent of the parties, which under the facts here can only be determined by the rule concerning subsequent action of the parties as a criterion of in* terpretation of their agreement, in the absence of evidence of specific agreement thereon. That is a legal question, stated in Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 235(e) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cIf the conduct of the parties subsequent to a manifestation of intention indicates that all the parties placed a particular interpretation upon it, that meaning is adopted if a reasonable person could attach it to the manifestation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In review of the record here, as a whole, we think it is made manifest that appellee and Gunlock had a meeting of minds and intended as a part of their \u201carrangement\u201d that it was to be as appellee put it, \"I\u2019m out there telling him how to do everything\u201d and such was an integral part of their original agreement. Any inference <em>contra </em>in the setting of this case, at the critical time of appellee\u2019s right to claim old-age benefits, considering the area of production of agriculture where appellee\u2019s farm was situated, the conduct of the parties, and the manner by which grain production operations were conducted on appellee\u2019s farm, seems to us to be a misinterpretation of the \u201carrangement\u201d appellee and Gunlock intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">OASI Bulletin 135, \u00a7\u00a7 1007-1012, gives some guides as to the existence of a partnership or joint adventure, as the Secretary considers that subject. \u00a7 1008 thereof states \u201csome factors indicative\u201d thereof to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">A. Conduct of the business as a joint undertaking, not as a sole ownership; (Such is the proof here)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">B. Contribution of capital or service to the business by each party; (Such is the proof here)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">C. A sharing in management decisions and other responsibilities; (Such is the proof here)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">D. A sharing in the profits and risk of loss in accordance with the \u25a0parties\u2019 agreement. (Such is the proof here)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">E. A holding out of the business to the public in such manner as to indicate that the parties are partners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">There is no evidence of such a holding out. However, as said by the Secretary:</p>\n<p id=\"AAZ\">\u201cIt is not necessary that all of these factors be present in order for an arrangement to be considered a partnership or joint adventure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">In Section 1022 of that bulletin, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-16\">\u201c \u2014 (I)f both the farm owner and the person working the land are involved in the management and control of the farm operations or in the day-to-day operations of the farm, they may be partners (and) both parties are farm operators and self-employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-17\">In such bulletin the Secretary treats \u201cpartnerships\u201d and \u201cjoint adventures\u201d as being synonymous. The parties to a joint adventure need not always be jointly involved in management or jointly involved in physical activities of production on the farm. See 30 Am.Jur., Joint Adventures, \u00a7 17, p. 951. Management and control may be in the owner of the land and the work done on the farm may be in another. The right to control of production on the land, and exercise of such control, we think, spells out \u201cmaterial participation\u201d as required by Section 211(a) (1) of the Act supra. The legislative history of that section as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>forth in the Hoffman opinion, supra, at 1. e. 5, makes that clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We think the Secretary erred in the case at bar by treating appellee and Gunlock as landlord and tenant when no such relationship was legally shown to exist. They should have been considered as \u201cjoint adventurers\u201d in the farm operation in question. Seemingly, the Secretary was led to the erroneous conclusion that a landlord-and-tenant relation existed because the Referee assumed that to be the situation at the outset of the hearing on appellee\u2019s claim for old-age insurance benefits and he overlooked or was unfamiliar with the \u201cdry-farming\u201d operation as conducted in the area of agricultural production where appellee\u2019s farm was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">For instance, the Hearing Examiner, at the commencement of such hearing, after explaining the nature and purpose thereof to appellee, said, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201cHearing Examiner: Now, the procedure in this case is quite simple. We\u2019re going to ask you some questions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\u201cMartin Wifstad: Don\u2019t talk too big words 'cuz I don't understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">\u201cHearing Examiner: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">Thereupon certain exhibits were marked and in respect thereto the Hearing Examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">\u201cNow, the exhibits in the record as we now have them, indicate that you are the owner of a 480-acre farm that has been operated by Merle Gunlock, who is not a relative of yours, under a <em>share crop agreement, </em>and that the principal source of income was grain \u2014 wheat, barley, flax, and so forth; and that you included crop share rentals in the amounts reported as self-employment income. From the various statements made, it would appear that Merle Gunlock, <em>your tenant, leased </em>these lands under some sort of <em>oral agreement </em>\u2014 no written agreement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">\u201cMartin Wifstad: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">\u201cHearing Examiner: -and the claimant, that\u2019s you, as your share of the <em>rentals </em>received one-half of the grain produced and the <em>tenant </em>received the other one-half.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-16\">\u201cMartin Wifstad: Yah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-17\">\u201cHearing Examiner: -and you shared expenses pursuant to the-statements you\u2019ve made contained in the farm questionnaires which are-all part of the record. Now, the-Bureau determined that you did not. materially participate in the production or in the management of production on the farm in either of those years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-19\">\u201cMartin Wifstad: Well, I did.\u201d' (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-20\">Under further examination by the-Hearing Examiner, appellee testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-21\">\u201cQ. Tell me a little bit what you do when you go out there to the-farm. You tell me that you go out there about four or five times a year. What do you do when you go out there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-22\">\u201cA. Well, you\u2019ve got to cultivate the summer fallow to get the weeds-down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-23\">\u201cQ. You\u2019ve got to cultivate summer fallow. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-24\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-25\">\u201cQ. Doesn\u2019t Gunlock know enough to do that without you telling him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-26\">\u201cA. Oh, yes, but then I\u2019ve got to-see it\u2019s done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-27\">\u201cQ. I see, in other words, the-tenant does it on his own, but you just double check to make sure it\u2019s-done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-28\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-29\">\u201cQ. Anything else done as a result of these inspections four or five-times a year? Tell me what other recommendations or suggestions you. make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-30\">\u201cA. Well, then we talk over what kind of wheat we\u2019ve got to have, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201cQ. When do you do that \u2014 in the spring or in the fall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201cA. In the spring. The kind of seed we\u2019re going to have. It rusts once in a while. We\u2019ve got to get the rust-proof wheat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">\u201cQ. In other words, in the spring of the year, you decide on what seed to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201cQ. Any other things that you talked about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t think of anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">\u201cQ. O. K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">\u201cA. I\u2019m doing all I\u2019m suppose to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">\u201cQ. Do you consider Mr. Gunlock a good sound tenant ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-14\">\u201cQ. Do you rely on his judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">\u201cA. You mean, I O. K. it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">\u201cQ. Not O. K. it, but if he does something on his own \u2014 can he do something on his own? Do you rely on him doing the right thing \u2014 do you rely \u2014 can you rely on his own judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-17\">\u201cA.

About four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqH\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-21\">\u201cQ. -in other words, in our determination today we can forget about any physical work done by you, right?

I\u2019m just managing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-26\">The Referee said in his decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIc\">\u201cSumming up the substantial credible evidence, it appears that after the farm plan was formulated in the spring, that is, deciding when, where, and what seed and what to summer fallow, the <em>day-to-day production activities </em>were left to the tenant. <em>The tenant could go ahead and harvest the grain when ripe without consulting the claimant. </em>The claimant admitted that the tenant was a good, successful and sound farmer, that the tenant exercised good judgment, and that he relied on the tenant\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-27\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR9\">\u201cThe credible evidence establishes that the tenant was primarily responsible for production of agricultural commodities on the claimant\u2019s land, performed all the labor, provided the farm machinery, <em>paid a greater share of the farm expenses, and for all practical purposes, had full control and dominion over the land and over the operation and management </em>of the farm, and was not dependent upon his <em>aged landlord </em>to significantly assist him in the operations during the years in question.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-28\">The hearing before the Referee lasted about two hours. His decision on the facts covers nineteen printed pages in <em>the record on </em>appeal. We think <em>there </em>is much errancy of fact as well as reasoning and conclusions stated therein. We briefly note it was stated in that decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-29\">\u201cThe hearing examiner was impressed with the claimant\u2019s honesty, candor, and sincerity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-30\">At the conclusion of the hearing held by him he asked appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-31\">\u201cBefore we adjourn, is there anything that you\u2019d like to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cMartin Wifstad: We\u2019ve told the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u201cHearing Examiner: Yes, I feel that all three gentlemen are very-honest, frank, and candid about the answers, and I have no question about the truth or veracity of you three gentlemen.. It\u2019s just a matter of evaluating the evidence as it is, whether there\u2019s any serious conflict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">There is no evidence that Gunlock \u201ccould\u201d or did \u201cgo ahead and harvest the grain when ripe without consulting the claimant.\u201d The evidence is that appellee was always present at harvest-time and that he and Gunlock did consult regarding such activity, as well as all other operations of the farm, and appellee had \u201cthe right to and did make all final management decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">At the critical time to appellee\u2019s claim for old-age benefits, Gunlock did not pay \u201ca greater share of the farm expenses, and (did not) for all practical purposes (have) full control and dominion over the land and over the operations and management of the farm\u201d \u2014 and such are not reasonable inferences, factually or legally sustainable by the evidence here. On the contrary, appellee had \u201cfull control and dominion over the land\u201d and paid the \u201cgreater share of the farm expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> Appellee\u2019s farm was a typical dry land, small grain operation in western North Dakota. There are no habitable quarters on the farm; only two grain barns were located thereon. Even when appellee farmed his land alone, he resided in town. We take judicial notice of \u201cdry farming\u201d operations. It is a subject one may consult in publications of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Departments of Agriculture of all the western states. But when one does, he will look in vain for any description or reference to \u201c \u2018day-to-day\u2019 farm operations\u201d in the theory thereof \u2014 which apparently seemed to be a cardinal point considered by the Referee in his decision in the case at bar, which he perceived but did not define. From all literature on the subject it is clear that there are \u201cfew areas of decision for dry land farm operations.\u201d' We need not review the technique thereof. It is sufficient to say that management of dry farming operations relate-mainly to the storage and retention of moisture in the soil, the water requirements of plants as a basis for crop selection, soil management and methods of crop rotation and utilization and clean-summer fallowing. And proper \u201csummer fallowing\u201d is recognized as of utmost importance to the success of such farm operation. Appellee very apparently recognized that to be a fact from his-, \u201cexperience\u201d because it was one of the first subjects mentioned by him when he was asked to describe his management directions of production activities on his farm. Appellee could not have contributed anything more to \u201cmanagement of production\u201d to the dry farming operations conducted on his farm than he did, had he been there every day in the year. That he had an \u201carrangement\u201d with Gun-lock to participate in the production of agricultural products on his land is manifest from the acts and conduct of the-parties as to how such operations were conducted. That he did so participate-is also established. Such is a legal conclusion to be made in applying appellee\u2019s, claim for old-age benefits to the statutory standards, as established by the record as a whole, presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">A significant matter appearing in the record of this case is that \u2014 very apparently, the Referee in arriving at his decision denying appellee\u2019s claim for old-age benefits, was influenced by the fact, that Gunlock was \u201ca good, successful and sound farmer, and was not dependent upon his <em>aged </em>landlord to significantly assist him in the operation\u201d of his (appellee\u2019s) farm. The Referee emphasized that matter in his decision, first, by considering a single statement made by claimant, that \u201c(i)f I\u2019m not there he\u2019ll (Gunlock) do it anyway\u201d; and, secondly, by reasoning that a young, modern and scientific farmer is more effective than a 76-year-old farmer, brought up in the \u201chorse and buggy\u201d days who has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u25a0\u201cdry farming\u201d his own land for years, who knew the condition of the soil, what \u25a0seeds to plant, what land to put in summer fallow, when in dry seasons to spray the crops, and how all that was to be \u2022done, because of years of experience, The fallacy of the Referee\u2019s reasoning is \u25a0exemplified in the footnote, where he undertook to interrogate appellee\u2019s witness Albert Heide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The philosophy the Referee there stated seemingly permeated all his reasoning when he came to consider the undisputed facts in the case at bar; so much so, that it became decisional in his mind, that appellee possibly did not participate in the \u201cmanagement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of production of agricultural commodities\u201d on his farm. Manifestly, such philosophy is unsound, to say the least, and <em>contra </em>to the concept of self-employment coverage as contemplated by the Congress in the enactment of Section 211(a) (1) supra. (Cf.) Harper v. Flemming, supra, 1.c. 63, 64. Ordinarily, \u201cfallacy of reasoning\u201d such as appears in the footnote will not singularly be latched upon as grounds for reversal of an administrative order, if the conclusion reached by the fact-finding body has other reasonable evidentiary basis in the record therefor. Hoffman v. Ribicoff, supra, 1. c. 6. But where, as here, it appears to have become decisional, we cannot disregard it. \u201cThe grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based.\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">At bottom the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requirement of Section 205(g) supra controlling review here, places the burden of persuasion upon the applicant to establish his right to Social Security Benefits, but that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cdoes not demand that the (appellee) settle all problems or even all the important problems that arise in connection with the operation of (his) farm, for the word \u2018participation\u2019 denotes joint activity in the entire enterprise and its modifier \u2018material\u2019 only requires that the activity be of substantial value or importance. No decisions are conceivable under the present facts that are more important to the enterprise than those relating to the type and quantity of the crops\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At5O\">the cultivation of the land and the manner in which crops were grown on appellee\u2019s farm. Conley v. Ribicoff, 294 F. 2d 1. c. 195. So far as wheat was grown thereon, the quantity admittedly was subject-to control by ASC Regulations. But, the type and quality of the wheat seed that was sown, as well as that of barley and flax, was selected by appellee. This because of his long experience with dry farming operations on his land. The risk of profit from such operation was one jointly shared by appellee and Gun-lock. If the crop failed they both lost \u2014 \u25a0 abundant harvest produced their profit. Appellee cannot be penalized because he joined in that joint adventure with a \u201cgood successful and sound farmer\u201d which very apparently was also a reasoned premise for the Referee\u2019s decision here. That is and was an unreasonable inference and conclusion on which to premise a denial of appellee\u2019s claim for old-age benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">When the facts here are tested by the proper legal standard they demonstrate that appellee is entitled to old-age insurance benefits under Section 211(a) (1) of the Act, supra. We cannot sustain the negative answer as given to that claim by the Secretary in the case at bar because there is no substantial evidence which affords a basis therefor. Kerner v. Flemming, 283 F.2d 916 (2 Cir. 1960); Butler v. Flemming, 288 F.2d 591 (5 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The Secretary\u2019s singular reliance on our opinion in Hoffman v. Ribicoff, supra, to sustain such a denial is misplaced. The facts in the case at bar are clearly distinguishable from those found and the issues that existed in that opinion of ours. In the Hoffman case there was a specific finding that no arrangement existed at the critical time of Hoffman\u2019s qualification for old-age insurance benefits. There was also a specific finding that he did not, personally or vicariously, \u201cpar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ticipate in the management of production\u201d on his farm land. There was substantial evidence concerning both such findings and that is what was sustained by our review in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-12\"><em>. </em>Mr. Albert Heide, County Treasurer of Divide County, North Dakota for 22 years, a witness on behalf of appellee, was examined by the Referee, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">Q. --This is a hypothetical question I\u2019m asking. It\u2019s predicated on these facts: 363 acres of land farmed by a tenant who has been farming for himself since 1952. A tenant who is well-versed in farming, who has good farming judgment. And suppose Mr. Wifstad took \u2022off and went down to Florida and retired. Or suppose the situation was that he was here every spring to formulate the farm plan and so forth \u2014 he tells him which acres to seed, and where to seed it, and what seed to use, and took off for Florida and didn\u2019t come back the entire year. Do you think his absence would have any significant effect on the farm yield?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-16\">\u201cA. Well, of course-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-17\">\u201cQ. I don\u2019t expect you to answer it, I just am asking if you have any opinion. That\u2019s up to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-18\">\u201cA. I think he has a very good renter, but that they \u2014 now, it may be that with Martin\u2019s additional years in the farming game would mean that he gives him some good tips once in a while that helps to-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-19\">\u201cQ. Let me ask you this in general, not in particular application to this case, but in general. I know that you are kind of a neutral party, yet you understand farming, you know farmers, and deal with farmers. What value is \u2014 let\u2019s take a 75 year old farmer who, excuse me, who is brought up in the horse and buggy days, if you pardon my expression \u2014 what value would his judgment be with reference to a farmer 45 years old who is brought up in the scentific farm age? Can you superimpose that judgment on a younger man\u2019s judgment and come up with an increase of farm yield, or have you just got a situation where two cooks are trying to spoil the broth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-20\">\u201cA. (Chuckling) I think that as in all areas of life, for instance, a doctor who has a son who becomes a doctor, and the fact that the father is still on the staff, I would rather go to that clinic because there alone because of the experience has the father was there than if the son was given him wisdom that the son hasn\u2019t got.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-22\">\u201cQ. We\u2019re kind of getting off the subject, that medicine has reached the point\u2014 this is really no exaggeration \u2014 that a machine, if there were such a machine, could do a better job in evaluating a person\u2019s impairment than a man could. What I mean by that, if there were such a machine that could take your blood pressure, your blood count, your electrocardiogram, your BUN, and goodness knows what else besides, get all the results of these tests, and run them through an IBM machine and out comes a card saying \u2018This man is ready for the graveyard. He\u2019s got hypertension, blah, blah, blah.\u2019 Seriously, that type of scientific evaluation based upon \u2014 it\u2019s really a mathematical evaluation based upon medical tests, is so far superior to any so-called country doctor, or the city doctor, or general practitioner, who through age and experience can render that it\u2019s the difference between night and day. It\u2019s a scientific fact. A lot of people like an old doctor because of his experience \u2014 not me, I know better \u2014 in my own experience and in the experience of my family. And you can talk about old lawyers \u2014 \u2018Oh, I like to go to an old lawyer \u2014 he knows all the tricks.\u2019 It\u2019s a lot of baloney! A young man out of law school with two years\u2019 experience is a far sounder lawyer today than a lawyer practicing for 25 years, exclusive of certain courtroom tricks, which are kind of meaningless nowadays because the tricks in the trade are gone as far as lawyers go, as you probably know. New discovery procedures and depositions' \u2014 there aren\u2019t any more tricks \u2014 both sides know what the other side has \u2014 they\u2019ve prepared the case for six months or so\u2014 pictures and statements, and so forth. It\u2019s like the courtroom lawyer of the past \u2014 it\u2019s a thing of the past \u2014 the same with the old country doctor, and city doctors of the past. A doctor can tell more in a two-hour examination, taking the blood pressure and so forth, than going to an old doctor who will look at him, and take his blood pressure and so forth. We are sort of getting off the Subject, but getting back to our subject which is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>farm question, is there any value that an old gentleman who has been brought up in a different theory or different era of agriculture- \u2014 is his judgment significant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">*\u2018A. Well, I have a father that\u2019s on the farm and manages the farm \u2014 not the one I have, but I notice that he raises a better crop than I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-12\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s the answer. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">\u201cA. I think it is experience. Now, I think what you said about the doctor is correct, but even at that, experience does give you something that nothing else gives you.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
