It contends that the case of F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Goldston, Tex.Civ.App., 1940, 155 S.W.2d 830, writ of error refused for want of merit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cholds directly and specifically to the contrary.\u201d In that case there was no evidence that the storekeeper was responsible for the banana peel upon which the plaintiff slipped, while in this case there was evidence that bottles frequently dropped to the floor and that a porter was regularly assigned to inspect the aisles, and further evidence that a package boy may simply have failed properly to clean the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-21\">In an annotation on \u201cliability of proprietor of store, office, or similar business premises for injury from fall due to presence of litter or debris on floor,\u201d the Annotator states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-22\"><em>\u201c \u00bb x </em>* where the floor condition is one which is traceable to the proprietor\u2019s own act \u2014 that is, a condition created by him or under his authority \u2014 or is a condition in connection with which the proprietor is shown to have taken action, no proof of notice is necessary.9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-23\">\u201c9 No case falling within the scope of this annotation has so much as intimated disagreement with, or possible qualification of, this principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-24\">61 A.L.R.2d pp. 1, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-25\">The defendant fails to draw the distinction between the duty owed to a gratuitous licensee and that owed to a business visitor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-26\">\u201c * * * There is only one particular in which one who holds his land open for the reception of busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ness visitors is under a greater duty in respect to its physical condition than a possessor who holds his land open to the visits of a gratuitous licensee. The possessor has no financial interest in the entry of a gratuitous licensee; and, therefore, such a licensee is entitled to expect nothing more than an honest disclosure of the dangers which are known to the possessor. On the other hand, the visit of a business visitor is or may be financially beneficial to the possessor. Such a visitor is entitled to expect that the possessor will take reasonable care to discover the actual condition of the premises and either make them safe or warn him of dangerous conditions. As stated in \u00a7 342, a possessor owes to a bare licensee only the duty to exercise reasonable care to disclose to him dangerous defects which are known to him and are likely to be undiscovered by the licensee. Toward the business visitor, the possessor owes the additional duty to exercise reasonable care to make the land safe for the reception of his visitor or, at the least, to ascertain the actual condition of the land so that by warning the visitor thereon, he may give the visitor an opportunity to decide intelligently whether or not to accept the invitation or permission.\u201d 2 Restatement of Torts, A. L.I. \u00a7 343, Comment a, pp. 939, 940.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Citing, among other authorities, that section of the Restatement, the Supreme Court of Texas has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">\u201cThe law places upon the owner or occupant of land the duty to use reasonable care to make and keep the premises safe for the use of persons invited to use the premises for business purposes, Carlisle v.
