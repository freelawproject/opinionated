Thereafter he was committed to the Philadelphia State Hospital, and from there transferred to the Farview State Hospital. The district judge found, and his finding is supported by the record, that the petitioner had failed to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State. The denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was therefore proper. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
