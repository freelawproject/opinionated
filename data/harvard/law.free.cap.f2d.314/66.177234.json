The rights of Owens and of the corporation as against each other were not in issue there. The issue was whether the agreements secured from those parties by Heinz were valid. Consequently, that judgment did not by virtue of law create license or ownership rights' in the corporation greater in extent than the rights created by its agreement with Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Since the corporation\u2019s interest in the patents had terminated prior to issuance of the injunction, we can find no interest on the part of the corporation in the protection of the patent rights, which was the chief protective function of the injunction. Any interest the corporation may have had in the injunction would seem to us to attach only to that decree\u2019s declaration that the parties (including the corporation) were not bound to Heinz by any agreement granting rights to build generators.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">It was therefore proper for Heinz to deal directly and solely with Owens with reference to the subject matter of its agreement of settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">If upon equitable grounds the corporation had rights against Owens to share in Owens\u2019 settlement with Heinz, there is no evidence that Heinz had notice of such matters and appellant\u2019s remedy is against Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
