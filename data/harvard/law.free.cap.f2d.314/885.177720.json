The grounds for the motion were alleged to be those-of newly discovered evidence, Rule 60(b) Fed.R.Civ.P., and fraud in the procurement of the award. United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a). The employer filed affidavits in support of its motion. The employee then moved for judgment on the pleadings and the employer\u2019s affidavits. The employer\u2019s motion to vacate was denied. The employee's motion for judgment was granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-20\">Under the arbitrator\u2019s award Bridgeport was ordered to reinstate with back pay an employee, Theodore Brown, who had been discharged under suspicion of complicity in the theft of materials from appellant\u2019s plant. The arbitrator, finding that the evidence offered against Brown in the arbitration proceeding consisted of \u201cmere rumor and gossip\u201d, found that the employer to the employer\u2019s knowledge at the time of the discharge did not have just cause to discharge Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-21\">Appellant, when it petitioned the district court to vacate the award, claimed to possess evidence uncovered after the arbitration award which conclusively established Brown\u2019s complicity, during his employment, in the thefts that then occurred, and alleged that Brown\u2019s testimony at the arbitration hearing, being perjurious, resulted in a fraudulent award. The trial judge held that the employer\u2019s affidavits failed to satisfy the employer\u2019s burden of proof. Upon oral argument before us appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he was prepared to submit to us additional confirmatory information demonstrating Brown\u2019s complicity in the thefts and his perjury, which information had been obtained after the docketing of the appeal. That the employer at the time his motion was presented to the district court may have had, or may now have, sufficient evidence to justify a discharge of Brown for cause if he were now in the employer\u2019s employ is irrelevant to the issues the arbitrator heard and has no bearing upon the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>determination that the employer did not have just cause to discharge him in 1961. Brown\u2019s guilt, if now proved, does not require the conclusion that the arbitrator\u2019s award, when made, was procured by fraud, for the decision of the arbitrator was based upon the failure of the employer\u2019s proof to convince rather than \u2022on the strength of Brown\u2019s alleged perjurious testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">We do not imply by what we have said here that the employer cannot commence whatever actions it may be advised to pursue for the alleged conversion of its property \u2014 or to imply that, upon Brown\u2019s reinstatement, it may not, if so advised, forthwith discharge him for just cause. We only hold that the parties, having agreed to an arbitration of their differences, are bound by the arbitration award made upon the testimony before the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">We affirm the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
