As to the first we find the record shows a conflict in the evidence on the issue of whether appellant suffered any mental disease, defect or disorder and whether, if he did, the act was its \u201cproduct.\u201d The court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>charge as originally given on the burden of proof on this issue was deficient and upon counsel\u2019s timely objection the District Judge restated the burden of proof. Defense counsel made no further point or comment and in these circumstances we must view the corrective instruction as one which he approved. We have also considered appellant\u2019s other contentions and find no error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\">. In the charge to the jury the statement was made that when the \u201cpresumption of sanity is called into question by evidence which may tend to show he was not [sane] <em>the presumption vanishes, and is no longer to he considered.\u201d </em>This was incorrect; it inadvertently overlooked Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469 at 486-488, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L. Ed. 499 (1895), which explicitly held' that the presumption of sanity remains in the case and is to be considered by the jury along with all other evidence. The error was not prejudicial to the accused, however, and may be disregarded' under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
