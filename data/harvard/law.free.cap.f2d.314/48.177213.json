The petitioner contends that he was denied due process of law because his plea of guilty was accepted by the state court when he was without the aid of counsel and was not mentally competent either to represent himself or to waive the assistance of counsel. Counsel for petitioner in this Court concedes that this contention has not been presented to the state court. The dismissal of the petition must therefore be affirmed. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254; Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 203-204, 70 S.Ct. 587, 94 L.Ed. 761 (1950).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
