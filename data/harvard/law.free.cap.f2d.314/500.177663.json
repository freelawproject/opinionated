They had also filed in the District Court a stipulation for dismissal of the action without prejudice. The District Court entered a dismissal pursuant to this stipulation. As it now appears that the proceeding below has been dismissed, and that accordingly no purpose would be served in vacating the decree with directions to dismiss, cf. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 1950, 340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36; Walling v. James V. Reuter, 1944, 321 U.S. 671, 64 S.Ct. 826, 88 L.Ed. 1001, and see cases cited note 3 of our original opinion, 303 F.2d 5, 8, the appeal is dismissed pursuant to stipulation of the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
