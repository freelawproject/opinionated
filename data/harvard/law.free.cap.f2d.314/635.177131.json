Cf: Douglas Laboratories Corporation v. Copper Tan, Inc., 2 Cir. 1954, 210 F.2d 453. Appellant sought an injunction and an accounting. Various defenses and counterclaims appeared in the answer, such-as (a) allegations of a prior use by appellees; (b) a prior state trademark registration by appellees of \u201cCopatint\u201d in New York, Florida and California, and the prior registration of \u201cCopper Tan\u201d' in California; (c) the lack of competition between the parties; and (d) the-lack of confusion between their products.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-25\">Thereafter a consent judgment was entered on November 12, 1959 in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, decreeing (1) the ownership of the trademark Coppertone in appellant; (2) that use of the words Copa Tan, Copa Cream and Copa Tint by appellees was likely to cause-confusion; (3) that appellees were per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>petually restrained from using the names Copatan, Copatint or Copacream, \u201cor any other names confusingly similar thereto,\u201d or to use Coppertone, or \u201cto use the word, root, prefix or suffix Copa or Copper;\u201d and (4) the injunction was stayed to July 1, 1961, to permit the appellees to sell their present stock of goods. Despite this stay, a writ of permanent injunction containing language similar to that of the consent judgment was issued May 11, 1961, and served on May 12, 1961, on appellees. On June 9, 1961, within the period of the original stay, appellant\u2019s agent purchased from appellees two suntan products manufactured by appellees, one labeled C5ca Tan and one labeled Coca Tint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">An order to show cause charging appellees with violation of the injunction was issued June 13, 1961. An affidavit was filed, alleging the original litigation above mentioned had been settled by the signing of a contract, and the payment by appellant to appellees of $20,750.00, and that the only issue before the court below on the order to show cause was \u201cwhether or not the use of the words Coca Tan and Coca Tint are within the scope of the injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">At the hearing, Exhibits II, LL and MM were placed in evidence and plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 counsel stipulated that certain affidavits might be considered as evidence. Further, the plaintiff offered a certain portion of the deposition of Harry B. Solmson taken on November 8, 1961, which was received in evidence. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendants moved the court to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s order to show cause on the ground that no sufficient showing of contempt had been made. Defendants\u2019 motion was argued, and the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law were entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">\u201c1. The Plaintiff is the owner of the trademark Coppertone which it affixes to containers of suntan lotions as represented by Exhibit MM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">\u201c2. The Defendants are the owners of the trademarks Coca Tan and Coca Tint which marks are affixed' to containers of suntan lotions as represented by Exhibits LL and IIr respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\">\u201c3. Plaintiff is the owner of certain rights, titles and interests in Copa Tan, Copa Tint and Copa Cream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">\u201c4. Plaintiff is not and has never used the names Copa Tan, Copa Tint and Copa Cream in connection with any of its products, goods or services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-14\">\u201c5. The names Coca Tan and! Coca Tint are not confusingly similar to Copa Tan, Copa Tint and Copa Cream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">\u201c6. It is not true that the Defendants\u2019 trademarks Coca Tan and Coca Tint are mere colorable attempts to avoid confusion with Plaintiff\u2019s trademark Coppertone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-16\">\u201c7. The Plaintiff has produced' no evidence showing that the Defendants are now using any trademark confusingly similar to Coppertone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-17\">\u201cCONCLUSIONS OF LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-18\">\u201c1. The Defendants by the utilization of trademarks Coca Tan and' Coca Tint or suntan lotions are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>selling a product which is confusingly similar to Plaintiff\u2019s product Coppertone as applied to suntan lotions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\"><em>\u201c2. </em>By the use of Coca Tan and Coca Tint the Defendants are not selling suntan products which are confusingly similar to Copa Tan, Copa Tint and Copa Cream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201c3. Defendants are not now infringing the trademark Coppertone by reason of the selling, marketing and distributing of suntan products under the names Coca Tan and Coca Tint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201c4. Defendants are not now infringing or damaging any rights Plaintiff has in the names Copa Tan, Copa Tint and Copa Cream by reason of Defendants selling, marketing and distributing suntan products under the trademarks Coca Tan and Coca Tint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The judgment entered was that plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for an order to show cause why defendants-appellees should not be punished for contempt be, and it was, dismissed. Timely appeal was taken here. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The court below found no \u201cconfusing similarity\u201d between the words Copa Tan, Copa Tint, and Copa Cream and Coca Tan and Coca Tint. Appellant urges this is clear error; the appellees urge that appellant simply failed to prove its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Appellant urges that all appellees have done is change one letter. This is not true. The original injunction referred to four coined words \u2014 Coppertone, Copatan, Copatint and Copacream. Coppertone is not here involved or material. The alleged infringement is composed of a pair of <em>two-word </em>phrases: Coca Tan; Coca Tint. The trial court took notice of this difference. Not only does one word become two, but the \u201cp\u201d becomes \u201cc\u201d, and to the \u201co\u201d there is added a macron symbol (\u00f3). The trial court took notice of this difference. (Tr. p. 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">We have heretofore agreed with the Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 729, that the test in determining possibility of confusion is appearance, pronunciation and verbal translation. In Sleeper Lounge Co. v. Bell Manufacturing Co., 9 Cir. 1958, 253 F.2d 720, we phrased the question as whether there existed similarity of \u201csound, sight and meaning.\u201d Though likelihood of confusion depends upon many factors, the \u201cone essential feature, without which the others have no probative value,\u201d is the similarity between the registered marks and the alleged infringing mark or phrase. Sleeper Lounge v. Bell Manufacturing Co., supra, at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">We have here considered the difference in specific appearance of the marks involved. The exhibits in evidence clearly disclose a difference in the general appearance of the <em>product </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the general appearance of the containers as a whole; their shape, color and design. There was no claim of similarity or likelihood of confusion therein. The only \u201csimilarity\u201d of packaging was that both were packaged in \u201cspray\u201d cans. Admittedly, the changes made in the alleged infringing phrase to some extent affect the physical appearance of the trademark. If pronounced correctly, there likewise exists a change in the phonetic sound. Thus, the danger of confusion if the words were but heard, rather than seen, is to some extent eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">If Copatan caused an audible verbal translation confusingly similar to Coppertone, it could only be because Copatan was pronounced with the short \u201co\u201d of \u201ckop'er\u201d. (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d ed., 1956.) If pronounced with the long \u201co\u201d of \u201cold\u201d, it would seem not to be confusingly similar in sound. Such an unconfusing pronunciation was insured by the placing of the macron symbol over the \u201co\u201d in the alleged infringing first word.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Counsel for appellant argue that perhaps the words Coca Tan might be mispronounced over the radio or on television. But there was no evidence of such mispronouncement, or of any other confusion. We can take judicial notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>of the fact that many suntan lotions are advertised by word of mouth only over the radio, and by word of mouth and by sight over television, but we cannot take judicial notice that many radio and/or television announcers do or would mispronounce simple words bearing a simple symbol of pronunciation so that such mistake occurs, or is likely to occur, in such numbers as to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In addition to the change in sight and sound, the prefix used \u2014 \u201cCoca\u201d-\u2014establishes a different meaning than that of the prohibited prefix \u201cCopa\u201d; if any is established by the latter. The use of cocoa-butter in suntanning concoctions is well known to the public. No such meaning is suggested by use of the prefix \u201cCopa\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We do agree with appellant that the seller of a trademark has a special duty to avoid confusion with a name he has sold. Fish Bros. Wagon Co. v. La Belle Wagon Works, 82 Wis. 546, 52 N.W. 595, 16 L.R.A. 453 (1892). The lower court concluded the seller had here avoided any such confusion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We also agree with appellant that an infringer, \u201conce caught,\u201d should have his conduct carefully scrutinized in any future operations so as to determine his intent in going as far as he does. He must \u201cbe required to keep a safe distance away from the margin line.\u201d Broderick &amp; Bascom Rope Co. v. Manoff, 6 Cir. 1930, 41 F.2d 353, 354.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">But here no one was \u201conce caught\u201d in the usual sense of those words. The consent decree is a two-edged sword. In the original suit appellant alleged it owned the trademark Coppertone \u2014 issued January 25, 1955; and that the trademark had acquired a secondary meaning; that Copatan and Copatint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> infringed Coppertone. Appellees urged as a defense, among many, that they had lawfully acquired the trademarked name Copatint by registration in New Yoik and Florida in July 1952 and in California in June 1952. This litigation was settled by the payment of a substantial sum of money to appellees by appellant, and a contract was entered into between them. The terms of that contract are not before us, although the fact of its existence is. What rights are therein established is not a question now before us. A consent judgment was entered into by the parties. We are required to and do respect it, and we are bound, as are the parties to it, by the law of the case. Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby Fabrics Corp., 2 Cir., 1962, 303 F.2d 283. But we do not draw any inferences from the pleadings and the consent decree that anyone was \u201ccaught\u201d doing anything. Appellees later either violated the injunction, or they did not. The court below held on the evidence before it that the defendants-appellees were not in violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">We keep in mind we are concerned here with a secondary meaning existing only as to one of the words mentioned in the injunction \u2014 the word Coppertone. No secondary meaning was alleged, claimed or proved as to Copatint or Copatan.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\"> We agree with appellant that the question is not whether there was confusion proved between the protected marks and the alleged infringing words, but whether there was a <em>likelihood </em>of such confusion existing. (Br., p. 10, and cases cited.) But one of the better ways to prove likelihood of confusion in the future is to prove it existed in the past. We cannot say there does exist a likelihood of any confusion, on the sparse record before this court. There is not one word of evidence as to the impact or effect of the supposed similarity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>products upon the market.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A \u201ctrademark is only protected <em>where </em>and <em>when, </em>and in the facts of each case, there is actual or likely confusion as to the source of the article in commerce.\u201d Mershon Co. v. Pachmayr, 9 Cir. 1955, 220 F.2d 879, 883. Appellant here has never used the words Copatan, Copatint or Copacream in any aspect of its business, either prior to or subsequent to the injunction. In fact, appellant had brought out new suntan lotion products after the purchase of these names, but had, by its own choice, preferred to use, and had used, the trademarks \u201cQT\u201d and \u201cRoyal Blend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">By its filing of this proceeding, appellant attempts, not to prevent competition with any product it produces under the name of Copatan, Copatint or Copacream (for it produces none), but to prevent the marketing in the competitive market of any product marked so that it <em>might </em>remind one of Coppertone. But as both the majority and the dissent in this case recognize \u2014 \u201cThe portion of the decree relating to Coppertone is irrelevant here.\u201d Yet that is the only competition here involved, under the facts of this case. We cannot read, on the evidence before us, any intent to palm off \u201cCoca Tan\u201d or \u201cCoca Tint\u201d as \u201cCoppertone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtS\">If that be so \u2014 so long as appellees do not use names confusingly similar to 'Copa Tan, Copa Cream and Copa Tint\u2014 &lt;for which, plus a specific agreement not to use \u201cthe word, root, prefix or suffix Copa or Copper,\u201d the appellees had been paid cash) the appellees, as the dissenting opinion states, \u201chad open to them a whole dictionary full of names, as well as all the fanciful names that could be fabricated from the entire alphabet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">The dissenting opinion is critical of the majority approach in \u201ccomparing the two [words] in juxtaposition only.\u201d Such an approach is here necessary because that comparison was the only evidence before the court below. There is an utter lack of proof:</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">(a) of confusion of one person buying \u201cCoca Tan\u201d thinking it was \u201cCoppertone\u201d or \u201cQT\u201d or \u201cRoyal Blend,\u201d or even that it was \u201cCopatan\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">(b) that the packages looked similar or alike;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">(c) that the names of the products sounded similar or alike, as was the case in several of the cases cited in the dissenting opinion;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">(d) that there was any exact copying;</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">(e) that there was any effect upon prospective customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Are we, in the absence of any evidence, better able than a trial judge to speculate as to what general impressions obtained with respect to the original product or its name in the mind of the public, even though that public be \u201cthe ignorant, the unthinking, and the credu-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> lous?\u201d We think not, but if it is our privilege to second-guess the trial court, then we are convinced a two-word trademark has a different visual impact on the public than would a one-word trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">Nor do we see the aptness of the suggestion that one cannot break a single word into two words and necessarily avoid a charge of infringement. We agree. We would not dispute the judgment of Judge Learned Hand that \u201cListogen\u201d was an attempt to borrow from \u201cListerine.\u201d But would it be clear beyond doubt that \u201cSister Rain\u201d would be violative of the trademark \u201cListerine\u201d? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">There existed in the record no evidence of injury or damage, or probable injury or damage, entitling appellant to a find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>ing that the injunction has been disobeyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The burden of proving the violation rested on appellant. As the trial court plaintively stated, after appellant rested below: \u201cWhat evidence is there to support [the violation of] your injunction?\u201d (Tr. p. 49.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant did not satisfy the court below there had been a violation of the injunction, and the evidence does not convince a majority of this court there had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">While it is true that under certain circumstances we are as well able as the trial court to determine if there is a likelihood of confusion by a mere visual or auditory comparison of the marks protected and allegedly infringing,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we cannot, on the record here before us, differ with the trial judge, much less hold his findings to be clearly erroneous. See Chappell et al. v. Goltsman et al., 5 Cir. 1952, 197 F.2d 837, 839. The mere use of a name which appellees had a right to use can not in and of itself constitute unfair competition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">We can find no proof of any possibility of similarity \u201csuch as would cause confusion of any appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers as to the source of the goods.\u201d Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 728. Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., 2 Cir. 1952, 199 F.2d 602, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">. The stayed injunction permanently enjoined appellees from manufacturing, selling etc., products \u201cbearing * * * the names Copatan, Copatint or Copacream, or any other name or names confusingly similar thereto, or to the trademark Coppertone, specifically including any trademark or trade name containing the word, root, prefix or suffix Copa or Copper.\u201d This injunction was stayed to and including July 1, 1961, for the purpose of allowing Kreis \u201cto liquidate its present inventory.\u201d Nothing in the record shows-when the stock of Ooca Tan and Ooca Tint bottles were manufactured or first used, or that they were or were not ever a part of the pre-injunction or them \u201cpresent inventory.\u201d So far as the record in this case discloses, we must conjecture whether the products purchased (which are the basis of the alleged violation of the injunction issued) fall within or without the exception carved out of the injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-12\">.

There is a suggestion made in the court\u2019s footnote 1 with which I must take issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">There, after noting the stay ordered for the purpose of allowing Kreis \u201cto liquidate its present inventory\u201d the footnote continues: \u201cNothing in the record shows when the stock of Coca Tan and Coca Tint bottles were manufactured or first used, or that they were or were not ever a part of the pre-injunction or then \u2018present inventory.\u2019 So far as the record in this case discloses, we must conjecture whether the products purchased (which are the basis of the alleged violation of the injunction issued) fall within or without the exception carved out of the injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">I think this shows a misunderstanding of the facts. The \u201cpresent inventory\u201d was the collection of products making up the old stock of \u201cCopa\u201d products, made under the name which Kreis was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>then selling to appellant.

As stated in Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby Fabrics Corp., 2 Cir., 303 F.2d 283, 284, which is cited in the opinion, \u201cA consent decree represents an agreement by the parties which the court cannot expand or contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">We must note also that in a ease of this kind the question of likelihood of confusion is one for this court to decide. As Judge Barnes well stated in Sleeper Lounge Company v. Bell Manufacturing Co., 9 Cir., 253 F.2d 720, 723, \u201cwe are \u2018in as good \u00e1 position as the trial judge to determine the probability of confusion\u2019 \u201d citing Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 199 F.2d 602, from which the last quoted language was taken. This is the rule of this circuit, as settled in a long line of decisions, and it is the prevailing rule in other circuits as well. See The Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Company, 9 Cir., 314 F.2d 149, (Feb. 12, 1963) and cases there cited. I think that such probability of confusion is demonstrated by this record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">Initially, in explaining my position, I want to call attention to one aspect of the facts of the case. After the original litigation was commenced, involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>alleged trademark infringement concerning \u201cCoppertone\u201d and after the defendants had filed their answer, the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which the plaintiff, appellant here, paid the defendants $20,750 for its registrations and rights in the \u201cCopa\u201d names \u201ctogether with the good will in connection therewith.\u201d As a part of the settlement the consent decree referred to in the majority opinion was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The net result of all this was that the right to the use of the names \u201cCopa Tan\u201d, \u201cCopa Tint\u201d, and \u201cCopa Cream\u201d, passed to the plaintiff and, what is important here, defendants were restrained from manufacturing, distributing, selling or offering for sale any suntan or sunburn product bearing the names referred to, \u201cor any other names or names confusingly similar thereto.\u201d The portion of the decree relating to \u201cCoppertone\u201d is irrelevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">If defendants desired to engage in the manufacture, distribution, or sale of suntan or sunburn products in competition with plaintiff, they had open to them a whole dictionary full of names, as well as all the fanciful names that could be fabricated from the entire alphabet, just so long as this competition was not carried on by the use of a name or names confusingly similar to those which defendants had just sold to plaintiff. Almost at once the defendants deliberately chose to market their products under names which were about as close to \u201cCopa Tan\u201d, \u201cCopa Tint\u201d, and \u201cCopa Cream\u201d, as could possibly be devised. By the mere substitution of a \u201cc\u201d for a \u201cp\u201d, whatever defendants were attempting to do was at once accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">There is nothing new about this sort of thing. Many court decisions have noted such maneuverings. None has described them better than the case of American Chicle Co. v. Topps Chewing Gum, 2 Cir., 208 F.2d 560, 582-563, which stated: \u201cFor the defendant has not suggested even the most diaphanous reason for selecting for its peppermint box out of all possible permutations of color and design, just the plaintiff\u2019s \u2014 or at least almost the plaintiff\u2019s \u2014 combination, except for the substitution of \u2018Topps\u2019 for \u2018Chiclets.\u2019 It would be absurd to see in this anything but a hope to bring to its own net just those buyers who are on the fringe of the plaintiff\u2019s possible customers. In the language of Judge By-er, the imitation \u2018revealed an apparent purpose to come as close to the plaintiff\u2019s package as the law might close its eyes to, so long as Topps is used instead of Chiclets.\u2019 What we said in Miles Shoes, Inc., v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 199 F. 2d 602, 603, applies to the letter <em>mutatis mutandis: </em>\u2018Why it should have chosen a mark that had long been employed by Macy and had become known to the trade instead of adopting some other means to identify its goods is hard to see unless there was a deliberate purpose to obtain some advantage from the trade which Macy had built up.\u2019 Indeed, it is generally true that, as soon as we see that a second comer in a market has, for no reason that he can assign, plagiarized the \u2018make-up\u2019 of an earlier comer, we need no more; for he at any rate thinks that any differentia he adds will not, or at least may not, prevent the diversion and we are content to accept his forecast that he is \u2018likely\u2019 to succeed. Then we feel bound to compel him to exercise his ingenuity in quarters further afield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In National Van Lines v. Dean, 9 Cir., 237 F.2d 688, 692, in referring to a defendant-appellee who had developed a mark resembling and similar to that of the plaintiff-appellant, we said: \u201cHe was fully aware of the fact that appellant was then using and extensively advertising such a mark. The inference is compelling that appellee intentionally sought to confuse and deceive prospective customers and thereby accomplish a transfer of business and good will from principal to erstwhile agent.\u201d Here, a similar inference is equally compelling. Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ants here were fully aware of the terms of the consent decree, that it referred to the \u201cCopa\u201d names, that they had sold them and the good will relating to them, and that they were prohibited by the injunction from using confusingly similar names. Clearly defendants intentionally sought to confuse and deceive prospective customers and thereby accomplish a transfer of business and good will from plaintiff who had just bought them out.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">As we said in National Van Lines, supra, \u201cif such an intent is shown, it raises a presumption that deception and confusion resulted.\u201d This is made plain in subdivision \u201cf\u201d of the Comment on Clause (b) under \u00a7 729 of the Restatement of the Law of Torts which refers to the \u201cfactors in confusing similarity.\u201d Subdivision \u201cf\u201d is as follows: \u201cf. Intent of actor. As stated in \u00a7 717, one may infringe another\u2019s trade-mark or trade name by adopting a confusingly similar designation whether he does so innocently or for the purpose of deceiving prospective purchasers. But his knowledge or purpose is an important factor in determining whether or not his designation is confusingly similar. If he adopts the designation in ignorance of the other\u2019s trade-mark or trade name, the similarity is determined on the basis of other factors. But if he adopts his designation with the intent of deriving benefit from the reputation of the trade-mark or trade name, his intent may be sufficient to justify the inference that there is confusing similarity. Since he was and is intimately concerned with the probable reaction in the market, his judgment manifested prior to the controversy, is highly persuasive. His denial that his conduct was likely to achieve the result intended by him will ordinarily carry little weight. While the actor\u2019s intention is thus a factor in determining the likelihood of confusion, the degree of similarity in appearance, pronunciation or suggestion (see Comments b to e) is a factor in determining the actor\u2019s intention when that is in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">One reason why the type of conduct manifested by the defendants in this case, in the words of the Restatement quoted above, \u201cmay be sufficient to justify the inference that there is confusing similarity\u201d, is that this is circumstantial evidence in the nature of an admission by the defendant himself. Here, as we have noted, if defendants had no predaceous competition in mind, after they sold their names \u201cCopa Tint\u201d, etc., to the plaintiff, they could have competed by the use of any one or more of a multitude of useable names.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Defendants did not choose to do that, but, on the other hand, they deliberately picked names just as close to the names sold to the plaintiff as was possible without precisely copying the original name. This indicates, as noted in American Chicle Co. v. Topps Chewing Gum, supra, that they \u201cforecast that [they] are \u2018likely\u2019 to succeed\u201d, that there is likelihood that those who had known of or purchased their \u201cCopa Tint\u201d would now pick up \u201cCoca Tint\u201d thinking they were buying the same product.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Mr. Callmann has noted, (Callmann, The Law Of Unfair Competition and Trademarks, 2d ed., Vol. 3, pp. 1381-1382), that a court \u201cmust also be aware of the fact that a defendant normally does not slavishly copy the plaintiff\u2019s mark, but makes certain \u2018colorable changes\u2019 which are \u2018variations not distinctions\u2019 And (on p. 1378) that courts are \u201cbeset by the sometimes ingenious attempt of a defendant, who is desirous of blinding the public as well as the court, so as to get such resemblances as will enable his goods to be sold, and such differences as will provide him with cover when his practice is discovered.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">It is also my view that we have approached this question of confusing similarity from the wrong angle. The words used in the decree are \u201cconfusingly similar thereto\u201d. The only proper meaning to be attached to these words, as used in the decree, is that they must be taken to have the same meaning as that attached to the subject of \u201cconfusing similarity\u201d as developed in the decisions of the courts dealing with trade-marks, trade names and unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In my view the opinion fails to apply the standards and tests prescribed in a multitude of cases dealing with the question of likelihood of confusion. Here the court has laid the two sets of names alongside of each other and by minute analysis of what I consider minor points of differences in these names has reached its conclusion that no likelihood of confusion arises. That is not the proper approach. Thus, in the Restatement of the Law of Torts, Comment \u201cb\u201d, \u00a7 728, relating to what constitutes confusing similarity, it is stated, \u201cThe similarity between a designation and a trade-mark or trade name which it is alleged to infringe is not determined by comparing the two in juxtaposition only. Since it is the effect upon prospective purchasers that is important, the conditions under which they act must be considered. Purchasers do not always see the goods in juxtaposition. They rely upon memory and vague impressions. And the question is whether, remembering a trademark fairly definitely, they are likely to regard the designation in question as the trade-mark or as identifying the source indicated by the trade-mark.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">This court has said the same thing in G. Heileman Brewing Co. v. Independent Brewing Co., 9 Cir., 191 F. 489, 497: \u201cNow, to one scanning the detailed description of these two Dutch scenes, or laying the pictures side by side, there could be no trouble in distinguishing the one from the other. But this is not the test. Will confusion result to the purchasing public by the use of the two not brought into direct or special comparison? Would the ordinary customer applying at the counter for \u2018Old Style Lager,\u2019 observing the care customary with purchasers in that way, be likely to be deceived or misled into buying \u2018Old German Lager,\u2019 if it was offered him. marked with defendant\u2019s label? We are impressed that he would.\u201d The reason for this is that the purchaser of a product seldom has before him both marks or names, the original name and the new name for comparison. He has in mind only his general impressions obtained with respect to the original product or its name.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Product advertising is on billboards, in newspapers, and nowadays, on television screens. The customer gets a visual impression. If the customer has been used to watching billboards, newspaper advertisements or television screens on which has appeared \u201cCopa Tan\u201d and then sees in the drug store a product bearing the name \u201cCoca Tan\u201d he acts upon these general impressions of the product he had in mind as a result of the advertising.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">This court noted the same thing in Stork Restaurant v. Sahati, 9 Cir., 166 F.2d 348, 359, where it quoted from a case there cited the following statement : \u201c \u2018The law is not made for the protection of experts, but for the public \u2014 that vast multitude which includes the ignorant, the unthinking and the credulous, who, in making purchases, do not stop to analyze, but are governed by appearance and general impressions.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The purchaser who walks into a store carries with him only his general impressions or memory of the earlier name. He cannot make the minute comparisons which the court has undertaken here. We should note the points of similarity which are very obvious here rather than \u201cthe less important points of specific difference.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Some of the differences mentioned by the court, are, I think, not really significant here. Thus it is stated that the injunction referred to certain words \u201cCopatan\u201d, and \u201cCopatint\u201d, and \u201cCop\u00e1cream\u201d, and that: \u201cThe alleged infringement is composed of a pair of <em>two-word, </em>phrases: Coca Tan; Coca Tint\u201d. The opinion says this makes a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">In the first place there is no basis in fact for this alleged difference. As the trial court\u2019s findings show, (finding 3), plaintiff became the owner of \u201cCopa Tan\u201d, \u201cCopa Tint\u201d, and \u201cCopa Cream\u201d. That is a correct statement, for the record shows, (Exhibit 1) that Kreis sold to Plough certain registrations described as \u201cCopa Tint\u201d with the description of state registrations in California, Florida and New York. And as the findings show, the trial judge was undertaking to ascertain whether the names \u201cCoca Tan\u201d and \u201cCoca Tint\u201d were confusingly similar to \u201cCopa Tan\u201d, \u201cCopa Tint\u201d, and \u201cCopa Cream\u201d, which he found in the negative, (finding 5). This was and is the issue. It cannot be affected by the fact that the decree after first referring to the names as \u201cCopa Tan\u201d, \u201cCopa Tint\u201d, and \u201cCopa Cream\u201d, subsequently writes the same words as \u201cCopatan\u201d, \u201cCopatint\u201d and \u201cCopaeream\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Even if there were facts to support the point sought to be made, I cannot believe that if a plaintiff has a trade name written as a single word, the would-be infringer can avoid a charge of confusing similarity by breaking the two syllable word into two words. I think there is no authority for that. To show that merely dividing a name having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>confusing similarity into two words cannot possibly aid a defendant, let us assume that the owners of \u201cHoleproof\u201d could object to \u201cHolefree\u201d, that \u201cMain-liner\u201d could object to \u201cMainflyer\u201d, that \u201cGraybar\u201d could object to \u201cGraybear\u201d and that \u201cSyntopicon\u201d could object to \u201cSynopticon\u201d. Defendants in such cases could hardly escape injunctions by calling their products \u201cHole Free\u201d, or \u201cMain Flyer\u201d, or \u201cGray Bear\u201d, or \u201cSyn Opticon\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Some emphasis is sought to be placed upon dissimilarity of packaging. I cannot find anything in the record to prove this. In the record are defendants\u2019 \u201cExhibit II\u201d, defendants\u2019 package of Coca Tint, \u201cLL\u201d, defendants\u2019 package of Coca Tan, and \u201cMM\u201d, plaintiff\u2019s package of Coppertone. The opinion purports to compare the packaging shown in the exhibits. But even if difference in packaging were material or relevant here, such a comparison cannot be made. This is not a case involving infringement of Coppertone and there is no occasion for comparing the Coca Tan and Coca Tint packages with the Coppertone package or ;an.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">It is plain that it was the defendants\u2019 intention to try to reach those customers who knew about Copa Tan and Copa Tint by offering them Coca Tan and Coca Tint. If comparisons of packaging were material at all, that is the kind of comparison that would have to be made but it cannot be made here. There are none of the old Copa packages in evidence. However, the packaging is irrelevant. This is not a suit in which plaintiff is trying to procure an injunction over the resistance of the defendant which would contain the provisions of the consent decree. In such a case it might be appropriate for a defendant to argue than an injunction ought not to be issued because through packaging or otherwise he had overcome the natural consequences of similarity in names.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">But here we start with a decree which unequivocally and in plain terms prohibits manufacturing or selling suntan or sunburn products bearing \u201cany other name or names confusingly similar.\u201d This prohibition is against <em>any </em>product bearing such confusingly similar names. In my view that is all there is to it; and the packaging is irrelevant even if the packaging had been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">It is said that there is a difference in sound. I think that such minor potential differences in the pronunciation of these names do not avoid the consequences of confusing similarity. As said in G. D. Searle &amp; Co. v. Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co., 7 Cir., 265 F.2d 385, 387, \u201cSlight differences in the sound of similar trademarks will not protect the infringer.\u201d In that case the plaintiff\u2019s product had the trade name \u201cDramamine\u201d. Defendant undertook to market a competing product called \u201cBonamine\u201d. It appeared that the defendant had requested some of its employees to suggest names for its new product and 158 names were suggested. The name picked, \u201cBonamine\u201d, was the one word in the whole list which was most like \u201cDramamine\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court found that the words Dramamine and Bonamine were unlike, referring to their pronunciation. The court of appeals reversed on the ground previously stated in the above quotation from the decision. The court also noted that although one name began with a \u201cD\u201d and the other with a \u201cB\u201d, the two words were \u201cvoiced plosives\u201d and were accoustieally similar. That is the exact situation in respect to the \u201cp\u201d in \u201cCopa\u201d and the \u201cc\u201d in \u201cCoca\u201d with which we are dealing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">In the case just referred to the court cited with approval the case of Lambert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Pharmacal v. Bolton Chemical Corporation, 219 F. 325, 326, a decision by Judge Learned Hand. There the plaintiff\u2019s trade name was \u201cListerine\u201d and the defendant\u2019s competing product was sold under the name of \u201cListogen\u201d. Judge Hand, speaking of the defendant\u2019s choice of name, said: \u201cIn choosing an arbitrary trade-name, there was no reason whatever why they should have selected one which bore so much resemblance to the plaintiff\u2019s; and in such cases any possible doubt of the likelihood of damage should be resolved in favor of the plaintiff. Of course, the burden of proof always rests upon the moving party, but having shown the adoption of a similar trade name, arbitrary in character, I cannot see why speculation as to the chance that it will cause confusion should be at the expense of the man first in the field. He has the right to insist that others in making up their arbitrary names should so certainly keep away from his customers as to raise no question. * * * To show how near the defendant\u2019s name is, we need only change one letter, \u2018g\u2019 to \u2018r\u2019; \u2018Listoren\u2019 would be so close an imitation as would not allow argument in its defense. Now the \u2018g\u2019 does make a difference; being a consonant it sounds more distinctly, but I cannot say that it is enough, and no reasonable explanation, no explanation whatever, is suggested why the name need be used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In Java Coffee Co. v. Jos. Martinson <em>&amp; </em>Co., D.C., 142 F.Supp. 423, Judge Dimock held that the use by one party of the name \u201cJavar Instant Coffee\u201d for his coffee was so similar to the other party\u2019s \u201cMartinson\u2019s Jomar\u201d coffee that confusion was likely to result. There again the pronunciations were different but the confusion was real.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">In my opinion the decision in this case cannot be justified by any consideration of variations in pronunciations, I do not believe that one purchaser in 500 would even see or notice the line over the \u201co\u201d; even if he did, it would mean nothing to him for likely as not when he has read the billboard advertisement of Copa Tan, etc., he decides that also is pronounced with a long \u201co\u201d. As Mr. Callmann remarks: \u201c * * * there is no such thing as a correct pronunciation of a trade-mark. It is pronounced in different ways by different people.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The opinion states that, \u201cNo secondary meaning was alleged, claimed or proved as to Copatint or Copatan.\u201d This is wholly beside the point here. As previously suggested, if this were a contested case in which the plaintiff was trying to procure an injunction which was resisted by the defendant, the question of whether plaintiff could claim an exclusive right to a certain name might involve a consideration of whether that name was one which must have acquired a secondary meaning. But such is not the situation here. The consent decree has settled as between these parties the defendants\u2019 lack of right to these names and the plaintiff\u2019s right to an injunction against defendants\u2019 use of those names or any other names confusingly similar thereto.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, the words \u201cCo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>pa Tint\u201d and \u201cCopa Tan\u201d, whether written together or as two words, are completely fanciful. Such a fanciful trade name is generally recognized to be a \u201cstrong\u201d name and entitled to an especially great degree of protection. Stork Restaurant v. Sahati, supra, 166 F.2d at p. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Although conceding that the question here is merely whether \u201cthere was a likelihood of such confusion existing\u201d, yet the opinion suggests that there should have been some proof made of specific instances of actual confusion. That such proof of specific instances of confusion is wholly unnecessary in cases involving the question of confusing similarity has long been settled.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We come then to the ultimate question here \u2014 are the names \u201cCoca Tan\u201d and \u201cCoca Tint\u201d confusingly similar to the names purchased and acquired by the plaintiff through the payment of the $20,750? Is there likelihood of confusion ?</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Under the parties\u2019 contract, (Exhibit 1), defendants sold to plaintiff its registration and rights in these names \u201ctogether with the good will in connection therewith\u201d. Wholly apart from the calculated effort to come as close as could be possible to these old names with the names Coca Tan, Coca Tint, etc., it seems to me that the conclusion is unavoidable that there must be likelihood of confusion. The cases are legion in which names differing more than those involved here have nevertheless been held to present confusing similarity. Of course, no two cases are exactly alike; but as I read the adjudicated cases dealing with confusion arising solely from the use of similar words, I cannot reconcile the result here with the general trend of decisions in this field.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Finally, it seems clear to me that the majority opinion mistakes the issue posed by the appellant\u2019s petition for an order to show cause. This is apparent from the statement of the opinion that by filing this proceeding appellant is attempting \u201cto prevent the marketing in the competitive market of any product marked so that it might remind one of Coppertone.\u201d This is most certainly not the case. The matter now at issue has nothing whatever to do with \u201cCoppertone\u201d. It has to do only with that portion of the decree which reads: \u201cThat defendants * * * are perpetually restrained from: (a) Manufacturing, distributing, selling or offering for sale any suntan or sunburn product bearing any one of the names Copatan, Copatint or Copacream as a trademark or trade name, or any other name or names confusingly similar thereto. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">I would reverse the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. They might have used such names as \u201cRich Tone\u201d; \u201cTawny Glo\u201d; \u201cSoft Tan\u201d; \u201cEasy Tan\u201d; \u201cE-Z Tan\u201d; \u201cKreis Glo\u201d; \u201cCafe au Eait Lotion\u201d; \u201cSepia Tint\u201d; \u201cTan Skin\u201d, etc. There was an unlimited freedom to create fanciful names such as \u201cSienanoint\u201d (from \u201cSiena Ointment\u201d), etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. The courts, like the compilers of the Restatement, recognize that under these circumstances the appropriate inference is that by doing this sort of thing the defendant has indicated his own opinion; \u2014that he has something to gain and that such gain will come from the natural confusion. In National Lead Company v. Wolfe, 9 Cir., 223 F.2d 195, 202, we noted the effect of this type of circumstantial evidence and quoted with approval from My-T Fine Corporation v. Samuels, (39 F. 2d 76, 77, as follows: \u201cBut when it [intent] appears, we think that it has an important procedural result; a late comer who deliberately copies the dress of his competitors already in the field, must at least prove that his effort has been futile. Prima facie the court will treat his opinion so disclosed as expert and will not assume that it was erroneous. * * * He may indeed succeed in showing that it was; that, however bad his purpose, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>will fail in execution; if he does, he will win. * * * But such an intent raises a presumption that customers will be deceived.\u201d See also Audio Fidelity Inc. v. High Fidelity Recordings, 9 Cir., 283 F. 2d 551, 558. As the language above quoted from the Restatement says: \u201cSince he was and is intimately concerned with the probable reaction in the market, his judgment manifested prior to the controversy is highly persuasive. His denial that his conduct was likely to achieve the result intended by Mm would ordinarily carry little weight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-11\">. \u201cIt has been well said that the most successful form of copying is to employ enough points of similarity to confuse the public with enough points of difference to confuse the courts.\u201d Baker v.

Oallmann analyzes the multitude of cases upon this point and summarizes the results as follows, (The Law of Unfair Competition and Trademarks, supra, pp. 1379 to 1383): \u201cThen too, marks are not to be considered vis-a-yis; the buyer viewing the mark of the defendant must rely upon his memory of the plaintiff\u2019s mark. * * * It must also be aware of the fact that a defendant normally does not slavishly copy the plaintiff\u2019s mark, but makes certain \u2018colorable changes\u2019 which are \u2018variations not distinctions\u2019; and the court should, therefore, consider the points of general similarity rather than the less important points of specific difference. * * * \u2018The law is not made for the protection of experts, but for the public \u2014 Iliat vast multitude, which includes the ignorant, the unthinking, and the credulous, who, in making purchases, do not stop to analyze, but are governed by appearances and general impressions.\u2019 The general impression of the ordinary purchaser, buying under the normally prevalent conditions in. the trade and giving the attention such purchasers usually give in buying that class of goods, is the touchstone.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b713-13\">. It appears to me that the court here has wholly disregarded the suggestions made by Mr. Oallmann, (pp. 1381, 1982) which are based upon his summary of a multitude of cases having to do with the problem of confusing similarity, and which are quoted above, footnote 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\">. The court there perceived what the defendant was up to and trying to accomplish. It quoted from Q-Tips, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, 3 Cir., 206 F.2d 144, 147, the following: \u201cThe evidence shows a list of dozens of names suggested by various employees, many of which are arbitrary, fanciful and completely unlike anything suggested by the plaintiff\u2019s product. But in the end defendant\u2019s top management came up with the name under discussion, \u2018Cotton Tips.\u2019 It is quite clear why, with all the possibilities open to it, defendant made this choice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">. Pocono Rubber Cloth Co. v. J. A. Livingston, Inc., 3 Cir., 79 F.2d 44G, 448: \u201cThe defendant suggests that its trademark should be pronounced \u2018Swavel,\u2019 with the accent on the first syllable, giving the \u2018a\u2019 a long sound to distinguish it from the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u2018Suavelle,\u2019 which has the accent on the second syllable. The selection of the word \u2018Swavel\u2019 by the defendant following so closely upon the selection of the word \u2018Suavelle\u2019 by the plaintiff would hardly seem a mere coincidence. A fair interpretation of the evidence rather indicates that the word was chosen by design. It is absolutely impossible for the defendant to control the pronunciation which the trade would give to the word. It is apparent that the word so nearly resembles in sound, appearance, and spelling the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark that it will necessarily cause confusion or mistake in the public mind and will deceive purchasers who will think they are buying merchandise produced by the plaintiff, when as a fact they are purchasing defendant\u2019s merchandise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b715-13\">. ITor this same reason the suggestion that appellant had not previously used the \u201cCopa\u201d names is irrelevant here. That circumstance is irrelevant here for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>another reason. The purchase contract is elated November 11, 1959. The consent decree was signed the next day. The injunction was stayed until July 1, 1961, to permit defendants to dispose of their stock on hand bearing the \u201ccopa\u201d marks. During that interval defendants wore using the names, in effect, as licensees of the plaintiff. Five months later, on December 4, 1961, this matter came on for hearing in the court below. Non-use by plaintiff during that five month period would not effect an abandonment of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. See Saxlehner v. Eisner &amp; Mendelson Go., 179 U.S. 19, 31, 21 S.Ct. 7, 45 L.Ed. 60; National Lead Company v. Wolfe, 9 Cir., 223 F.2d 195, 205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">.
