He contends that the District Court erred in permitting police officers to testify as to certain admissions and in denying his timely motion for mistrial when the prosecutor called to the attention of the jury that the defendant had failed to take the stand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-19\">About 1 P.M. on September 1, 1961, a stock clerk named Simmons was in the stockroom of Sears Roebuck &amp; Company at 4500 Wisconsin Avenue when the appellant entered. Outside the two main doors to the stockroom were signs reading \u201cFor Employees Only.\u201d Appellant was wearing a uniform of a type customarily worn by Sears\u2019 employees. He extended a greeting to Simmons who observed that the shirt worn by the appellant bore a blue Sears emblem. Simmons thought appellant was a new porter as the latter walked to the area where the television sets were stored. Appellant picked up a \u201cTV\u201d set in a sealed carton and went out through the store carrying the television set.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-20\">The following day appellant again entered the Sears store wearing a Sears shirt. Appellant was on the basement level heading back toward the stockroom when Simmons first saw him. Simmons and two other employees walked toward the appellant who then \u201cstarted walking pretty fast up the steps,\u201d got on the escalator and went as far as the second floor where a store detective stopped him. After appellant told the detective he had found the shirt, appellant was asked to accompany the detective to the \u201csecurity\u201d room. Simmons was .summoned and there identified appellant as the \u201cman who had taken the TV set the day before.\u201d The store detective then notified Precinct No. 8 nearby, and two Metropolitan police officers came over, arriving about 12:45 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>After ascertaining the foregoing and other facts, the Metropolitan police took the appellant back to the precinct. Upon arrival, appellant\u2019s name and appropriate information were entered in an arrest book, and a written charge was noted with the arresting officer\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The officers then had in their possession obviously adequate evidence of \u201cprobable cause,\u201d not only to \u201csupport the arrest,\u201d but if believed by a jury, \u201cultimately his guilt.\u201d But without any justifiable excuse to be gathered from the record, the police did not then present White before a committing magistrate. Instead, they took him to the second floor of their headquarters for the admitted purpose of questioning him in regard to the larceny.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">At the trial, defense counsel, retained by the appellant, objected to any statement made by White at the precinct \u201con the ground it was taken under duress and not voluntarily made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The trial judge conducted a hearing to ascertain what if any \u201cduress\u201d might predicate the objection. During the hearing in the absence of the jury appellant did not testify. The testimony elicited from the officers supplied no evidence of \u201cduress,\u201d and White\u2019s admissions were thereafter received in evidence before the jury. Had defense counsel objected on Mallory grounds, we would have a grave question as to whether or not the appellant\u2019s admissions would be admissible in view of the opinions of this court on this point. After repeatedly denying the larceny, the appellant finally admitted his act and informed the officers of the address where the television set might be found.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The argument now for the first time advanced that the trial judge should have excluded such admissions on Mallory grounds comes too late considering the\u2019 record as a whole. We frequently have pointed out that objections to the receipt of evidence should be made in the trial court. Williams v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 7, 9, 303 F.2d 772, 774, cert. denied, 369 U.S. 875, 82 S.Ct. 1145, 8 L.Ed.2d 277 (1962) and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Appellant did not take the stand as the trial was resumed. His counsel had filed no requests for special instructions. Government counsel, apparently intending to counter the argument of defense counsel, undertook to caution the jury \u201cin advance\u201d that the jurors always should keep in mind that the arguments of counsel are not evidence. He reminded the jury of the evidence before it, which included, of course, the appellant\u2019s admissions. The prosecutor pointed out that the Government\u2019s only exhibit was the television set, recovered pursuant to White\u2019s directions. Then he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\"><em>\u201cThe Government would also bring to your attention the fact that the defendant failed to take the stand. </em>No inference at all is to be.given to you by the fact <em>[sic] </em>that he exercised this right. This is a very important right to the individual; it is an important right in our system of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\">\u201cIt is my job to prove to you \u2014 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">Defense counsel interrupted and asked for a bench conference. During that colloquy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> counsel moved for a mistrial be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>cause of the prosecutor\u2019s comment \u201con the failure of the defendant to take the stand.\u201d The motion for mistrial was denied. We think there was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Even if the judge had then admonished the prosecutor and had promptly instructed the jury on the point, we would have had a close question. At least in those circumstances the jurors might have tried to eliminate from their thinking any possible inference of guilt from the appellant\u2019s failure to refute or explain his admissions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or otherwise to counter what had been offered against him. Of course, the jury knew that White had not testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Here the judge did neither. He made no reference to the challenged episode in his charge. Although later he correctly instructed the jury \u201cthat no inference of guilt arises against the defendant because of his failure to testify as a witness in his own behalf\u201d and properly explained the rationale of the rule, we are not persuaded that no prejudice arose. The prosecutor\u2019s statement had been made openly in argument before the jury. The colloquy, the judge\u2019s comment and his ruling on the motion for mistrial had occurred at the bench. The jury was without knowledge of what had there been said. How much \u201cprejudice\u201d may be attributable to an occurrence of this sort we have no way of knowing. The Supreme Court has said \u201cThe minds, of the jurors can only remain unaffected from this circumstance by excluding all reference to it.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have noted that-\u201cstrict observance [of this principle] has-been many times commended to prosecuting attorneys.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">We have carefully considered all' aspects of the case in our effort to determine whether or not there was harmless-error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) reads: \u201cAny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial-rights shall be disregarded.\u201d But it is beyond doubt that an accused is afforded a \u201csubstantial right\u201d in deciding whether or not to take the stand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find ourselves unable to say with fair assurance- and in the total setting here presented,, that there was no prejudice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-16\">. On brief, he also had argued that the court erred in admitting into evidence without proper identification a certain television set, the theft of which was charged in the second count. In view of our disposition of the case, we deem unnecessary any further reference to this particular point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">. Mallory v.

After counsel had expressed his view respecting the Government\u2019s \u201ccommenting on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand,\u201d the judge said to the prosecutor\u2014 but not then to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-17\">\u201cThe Coubt: I don\u2019t think <em>it is </em>very wise to say that, [Prosecutor].
