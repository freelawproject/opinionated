The district court dismissed because it concluded that Rivera had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal determinations, including those concerning jurisdiction. <em>See Requena-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell, </em>190 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1999). Because Rivera is the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, he bears the burden of demonstrating that the exercise of that jurisdiction was proper. <em>See Stockman v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>138 F.3d 144, 151 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-22\">Because Rivera\u2019s deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997, and ended more than thirty days after September 30, 1996, this case is governed by the uncodified judicial review transitional provisions found in \u00a7 309(c)(4) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d). <em>See Requena-Rodriguez, </em>190 F.3d at 302-03. Under this transitional regime, \u201chabeas jurisdiction continues to exist under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules in cases involving final orders of deportation against criminal aliens, and [ ] habeas jurisdiction is capa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>cious enough to include constitutional and statutory challenges if those challenges cannot be considered on direct review by the court of appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The government argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Rivera\u2019s habeas petition because IIRIRA did not operate to bar him from bringing a petition for review in this court. According to the government, Rivera\u2019s criminal offense \u2014 aiding and abetting an alien\u2019s entry at an improper time and place in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a) \u2014 is not one of the offenses referenced in IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G), the provision that forecloses our jurisdiction to review petitions filed by aliens who are deportable because they have committed certain offenses. <em>See Nguyen v. INS, </em>117 F.3d 206, 207 (5th Cir.1997). Rivera asserts merely that he has committed a covered offense; he does not respond to the government\u2019s jurisdictional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Under IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ald\">there shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 212(a)(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or section 241(a)(2)(A)(in), (B), (C), or (D)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Immigration and Nationality Act (as in effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act), or any offense covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of such Act (as in effect on such date) for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their date of commission, otherwise covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(i)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of such Act (as so in effect).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>See Lerma de Garcia v. INS, </em>141 F.3d 215, 216 (5th Cir.1998). The IJ concluded that Rivera\u2019s offense constituted an aggravated felony pursuant to the terms of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), which states that an aggravated felony is \u201can offense described in paragraph (1)(A) or (2) of section 1324(a) of this title (relating to alien smuggling).\u201d Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), noted the IJ, an alien who commits any aggravated felony after admission is de-portable.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The government contends that the IJ was mistaken in concluding that Rivera\u2019s conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a) qualifies as a conviction of an aggravated felony. It notes that since Rivera filed his habeas petition, the BIA has held that the offense described in \u00a7 1325(a) is not an aggravated felony. <em>See In re Alvarado-Alvino, </em>Interim Decision (BIA) 3391, 1999 WL 322973 (BIA 1999). In <em>Alvarado-Al-vino, </em>the BIA held that by its plain language, \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) includes only convictions under \u00a7 1324(a), not those under \u00a7 1325(a). The BIA noted that \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(0) does include \u00a7 1325(a) convictions as aggravated felonies, but only when \u201ccommitted by an alien who was previously deported on the basis of a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s analysis. Rivera\u2019s conviction of violating \u00a7 1325(a) is outside the ambit of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N), which is explicitly confined to convictions under \u00a7 1324(a). Likewise, because Rivera did not violate \u00a7 1325(a) after being previously deported, he did not commit an aggravated felony as defined in \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(O).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">As we have stated, under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, habeas jurisdiction exists only where \u201cchallenges cannot be considered on direct review by the court of appeals.\u201d <em>Requena-Rodriguez, </em>190 F.3d at 305. Section 309(c)(4)(G) of IIRIRA denies us jurisdiction to consider petitions for review only when an alien has committed a referenced criminal offense. Because Rivera\u2019s conviction for violating \u00a7 1325(a) does not qualify as an aggravated felony that would trigger IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G), and because none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>other classes of offenses listed in \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) is applicable to him, we have jurisdiction to review directly a deportation order entered against Rivera. Accordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Rivera\u2019s habeas petition. <em>See Requena-Rodriguez, </em>190 F.3d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Accordingly, the judgment is VACATED, and a judgment of dismissal for want of jurisdiction is RENDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) (West 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-13\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-14\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
