Powers conferred on Congress un- \u25a0 der'the Constitution are thereby exclusively vested in Congress, and, consequently, forbidden to the states: Brown <em>v. </em>State of Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Willson <em>v. </em>The Blackbird Creek Co., 2 Peters 245; Gibbons <em>v. </em>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; New York <em>v. </em>Miln, 11 Peters 102; Passenger Cases, 7 Howard 203; Cooley <em>v. </em>Board of Wardens, 12 Id. 311; Gilman <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713; State Taxes Cases, 15 Id. 232, 284 and 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-10\">The power is given to Congress to grant patents, and the Act of 1872, when it undertakes to prescribe how a patent can be used, sold or vended, and takes away from notes given for a patent right their negotiability under the law of commerce, and provides severe penalties for any patentee who shall venture to take a negotiable promissory note as part of the price of his patent, interferes with this power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-11\">Laws identical in purpose, and almost identical in words, were passed not only by Pennsylvania, but also by Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota; and except Pennsylvania in all of those states have been declared unconstitutional and void: Woollen <em>v. </em>Banker (Ohio), Am. L. Rec. 1877, 236; Ex parte Robinson, 2 Bissell 311; Cranson <em>v. </em>Smith (Mich.) Albany Law Jour. 1877, 330; Crittenden <em>v. </em>White (Minn.) 9 Chicago Leg. News 112; Patterson <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 11 Bush. 311. In this case the note in question does not fall within the law. The negotiable character of the instrument is only taken away when the words \u201cgiven for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>a patent right\u201d are written or printed on its face. An innocent purchaser for value cannot be affected by the act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-6\"><em>JEdwin S. </em>Dixon, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtV\">\u2014 The fallacy of the argument of the plaintiff in error consists in his treating the Act of 1872 as undertaking to prescribe how a patent can be used or sold, when it simply regulates, as the title implies, the execution and transfer of notes given for patent rights. The acts of other states upon which the rulings in the cases cited by plaintiff in error are based, are plainly distinguishable from our act.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2rJ\">February 25th 1878.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-7\">Mr. Justice Sharswood</author>\n<p id=\"Aic\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">If the act entitled \u201c An Act to regulate the execution and transfer of notes given for patent rights,\u201d passed April 12th .1872, Pamph. L. 60, makes absolutely void all such notes in which the words \u201cgiven for a patent right\u201d are not prominently and legibly written or printed on the face of such note above the signature thereto, there would be great reason for the contention that the act. is unconstitutional and void. No state can so interfere with the right of a patentee, secured to him by the* Acts of Congress, to sell and assign his patent. But such is not the operation of the act, according to its letter and spirit. By the express provision of the statute, the only effect of the insertion of such words is that \u201csuch note or instrument in the hands of the purchaser or holder-shall be subject to the same defences as if in the hands of the original owner or holder.\u201d By necessary implication, notes without such words inserted in them remain on the same footing as before the act. The sole object of the legislature was to secure, so far as could be done consistently with the rights of innocent third persons, that notice of the consideration should be given to all who should take the paper. Nothing is better settled than that between the original parties to a note given for a patent right, it is a good defence to show that the alleged patent is void; in other words, that it is no patent. right at all, and that the consideration has therefore entirely failed: Bellas <em>v. </em>Hays, 5 S. &amp; R. 427; Geiger <em>v. </em>Cook, 3 W. &amp; S. 266; Holliday <em>v. </em>Rheem, 6 Harris 465. All who take with notice of the consideration, take necessarily subject to the same defence. There is nothing in all this which interferes with any just right\u2019of the holder of a valid patent under the Acts of Congress, nor that the maker of the note shall be permitted to show against a holder with such notice that it was obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation. This very plainly distinguishes our act from the statutes of other states, which have been held unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">To secure the insertion of these words, the second section of the act makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine or imprisonment.or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>both, for any person \u201cknowing the consideration of a note\u201d to be the sale of a patent right, to take, sell or transfer it without the words \u201cgiven for a patent right\u201d inserted, as provided by the act. It is too plain for argument that this section in no way affects the right or title of the holder of such a note, who takes it not knowing that the consideration was the sale of a patent. He commits no illegal or indictable offence. The negotiability of a note in which the required words are not inserted, is in no way affected by the act. The innocent holder, who takes it before maturity for value, without knowledge or notice of the consideration, takes it as heretofore, clear of all equities between the original parties. We think, therefore, that the court below were clearly wrong in entering judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>on the reserved point in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Judgment reversed, and now judgment for the plaintiff upon the verdict. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
