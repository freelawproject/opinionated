Kerns against the New Jersey Mutual Life Ins. Co. on a policy of life insurance for $5000 on the life of her deceased husband, Edward L. D. Kerns.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-14\">The plaintiff filed a copy of the policy on which suit was brought, with an averment of the death of Kerns, and that due proof thereof had been made. The policy was dated December 4th 1874, and Kerns died October 14th 1875. Defendants, under the belief that the policy of insurance was not such an instrument as would support a judgment by default under the affidavit of defence law, filed no affidavit, and judgment was entered against them. This fact having beeen represented to the court in an affidavit filed, a rule to open the judgment was granted. One Kramer then filed an affidavit, which in substance averred \u201cthat he was the soliciting agent of the company, and received the application of Kerns; that the latter not being able to pay the whole of the first premium of $110.35, deponent took his note for the balance, upon the express agreement that if said note was not paid at maturity the policy should be void; that the note was as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-15\">\u201c \u2018$82.76.

(Signed) Edward L. Kerns.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\"><em>&lt;e </em>That said note was then delivered to the defendants, who accepted the same, and was not paid at maturity.\u201d By agreement of counsel the foregoing affidavits were to have the effect of affidavits of defence, and the case was to be proceeded with as if the plaintiff had entered a rule for judgment, because of their insufficiency, whereupon the court entered judgment for the defendants, and plaintiff took this writ, assigning this action for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-6\"><em>iS. O. Perlcins, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVS\">\u2014 No request that actual payment of the first premium is essential to the validity of the policy is inserted in any form therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">The receipt of the premium is essential to the existence of the contract, and the rule of law is that a party is estopped from denying the receipt of premium when it is thus acknowledged in the policy, if the purpose is thereby to defeat the policy: Madison Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Fellowes, 1 Disney (O.) 217; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 260; Goit <em>v. </em>National Protection Ins. Co., 25 Barb. 189; Provident Life Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Fennell, 49 Ill. 180; Dalzell <em>v. </em>Mair, 1 Campb. 532; 1 Phillips Ins., \u00a7 514; Boehen <em>v. </em>Williamsburgh Ins. Co., 35 N. Y. 131; Anderson <em>v. </em>Thornton, 20 Eng. Law &amp; Eq. 339. \u201c The old law, and which is as old as the time of Lord Mansfield, is that the defendant is estopped by signing the policy from saying he has not received the premium:\" McAllister <em>v. </em>New England Mutual Life Ins. Co., 101 Mass. 558; Basch <em>v. </em>Humboldt Mut. F. &amp; M. Ins. Co., 6 Vroom 429.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-9\">The \u25a0 fact of the non-payment of the note set forth in the affidavits, does not prove non-payment of the premiums or forfeiture of the policy by reason of the non-payment of the note. See Mut. Ben. Life Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>French, 2 Cin. S. C. Rep. 321.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-10\">The facts set up in the agent\u2019s affidavit show in any event a waiver of any requirement of pre-payment of the premiums as a condition precedent to the validity of the policy, and this waiver was assented to by the company. Where a credit is intended the policy is valid, although the premium is never paid: Miller <em>v. </em>Life Ins. Co., 12 Wall. 285; Lycoming County Mut. Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Schollenberger, 8 Wright 263.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-11\">No printed nor oral argument contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"At6\">February 11th 1878,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b172-12\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered,</p>\n<author id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AKe\">\u2014 The note signed by the assured for the abated premium, when the policy was delivered, is a written admission that the recital of payment in the policy was not true, and therefore could not give effect to the policy, as an actual payment would. It is not only such a written declaration of non-payment, but it is a contract of even date, qualifying the terms of the policy, and an agreement that the policy shall be without effect and surrendered, in case the note for the premium be not paid. It therefore superseded the policy to the extent of the agreement. It would be a harsh measure of justice to hold the company to the terms of the policy, upon a concession made to the assured for his benefit, and evidenced by his own writing of even date with the delivery, and intended by him to govern his rights. Clearly the company caannot be held to the letter of a policy not paid for, and so altered for the benefit of the assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
