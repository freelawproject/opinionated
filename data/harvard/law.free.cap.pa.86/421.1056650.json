G. and his wife, who were colored people, brought an action against a railroad company for the exclusion of the wife from a railway car. The evidence of her exclusion was denied by the witnesses for the company, and it-was attempted to be shown that G., who was in company with his wife, was smoking, and that the exclusion was for that reason. The smoking was denied by G. and other witnesses. The court charged that it was conceded on all sides that the wife was excluded; and further instructed the jury that there was no doubt she was excluded if the testimony be true. <em>Held, </em>that this instruction did not take the facts <em>from </em>the consideration of the jury, and left to them to determine whether the exclusion was on account of race or color.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b421-11\">2. Paxson, J., concurring, was of opinion that there was not sufficient evidence of the exclusion on account of race or color, but as there had been no assignment of error to raise the question, the judgment should stand affirmed. <em>And further, </em>that while the Act of 1867 was intended to prevent railroad companies from making distinctions between passengers on account of race and color, it did not intend that said companies should be debarred from making reasonable police arrangements in the management of their road, and if they choose to designate a particular car for certain passengers, they are not to be compelled to assign a reason therefor.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b421-12\">March 15th 1878.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ATF\">Before Agnew, C.

J., it appeared that Green and his Avife, who were colored people, after purchasing tickets at Wilkesbarre, boarded the train at this .station with the purpose of going to their home at Parsons, a few miles distant. The train had a smoking and two other passenger cars, and Green and his wife attempted to enter the rear car by way of its front platform. Other passengers were entering this car at the same time. Tavo white ladies immediately in front entered the car Avhen Mrs. Green approached and Avas stopped by the brakeman, Avho pushed her back and pointed to the front car. She then stepped on the platform of the car in front and endeayored thereby to step on to that of the rear car, but the brakeman put up the chain and prevented her. Green then tried to take the chain down, when the brakeman locked the door. While this controversy was going on, two white ladies, one of whom was a passenger for Parsons, was permitted to enter the rear car. Not succeeding in her effort to get into the rear car, the train having meantime started, Mrs. Green entered the one in front and remained there until she reached Parsons. The car in the rear was designated the NeAV York car and that in front the Philadelphia car, they having come from those cities respectively. They were both, however, destined for a point beyond Parsons. The brakeman did not assign Mrs. Green\u2019s color as a reason for her exclusion from the car. It was alleged, however, that Green was smoking, and that for that reason alone he AA'as directed to the smoking-car. Three employees of the road swore positively that this was the only subject of controversy, and that Mrs. Green herself Avas not refused an entrance. Witnesses on the part of Green, on the contrary, denied that he was smoking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">In their charge to the jury the court said: \u201c That Mrs. Green was excluded, there can be no doubt, if the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses be true; [and that she was excluded from the car is conceded, even by the testimony that has been produced here on the part of the defence.] Hid they exclude her because of her color ? Mrs. Green Avas not smoking; the only bearing the matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>smoking has in the case, is with reference to the credibility of John W. Green. He says he was not smoking. Some witnesses say he was ; others say that he had a cigar in his hand. Others again say they did not see him smoking. No person seems to have seen him smoking while he was in the passenger room, and the testimony seems to be that he went right out of the room towards the train. This is a circumstance proper for your consideration in determining as to the credibility of the man. Now, if Green was smoking, or was inebriated, either might have furnished a reason why the company should exclude him; but it would not entitle them to exclude the wife, if she was quiet and orderly, and not smoking. We say to you that if she was seeking admission to that car, and was excluded on account of her color, the company are liable. There is no positive testimony, in so many words, that the brakeman said she could not enter the rear car because she was a colored woman. But very often we have to judge of human action according to the circumstances under which it takes place. Did persons go into that car before her, and were they unmolested? That is a circumstance developed by the testimony. If they did, then it would seem that white people went into the car before her. Did they go in after-wards ? If the testimony is correct \u2014 and even the brakeman says, that after these colored people went into the adjoining car, white people went into the rear car \u2014 then it would seem that white people went into that car, also, after her failure to enter. Now, that, is a circumstance for your consideration in determining the reason why they excluded Mrs. Green. Was there anything about her except her color? Is there anything in the testimony that goes to show that she was excluded for any other reason ? She was behaving in a very proper manner so far as the testimony shows; [and it is conceded on all sides that she was excluded.] You must consider this case with your minds free from any political or other prejudice. If the law of the state has been violated, the penalty must follow. [If this company excluded this woman from a particular car of their train, as it is conceded on all sides they did, and if such exclusion was because of her color, then she is entitled to recover the sum of $500.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel has asked us to charge you that, in order to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, the jury must be satisfied, under the evidence, that the plaintiff not only was excluded from the car of the defendant, but that such exclusion was because she was a colored woman. In other words, the jury must be satisfied that she was excluded because of race or color, and for no other reason.

The answer of the court to the point submitted is subject to the same objection as the general charge. It assumes the main point in controversy. We asked for a distinct charge upon the two questions: First \u2014 as to the fact of exelusion; and second \u2014 as to the cause, or reason for it. The answer of the court does not give the jury any light upon the first question, and practically refers them back to the body of the charge for instruction as to the second. In this respect we think it imperfect and erroneous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-5\"><em>William H.

Her husband made repeated and ineffectual attempts to put her in. The brakeman pushed her off the step as she attempted to enter, gave no reason, but said, \u201c Go into that car,\u201d pointing to,the car ahead. She stepped upon the rear platform of the forward car, and attempted to cross to the platform of the rear car. The brakeman put up the chain. Her husband took down the chain, and as he attempted to get his wife across, the brakeman locked the door. During all this time a contrversy was going on. These facts are not controverted or disproved. In all these facts Green and his wife are distinctly corroborated. The judge below recited them and said, \u201c The fact that the company did exclude her is not enough to entitle the plaintiff to recover. That she was excluded there can be no doubt, if this testimony be true; and that she was excluded from the car is conceded, even by the testimony that has been produced here on the part of the defence. Did they exclude her because of her color ?\u201d This statement is strictly true. Then on what principle can it be said that the judge took the facts from the jury? The defendant did not controvert the exclusion, but put it on the ground that Green had a cigar in his mouth, and was smoking. The testimony is clear that this was the only reason. The fact of smoking was denied stoutly, and Mr. and Mrs. Green\u2019s testimony on this point was thoroughly corroborated. It was the contested fact of the case, and was fully and fairly submitted to the jury, including the credibility of the witnessess, and especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of Green. The case went to the jury on the pivotal question of the case, whether the exclusion of Mrs. Green was on account of her race or color.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Here, too, we find ample evidence to go to the jury. Indeed the point put to the court by the defendants, concedes the sufficiency of the evidence, by requesting the court to charge the jury that the exclusion must have been because she was a colored woman, or because of race or color. No point was made and no error assigned as to the sufficiency of the evidence on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Green had tickets for himself and wife. They started to go into the rear car, where other passengers were entering. Two white ladies immediately in front of them entered, and as Mrs. Green stepped up, the brakeman pushed her back and pointed to the front car. She was in advance, her husband following. The brakeman did not ask them to show their tickets, and said nothing, except that she should not go into that car; told her to go to the next car. She then got on to the platform of the front car to step on to that of the rear, and the brakeman put up the chain. The husband took it down and tried to get his wife on. The brakeman locked the door. While the controversy was going on two white ladies came and were let into the rear car. One of these passengers lived at Parsons, the same place where the Greens lived, and got off there. Shortly afterwards, Judge Handley and other white persons were permitted to enter the rear car. These facts were fully corroborated by James Thomas, Mrs. Thomas and Miss Thomas, all white. Now, in the absence of all other reason than their color, and in view of the permission to white persons to enter, and the very determined and effectual means used by the brakeman to prevent entrance, what other probable inference could be drawn than that it was because of their color they were prevented. The only ground set up was that Green was smoking. But this was fairly submitted to the jury as a sufficient ground to exclude Green himself, and found against the defendants. The verdict of the jury and perhaps the weight of the evidence is against <em>this </em>excuse, so that it was clearly a question for the jury, what was the cause of exclusion. The evidence is clear that these persons were respectable, decent persons, and it is scarcely possible to conceive of any ground of exclusion on the evidence except their color, the smoking being negatived.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">' We perceive no error in the record, and therefore the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-9\">Sharswood, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b425-10\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"AWmm\">filed the following concurring opinion:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">While I concur in the judgment in this case I do not agree to that portion of the opinion in which it is asserted that there was ample evidence to go' to the jury of the exclusion of Mrs. Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>from the car on account of color. The sufficiency of the evidence upon this point was really not before us, as no such question was made in the court below. Its discussion here might well have been omitted,</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The Act of 22d March 1867, Pamph. L. 88, should receive a a reasonable construction. It was manifestly intended to prevent railroad companies making distinctions between passengers on account of race or color. In other words, to secure to colored persons the same rights in travelling as are enjoyed by others. All fair-minded people must concede that this is entirely proper. But I do not think it was intended by said act to give them superior privileges, or to so interfere with the reasonable police arrangement of railroad companies in operating their road and moving their cars as to enable a colored man to force himself into a car where, by reason of such police regulations, a white man may not enter. An ordinary traveller takes his seat in such car as may be pointed out to him by those in charge of the train. In doing so he recognises the undoubted right -of the company to designate the car which he shall enter. He has a right to a seat, but not to a seat in any particular car. There are sufficient reasons why this should be so. Trains are often made up of way cars and through cars. Sometimes there are one or more cars attached occupied by private parties, excursions, &amp;ci Of necessity those in charge of the train must have the right to assign a particular car to the passenger when he gets on the train. Nor do I think they are obliged to give any reason for- the selection, otherwise needless discussions might arise in seating the passengers to the delay of the train and the annoyance of all reasonably disposed travellers. I am unable to see that the mere fact of Mrs. Green\u2019s exclusion from a particular car was evidence that such exclusion was on account of race or color. She was directed to enter a car in which white persons were seated, and which was the -equal in every respect of the car from which she was excluded. One was a New York car and the other was a Philadelphia car. There was no other point of difference. Had she been forced to enter a smoking car, or a car set apart for colored persons, there, would have been a clear violation of the Act of 1867, and this verdict would have.been entirely proper. As no such indignity was offered her, I am of opinion that the case is wholly devoid of evidence to show her exclusion on account of race or color. As, however, this point was not raised, the judgment must be affirmed. I refer to it merely to avoid the appearance of concurring in views which I regard as not only unsound, but as unnecessary to the decision of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
