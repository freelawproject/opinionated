The first count of the indictment charged that the defendant \u201c unlawfully and- fraudulently did make and sign, and was concerned in making and signing \u201d said diploma; and the second that he \u201c unlawfully and fraudulently did utter as true\u201d said instrument. The indictment was found under the 169th sect, of the Act of March 31st 1860, Purd. Dig. 364, pi. 253. At the trial it. appeared that the \u201c Veterinary College \u201d had been incorporated by Act of Assembly, but had not been in existence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>some years. It having come to the knowledge of the police authorities, however, that a number of diplomas, purporting to be of said college, were in the hands of improper parties, who were plying the vocation of veterinary surgeon, they were traced to the defendant, who had been one of the faculty of the college when in existence. A detective was directed by the police authorities to procure the proper evidence to convict McClure of the offence of making and uttering these diplomas, and a young man named Standin, who had been a student at the college, was employed to negotiate with defendant and procure a diploma. Following the directions given him, he finally, after some correspondence, concluded an arrangement whereby he was to receive a diploma for $120. The money to be paid therefor was marked, and when the diploma was delivered to Standin, a dectective arrested McClure. When McClure handed the diploma to Standin, he gave him three books, saying to Standin, <em>\u201c </em>These will help you in your practice. You are now a full-fledged doctor, and are as much entitled to write M. D. after your name as any doctor in the land.\u201d There was no communication or understanding between McClure and Standin that the college was not in existence, or that the names signed to the diploma were not written by the parties whose names were thereto signed, or that the diploma was not a genuine one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">The diploma, which was in evidence, read as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\"><em>Ars Veterinaria post Medicinara Secunda est. </em>VETERINARY COLLEGE OE PHILADELPHIA.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">To all whom it may concern.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">Know ye, That we, the Officers and Professors of the Veterinary College oe Philadelphia,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">Do, by the authority vested in us by the Sovereign Power of the State of Pennsylvania, confer the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, with all the attending immunities consequent thereto, upon Francis Standin, he having attended the curriculum of Studies, and complied with all the requirements imposed by the laws of our Institution.

The 19th sect, of the Criminal Procedure Act of March 31st 1860, 1 Brightly Dig. 379-80, pl. 20, is in these words:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">\u201cIt shall be sufficient, in any indictment for forging, uttering, offering, disposing\u2019 of, or putting off, any instrument whatsoever, or for obtaining or attempting to obtain any property, by false pretenses, to allege that the defendant did the act with intent to defraud; without alleging the intent of the defendant to be to defraud any particular person; and on the trial of any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>offences in this section mentioned, it shall not be necessary to prove any intent on the part of the defendant to defraud any particular person, but it shall be sufficient to prove that the defendant did the act charged with an intent to defraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Here is a positive statute which says you need not charge or prove an intent to defraud any particular person, but it shall be sufficient to charge and prove a general intent to defraud. Hid the legislature mean what it said in this act ? Who can doubt it ? What was the purpose ? Clearly to meet those frauds which affect the public at large. If a man forge bank notes, bonds to bearer, or other documents, intended to deceive the public, and make money out of the imposture, on what principle is this a less offence than if he intended to cheat a single individual ? He often does not circulate them himself, but sells them, at a percentage on their face, to accomplices, who circulate them to the injury of the public. Such a counterfeiter is far more dangerous to society than the- \u201cshover,\u201d as he is called, of the bills or counterfeit papers. Now that any foreign case should control a Pennsylvania statute, so plain in its intent and beneficial in its purposes, would itself be almost a fraud upon the public. We cannot recognise any such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The case before us is a clear one. The defendant procured a certain diploma to be fraudulently and falsely signed with the names of certain persons as the \u25a0 officers of a once existing institution authorized to grant degrees. He sold this diploma to a person named Standin for $120, after a correspondence on the subject, resulting in the price named. Standin, it is true, was engaged to trap the defendant and he was not deceived. But not so the defendant; he sold the forged diploma-in order to make money out of it, and thereby intending to defraud any and every one putting trust in it, as the evidence of the skill and knowledge of the person named in the diploma. He fell directly within the words and intent of the 19th sect, referred to; he had a fraudulent intent in his act; his purpose was corrupt and injurious; and this the law says shall be sufficient; and it shall not be neqessary to prove any intent to defraud any particular person. No one can doubt the fraud such a document is intended to perpetrate, or the intent to defraud, that the forger had, when he got it up and used it. It is just such a case as the law intends to reach, a general intent quite as injurious to the public as an intent to defraud a particular person.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Sentence affirmed, and the record is ordered to be remitted' to the Court of Quarter Sessions, for the purpose of proceeding to bring the defendant into court and committing him to custody, in order that the sentence of the court shall be fully carried into effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
