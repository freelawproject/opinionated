Starr appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her suit for failure to comply with an earlier sanction order. The dismissal is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gelabert v. Lynaugh, </em>894 F.2d 746, 747-48 (5th Cir.1990). Starr argues that the sanction order was false and was limited to the proceedings of the prior suit. Starr is correct in that the 1997 sanction order prohibited her, without exception, from filing any motions or pleadings related to the prior suit or her involuntary commitment to the Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield in this court or any district court in the circuit. The sanction order then provided that other pleadings or filings could be filed with the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>mission of a district judge. The record is clear that she was sanctioned by this court and that she had not complied with the sanction order by requesting and receiving permission to file the instant complaint. The district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing the prior sanction order by dismissing Starr\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
