In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s order was entered on the criminal docket on July 25, 2007, 2007 WL 2156110, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(6); the ten-day appeal expired on August 8, 2007. Monroe mailed his notice of appeal, at the earliest, on August 30, 2007. Thus, under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), Monroe\u2019s notice of appeal was filed beyond the ten-day appeal period but within the excusable neglect period that expired on September 7, 2007. Because Monroe\u2019s notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Monroe has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
