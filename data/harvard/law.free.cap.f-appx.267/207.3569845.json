Under threat of force I involuntarily submitted ... [i]f DCD 20-9 allows collection by force, it is invalid. If allowed by law, it is unconstitutional.\u201d (ER 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">The district court dismissed the action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) (2000) without service of process against the Defendants, noting that the Act was similar to Virginia\u2019s DNA collection act, citing to our opinions in <em>Ewell v. Murray, </em>11 F.3d 482 (4th Cir.1993), and <em>Jones v. Murray, </em>962 F.2d 302 (4th Cir.1992). On appeal, Rendelman argues that the district court failed to address his claim regarding the threatened use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">We review de novo a \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) dismissal. <em>De\u2019Lonta v. Angelone, </em>330 F.3d 630, 633 (4th Cir.2003) (according de novo review to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal for failure to state a claim). Allegations in the complaint are to be liberally construed, and a court should not dismiss a claim for failure to state a claim \u201c \u2018unless after accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in the plaintiffs favor, it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Veney v. Wyche, </em>293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">We note that neither the <em>Ewell </em>nor <em>Jones </em>opinions discussed any use of force to obtain a DNA sample. Rather, both cases focused on punishments meted out for refusing to provide a sample, but did not discuss the forcible extraction of a DNA sample. <em>Ewell v. Murray, </em>11 F.3d at 486-88; <em>Jones v. Murray, </em>962 F.2d at 303. Here, despite the district court\u2019s statements to the contrary,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it is not clear what steps the Defendants would have taken to forcibly extract a sample from Rendelman. Maryland\u2019s decision to use force to extract DNA from prisoners distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>guishes the Act from the Virginia cases relied upon by the district court to summarily dismiss the action. Thus, we vacate and remand the case to the district court to further address this issue, noting that service of process against Defendants, and an answer to the complaint, would assist in clarifying the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\"> The district court stated that it had attached DCD 20-9 to its opinion. We can find no such attachment in the record, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
