Valderrama also appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying her plea for leave to renew or to reopen motion for summary judgment and her motion to reconsider the motion to file a sur-reply, in which she sought reconsideration of the court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir. 1988). Summary judgment may only be granted when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ-P. 56(c). With this standard in mind, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Valderrama v. Honeywell Tech. Solutions, Inc., </em>473 F.Supp.2d 658 (D. Md. filed Feb. 14, 2007 &amp; entered Feb. 15, 2007; Apr. 5, 2007 &amp; entered Apr. 6, 2007). We deny Valderrama\u2019s pending motion for mandamus relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
