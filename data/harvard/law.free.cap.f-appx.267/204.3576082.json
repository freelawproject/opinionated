Jones was sentenced to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment on the \u00a7 1951 violations and an additional 84 months on the \u00a7 924(c) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">On appeal, Jones asserts that he should have been sentenced to no more than five years for the \u00a7 924(c) violation. According to Jones, the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence by two years based on a finding that the firearm was brandished, which was not alleged in the indictment, admitted by Jones, or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. Jones bases his argument on <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), which struck down California\u2019s determinate sentencing law. However, as Jones acknowledges, the Supreme Court, in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), has already decided this issue adversely to his position. Accordingly, as the Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Harris, </em>we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
