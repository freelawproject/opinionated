The district court sentenced Zetino-Rivera to the statutory minimum of sixty months of imprisonment. ZetinoRivera timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">On appeal, counsel has filed an Anders<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> brief, in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questions whether the district court acted unreasonably when it failed to consider the evidence offered by Zetino-Rivera in support of his motion for a variance below the statutory minimum sentence. Zetino-Rivera was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. The Government declined to file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-24\">Zetino-Rivera\u2019s sentence was the mandatory minimum sentence. The district court properly recognized that, absent a substantial assistance motion filed by the government pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), it lacked authority to sentence Zetino-Rivera below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>450 F.3d 565, 568-69 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-25\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Zetino-Rivera\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>vietion and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Zetino-Rivera, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Zetino-Rivera requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Zetino-Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-18\"><em> Anders v.
