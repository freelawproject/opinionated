The district court awarded a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to Gormley on his contention that trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to persuade the trial court to accept his \u201ctheory of the defense\u201d instruction and failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>preserve the issue for appeal. We deny relief on this issue and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In an appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 267 (4th Cir.2007). In order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To satisfy the second prong, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that his attorney\u2019s errors altered the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Having reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s decision, we conclude that Gormley cannot establish that trial counsel was ineffective in his conduct regarding a \u201ctheory of the defense\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus, we affirm the portion of the district court\u2019s order rejecting this claim for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Gormley, </em>Nos. 3:98-cr-00152-2; 3:03-cv-00340 (S.D. W. Va. June 22, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> In addition, to the extent that appellate counsel's failure to raise this issue on appeal was included in the district court's certificate of appealability, we find that this claim fails under <em>Strickland, </em>as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
