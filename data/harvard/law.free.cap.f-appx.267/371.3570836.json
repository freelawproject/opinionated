The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the order of the immigration judge (IJ). The respondent moves for summary disposition based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 255-56 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1031, 126 S.Ct. 733, 163 L.Ed.2d 569 (2005). In the alternative, the respondent moves to reset the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Because he was inadmissible pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), the BIA did not act arbitrarily when it determined that Yepez was not eligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). <em>MorteraCruz, </em>409 F.3d at 255-56. Although Yepez argues that this court should revisit <em>Mort-era-Cruz </em>in light of decisions from the Ninth and Tenth Circuits that interpret the \u00a7 1255 waiver more broadly, one panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel determination. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir. 1999). Because this court is bound by <em>Mortera-Cruz, </em>there is no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, and summary disposition is appropriate. <em>See NLRB v. Evans Plumbing Co., </em>639 F.2d 291, 292 n. 1 (5th Cir.1981). The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">MOTION FOR SUMMARY DISPOSITION GRANTED; PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION TO RESET BRIEFING SCHEDULE DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
