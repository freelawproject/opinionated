On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issues: whether (1) Abney received ineffective assistance of trial counsel, but was unable to express this belief because counsel died between his guilty plea and sentencing hearing, and (2) Abney\u2019s sentence was improperly enhanced because of drug weight and his role in the offense. The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. For the reasons that follow, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">We grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of Abney\u2019s sentence. The record reveals that Abney waived his right to appeal \u201cany sentencing guidelines factors or the Court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines factors to the facts of my case\u201d (J.A. 17) as long as he received a \u201cfair sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>(Id.). </em>Our review of the record reveals that Abney received a fair sentencing hearing, a fair plea hearing that complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11, and that Abney knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence in this regard. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of Abney\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>issues are without merit. First, Abney has failed to meet the demanding burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). Second, Abney has waived his right to attack his sentence. Moreover, the record does not support his claims that his sentence was improperly increased because of drug weight or his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal of Abney\u2019s sentence and affirm his conviction. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
