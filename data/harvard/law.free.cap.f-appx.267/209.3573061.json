Perkins State Hospital Center (\u201cthe Center\u201d) after being found not competent to stand trial, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of two actions he filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>I. 07-7576</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Kelly\u2019s first complaint asserted due process and equal protection violations arising from statements the director of the Center made in the course of Kelly\u2019s competency hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding that two defendants\u2014 the State of Maryland and the Center\u2014 were not amenable to suit under \u00a7 1988, the district court dismissed the claims against them. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), the district court dismissed Kelly\u2019s remaining claims as frivolous because they espoused an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court did not err in dismissing Kelly\u2019s claims against the State of Maryland and the Center. A cause of action under \u00a7 1983 requires the deprivation of a civil right by a \u201cperson\u201d acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It is now well settled that a state cannot be sued under \u00a7 1983. <em>Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (\u201c[N]either a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are \u2018persons\u2019 under \u00a7 1983.\u201d). This rule applies \u201cto States or governmental entities that are considered \u2018arms of the State\u2019 for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. Therefore, because the Center was properly considered an arm of the State of Maryland, it cannot be sued under \u00a7 1983 either. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 65-70, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>Foremost Guaranty Corp. v. Community Sav. &amp; Loan, Inc., </em>826 F.2d 1383, 1386-88 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">A district court has broad discretion to dismiss a complaint if the action is \u201cfrivolous or malicious\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1915(d). <em>See White v. White, </em>886 F.2d 721, 722 (4th Cir.1989). An action is frivolous or malicious if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory or if the factual contentions are clearly baseless. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992); <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Kelly\u2019s remaining claims as frivolous. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Kelly v. State of Maryland, </em>8:07-cv-02601-AW (D.Md. Oct. 17, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">II. 07-7634</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Kelly\u2019s second complaint alleged due process and equal protection violations arising from the Center librarian\u2019s refusal to perform legal research for Kelly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Kelly\u2019s complaint on the grounds that the State of Maryland was not amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983 and the complaint failed to adequately state claims against the remaining Defendants. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Kelly v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>State of Maryland, </em>No. 8:07-cv-02600-AW (D.Md.

Kelly also asserted several state common law claims, including libel. After the district court dismissed the claims on which federal jurisdiction was based, it exercised its discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (2000) to decline jurisdiction over, the state law claims.
