This issue was not raised below and is hence reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 720 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(April 18, 2007) (No. 06-1381). In light of <em>Mejia-Huerta, </em>even if there were error in this respect, any such error is not plain, clear or obvious. <em>See id. </em>at 722-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-23\">We reject appellant\u2019s contention that <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), in effect overruled <em>Mejia-Huerta. </em>No such or similar issue was before the Court or presented by the facts of that case and the Court did not expressly advert to that issue or to the holding in this respect in <em>Mejia-Hmrta </em>or to the circuit split on that issue or to any of the decisions reflecting such split.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-26\">We also note that the parties are in agreement, and the district court\u2019s remarks at sentencing unambiguously reflect, that the district court first correctly determined the guideline range and then expressly determined to sentence appellant outside of that range based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and did <em>not </em>make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>a guidelines departure. While the written statement of reasons is suggestive of a guidelines departure, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>United States v. Moreci, </em>283 F.3d 293, 299-300 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Zuburi also argues that his above-guidelines sentence is unreasonable. The district court provided a detailed justification for the above-guidelines sentence that was based on Zuburi\u2019s recent, escalating criminal history. Accordingly, Zuburi\u2019s 18-month sentence was reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-601, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-19\">. The Supreme Court did recently grant certiorari in <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2006) (holding no notice required before imposing above guidelines sentence), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008). Nevertheless, <em>Mejia-Huerta </em>remains the law of this circuit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
