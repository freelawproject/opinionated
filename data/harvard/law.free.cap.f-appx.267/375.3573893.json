We affirm as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b403-28\">When NH Texas Properties Limited Partnership (\u201cNH Texas\u201d) amended its commercial lease agreement with HP/Texas Properties, Inc. (\u201cHP/Texas\u201d), Douglas Mittleider executed the Guaranty in favor of NH Texas. After HP/Texas failed to make rent payments, NH Texas filed suit against Mittleider for payment under the Guaranty. The district court entered a judgment in favor of NH Texas in the amount of $440,158.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-29\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b403-30\">Mittleider argues\u2014and NH Texas concedes\u2014that the total amount of the judgment should be no more than $209,823.12.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>We therefore modify the amount stated in the judgment. Only one issue remains for us to decide: whether the district court erred in concluding that the guaranty covers more than the first $1,236,180.00 in rent due under the lease. The interpretation of a contract is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Dell Computer Corp. v. Rodriguez, </em>390 F.3d 377, 384 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In relevant part, the Guaranty states that Mittleider \u201cguarantees ... payment by Tenant of rent in the amount of $1,236,180.00 due under the lease in the manner and at the time prescribed in the Lease, which is a portion of the rent is [sic] payable from the date hereof until February 1, 2006....\u201d The district court concluded that Mittleider guaranteed payment of rent for the stated period, up to a total amount of $1,236,180.00. In other words, the district court found that Mittleider was liable for no more than $1,236,180.00 in unpaid rent accruing during the period stated in the Guaranty, without regard to the amount of rent actually paid during the period.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On appeal, Mittleider contends that the Guaranty guarantees only that the first $1,236,180.00 in rent would be paid. Because more than $2 million was paid under the lease, Mittleider argues that his obligation terminated before HP/Texas failed to make the rent payments at issue. We disagree. As the district court noted, the Guaranty did not specifically state that Mittleider \u201cguarantees the first $1,236,180.00\u201d or \u201conly the first $1,236,180.00 that becomes due\u201d or similar language, though this would have been a much simpler way of conveying the interpretation Mittleider advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Moreover, part of the Guaranty would be meaningless if we were to accept Mittleider\u2019s interpretation. The Guaranty provision ends with the clause: \u201cwhich is a portion of the rent ... payable from the date hereof until February 1, 2006.\u201d There would be no need to define an end date of Mittleider\u2019s liability if the guarantee was intended to end as soon as $1,236,180.00 in rent was paid. As the contract states, this amount was only \u201ca portion\u201d of what would become due before February 1, 2006. If the tenant paid the first $1,236,180.00 in rent, Mittleider\u2019s liability could not extend beyond February 1, 2006. If the tenant failed to pay the first $1,236,180.00 in rent, Mittleider would become liable before February 1, 2006. In either case, the end date would be irrelevant under Mittleider\u2019s interpretation of the contract. A court is to \u201cconsider ... and give effect to <em>all </em>the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.\u201d <em>Preston Ridge Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Tyler, </em>796 S.W.2d 772, 778 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1990, writ denied) (citing <em>Coker v. Coker, </em>650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex. 1983)). The district court properly imposed liability on Mittleider under the Guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment as modified by the parties\u2019 stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">AFFIRMED as MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
