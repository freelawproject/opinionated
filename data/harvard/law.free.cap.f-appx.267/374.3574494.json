Lindsey, Louisiana prisoner # 121881, was convicted by a jury of simple robbery and was sentenced to life imprisonment after being adjudicated a fourth felony offender. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging this conviction. He argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by fading to investigate and challenge his prior convictions. Lindsey maintains that counsel should have challenged his 1988 simple burglary guilty plea because the plea resulted in a deferred adjudication that could not be counted against him. The statute upon which Lindsey relies addresses the successful completion of deferred adjudication for first-time simple drug possession; Lindsey\u2019s burglary conviction is not covered. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. 40:983(A), <em>repealed by </em>Acts 1995, No. 1251, \u00a7 2. Counsel does not render ineffective assistance by failing to make frivolous arguments. <em>See Johnson v. Cockrell, </em>306 F.3d 249, 255 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-22\">Lindsey also contends that his life sentence was excessive in light of various mitigating factors. To the extent that Lindsey is arguing that he was entitled to a lesser sentence in light of state law, his claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 2254. <em>See Derden v. McNeel, </em>978 F.2d 1453, 1458 (5th Cir.1992). To the extent that Lindsey is arguing that his life sentence is unconstitutionally excessive, he has failed to establish that his sentence is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d when compared to the offense committed. <em>See Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 965-66, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980). Lindsey has not established that the state courts\u2019 denial of relief \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u00a7 2254(d)(1). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
