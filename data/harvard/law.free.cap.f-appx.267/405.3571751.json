As Marquez-Perez has not challenged the denial of his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture, any such challenge is abandoned. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Marquez-Perez argues that business owners in El Salvador who are targeted by gang members for money constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d for purposes of an application for asylum and withholding of removal. He also argues that he established past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution if he returned to El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Marquez-Perez established neither past persecution nor a well-founded fear of future persecution from gangs in El Salvador due to his alleged membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d or any other of the remaining grounds enumerated under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b); <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir. 2006); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also Matter of A-M-E &amp; J-G-U, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69 (BIA 2007) . Because Marquez-Perez has not satisfied the asylum standard, he cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 186 n. 2 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-19\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
