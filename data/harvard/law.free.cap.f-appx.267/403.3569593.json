The release followed his guilty plea conviction for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and for distributing cocaine. Alaniz argues that the district court imposed a longer sentence of imprisonment than that recommended by the United States Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements applicable to violations of supervised release (which he says was within the range of four to ten months). He asserts that this was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">The district court may impose any sentence that falls within the maximum term of imprisonment allowed by statute for the revocation sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In doing so, the district court is to consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and the advisory policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 90 (5th Cir.1994). The statutory maximum term of imprisonment upon the revocation of Alaniz\u2019s supervised release was five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Consequently, it was not error to sentence Alaniz to two years in prison. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-19\">Alaniz\u2019s argument that the district court did not adequately articulate its sentencing reasons also fails. On plain-error review of a revocation sentence, it suffices to show that the sentencing factors were at least implicitly considered. <em>United States v. Teran, </em>98 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir.1996). By announcing the reasons it gave for Alaniz\u2019s revocation sentence, the district court demonstrated that it had implicitly considered the appropriate sentencing factors. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
