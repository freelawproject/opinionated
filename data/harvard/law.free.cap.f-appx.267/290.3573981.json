Carmichael appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in making a 6-level adjustment for assault on a law enforcement officer in a manner that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury during the offense, or immediate flight therefrom, under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3A1.2 (c)(1) (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">Carmichael was stopped by Goldsboro, North Carolina, Police Officer Steven Powers because Carmichael\u2019s vehicle matched the description of a car involved in recent drive-by shooting. Powers called for backup after seeing what appeared to be marijuana on Carmichael\u2019s pants. Carmichael, who had a loaded firearm concealed in his waistband, tried to flee through the open passenger-side window. After a brief struggle with Powers, who reached in through the window on the driver\u2019s side and grabbed his legs, Carmichael succeeded in pulling the top half of his body out of the window. Powers testified at the sentencing hearing that, at this point, he looked over the roof of the car and saw a gun in Carmichael\u2019s hand, coming toward him. Powers shot and wounded Carmichael.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">At sentencing, the district court heard conflicting testimony about the incident from Powers, the backup officer, Carmichael, and two -witnesses to the incident. Carmichael testified that he did not take the gun from his waistband before he was shot. The court found Powers\u2019 testimony to be the most credible. Carmichael also argued that the \u00a7 3A1.2 (c)(1) adjustment required a finding that he intended to harm the officer, but he informed the court that he would not object to a 2-level adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment). The court applied \u00a7 3A1.2, finding that Carmichael caused Powers to fear that he would be shot, thus making the implied finding that his conduct amounted to an assault in a manner that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its interpretation of the guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Quinn, </em>359 F.3d 666, 679 (4th Cir.2004). Application Note 4 to \u00a7 3A1.2 states that \u201c[s]ubsection (c) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault\u201d against a law enforcement officer or prison official, and that \u201cits applicability is limited to assaultive conduct against such official victims that is sufficiently serious to create at least \u2018a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d The commentary to \u00a7 3A1.2 does not define aggravated assault. Nor does it require a showing of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Carmichael contends that the district court should have applied the definition of aggravated assault set out in Application Note 1 to USSG \u00a7 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault). However, \u00a7 2A2.2 is not applicable to Carmichael\u2019s offense. Definitions of widely-used terms are set out in USSG \u00a7 1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Application Note 2 to \u00a7 1B1.1 states that definitions of terms contained in other guidelines \u201care not designed for general applicability\u201d and \u201ctheir applicability to sections other than those expressly referenced must be determined on a case by case basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In this case, Carmichael concedes, as he did in the district court, that his conduct caused a substantial risk of serious injury to Powers, but maintains that only a 2-level adjustment under \u00a7 3C1.2 was warranted. However, both \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) and \u00a7 3C1.2 may apply, without a finding of intent, if the defendant created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. The difference is that, if the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the risk to an official victim, such as a law enforcement officer, the 6-level adjustment under \u00a7 3A1.2 must be applied. <em>See United States v. Sloley, </em>19 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.1994); <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, comment. (n.l) (\u00a7 3C1.2 should not be applied if another Chapter Three adjustment results in greater increase in offense level based on same conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Carmichael attempts to distinguish <em>Sloley, </em>asserting that the only issue in that case was the district court\u2019s factual finding that Sloley assaulted the officer. However, like Carmichael, Sloley argued that his conduct warranted the application of \u00a7 3C1.2 instead of \u00a7 3A1.2. We noted in <em>Sloley </em>that, if both \u00a7 3A1.2(b) and \u00a7 3C1.2 apply, the sentencing court must apply \u00a7 3A1.2, which provides a greater increase, <em>see </em>19 F.3d at 154, and for that reason, we stated that the relevant question was whether the defendant\u2019s conduct warranted a finding that he had assaulted the officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. <em>Id. </em>Here, as in <em>Sloley, </em>Carmichael\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to the officer. We find no error in the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3A1.2 (c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> When <em>Sloley </em>was decided, the pertinent language was in \u00a7 3A1.2(b) and the guideline provided only a three-level adjustment. Amendment 664, effective November 1, 2004, added subsection (c) and increased the adjustment to six levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
