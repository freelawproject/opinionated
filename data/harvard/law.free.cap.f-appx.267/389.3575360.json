The district court granted a COA regarding the following grounds: (1) whether Mattio was denied effective assistance of counsel and (2) whether Mattio\u2019s due process rights were violated when the State withheld exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">In a habeas corpus appeal, we \u201creview the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo, applying the same standard of review to the state court\u2019s decision as the district court.\u201d <em>Beazley v. Johnson, </em>242 F.3d 248, 255 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In addition, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on questions adjudicated on the merits by the state court unless the state court\u2019s decision (1) was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">Mattio contends that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>to call two crucial witnesses at trial who could have impeached the testimony of the victim. To prevail on an ineffective-assistance claim, a defendant must show \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Failure to establish either deficient performance or prejudice defeats the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The court indulges in a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s representation fell within the wide range of reasonable professional competence, or that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Bridge v. Lynaugh, </em>838 F.2d 770, 773 (5th Cir.1988) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Mattio has not overcome the presumption that his counsel reasonably relied upon the subpoena he issued as well as assurances he received from one of the witnesses that he would testify. <em>See Bridge, </em>838 F.2d at 773. Mattio similarly has failed to rebut the presumption concerning the second uncalled witness who allegedly would have testified that he smelled alcohol on the victim\u2019s breath. <em>See Wilkerson v. Cain, </em>233 F.3d 886, 892-93 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Mattio contends that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to subpoena and inspect the victim\u2019s medical records. Even if it is assumed that the medical records Mattio sought to present at trial demonstrated that the victim had consumed alcohol, Mattio has not shown that such evidence was sufficient to nullify the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Mattio contends that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by stipulating to damaging evidence. Because Mattio\u2019s counsel objected to the use of a photo identification, Mattio\u2019s argument regarding this evidence was moot. Further, Mattio cannot challenge the stipulation of DNA evidence because the district court did not grant a COA on the ground, and he has not requested an expansion of the COA. <em>See United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1998). Additionally, he does not articulate what trial strategy should have been pursued in light of the undisputed evidence that he had sex with the victim. Thus, Mattio has not overcome the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s decision to stipulate to the evidence was \u201csound trial strategy.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Nor has he shown prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Mattio contends that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to explain the consent defense and to allow him to testify at trial. Although a defense counsel\u2019s \u201cdecision whether to put a Defendant on the stand is a \u2018judgment call\u2019 which should not easily be condemned with the benefit of hindsight,\u201d \u201cit cannot be permissible trial strategy, regardless of its merits otherwise, for counsel to override the ultimate decision of a defendant to testify contrary to his advice.\u201d <em>United States v. Mullins, </em>315 F.3d 449, 453 (5th Cir.2002). Assuming that Mattio was not fully informed of his right and that he has met the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>he has nevertheless failed to establish prejudice in light of the totality of the evidence introduced at trial. <em>See Mullins, </em>315 F.3d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Mattio argues that his due process rights were violated because the State withheld exculpatory evidence, namely the victim\u2019s rap sheet showing her DWI conviction and pending DWI prosecution. Because Mattio has not established any \u201cmaterial\u201d use for the evidence, his assertion is wholly conclusional and insufficient to warrant habeas relief under <em>Brady v. Mary</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>land, </em>873 U.S. 83, 86-87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). <em>See Murphy v. Johnson, </em>205 F.3d 809, 814 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mattio\u2019s habeas application.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
