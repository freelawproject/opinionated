Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review factual determinations\u2014including the determination that an alien is unentitled to withholding of removal\u2014under the substantial evidence test. <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cUnder this highly deferential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">We address Garcia\u2019s asylum claim first. The IJ determined that Garcia\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that extraordinary circumstances did not excuse the untimely filing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government asserts that we lack jurisdiction to review the determination that Garcia was ineligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">We review \u201cquestions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). An asylum application must be \u201cfiled within [one] year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application----\u201d8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). But the determination of whether an alien can apply for asylum is left exclusively to the Attorney General; so we do not have jurisdiction to review a decision about whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established circumstances that would excuse her untimely filing. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Garcia\u2019s asylum application was untimely. We also lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination on whether extraordinary circumstances excused the untimely filing. <em>Id. </em>We dismiss Garcia\u2019s petition for review on her asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">We now address Garcia\u2019s withholding of removal claim. An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that her life or freedom would be threatened \u201cbecause of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Therefore, an alien bears the burden of demonstrating that she more-likely-than-not would be persecuted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>or tortured upon return to her country of nationality.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Garcia argues that she has established past persecution based on a protected ground because she was threatened repeatedly by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) over the telephone and, on one occasion, was detained by the FARC for a few hours. Garcia, who testified that she was a member of Colombia\u2019s Conservative Party, contends that the FARC\u2019s acts were the result of her participation in health brigades in Colombia and her refusal to comply with the FARC\u2019s demands for medical assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Garcia failed to meet her burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal. Even if we were to assume that Garcia\u2019s past mistreatment was based on a protected ground, this mistreatment does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that five-day detention \u201cduring which [the petitioner] was not harmed does not <em>compel </em>the conclusion that he experienced past persecution\u201d); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (explaining that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation\u201d and that \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). Therefore, the record does not compel the conclusion that Garcia more-likely-than-not would face persecution in Colombia on account of a protected ground. We deny Garcia\u2019s petition on her withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-14\">. Garcia included her husband and children as derivatives in her asylum application. But as will be discussed, we only consider Garcia's withholding of removal claim; and \u201cthere are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\"><em>. </em>On appeal, Garcia does not offer argument on the denial of CAT relief; therefore, this claim is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that petitioner abandons issue by failing to offer argument on that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b863-15\">. Garcia entered the United States in 2000; but she did not file her asylum application until 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">. If the alien establishes past persecution in her country based on a protected ground, it is presumed that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to that country unless the government shows by a preponderance of evidence that, among other things, (1) the country's conditions have changed such that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened; or (2) it would be reasonable for the alien to relocate to another part of the country. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. An alien who has not shown past persecution may be entitled to withholding of removal if she can demonstrate a future threat to her life or freedom on a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
