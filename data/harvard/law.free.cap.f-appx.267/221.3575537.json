The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Woodberry has not made the requisite showing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Woodberry\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> To the extent that the district court erred in finding that several of Woodberry\u2019s ineffective assistance claims were precluded because they were encompassed in our decision on direct appeal, we have reviewed these claims on the merits and conclude that no certificate of appealability is warranted. <em>See generally United States v. King, 119 </em>F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997) (noting that ineffective assistance claims are not generally cognizable on direct appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
