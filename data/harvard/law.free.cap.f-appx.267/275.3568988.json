West seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his civil action. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-24\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

The notice of appeal was filed on September 5, 2007. On December 21, 2007, West filed a motion in this court to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period. We deny the motion to extend or reopen the appeal period and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
