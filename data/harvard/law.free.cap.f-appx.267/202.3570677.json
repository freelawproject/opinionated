We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">Our jurisdiction is limited to the Board\u2019s order dismissing the appeal from the order denying the motion to reconsider. In his brief, Solomon-Tebika challenges the immigration judge\u2019s earlier order denying his applications for asylum, withholding from removal and withholding under the Convention Against Torture. This court lacks jurisdiction over these challenges because Solomon-Tebika failed to exhaust administrative remedies by appealing the immigration judge\u2019s decision to the Board. \u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (West 2005). When Congress has statutorily mandated exhaustion, that requirement must be enforced. <em>Kurfees v. INS, </em>275 F.3d 332, 336 (4th Cir.2001). Moreover, this court has held it lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument not made before the Board. <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-21\">Because Solomon-Tebika does not challenge the Board\u2019s order dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s order denying the motion to reconsider in his brief, we will not review the order. \u201cIt is a well settled rule that contentions not raised in the argument section of the opening brief are abandoned.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
