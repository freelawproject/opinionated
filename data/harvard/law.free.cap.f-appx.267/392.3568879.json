In filing the IFP motion, Jones is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">There is no merit to Jones\u2019s argument that District Attorney Susan Reed and Assistant District Attorney Samantha Dimaio forfeited their immunity because they acted maliciously, intentionally, and in retaliation for his sex-offender status. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 431, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Because Jones does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his claims against Sheriff Ralph Lopez, Michael Valicek, and Sergeant G.D. Kuschel, he has abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of those defendants. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Jones\u2019s appeal has no arguable merit, is frivolous, and is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal by the district court of Jones\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Jones is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Jones\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
