Goode pled guilty to receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) (2000), and was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of five years imprisonment. The court also imposed a ten-year term of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(k) (West Supp.2007). Goode appeals his sentence on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>that the advisory guideline range was incorrectly calculated. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The district court adopted the guideline calculation set out in the presentence report, overruling Goode\u2019s objections and finding that the guideline range would have been 37-46 months, but was increased to the statutory minimum term of 60 months under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1. 1(b) (2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Goode does not dispute that he was subject to the 60-month minimum term or that the guideline range was 60 months pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.2(b). He contends that the court should have applied USSG \u00a7 2G2.4 (possession of child pornography) instead of \u00a7 2G2.2 (trafficking in child pornography), and erred in making an enhancement for distribution under subsection (b)(2)(E). Both issues pertain only to the initial computation of the guideline range before the application of \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). We conclude that the district court correctly determined that Goode\u2019s guideline range was 60 months and sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> Goode\u2019s offense was committed in October 2003. The 2002 Guidelines Manual was applied to avoid ex post facto issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
