Wilson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on retroactive Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Wilson argues that, based upon Amendment 591, the sentencing court miscalculated his base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Wilson\u2019s argument is without merit. Amendment 591 applies to the determination of the appropriate Chapter Two offense guidelines section, and Wilson was properly sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the appropriate offense guidelines section for his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Amendment 591 is irrelevant to the determination of base (or specific) offense levels within the applicable offense guidelines section or to any consideration of relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment 591 (Nov. 2000). To the extent that Wilson merely argues that his sentence was improperly calculated, that is not a ground for modification of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance in lieu of filing a brief is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
