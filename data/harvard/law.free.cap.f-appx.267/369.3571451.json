Zamudio contends the district court improperly refused \u25a0 to award him a \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">If a defendant meets the five criteria of the safety-valve provision, a sentencing court must reference its sentence to the Sentencing Guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The second of these criteria, and the only one at issue in this case, requires that \u201cthe defendant did not use violence <em>or </em>credible threats of violence ... in connection with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">The relevant conduct is undisputed. On October 8, 2006, a Border Patrol agent, responding to suspicious behavior, attempted to stop Zamudio\u2019s car. In the course of attempting to avoid the traffic stop, Zamudio lost control of his car. Zamudio\u2019s car came to rest facing the Border Patrol agent\u2019s patrol car. After the agent parked his car in front of Zamudio\u2019s car and began to exit his car, Zamudio accelerated his car and hit the front of the agent\u2019s car at a rate of speed of approximately five to ten miles per hour. Then, after hitting the agent\u2019s car, Zamudio again attempted to flee, but he was unable to flee as his car\u2019s tires had lost traction. Zamudio did not further attempt to resist arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">After taking testimony, including from the agent, the district court concluded that Zamudio\u2019s conduct was both violent and a credible threat of violence. The district court thus refused to award Zamudio the safety valve reduction. Zamudio timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">Zamudio argues that the district court erred in determining that he used violence in connection with his offense. He argues that \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2)\u2019s reference to \u201cuse violence\u201d requires the intentional use of violent or destructive physical force. Zamudio further contends that there is no evidence that he intentionally used violent or destructive physical force when he \u201cbumped\u201d the agent\u2019s car at a low rate of speed in an attempt to flee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-18\">The Government responds that the district court did not clearly err in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that Zamudio\u2019s conduct was both violent and constituted a credible threat of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We stress that a court\u2019s refusal to apply \u00a7 5C1.2 is a factual finding that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.1995). A finding is clearly erroneous only if, based on its review of the record, this court is \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 238 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As long as the finding is plausible in light of the entire record, it cannot be clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Neither \u00a7 5C1.2 nor the accompanying commentary defines \u201cviolence\u201d or \u201ccredible threats of violence.\u201d This case, however, does not require definitions of these common terms for the purpose of determining the issue here: whether the district court\u2019s finding of fact was clear error. Certainly, it is entirely plausible, even under the definition offered by Zamudio, that Zamudio\u2019s striking of the agent\u2019s car with his car was violent and/or constituted a credible threat of violence, especially as the agent was attempting to exit his vehicle at the time Zamudio ran his car into the agent\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The district court did not clearly err by refusing to award Zamudio the safety valve reduction. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-13\">. Zamudio also argues that the district court\u2019s determination that the evidence was insufficient to justify a two-level reckless-endangerment enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Cl.2 indicates the absence of any use of violence or credible threats of violence. This argument is without merit. To support the two-level enhancement under that provision, the Government must show that \"the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the impact here was insufficient to create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury is not determinative of whether Zamudio\u2019s conduct was violent or constituted a credible threat of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
