Pursuant to a plea agreement, Perry pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.CA. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000) and (b)(1)(C) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007), and possession of a firearm after having three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000) and 924(e) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007). At sentencing, the district court determined Perry was an Armed Career Criminal within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007) and that he had a resulting advisory guidelines range of 188-285 months\u2019 imprisonment. In conformity with this range, the district court sentenced Perry to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Perry timely noted his appeal and now argues that his sentence was unreasonable. We affirm for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. The district court must calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range by making any necessary factual findings. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir. 2006) . The court should then afford the parties \u201can opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Then, the sentencing court should consider the resulting advisory guideline range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007) , and determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence requested by either party. <em>Id. </em>Considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) does not require the sentencing court to \u201crobotically tick through\u201d every subsection of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). The sentencing court may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable, but if it decides to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range it \u201cmust consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">On appeal, we review a sentence for reasonableness, focusing on whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). This involves two steps, first examining the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural errors,\u201d and second, evaluating the substance of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>Significant procedural errors include \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). \u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the appellate court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, it may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. Moreover, it must give \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 8558(a) factors justify the extent of any variance sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">On appeal, Perry seizes on the language in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007) that a sentencing court is to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and appears to argue that the district court failed to properly consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Simply because the district court may have weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors differently than Perry desired does not establish that the district court committed a significant procedural error in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Additionally, Perry\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468 at 473-74. Perry acquired numerous felony convictions at a young age and continued to offend into adulthood. Ultimately, Perry was arrested in possession of crack cocaine and a loaded .40 caliber handgun and was properly characterized as an armed career criminal. These facts were aptly countered by argument in mitigation from defense counsel and by Perry\u2019s allocution. This court may presume that Perry\u2019s advisory guidelines sentence of 188 months was reasonable, and Perry has failed to rebut such a presumption. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
