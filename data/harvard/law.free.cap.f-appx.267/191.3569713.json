As Clyburn was determined to be a career offender, he was sentenced to 264 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Although Clyburn was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he did not do so, and the Government elected not to file a responding brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Because Clyburn did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review any alleged Rule 11 error for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-26 (4th Cir.2002). To establish plain error, Clyburn must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.2005). We have reviewed the record and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
