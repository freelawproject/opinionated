A magistrate judge found Daniels operated a vehicle on a suspended license, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (2000), assimilating Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-301 (Michie 2004), and sentenced Daniels to six months\u2019 supervised probation. Daniels appealed to the district court pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 58(g)(2), and the district court affirmed. Daniels appealed to this court, contending the district court erroneously found he was driving on a Virginia highway as defined by Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-100 (Michie Supp. 2007). Finding no error, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court in its thorough opinion. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>471 F.Supp.2d 634 (E.D.Va.2007). We deny Daniels\u2019 motion for leave to file an attachment to the Joint Appendix. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
