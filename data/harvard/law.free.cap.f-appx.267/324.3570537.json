California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Collum has filed a response. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Collum\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Collum\u2019s motion to strike counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion and brief is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 901-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
