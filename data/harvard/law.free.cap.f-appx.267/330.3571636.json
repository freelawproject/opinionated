His sentence falls within the applicable advisory sentencing guidelines range, and he does not challenge the calculation of that range. He instead argues that the presumption of reasonableness afforded sentences within the applicable guidelines range under <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), and its progeny, violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This argument is confuted, however, by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), which held that a \u201ccourt of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Gomez-Martinez alternatively argues that the district court should have sentenced him below the guidelines range in light of the circumstances of his reentry, his employment and family ties in Mexico, and his difficulties in childhood. This court reviews \u201cthe district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence\u201d for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). The district court observed that Gomez-Martinez had not learned to abide by the law despite his having served a prior 46-month sentence for illegal reentry. The court also noted that it had considered both Gomez-Martinez\u2019s particular circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Gomez-Martinez\u2019s sentence. The district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range, and Gomez-Martinez has failed to show that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 518-19. Finally, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Gomez-Martinez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. As Gomez-Martinez concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
