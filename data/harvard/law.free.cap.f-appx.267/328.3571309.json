He contends that the sentence imposed is unreasonable because the Guidelines do not take into account the remoteness of his prior drug-trafficking conviction or the small quantity of drugs involved. Paredes further argues that the sentence imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>does not comport with the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), especially \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Because the sentence Paredes received fell within the correctly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s proper consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including \u00a7 3553(a)(2), is inferred. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). Paredes has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 602, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The true nature of his argument is that the district court erred in failing to depart downwardly from the guidelines range. However, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s refusal to downwardly depart given that there is no indication that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the authority to do so. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Paredes next challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This issue is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
