In his brief filed prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), Del Angel argues that this court\u2019s presumption that sentences within a properly calculated guidelines range are reasonable effectively reinstates the mandatory guidelines regime struck down in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed that a \u201ccourt of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 2462. Accordingly, Del Angel\u2019s challenge to the presumption fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-26\">Del Angel also argues that his sentence was unreasonable on its merits. Because Del Angel\u2019s sentence is \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range,\u201d it is \u201cpresumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>Alanzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Del Angel\u2019s arguments that the guidelines range overstates the seriousness of his offense is insufficient to overcome the presumption. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007) (setting forth standard for rebutting presumption). In other words, he has not shown that his \u201cspecial circumstances are special enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they require a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2470.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Del Angel also argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence was unreasonable because his \u201cage, 44, ... makes it unlikely that he will commit future crimes.\u201d Because he did not object on this basis below, Del Angel\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence based on his age is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (plain error standard). Del Angel has not overcome the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his sentence on appeal, <em>see Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554, much less has he demonstrated that the district court committed plain error in sentencing him simply because of his age at the time the sentence was imposed. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Del Angel also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
