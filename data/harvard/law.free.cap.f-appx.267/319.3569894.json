After the parties consented to proceed to final judgment before the magistrate judge (MJ), the MJ granted the defendant Dallas County\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Crowder\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint. The MJ denied Crowder\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP in this court, Crowder is challenging the MJ\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Crowder\u2019s complaint alleged that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference when they housed him with gang-affiliated inmates, failed to protect him from physical harm inflicted by inmates, and denied him adequate medical care, which he contends resulted in the permanent loss of vision in his left eye. Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, an inmate confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility may not bring an action under \u00a7 1983 with respect to prison conditions until all available administrative remedies are exhausted. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Exhaustion is mandatory and applies to all inmate suits regardless of the forms of relief sought. <em>Clifford v. Gibbs, </em>298 F.3d 328, 332 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Accordingly, Crowder\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. No further briefing is required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
