United States, </em>77 Fed.Cl. 387 (2007), as one involving a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and for which an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(2). Ellamae Phillips Co. (Ella-mae) opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">Ellamae filed a complaint in the trial court, asserting that the government\u2019s preservation for future rail use of a federally-granted railroad right-of-way crossing Ellamae\u2019s property, and its interim use as a recreational trail, constituted an uncompensated taking. The trial court stayed the case pending this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hash v. United States, </em>403 F.3d 1308 (Fed.Cir.2005), which involved similar claims. Following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hash, </em>the trial court granted Ellamae\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the conversion of the land at issue to a public trail constituted a taking and that the United States is liable for the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"AN0p\">Subsequently, the trial court stayed further proceedings and granted the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>States\u2019 motion to certify the trial court\u2019s order for permissive appeal. The trial court stated that the order involved a controlling question of law with respect to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Ultimately, this court must exercise its own discretion in deciding whether it will grant permission to appeal an interlocutory order certified by a trial court. <em>See In re Convertible Rowing Exerciser Patent Litigation, </em>903 F.2d 822 (Fed.Cir.1990); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(2) (\u201cthe Federal Circuit may, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order\u201d). We determine that granting the petition in these circumstances is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The petition for permission to appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
