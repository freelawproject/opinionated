In 2004, the court sentenced Britt to 103-month concurrent sentences for Counts One, Two, Four and Eight, and a 60-month sentence for Count Three to be served consecutively to Count One, for a total of 163 months of imprisonment. This court affirmed Britt\u2019s convictions but remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. See United States v. Britt, </em>216 Fed.Appx. 317 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-24\">On remand, Britt specifically noted the then-pending amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, which would lower the punishment for amounts of crack cocaine, and argued that the district court should impose a lower sentence based on the proposed amendments. He also noted the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine and cited to the Supreme Court\u2019s then-pending case raising this issue in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). The district court denied relief on these arguments, based on Circuit precedent, <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632-34 (4th Cir.2006). Based on the amended presentence report, Britt\u2019s advisory sentencing range was calculated as 78-97 months, and the district court sentenced Britt to 78 months of imprisonment for Counts One, Two, Four, and Eight and a 60-month consecutive sentence for Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Britt timely appeals, alleging that the district court erred by declining to consider, under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), the crack cocaine/powder cocaine sentencing disparity, and the then-pending Sentencing Guidelines amendments intended to partially address that disparity. For the reasons that follow, we vacate and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Since Britt\u2019s resentencing, our opinion in <em>Eura </em>has been abrogated by <em>Kimbrough. See </em>128 S.Ct. at 565-66 &amp; n. 4. Moreover, the proposed amendments, lowering the punishment for amounts of crack cocaine, are reflected in the 2007 version of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for the district court to resentence Britt in light of <em>Kimbrough </em>and consider any other issues the parties may raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\"> We offer no criticism of the district court, which followed the relevant Circuit precedent in resentencing Britt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
