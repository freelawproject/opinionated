Bronson\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning the sufficiency of Bronson\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing and the reasonableness of his sentence. The Government did not file a brief, and although advised of his right to do so, Bronson has declined to file a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">We first conclude the district court fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 in conducting Bronson\u2019s plea hearing. The district court advised Bronson regarding his rights under federal law, the nature and elements of the charges to which he was pleading guilty, and the applicable statutory mandatory minimum and statutory maximum and period of supervised release. The court also questioned Bronson to ensure he was competent to plead guilty. Bronson further informed the court that, prior to signing the plea agreement, he had discussed it with his attorney, with whom he was satisfied. The district court further accepted the Government\u2019s proffer of evidence to establish a factual basis for Bronson\u2019s guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>plea. As noted by counsel in his <em>Anders </em>brief, there was no Rule 11 error.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">We next address Bronson\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable. As recently determined by the Supreme Court, \u201c[rjegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We remain charged with reviewing sentences for reasonableness, <em>id. </em>at 594, 597, which requires that we consider both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In determining whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, this court first assesses whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. This court must then consider whether the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). Finally, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). This court affords sentences that fall within the properly calculated Guidelines range a presumption of reasonableness, a presumption permitted by the Supreme Court. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>-U.S. -\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Bronson did not object to the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) accepted by the district court. Significantly, Bronson raised no challenge to the inclusion of either of the two prior felony drug convictions that formed the basis for his designation as a career offender. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2006) (\u201cUSSG\u201d). Because the statutory maximum applicable to the charged offense was life imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2007), Bronson\u2019s career offender designation elevated his offense level to 37 and his criminal history category to VI. USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (2006). Bronson\u2019s base offense level was then reduced three levels for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total adjusted offense level of 34. This, coupled with the category VI criminal \u25a0 history, yielded a sentencing range of 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. USSG ch. 5, pt. A, sentencing table (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The district court properly calculated Bronson\u2019s advisory Guidelines range and imposed a sentence at the bottom of that range. As our review of the record reveals no procedural or substantive defect in Bronson\u2019s sentence, we conclude Bronson cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his sentence. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2459, 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">Because this case is before us pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we note that neither the issuance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), nor the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s decision regarding the retro-activity of Amendment 706,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which lowered the base offense level for crack offenses effective November 1, 2007, commands a different result. Because Bronson was designated a career offender, his base of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>fense level of 37 was determined by the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment applicable to his offense under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), not the drug quantity found attributable to him. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A) (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, although the base offense level corresponding to the determined drug quantity would be lower as a result of Amendment 706, the amendment is ultimately of no consequence because calculation of Bronson\u2019s base offense level was driven by the career offender designation. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3), 2D1.1 cmt. n. 10(D)(1) (2007) (calculating sentencing range using drug equivalency table as amended would result in base offense level of 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entirety of the record and found no meritorious issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We require that counsel inform Bronson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Bronson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation.Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Bronson. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\">.
