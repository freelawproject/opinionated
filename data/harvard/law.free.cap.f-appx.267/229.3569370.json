Everson appeal the district court\u2019s orders granting Richard L. Doughton\u2019s motion to dismiss the Eversons\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 (2000) complaint. The district court found the Eversons\u2019 claims were barred by absolute judicial immunity and the Eleventh Amendment. The Eversons challenge both of the district court\u2019s findings. We have reviewed the record, the parties\u2019 informal briefs, and the district court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-21\">Judges enjoy absolute judicial immunity from damages liability for judicial acts unless done \u201cin clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). In making this determination, \u201cthe scope of the judge\u2019s jurisdiction must be construed broadly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 98 S.Ct. 1099. And a judge may \u201cnot be deprived of immunity because the action [taken] was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Chu v. Griffith, </em>771 F.2d 79 (4th Cir.1985). We have identified two important factors for consideration: whether the function is one normally performed by a judge and whether the parties dealt with the judge in his or her judicial capacity. <em>King v. Myers, </em>973 F.2d 354, 357 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-22\">The Eversons\u2019 only assertion is that Doughton wrongly decided the state court action. As a judge on the state superior court, Doughton had authority to consider that action and he is immune from suits arising from those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">The Eleventh Amendment provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted by one of the United States by Citizens of another State.\u201d The Eversons correctly note that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar suits seeking damages from government officials in their individual capacities. <em>See S.C. State Ports Auth. v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>243 F.3d 165, 170 (4th Cir.2001). However, this principle does not aid the Eversons because the only conduct the Eversons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>challenge is Doughton\u2019s disposition of state court proceedings. Therefore, the district court properly dismissed the action as being barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (\u201c[A] suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but r\u00e1ther is a suit against the official\u2019s office\u201d and therefore \u201cis no different from a suit against the State itself.\u201d). Accordingly, the Eleventh Amendment also bars the Eversons\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u25a0 We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
