Kolhage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Clerk of the Circuit Court of Monroe County, Florida, and Ruth Thurston, a deputy clerk of the circuit court, alleging violations of his due process rights. Hyland\u2019s complaint alleged that on February 3, 2004, Judge Wayne Miller, a Florida circuit court judge, sentenced Hyland to two years probation on a felony \u201cpetit theft\u201d charge. Thurston was the deputy clerk in charge of taking the minutes of the court that day. Hyland alleged that the original court minutes for the sentence hearing showed that Judge Miller ordered that Hyland be held in custody until there was a bed available in the \u201cKeys to Recovery Program,\u201d an in-patient treatment program. According to Hyland, in April 2004, it was brought to the clerk\u2019s attention that in order for the court\u2019s sentence regarding the Keys to Recovery Program to be sufficient, the minutes would have to state \u201ccomplete Keys to Recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Hyland alleged that Thurston illegally altered the minutes to include the condition \u201cComplete Keys to Recovery,\u201d which resulted in a special condition of probation being entered that was not ordered by the sentencing judge. According to Hyland, no one ever attempted to officially amend or modify the minutes, and the court never sentenced him to complete the Keys to Recovery program. Hyland alleged that Thurston \u201cnegligently\u201d added the additional condition, but he also claimed that it was not \u201cjust an oversight or a failure to maintain records, but deliberate, affirmative, operational action, void of judgment or discretion ... by private agenda.\u201d His complaint alleged that because of Thurston\u2019s actions, he was forced to spend time in \u201cillegal restraint,\u201d and the Department of Corrections used the altered court minutes to imprison him for failure to complete the treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The district court dismissed the suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for failure to state a claim. The court concluded that Hyland had failed to allege any personal wrongdoing by Kolhage, and that public officials in supervisory positions cannot be held vicariously liable for acts of their subordinates in a \u00a7 1983 action. The court also concluded that Hyland\u2019s claims against Thurston should be dismissed because she was entitled to qualified immunity and Hyland had failed to allege deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">On app\u00e9al, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal with respect to Kolhage. However, we vacated and remanded the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hyland\u2019s claims against Thurston because Hyland had alleged in his complaint that Thurston had acted with deliberate indifference and in bad faith. As a result, Thurston could not assert qualified immunity as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">On remand, Hyland filed an amended complaint, repeating the claims against Thurston and adding additional claims against Kolhage. Hyland\u2019s amended complaint alleged that in April 2004, he wrote to Kolhage to make him aware of the alteration of the court minutes and requested that Kolhage withdraw the altered minutes. According to Hyland, Kolhage did not respond to Hyland and remained deliberately indifferent to Hyland\u2019s illegal restraint. Hyland also alleged that Kolhage had a duty to investigate by alleging that if Kolhage had acted \u201clawfully and ethically,\u201d then Hyland would not have been injured. Finally, Hyland alleged that Kolhage had a duty to correct the altered court minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Kolhage filed a motion to dismiss Hyland\u2019s claims against him, which the district court granted. The court decided that the amended complaint was still an attempt to hold Kolhage vicariously liable for Thurston\u2019s actions, which is not permissible in a \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Hyland then filed a proposed second amended complaint, along with a motion for joinder of Judge Miller as a defendant. The complaint was a copy of his first amended complaint with a few additional allegations. Hyland alleged that Judge Miller had \u201csubversively directed and caused\u201d the unlawful alteration of the court minutes by directing Thurston to alter the original court minutes to reflect that Hyland was to complete the Keys to Recovery Program. According to Hyland, Judge Miller knew that he had not orally pronounced such a condition when he sentenced Hyland. Hyland alleged that Judge Miller violated his due process rights by instructing Thurston to alter or amend the court minutes. Hyland\u2019s complaint further alleged that Judge Miller did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Hyland\u2019s case when the minutes were amended, so Judge Miller was not protected by judicial immunity. Hyland sought compensatory and punitive damages from Judge Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Hyland also filed a motion to re-join Kolhage as a defendant, arguing that he had raised a valid \u00a7 1983 claim against Kolhage in his second amended complaint. Specifically, Hyland argued that he had sufficiently alleged that Kolhage had a duty to investigate his complaints, but remained deliberately indifferent and failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The district court denied Hyland\u2019s motion to join Judge Miller as a defendant on the ground that he was entitled to absolute judicial immunity. The court also denied Hyland\u2019s motion to rejoin Kolhage as a defendant because, despite his insistence to the contrary, Hyland was still attempting to hold Kolhage liable as a supervisor, which is not a valid basis for a \u00a7 1983 action. Moreover, according to the district court, Hyland pointed to no authority that imposed a duty on Kolhage to investigate Hyland\u2019s complaints. The district court finally dismissed the remainder of Hyland\u2019s second amended complaint, taking judicial notice of Hyland\u2019s state criminal records, and concluding that throughout his state court proceedings, Hyland had acknowledged that he was sentenced to complete the Keys to Recovery Program. Therefore, the court concluded that his complaint was without merit. Hyland timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Hyland first contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to join Judge Wayne Miller, a Florida circuit court judge, as a defendant because he was not entitled to judicial immunity when he told Thurston to alter the minutes of Hyland\u2019s sentencing hearing. Specifically, Hyland argues that Judge Miller is not entitled to judicial immunity because: (1) Judge Miller\u2019s instruction to Thurston was not a normal judicial function; (2) the act occurred outside courtroom or chamber proceedings; (3) no matter involving Hyland was pending before Judge Miller because the case was already on appeal; and (4) the instruction was simply a ministerial act, not a discretionary one.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for joinder only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Swan v. Ray, </em>293 F.3d 1252, 1253 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). \u201cThe district court has broad discretion to join parties or not and that decision will not be overturned as long as it falls within the district court\u2019s range of choices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal on the basis of judicial immunity. <em>Smith v. Shook, </em>237 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[JJudicial immunity is an immunity from suit, not just from ultimate assessment of damages. Accordingly, judicial immunity is not overcome by allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>tions of bad faith or malice, the existence of which ordinarily cannot be resolved without engaging in discovery and eventual trial.\u201d <em>M\u00edreles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 288, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has set forth a two-part test for determining when a judge is entitled to immunity from money damages liability when sued under section 1983.\u201d <em>Simmons v. Conger, </em>86 F.3d 1080, 1084 (11th Cir.1996). First, in order to be entitled to immunity, the judge must have dealt with the plaintiff in his judicial capacity. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[WJhether an act by a judge is a \u2018judicial\u2019 one relate to the nature of the act itself, i.e., whether it is a function normally performed by a judge, and to the expectations of the parties, i.e., whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity.\u201d <em>M\u00edreles, </em>502 U.S. at 12, 112 S.Ct. at 288 (quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">\u201cIf the judge was not dealing with the plaintiff in a judicial capacity, then there is no immunity. If the judge was dealing with the plaintiff in his judicial capacity, however, the second part of the test is whether the judge acted in the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simmons, </em>86 F.3d at 1085 (citations omitted). \u201cA judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">According to his complaint, Hyland was the defendant in a state felony petit theft prosecution, and Judge Miller was the state circuit court judge who presided over his sentence hearing and was responsible for pronouncing his sentence on the charge. Florida state courts have the power to correct errors in sentences, including mismatches between a written sentence and the earlier orally pronounced sentence. Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.800; <em>see Simon v. State, </em>793 So.2d 980, 981 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>768 So.2d 513, 513 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000). Accordingly, a judge\u2019s act of altering a written sentence is a judicial act. Even assuming, as we are required to do at this stage in the proceedings, that inserting \u201cComplete Keys to Recovery\u201d was erroneous, Judge Miller\u2019s instructions to Thurston to amend the minutes to Hyland\u2019s sentence hearing, by its nature, was still a judicial act. <em>See Mireles, </em>502 U.S. at 12, 112 S.Ct. at 288 (\u201c[T]he relevant inquiry is the \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018function\u2019 of the act, not the \u2018act itself.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Moreover, under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 26.012(2)(d), circuit courts have \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d over all felony offenses. As the presiding judge, Judge Miller had jurisdiction over Hyland\u2019s sentence hearing and all matters related to it. Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.800(b)(2) provides that a circuit judge has jurisdiction to rule on a party\u2019s motion to correct a sentencing error even when an appeal in the case is pending. This shows that Hyland\u2019s appeal of his case did not, as he argues, divest the circuit court of all jurisdiction over his sentence. As a result, Judge Miller was not acting in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction\u201d when he directed Thurston to alter the minutes, so he \u201cwill not be deprived of immunity because [Hyland alleges that] the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority.\u201d <em>Stump, </em>435 U.S. at 356, 98 S.Ct. at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Because Judge Miller\u2019s actions were taken within his judicial capacity and he did not act in the absence of all jurisdiction, he was entitled to judicial immunity, and the district court did not abuse its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>when it denied Hyland\u2019s motion to join Judge Miller as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Hyland next contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for re-joinder of Kolhage as a defendant because his claim against Kolhage was not one involving respondeat superior or vicarious liability. Instead, Hyland argues that his claim was based on Kolhage\u2019s failure to investigate the allegation that the minutes had been altered. According to Hyland, the district court erred by concluding that Kolhage did not have a constitutional duty to investigate the allegations because Kolhage took an oath to uphold the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">As we mentioned above, we review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for joinder only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Swan, </em>298 F.3d at 1253. The district court denied re-joinder of Kolhage as a defendant because it concluded that vicarious liability is not the basis of a \u00a7 1983 claim, and Kolhage had no duty to investigate Hyland\u2019s complaints. Nonetheless, \u201cwe may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment \u2018on any ground that finds support in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens &amp; Home, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 1361, 1363 n. 1 (11th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Jaffke v. Dunham, </em>352 U.S. 280, 281, 77 S.Ct. 307, 308, 1 L.Ed.2d 314 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Under the law of the case doctrine, both district courts and appellate courts generally are bound by a prior appellate decision in the same case. <em>Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Med., Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1285-86 (11th Cir.2004). The doctrine operates to preclude courts from revisiting issues that were decided explicitly or by necessary implication in a prior appeal. <em>Luckey v. Miller, </em>929 F.2d 618, 621 (11th Cir.1991). There are three exceptions to the law of the case doctrine where we would not be bound by our prior decisions in a case: \u201c(1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence^] (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue[;] or (3) the law-of-the-case is clearly erroneous and will work manifest injustice if not reconsidered.\u201d <em>Culpepper v. Irwin Mortg. Corp., </em>491 F.3d 1260, 1271 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">We have already held that Kolhage could not be held liable for the actions of his subordinate, Thurston, under a theory of vicarious liability or respondeat superi- or, <em>see Hyland v. Kolhage, </em>158 Fed.Appx. 194, 196 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished), and Hyland does not argue that one of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine applies. Therefore, to the extent that Hyland\u2019s second amended complaint alleges that Kolhage should be held vicariously liable for Thurston\u2019s conduct, that argument is barred by the law of the case. <em>See Alphamed, Inc., </em>367 F.3d at 1285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Moreover, to the extent that Hyland seeks to hold Kolhage liable for failing to investigate Thurston\u2019s alleged alteration of the minutes, this argument rests on a theory of supervisory liability. \u201cSupervisory liability occurs either when the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation or when there is a causal connection between actions of the supervising official and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Brown v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 667, 671 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cThe causal connection can be established when a history of widespread abuse puts the responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation, and he fails to do so. The deprivations that constitute widespread abuse sufficient to notify the supervising official must be obvious, flagrant, rampant and of continued duration, rather than isolated occurrences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Hyland has not alleged that Kolhage personally participated in the alteration of the minutes, or that Thurston\u2019s alteration of the minutes was any more than an isolated occurrence so that Kolhage should be held liable in a supervisory capacity for Thurston\u2019s conduct. Therefore, even if the allegations in his complaint are not barred by the law of the case, Hyland has failed to state a claim against Kolhage. <em>See Brown, </em>906 F.2d at 671. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying re-joinder of Kolhage as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Hyland finally contends that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because he raised constitutional claims against Thurston, Judge Miller, and Kolhage. Hyland further argues that the district court erroneously found that he agreed that Thurston\u2019s alteration of the court records was done upon the express direction of Judge Miller. According to Hyland, he stated a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983 because he demonstrated a causal connection between the defendants\u2019 actions and his unlawful restraint in the Keys to Recovery Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), using the same standards that govern Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissals and viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>See Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). As mentioned above, we may affirm a district court decision on any ground supported by the record. <em>Gaston, </em>167 F.3d at 1363 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Court clerks enjoy a \u201cnarrower ambit of immunity than judges.\u201d <em>Tarter v. Hury, </em>646 F.2d 1010, 1013 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Court clerks \u201chave absolute immunity from actions for damages arising from acts they are specifically required to do under court order or at a judge\u2019s direction, and only qualified immunity from all other actions for damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAbsolute immunity from damages actions applies, only in a narrow range of actions, for clerks of court acting in a nonroutine manner under command of court decrees or under explicit instructions of a judge. Damages will not be awarded for a clerk\u2019s actions of this type even if in bad faith or with malice.\u201d <em>Williams v. Wood, </em>612 F.2d 982, 985 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">As we mentioned above, the district court properly denied joinder of Kolhage and Judge Miller as defendants to this case. The only issue remaining is whether the court erred by dismissing Hyland\u2019s claims against Thurston. Hyland\u2019s second amended complaint alleges that Judge Miller \u201cinstruct[ed] Ruth Thurston, Deputy Clerk, Monroe County Clerk\u2019s Office, to insert the words \u201cComplete Keys to Recovery\u201d in the \u201cother\u201d section of [Hyland\u2019s] court minutes.... \u201d His complaint further alleges that Judge Miller instructed Thurston \u201cnot to mark the (then) altered court minutes as \u2018Amended\u2019 and not to notice the parties as to the alteration and not to serve copies\u201d of the amended minutes on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">Taking these allegations in Hyland\u2019s complaint as true, it is difficult to imagine a clearer scenario of a clerk acting \u201cunder explicit instructions of a judge.\u201d <em>See Tarter, </em>646 F.2d at 1012. Moreover, Hyland\u2019s complaint also alleges that this was not a routine action by Thurston, because Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Miller explicitly requested that Thurston change the minutes that she had transcribed at Hyland\u2019s sentence hearing without notification to the parties. Thurston is therefore entitled to absolute immunity from a suit for damages. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Hyland\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">.
