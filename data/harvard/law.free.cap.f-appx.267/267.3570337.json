McEvily previously sought to appeal this order, but we dismissed his appeal because the notice of appeal was not timely filed. <em>See McEvily v. Johnson, </em>241 Fed.Appx. 969 (4th Cir. 2007). After that decision, McEvily sought an extension of time to file a notice of appeal from the district court, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6), which the district court granted. McEvily then filed another notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court erred in granting McEvily\u2019s motion. McEvily stated in his motion that he received the district court\u2019s order on June 22, 2007. He did not file a motion for extension or reopening of the appeal period until September 24, 2007.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Rule 4(a)(6)(B) requires that a motion to reopen the appeal period be filed \u201cwithin 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is earlier.\u201d Because McEvily did not file his motion within seven days of receiving notice of the entry of the district court\u2019s order, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-18\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-14\"> We assume that the date appearing on the motion is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
