Jordan appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in declining to consider the disparity in sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses, applied the wrong legal standard in determining his sentence, and imposed a sentence greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing. For the reasons explained below, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">When Jordan was sentenced, our circuit precedent did not permit the sentencing court to impose a variance sentence based on the disparity in sentences prescribed under the guidelines for crack and powder cocaine offenses. <em>See United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 634 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio could not be used as basis for variance), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008). Since then, the Supreme Court decided, in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the erack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>thus abrogated <em>Eura.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence within a correctly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>within-guidelines sentence). However, in deciding not to depart or vary below the guideline range in this case, the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough. </em>To give the district court an opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>we conclude that resentencing is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
