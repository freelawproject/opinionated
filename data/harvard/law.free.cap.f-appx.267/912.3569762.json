For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Morgan Layne Dize, a minor child, was severely injured in an automobile accident. Schneider served as co-counsel for Morgan in the personal injury litigation that arose from that accident. A multimillion dollar settlement resulted from the litigation. Morgan\u2019s father, Andrew Dize (\u201cDize\u201d), was appointed guardian of Morgan\u2019s estate on the condition that he furnish a bond securing the faithful performance of his duties as a guardian under Georgia law. To that end, Dize contacted Burley Roberts, an independent insurance agent, who in turn contacted several brokerage houses that he knew could issue probate surety bonds. One of the agencies that Roberts contacted was Universal Services Agency (\u201cUniversal\u201d), which brokered products from several companies, including Hartford. Roberts also contacted Schneider and asked him to assist Dize in making the required filings with the probate court. Schneider sent Roberts a fax indicating his willingness to do so. Finally, Roberts contacted an accountant to obtain written confirmation that Dize would have assistance with investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Roberts provided the fax from Schneider and a letter from the accountant to a broker for Universal. The Universal broker then provided the fax and letter to underwriters at companies to which she was shopping the bond, including Hartford. Hartford then contacted Universal and indicated that it would provide the bond under a few conditions. After Hartford issued the bond, Dize filed the bond with the probate court and was appointed guardian for Morgan\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Soon thereafter, Dize misappropriated millions of dollars from the estate. In February 2004, Morgan\u2019s estate, the guardian of which was no longer Dize, entered into a settlement agreement with Hartford under which Hartford paid the estate $6 million, which was less than the full amount of the misappropriated funds. The agreement provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-8\">The Estate of Morgan Layne Dize shall transfer and assign to Hartford Fire Insurance Company and Hartford Fire Insurance Company shall be subrogated to all of the Estate\u2019s rights, titles, claims, causes of action, chooses in action or other interests with respect to Andrew Dize, Sabrina Dize and any other person or entity who received either directly or indirectly any of the funds or property belonging to the Estate of Morgan Layne Dize without express Probate Court Approval (this transfer shall include authority to prosecute any such action in the name of the Estate).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Hartford then sued Schneider for negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and fraud on its own behalf, and for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence, on behalf of Morgan\u2019s estate. The district court entered summary judgment in Schneider\u2019s favor, and Hartford appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Welding Servs. Inc. v. Forman, </em>509 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">\n<em>A. Claims Brought on Behalf of the Estate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">The district court found that Hartford lacked standing to sue Schneider on behalf of Morgan\u2019s estate because it limited its subrogation rights in its settlement agreement with the estate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">In Georgia, \u201c[a] surety who has paid the debt of his principal shall be subrogated, both at law and in equity, to all the rights of the creditor----\u201d O.G.C.A. \u00a7 10-7-56. As the district court recognized, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>subrogation rights may be waived by an insurer as consideration to support a settlement agreement. <em>See Rabun &amp; Assocs. Constr., Inc. v. Berry, </em>276 Ga.App. 485, 623 S.E.2d 691, 695-96 (2005). Hartford expressly limited its subrogation rights in the settlement agreement to Dize, Sabrina Dize, and \u201cany other person or entity who received either directly or indirectly any of the funds or property belonging to the Estate....\u201d It is undisputed that Schneider did not receive any of the misappropriated funds. Thus, because Hartford\u2019s subrogation rights do not reach Schneider, Hartford does not have standing to sue Schneider.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Hartford argues that <em>Rabun &amp; Assocs. </em>should not apply here because it involved an express waiver of subrogation rights. We disagree, however, because an express limitation of subrogation rights is the functional equivalent of an express waiver of those rights with respect to anyone who falls outside of the limitation. Accordingly, we affirm as to the breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence claims brought on behalf of Morgan\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">\n<em>B. Claims Brought on Hartford\u2019s Behalf</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">On its own behalf, Hartford claims that (1) Schneider provided a false statement (the fax to Roberts); (2) Hartford relied on the statement in its decision to issue the bond; and (3) the issuance of the bond allowed Schneider to receive his contingency fee relating to the personal injury action. Based on those allegations, Hartford argues that it should prevail on the following substantive theories: negligent misrepresentation, professional negligence, breach of contract and promissory estoppel. Hartford\u2019s arguments, however, are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">\n<em>1. Negligent Misrepresentation and Professional Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">We agree with the district court that Hartford has offered no evidence to establish that Schneider\u2019s alleged negligence was the proximate cause of Hartford\u2019s damages. There is no evidence that Schneider knew of Dize\u2019s poor investments or that Schneider\u2019s failure to advise Dize in the probate process resulted in poor investment choices. As the district court recognized, the only evidence of causation that Hartford has offered is the speculation as to what Hartford might have done to protect the funds in Morgan\u2019s estate if Schneider had known of Dize\u2019s misconduct and reported it. That evidence, however, does not sufficiently connect Schneider\u2019s alleged negligence to Hartford\u2019s loss. Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate on the negligent misrepresentation and professional negligence claims that Hartford brought on its own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">\n<em>2. Breach of Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">We also agree with the district court that no valid contract existed between Schneider and Hartford. Under Georgia law, a contract without consideration is invalid. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-3-40. Hartford has offered no evidence that Schneider received any consideration for his agreement to assist Dize in the probate process. Accordingly, no contract existed between Hartford and Schneider, and the district court correctly entered summary judgment in Schneider\u2019s favor on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">\n<em>3. Promissory Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">Finally, we agree with the district court as to Hartford\u2019s promissory estoppel claim as well. Under Georgia law, a plaintiff claiming promissory estoppel must establish that (1) the defendant made a promise; (2) the defendant should have reasonably expected the plaintiff to rely on the promise; (3) the plaintiff relied on the promise to its detriment; and (4) an injustice can only be avoided by the enforcement of the promise. <em>Rental Equip. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number><em>Group v. MACI, </em>263 Ga.App. 155, 587 S.E.2d 364, 367 (2003). The reliance, however, must be reasonable. <em>Gilmour v. Am. Nat\u2019l Red Cross, </em>385 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). The Georgia Court of Appeals, moreover, has declared that \u201cit defies logic to suggest that the intended obligee could reasonably rely on a promise to be bound without any compensation to the promisor.\u201d <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland v. West Point Constr. Co., </em>178 Ga.App. 578, 344 S.E.2d 268, 270 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Hartford has offered no evidence that it gave Schneider any compensation for any promise. Accordingly, any reliance on a promise from Schneider was unreasonable as a matter of law, and Hartford\u2019s promissory estoppel argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Summary judgment was appropriate on the claims that Hartford brought on behalf of Morgan\u2019s estate and those it brought on its own behalf. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
