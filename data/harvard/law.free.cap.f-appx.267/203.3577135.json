On appeal, Carter claims that the Government\u2019s proffer at the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing was insufficient to support the firearm conviction and that the district court incorrectly calculated his criminal history category. The Government asserts the appeal should be dismissed because Carter knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. Because we find the appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and that the issues raised by Carter are within the scope of the waiver, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-25\">Carter\u2019s plea agreement contained an appellate waiver that stated he waived the right to appeal \u201cany and all issues related to [his] guilty plea and sentencing.\u201d The record reveals that Carter agreed to this waiver knowingly and voluntarily.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168-69 (4th Cir.2005). Moreover, Carter does not dispute that the issues he raises on appeal fall within the purview of his appellate waiver. <em>See id. </em>at 169-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss Carter\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-18\"> Although the district court failed to question Carter at the Rule 11 hearing about the appellate waiver in violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. ll(b)(N), because Carter does not assert that he was unaware of the waiver or that the district court's failure affected the outcome of his guilty plea, he cannot establish plain error. <em>See United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 n. 5 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that the district court's failure to strictly comply with Rule 11 is subject to plain error review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
