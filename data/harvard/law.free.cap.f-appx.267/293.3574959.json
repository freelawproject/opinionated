Subsequently, Luckerson and the Government signed a plea agreement in which Luckerson pled guilty to Count One in exchange for the Government\u2019s agreement to dismiss Count Two. The plea agreement included a series of stipulations related to Luckerson\u2019s offense level along with a provision waiving (\u201cwaiver provision\u201d) Luckerson\u2019s right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-25\">The waiver provision contained three exceptions that would allow Luckerson to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>appeal his sentence. At Luckersoris sentencing, the district court applied a non-stipulated four-level enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2005) <em>K </em>Luckerson appeals the district court\u2019s decision to apply the non-stipulated enhancement, and contends that our review is proper because it falls within one of the plea agreement\u2019s three exceptions. After a thorough review of the record, we dismiss Luckerson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On July 5, 2005, as Luckerson was driving from Houston to New York, a North Carolina police officer pulled him over for speeding. After Luckerson consented to a search of his vehicle, the police officer looked in the vehicle\u2019s trunk and discovered seven unloaded new pistols, several boxes of ammunition, and marijuana. As a result, on January 24, 2006, Luckerson was indicted for possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Luckerson eventually entered into a plea agreement with the Government in which he pled guilty to the gun possession charge, and the Government agreed to drop the marijuana possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Paragraph 7 of the plea agreement contained several stipulations relating to the calculation of Luckersoris offense level under the sentencing guidelines including: Luckersoris base offense level (20), his eligibility for a two-level enhancement because of the multiple firearms involved in the crime<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and his opportunity to obtain a three-level reduction based on acceptance of responsibility and the timeliness with which Luckerson notified the Government of his intent to plead guilty or provided information to the Government about his involvement in this crime. (J.A. 10-11.) Though the plea agreement did not contain a stipulation setting out Luckersoris final offense level, based on the stipulations in the plea agreement, Luckersoris final offense level would have been 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The United States Probation Office submitted a Pre-Sentencing Report (PSR) to the district court in which it recommended a sentence consistent with the stipulations in paragraph 7; however, the PSR also recommended an additional four-level enhancement because Luckerson possessed the firearms in connection with another felony offense\u2014i.e., drug trafficking. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2005). With this four-level enhancement, the PSR calculated Luckersoris offense level to be 23, resulting in a sentencing guideline range of 51-63 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">On October 30, 2006, Luckerson\u2019s sentencing hearing took place. During the hearing, Luckerson objected to the four-level enhancement, contending that simply because both the firearms and marijuana were located in the trunk of his vehicle did not necessarily indicate a connection between the two items; in fact, Luckerson claimed that their close proximity was merely fortuitous. While conceding that the issue was \u201cclose\u201d (J.A. 54), the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>court overruled Luekerson\u2019s objection to the four-level enhancement, and sentenced him to 51 months imprisonment, a two-year term of supervised release, and a $100.00 special monetary assessment fee. Luckerson appeals the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s decision to apply the four-level enhancement. Prior to reviewing the substance of Luckerson\u2019s contentions, we must determine whether the plea agreement precludes Luckerson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We review whether Luckerson has waived his right to appeal <em>de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-03 (4th Cir.2000). The parties disagree over whether the plea agreement\u2019s waiver provision bars Luckerson from appealing his sentence. The interpretation of a plea agreement is guided by the law of contracts. <em>United States v. Chase, </em>466 F.3d 310, 314 (4th Cir.2006). The waiver provision states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">... [Luckerson] waives all such rights to contest the conviction and/or sentence except for .... (3)the sentence, but only to the extent defendant contests the sentence on the basis that one or more findings on guideline issues were inconsistent with the explicit stipulations contained in any paragraph in the plea agreement filed herein, or on the basis of an unanticipated issue that arises during the sentencing hearing and which the District Judge finds and certifies to be of such an unusual nature as to require review by the Fourth Circuit of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">(J.A. 13)(emphasis added). During the sentencing hearing, Luckerson\u2019s attorney asked the district court to certify the issue of whether the four-level enhancement was appropriate to us. The district court refused, holding that the issue was not unusual since the parties clearly anticipated it, and in fact filed briefs on the issue. Thus, the viability of Luckerson\u2019s appeal depends on whether the district court\u2019s decision to apply the non-stipulated four-level enhancement is \u201cinconsistent with the explicit stipulations\u201d in paragraph 7 of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">There is no doubt that the four-level enhancement applied by the district court was not stipulated to by the parties. Nevertheless, no provision in the plea agreement precluded the district court from adopting additional applicable non-stipulated sentencing enhancements. Most importantly, however, the four-level enhancement for using a firearm in connection with another felony was clearly not inconsistent with the explicit stipulations in the plea agreement. To the contrary, the four-level enhancement was perfectly consistent with all of the stipulations in paragraph 7 including the enhancement Luckerson received for possession of multiple firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Because we find that the plea agreement precludes Luckerson\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s sentence, we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">. \"If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, increase by 4 levels ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-13\">.
