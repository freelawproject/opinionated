In his complaint, Howard alleged that he was convicted in 1968 as a 15 year old and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He averred that the Louisiana Board of Pardons (LBOP) recommended the commutation of his sentence in 2003, but the governor left office without taking action on his case. Howard alleged that the LBOP subsequently informed him that he must wait five years to reapply for a pardon or commutation of his sentence, a waiting period established by La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:574.2(D), which was not in effect at the time of his conviction. Howard claimed that the application of laws enacted following his conviction violated the prohibitions on ex post facto laws of the Federal Constitution and the Louisiana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-22\">The district court, without ordering service of the defendants, dismissed Howard\u2019s federal law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Howard\u2019s state law claim. The district court certified that Howard\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Howard is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 21 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). This court may authorize Howard to proceed IFP on appeal if the appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1); <em>see Holmes v. Hardy, </em>852 F.2d 151, 153 (5th Cir.1988). If, as is the case here, the merits of the appeal are \u201cinextricably intertwined with the certification decision,\u201d this court may determine both issues. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed under the same de novo standard as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe complaint must be liberally construed, with all reasonable inferences drawn in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Woodard v. Andrus, </em>419 F.3d 348, 351 (5th Cir.2005). The plaintiff is required to make sufficient factual allegations \u201cto raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citations omitted). The dismissal of an IFP complaint as frivolous typically is reviewed for abuse of discretion; however, where the district court also finds that the complaint fails to state a claim, as here, it is reviewed de novo. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Howard argues that his complaint states a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983 because the application of laws enacted after his conviction, including the waiting period established by \u00a7 15:574.2(D), violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. He also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his action without conducting a <em>Spears </em>hearing. <em>See Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">In <em>Dunn v. Maggio, </em>712 F.2d 998, 1001-02 (5th Cir.1983), this court rejected a claim that the repeal of La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:571.7, which contained provisions pertaining to the process by which a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment may obtain a commutation of his sentence constituted a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. However, the court in <em>Dunn </em>did not resolve the issue central to the instant case, which is whether the application to Howard of current Louisiana law governing the pardon and sentence commutation process violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Garner v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 255, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000) and in <em>California Dept. of Corr. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995), has issued decisions addressing substantially similar claims challenging the application of changes in the timing of parole reconsideration hearings as violative of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Under the principles of the above cases, to state a claim on which relief could be granted Howard was required to plead facts that would show that, \u201cas applied to his own sentence,\u201d the new laws governing the process for obtaining a pardon or commutation of his sentence \u201ccreated a significant risk of increasing his punishment.\u201d <em>See Garner, </em>529 U.S. at 255, 120 S.Ct. 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Considering the above authorities, relevant Louisiana statutory provisions, and the allegations of Howard\u2019s complaint, we have determined that Howard has stated a claim on which relief can be granted. Accordingly, Howard\u2019s IFP motion is granted, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Given our disposition of this matter, which reflects no opinion on the merits of Howard\u2019s action, we have no occasion to decide whether the district court erred by dismissing Howard\u2019s complaint without conducting a <em>Spears </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">IFP MOTION GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
