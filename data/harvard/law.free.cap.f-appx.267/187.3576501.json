On appeal, counsel has filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>noting that Plummer waived the right to appeal his sentence and, thus, that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. In the event this court invalidates the waiver, counsel asserts that Plummer\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because the district court used the 100:1 crack-to-powder-coeaine ratio in determining Plummer\u2019s base offense level. Plummer was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based upon Plummer\u2019s waiver of appellate rights. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Amaya-Portillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). The question of whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Plummer knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. Moreover, the sentencing issue raised on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver. <em>See id. </em>at 169-70 (holding that waiver of right to appeal in plea agreement accepted before decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not invalidated by change in law). We therefore grant, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Although the waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes our review of the sentence, the waiver does not preclude correction of any errors in Plummer\u2019s convictions that may be revealed by our review pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>Our review of the transcript of the plea colloquy leads us to conclude that the magistrate judge fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Plummer\u2019s guilty plea on each count and that the magistrate judge and the district court ensured that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily and was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Thus, we deny, in part, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues not covered by the waiver. We therefore affirm Plummer\u2019s convictions and dismiss the appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"><em> Anders v.
