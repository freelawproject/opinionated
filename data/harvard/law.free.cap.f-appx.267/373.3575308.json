Camacho contends that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault is not a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that the Texas crime of aggravated assault is more broadly defined than most other definitions of aggravated assault because it may be committed by threatening the victim with a weapon. The Texas statute, Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.02, is substantially similar to the generic, common sense definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d and thus qualifies as the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Beltran-Garcia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 418, 169 L.Ed.2d 293 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Camacho challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pinedas-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
