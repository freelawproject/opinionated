Gordon (\u201cGordon\u201d), proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action against Judge Martin H. Colin (\u201cColin\u201d), Gordon\u2019s ex-wife Emily (\u201cEmily\u201d), and her attorney Bruce Rosenwater (\u201cRosenwater\u201d). Gordon\u2019s complaint asserts claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">Gordon contends: (1) that the district court erred in finding that Colin was entitled to judicial immunity in his individual capacity; (2) that the district court erred in finding that Emily and Rosenwater were entitled to absolute immunity under Florida law; and (3) that the district court erred in dismissing his federal claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against Colin. Additionally, Gordon contends that the district court erred in its alternative ruling dismissing Gordon\u2019s action based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the <em>Younger </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-18\">The district court, in its order dismissing the action (R. 1-35), adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge (R. 1-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-19\">Gordon\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim seeking money damages against Colin in his individual capacity is totally meritless. Colin dealt with Gordon in a judicial capacity, and Colin did not act in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d Thus, he is immune from this claim for money damages. <em>Simmons v. Conger, </em>86 F.3d 1080, 1084 (11th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-20\">We also conclude that the district court properly found Emily and Rosenwater immune under Florida law from Gordon\u2019s state law claims for money damages. Their conduct of which Gordon complains involved prosecuting the claims for unpaid alimony, and occurred during the course of the litigation. Thus, Emily and Rosenwater are, under Florida law, entitled to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>munity for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. (R. 1-82 at 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Finally, the district court properly dismissed Gordon\u2019s claims for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief. In the instant case, Gordon sought two forms of equitable relief. First, Gordon sought an order preventing Colin from issuing a future writ of bodily attachment and a declaration that Colin\u2019s actions had violated his federal constitutional rights. Gordon, however, lacked standing to seek this relief because the possibility that a writ of bodily attachment will be issued in the future, especially after the underlying contempt order has been vacated, is too speculative to satisfy the case and controversy requirements of Article III. <em>Cf. Emory v. Peeler, </em>756 F.2d 1547, 1552 (11th Cir.1985). Second, he sought an injunction vacating Colin\u2019s contempt order. This claim for injunctive relief, however, is now moot because the state appellate court has already vacated that order. Thus, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider Gordon\u2019s claims for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">We conclude that Gordon has shown no error in the district court\u2019s determination that all of his claims should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Whether there is currently a final state court judgment is unclear, and we decline to find a lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Similarly, because it is unclear that state court proceedings are ongoing, we decline to say that <em>Younger </em>abstention is appropriate. Therefore, we AFFIRM dismissal of the action with prejudice, but AMEND the district court\u2019s judgment by eliminating the paragraph dismissing Gordon\u2019s action on the alternative grounds of <em>Younger </em>abstention and the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">JUDGMENT (AS AMENDED) DISMISSING ACTION WITH PREJUDICE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-13\">. <em>Rooker v.
