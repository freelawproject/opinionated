We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Timothy Collinsworth enrolled in a long-term disability group insurance plan insured by AIG Life Insurance Company and provided by his employer, Tyco International (US). He had two policies under the plan that provided a total benefit of $180,000. In accordance with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1022, Tyco gave Collinsworth a summary plan description (SPD) that described the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Collinsworth fell on his left side in 2001, after the policies had become effective. He suffered a bruise and excruciating pain. The next day, he sought emergency medical treatment from Dr. Wong. Dr. Wong diagnosed Collinsworth with a contusion to his left elbow and cleared Collinsworth to return to work with no restrictions. Collinsworth also saw his regular physician, Dr. Goyal. Collinsworth was placed on short term disability after he continued to experience severe pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-19\">Collinsworth subsequently applied for benefits under both policies. He submitted a proof of loss form, which described his condition after the fall. Along with the form, Collinsworth turned in notes from Dr. Goyal, which described Collinsworth\u2019s pain and concluded that Collinsworth was \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d When AIG reviewed the claim and Collinsworth\u2019s medical history, it discovered that Collinsworth had experienced a left-hemispheric stroke six years earlier. As a result of the stroke, the left side of Collinsworth\u2019s body was partially paralyzed, and Collinsworth had trouble sitting, standing, and walking. After the stroke, he also suffered from central pain syndrome and depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-20\">After learning of the stoke and its complications, AIG asked Dr. Seals (a medical doctor) and Dr. Howarth (a psychiatrist) to examine Collinsworth. Dr. Seals concluded that the fall caused no detectable trauma to Collinsworth\u2019s nervous system, and that any neurological deficit was \u201clinked to his stroke.\u201d Seals also reported that Collinsworth was able to perform all activities for which he was qualified. Dr. Howarth noted that Collinsworth had been counseled for depression several months prior to the fall. Based on Collinsworth\u2019s history of recurrent major depression, Howarth concluded that Collinsworth was not totally and permanently disabled as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the fall. AIG denied Collinsworth\u2019s claim based partially on these reports; it interpreted the plan to contain an exclusion for preexisting conditions. Collinsworth appealed the denial to AIG\u2019s ERISA Appeals Committee, which affirmed the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Collinsworth then filed this lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The court denied AIG\u2019s motion and granted Collinsworth\u2019s motion in part. It disagreed with AIG\u2019s interpretation of the plan, concluding that the plan does not contain a preexisting condition exclusion. It also concluded that AIG\u2019s factual findings were insufficient to support its denial under this interpretation. The court therefore remanded for AIG to reconsider its decision in light of the new plan interpretation. The court denied Collins-worth\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, but it also stated that Collinsworth could renew the request after remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On remand, AIG reopened its investigation and again denied Collinsworth\u2019s claim. Collinsworth appealed the second denial to the appeals committee. This time, the committee voted to reverse the denial and to pay the claim in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Collinsworth then moved the district court to award attorney\u2019s fees, interest, and court costs. The district court awarded interest and court costs, but it denied the request for attorney\u2019s fees. Collins-worth appeals this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, we defer to the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">ERISA gives the district court \u201cdiscretion [to] allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee ... to either party.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Bowen, </em>we enumerated five factors that district courts should consider in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s fees under ERISA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-17\">(1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO2\">We have described these factors as \u201cguidelines\u201d and explained that \u201c[n]o one of these factors is necessarily decisive, and some may not be apropos in a given case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJV\">Collinsworth challenges the district court\u2019s application of these factors in several ways. His main contention is that the court inadequately explained its denial. In its initial order remanding to AIG, the court cited the correct <em>Bowen </em>standard. It then stated, \u201cHaving considered those factors, the Court determines not to award attorneys\u2019 fees to Plaintiff.\u201d After remand, the district court again denied attorney\u2019s fees. This time, it listed the <em>Bowen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>factors and made specific factual findings under each factor. Collinsworth claims the district court\u2019s analysis constituted abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Although the district court did not explicitly cite the findings that supported its first denial of attorney\u2019s fees, it did recite the <em>Bowen </em>factors and state that it considered them. Moreover, the court\u2019s implicit findings are sufficient to support its decision. Most importantly, nothing in the court\u2019s opinion suggests that AIG acted in bad faith. The court stated that several of the defendant\u2019s factual findings supported its denial of benefits, especially under the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the plan. Similarly, it later concluded that some evidence supported the defendant\u2019s denial. The court also found that the defendant did not make its original decision with undue delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The court similarly indicated that the defendant\u2019s construction of the SPD was in good faith. First, it noted that \u201ca reasonable plan participant could not read the summary plan description and know with any degree of certainty whether his accident coverage was restricted by specific previous conditions.\u201d It stated that this \u201cambiguity ... must be resolved in the policyholder\u2019s favor.\u201d It made a similar determination about the meaning of the word \u201cresult\u201d within the SPD. The SPD requires that a disability must come about \u201cas a result\u201d of a covered accident but does not state whether the accident must be a \u201cdirect and independent cause\u201d of the disability. The court stated that the \u2018\u201cas a result\u2019 language is ambiguous\u201d and similarly construed it in the policyholder\u2019s favor. Finally, the SPD excludes losses \u201ccaused by or resulting from\u201d certain things. The court determined that \u201c \u2018caused by or resulting from\u2019 is ambiguous\u201d and construed that phrase in Collinsworth\u2019s favor. Thus, although the court ultimately disagreed with AIG\u2019s construction of the plan, it did not indicate that AIG\u2019s interpretation was done in bad faith; to the contrary, the court\u2019s discussion supports the opposite inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The district court\u2019s memorandum also indicates that, although Collinsworth ultimately prevailed, AIG\u2019s position nevertheless had merit. The determinations noted above show that AIG\u2019s interpretation of the plan was plausible, and that AIG produced evidence to support its decision. Moreover, the court decided to remand to AIG, which it likely would not have done if it found AIG\u2019s position meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Furthermore, the <em>Bowen </em>analysis in the district court\u2019s second opinion relieves any concerns we might have about the first opinion\u2019s analysis. After remand, the court explicitly found that (1) AIG \u201cdid not act in bad faith or otherwise act culpably\u201d; (2) \u201can award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case would [not] deter improper conduct of [AIG] or others\u201d; (3) Collinsworth did not seek \u201cto benefit others,\u201d and the case did not \u201cresolve[ ] a significant legal question under ERISA\u201d; and (4) although Collins-worth ultimately prevailed, AIG\u2019s factual findings did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Assuming these findings are not clearly erroneous\u2014an assumption we test momentarily\u2014the district court\u2019s <em>Bowen </em>analysis did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Collinsworth also argues, however, that the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. First, he contends that the district court committed clear error in finding a lack of bad faith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>claims that bad faith is evident from AIG\u2019s reliance on definitions in the policy rather than definitions in the SPD, and its claim that Collinsworth\u2019s position was a \u201cred herring.\u201d While this evidence arguably tends to show that AIG acted in bad faith, other evidence\u2014cited above\u2014tends to show good faith. Given that the totality of the evidence does not unequivocally show bad faith, the district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Collinsworth also claims clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that an award would have little deterrence value. He claims that a fee award would deter other administrators from \u201chiding behind a policy requirement in denying the claims of unsuspecting employees.\u201d But this explanation assumes that AIG was acting in bad faith, rather than acting upon a reasonable (but legally incorrect) plan interpretation. An award of attorney\u2019s fees seems unlikely to deter administrators who make a good faith, but legally incorrect, plan interpretation. Thus, the district court\u2019s finding is not clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Collinsworth also assails the district court\u2019s finding that this suit did not seek to benefit all plan beneficiaries or to resolve a significant legal question. According to Collinsworth, the \u201csuit did seek to benefit other beneficiaries of an ERISA plan, since the plan in question was an ERISA sponsored employer benefit plan.\u201d According to this logic, however, virtually every ERISA lawsuit would satisfy this factor. This case does not appear to provide any special benefit to other beneficiaries, and the district court\u2019s finding to that effect is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Finally, Collinsworth argues that the merits of the case were strongly on his side. As noted above, although Collins-worth\u2019s position ultimately prevailed, AIG\u2019s position nevertheless had merit. The district court\u2019s finding on this factor is not clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Because the district court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous and adequately support its decision, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Collinsworth also argues that the district court should have awarded attorney\u2019s fees because Collinsworth \u201cbelieves that where there is not a near equivalence of merit, the party who presents the side with the greater merit is entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion, particularly if the other factors weigh in the party\u2019s favor.\u201d We reject this argument for two reasons. First, Collinsworth\u2019s \u201crule\u201d is not the law. Collinsworth presents no ease with this holding. The law of the Fifth Circuit is that the district court has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees and should take guidance from the five factors set forth in <em>Bowen.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Second, even if Collinsworth\u2019s rule were the law of this Circuit, the district court did not make the finding it requires\u2014that \u201cthere is not a near equivalence of merit\u201d in the parties\u2019 positions, and that \u201cthe other factors weigh in\u201d his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Finally, Collinsworth claims the district court erred in two related ways: first, by not analyzing whether AIG abused its discretion in construing the plan\u2019s terms or denying the claim; and second, by stating in the second opinion that it had previously concluded that AIG did not abuse its discretion. The first argument is unavail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ing. In an ERISA case, the district court reviews the administrator\u2019s interpretation of plan terms or denial of benefits for abuse of discretion only if the plan gives the administrator discretion to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court \u201cemploy[s] a two-part test when applying the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, we \u201cidentify the legally correct interpretation of the plan.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the administrator\u2019s interpretation is legally incorrect, then under the second step \u201cwe determine whether the administrator\u2019s decision constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If, however, the plan does not provide such discretion, the court reviews the administrator\u2019s determinations <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Regardless of whether the plan gives the administrator discretion, the court reviews the administrator\u2019s factual findings for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Collinsworth complains that after the district court found AIG\u2019s interpretation legally incorrect, it was \u201cobligated\u201d to determine whether AIG abused its discretion in construing plan terms or denying benefits. The district court\u2019s approach was not erroneous. The court concluded that the plan does not give the administrator discretion,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and it therefore reviewed the administrator\u2019s decisions de novo. Because the plan gave AIG no discretion to construe plan terms or to deny benefits, the district court did not err by failing to determine whether AIG abused its discretion in these areas. Furthermore, even if the district court had reviewed for abuse of discretion and found that AIG abused its discretion, that finding would not require the district court to award attorney\u2019s fees. We have held that \u201ca district court <em>may </em>award attorneys\u2019 fees upon finding an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But the decision whether to award attorney\u2019s fees is still in the district court\u2019s discretion, subject to its analysis of the <em>Bowen </em>factors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Collinsworth\u2019s second argument is equally unavailing. As noted above, the district court interpreted the plan de novo, and hence it had no opportunity to conclude that AIG\u2019s interpretation was an abuse of discretion. Regarding AIG\u2019s factual findings, the district court purported to conduct an abuse of discretion review, and it did not conclude that AIG abused its discretion. Thus, even if the district court did not explicitly find no abuse of discretion, its statement in the second opinion accurately reflects the substance of the earlier opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
