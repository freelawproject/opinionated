Milo asserts the indictment was fatally defective because it alleged he made false statements for the purpose of obtaining his pilot\u2019s license, when there is no such thing as a pilot\u2019s license, only an airman\u2019s certificate, and the court erred by concluded that the \u201cpilot\u2019s license\u201d language in the indictment was surplusage. Milo also contends the Government committed prosecutorial misconduct because it used the incorrect \u201cpilot\u2019s license\u201d language throughout the trial, even after the language was deemed to be inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for an abuse of discretion and the sufficiency of an indictment <em>de novo. United States v. Bobo, </em>344 F.3d 1076, 1082-83 (11th Cir. 2003). Certain types of motions must be made before trial, including \u201ca motion alleging a defect in the indictment.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). The motion may be heard while the case is pending only if there is a claim that the indictment \u201cfails to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction or to state an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA party waives any Rule 12(b)(3) defense, objection, or request not raised by the deadline the court sets under Rule 12(c) or by any extension the court provides. For good cause, the court may grant relief from the waiver.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(e); <em>see also United States v. Ramirez, </em>324 F.3d 1225, 1227-28 (11th Cir.2003). A defendant does not have good cause warranting relief from waiver when he had all the information necessary to bring a Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b) motion before the date set for pretrial motions, but failed to file it by that date. <em>Ramirez, </em>324 F.3d at 1228 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Milo waived his ability to claim the indictment was defective because he did not raise the issue in a pre-trial motion and he cannot show the indictment failed to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction or to state an offense. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B), (e); <em>Ramirez, </em>324 F.3d at 1227-28. Milo also failed to show good cause for relief from the waiver because he had all the information necessary to challenge the indictment before the trail began but failed to do so. <em>See Ramirez, </em>324 F.3d at 1228 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Milo was also properly convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2). The district judge instructed the jury on all the elements of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2) violation, stating that Milo could only be found guilty if the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that he willfully and knowingly made a materially false statement in relation to a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2). That the Government erroneously referred to a \u201clicense\u201d or \u201cpilot\u2019s license\u201d at trial had no effect on the outcome of the trial because the Government never indicated a pilot\u2019s license and a medical certificate were the same document, and testimony provided that an \u201cairman medical certificate is not\u201d a pilot\u2019s license. Therefore, any error the prosecutor made does not warrant a new trial. <em>See United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 637 (11th Cir.2007) (stating \u201c \u2018[pfr'osecutorial misconduct requires a new trial only if we find the remarks (1) were improper and (2) prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). The jury found Milo knowingly and willfully made materially false statements on the 2002 and 2004 medical certificates, which were in the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States. Milo was properly charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>and convicted, and we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
