Bautista-Gonzalez contends that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing his prior Texas state felony drug conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Given the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Lopez <em>v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Bautista-Gonzalez is correct that his prior conviction is not an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 259-61 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Government concedes that the district court erred in characterizing the state offense as an aggravated felony and in imposing an eight-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), but contends that the error was harmless. The Government has failed to meet its burden of showing that the error was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We VACATE Bautista-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
