The district court concluded that Rolle\u2019s allegations that his constitutional rights were violated during a state probation revocation proceeding failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-24\">Rolle\u2019s complaint fails on several grounds. The central premise of Rolle\u2019s complaint that his probation revocation is</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>invalid fails because, under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>a state prisoner cannot \u201cseek[] damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit\u201d when judgment in his favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or sentence.\u201d 512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Rolle\u2019s complaint that his federal rights were violated by the agents of the Florida Department of Corrections, the Law Office of Frank Sheffield, the Florida State Attorney\u2019s Office, the Florida Second Judicial Circuit, the Florida Office of the Attorney General, and the Florida First District Court of Appeals fails because there is no respondeat superior liability available under section 1983. <em>Cottone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2003). Rolle\u2019s complaint against the Florida agencies and their officers also fails because these state entities are not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of section 1983. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Rolle\u2019s complaint against Judge Richard L. Hood, Judge Thomas Howell Bateman III, Judge Richard W. Ervin, Judge Peter D. Webster, and Judge Paul Mahlon Hawkes fails because those judges are entitled to absolute immunity. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). Prosecutor John Joseph Maceluch Jr., Assistant Attorney General Sherrie Rollinson, probation officer Nicole Raysor, and Raysor\u2019s supervisor, Brian Engles, are also immune from Rolle\u2019s complaint. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 427-28, 96 S.Ct. 984, 993-94, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>Hughes v. Chesser, </em>731 F.2d 1489, 1490 (11th Cir. 1984). Rolle\u2019s complaint against Lilia Dandelake, who represented Rolle in his probation revocation proceeding, fails because a defense attorney is not a state actor under section 1983. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 453, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The dismissal of Rolle\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
