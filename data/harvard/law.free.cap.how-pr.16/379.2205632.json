Each action was brought upon a promissory note made by one Chichester, and indorsed by the defendants, - On the 4th of April, 1857, judgment was perfected in each action against all the defendants by default. The amount of the judgment in the first action is $312.39, and in the other $369.86.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-8\">On the 14th of May, 1857, an order was made by the Troy mayor\u2019s court, upon the application of the defendants, by which the default and all subsequent proceedings in these causes were so far set aside, as to allow the defendants therein to interpose a defence within ten days. But the judgment entered, and the execution issued and the levy made in each of said causes was to stand as security for any judgment which might ultimately be recovered in the actions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-9\">The defendant Warren, within the time allowed by the order, put in an answer in which he set up usury as a defence in each cause. The issues were noticed for trial at a term of the mayor\u2019s court, to be held on the 8th day of December. On the morning of that day, writs of <em>certiorari </em>were duly allowed by a justice of the supreme court, removing the causes into this court, under the provisions of the. Devised Statutes relating to the removal of causes from inferior courts. (2 <em>R. S. </em>389.) The defendant also offered to pay the costs of noticing the cause for trial. The costs were by stipulation between the parties taxed on the 9th of December, at about $25 in each cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\">The plaintiffs moved to \u201c set aside, dismiss and vacate,\" the writs of certiorari in each cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>M. I. Townsend, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-5\">A. C. Geer, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-6\">Harris, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ASG\">It, was objected on the part of the defendant that this motion is premature, inasmuch as no return had been made to the writs of <em>certiorari. </em>Were this to be regarded \"as a motion to <em>quash </em>the writs for irregularity, the objection would be well taken. But regarding it as an application to <em>supersede </em>the writs, because improperly allowed, the objection cannot prevail. \u201c If the writ be misdirected or otherwise bad in point of law,\u201d says Tidd, \u201c the court will order it to be <em>quashed </em>if before them, or if not returned will grant a super\u2022 <em>sedeas.\u201d </em>(1 <em>Tidd's Pr. </em>335. <em>See also 2 Burrell's Pr. </em>250; <em>Graham's Pr. </em>557; <em>Ferguson </em>agt. Jones, 12 <em>Wend. </em>241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">It becomes necessary, therefore, to inquire whether the writs were properly allowed. Judgments had been recovered against all the defendants in each action. Executions had been issued and a levy made upon the property of the defendants. As to all the defendants except Warren, these judgments and executions remain in full force. As to Warren, the effect of the order of the 14th of May, was not to vacate or set aside the judgments but to suspend proceedings until it should be ascertained by a trial whether this defendant in fact had a defence to the actions. If upon such trial he should be able to sustain his defence, the judgments might be set aside, but if not, then they would be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The statute provides that a <em>certiorari </em>to remove an action into the supreme court from an inferior court, shall not be effectual for that purpose, unless it be filed with the clerk of the court before judgment is entered in such action. (2 <em>R. S. </em>389, \u00a7 7.) In these cases judgments had been entered, and had not been vacated. The writs, therefore, were not effectual to remove the actions. The plaintiffs are entitled to an order that the writs of <em>certiorari </em>be <em>superseded. </em>I think, too, that the defendant should be charged with the costs of the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
