At the special term, it was held, that as the judgment debtor had (before settling with the plaintiff,) notice that the attorney of the plaintiff claimed a lien on the judgment <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>the amount of </em>$250, for his services in obtaining the judgment, he, the debtor, was bound thereby <em>to that </em>amount, and could not so settle with the plaintiff, as to protect himself from paying that sum on the execution, for the benefit of the attorney. At the same time the entire amount of costs contained in the judgment, including $40 of extra allowance, was $120.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The plaintiff in the judgment on the other hand, claimed \u2022that as between him and his attorney, there was nothing due. And to arrive at a decision at the special term, it was necessary to order an interlocutory reference, to ascertain what, as between the plaintiff and his attorney, was due for services in this cause. And it appears that on the reference, the plaintiff refused to appear, denying the authority of the court to refer, without his consent, a controversy between him and his attorney, for the trial of which he had a right to a jury. I am unable to see why this position of the plaintiff is not sound; as the <em>defendant </em>(and not the plaintiff,) made the motion to set aside the execution, because the judgment was settled. And if this position be sound, it seems to me to lead us directly to the correct solution of the whole difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The <em>allowance </em>made by the Code is a substitute for and in strict analogy to the <em>costs </em>of the old fee bill; and the amount of such allowance is patent on the judgment, as an item <em>separate </em>from the <em>plaintiff's damages. </em>To this limit, the attorney has, on the judgment roll itself, <em>prima facie </em>claim, of which all parties have legal notice. And in any settlement with the party, the defendant settles those costs <em>at,his peril. </em>But .an agreement as to amount of compensation, made between attorney and client under the Code, is utterly indefinite as well as confined .to their own knowdedge, and may as well extend to three-quarters of the whole judgment as to any other amount. And should there be a dispute between the attorney and his client, as to what the agreement was, and to what amount it extended, I know of no short remedy to which an attorney is entitled, by which to avoid settling that dispute in the usual way and by the usual tribunals. While, since the tenor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>extent of this agreement can never appear on the record, no party can ever be safe (in settling a judgment) against a claim of an attorney, however exorbitant or unlikely it may appear, but he must abide the due course of an execution, which will necessarily be collected long before the plaintiff and his attorney can have Aheir differences decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">It therefore seems to me, that while the attorney\u2019s lien should be maintained, under as well as before the Code, it should now, as then, be restricted to what appears as costs on the roll. And I would so modify the order of the special term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
