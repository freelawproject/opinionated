B. Akin, for the price of a quantity of hay sold by Akin to the defendants. Hall was a merchant and trader, doing business- in Providence, B. I., owned vessels, and was wealthy. Wardwell and Bardwell were commission merchants and produce dealers, in Albany, \u00a1New-York. For three years these two mercantile houses, (the three defendants,) had been and were in the habit of speculating and of purchasing produce, hay, feed, lumber, &amp;c., on credit on joint account. And this hay was purchased in the same way, the purchases made at Albany, the sales in Providence, B. I. The articles so purchased were sent in Hall\u2019s vessels to him at Providence ; by him sold, the proceeds received, the cost of the articles and one-half of the profits were remitted to Wardwell &amp; Bardwell at Albany. W. &amp; B. paid the amount due for the articles so purchased, and had one-half of the profits, and did not charge Hall any commission. Hall kept the other half of the profits as his share of the profits, charging no commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-9\">This hay was sold and the proceeds disposed of in the same way. Except the amount for which this action was brought, was not paid over to Akin, as Hall supposed it was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\">The testimony as to the purchase of the hay was conflicting. The plaintiff claiming that it was purchased upon the credit of both firms, of all the defendants. The defendant Hall claimed that W. &amp; B. purchased the hay, Hall carried it to Bhode Island, sold it and divided the profits with W. &amp; B. charging no commission. The referee found for the defendant, and held, <em>\u201c </em>that this transaction did not constitute Hall a copartner with W. &amp; B., either as between themselves or as to third persons, and that Hall was not individually or jointly liable with W. &amp; B. \u201d for this hay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">Judgment was entered upon the report of the referee, from which the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-13\">John Fitch, <em>attorney and counsel in person.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>First. </em>The referee erred in holding that Hall was not a <em>joint purchaser </em>of the hay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">1.

The testimony of Akin clearly shows it; the testimony of Bedell, Norris, the admission of Bardwell, conclusively confirm it. Akin swears he said to them, \u201c Well, gentlemen, what do you say\u2014do you conclude to take the hay?\u201d Wardwell said, \u201cMr. Akin, come over to-morrow, and we will let you know (this was after Hall and Wardwell stepped aside and talked together.) Akin did go over, and asked for Hall; Wardwell told him he had gone home, but that, <em>\u201c </em>we have concluded to take your hay.\u201d They took the hay. This constituted a contract. Akin offered to sell the hay at 40 cents per hundred; he asked them at his house, if they had concluded to take the hay, (this was after they had examined it, and Wardwell had introduced Hall to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Akin, as the man who Akin and Wardwell had talked about as the man who wanted to join with Wardwell and Bardwell in the purchase of Akin\u2019s hay,) and received for answer, \u201c Come over, and we will let you know.\u201d They did let him know\u2014they took it.

An action for money had and received was brought for the purpose of trying whether the plaintiff had been a trader within the meaning of the bankrupt laws. At the trial, it appeared that the plaintiff resided under the roof of Greenwood, his brother-in-law, who had long been a trader. Greenwood persuaded the plaintiff to enter into partnership with him. There was a long negotiation between them, and many conversations with creditors were proved, in which the plaintiff sometimes said he had become a partner with Greenwood. There was no evidence of any express agreement, nor of any interference in the business by the plaintiff, except that he had once gone, in company with Greenwood, to a dyer\u2019s, and having inquired about some goods that he had with him to be dyed; spoke of them as the joint property of himself and Greenwood. It appeared also, that the partnership, if any, only lasted from the 22d of March till the 9th of May. Upon this evidence, the jury found a verdict for the defendant, thereby establishing that the plaintiff was a partner with Greenwood, and\" therefore liable to the bankrupt laws; and the court of common pleas held the verdict to be right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Second. </em>The referee erred in holding that Hall was not liable as a <em>partner </em>with the other defendants in the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">1. The terms of the partnership as admitted by Hall at the time to Mr. Viele, were, that the other defendants made the purchases, he made the <em>sales, </em>and the three divided the <em>profits.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">2. This is entirely distinguishable from the cases of clerks and others, receiving as compensation a <em>sum equal to </em>a given share of the profits. It was not contended on the trial of the cause before the referee, that this was a mode of compensating Hall for any services. Hall was the capitalist; Ward well and Bard well were poor. <em>(Hodgman </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>13 <em>Barbour, </em>302 ; <em>Smith </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>1 <em>Abbott's Pr.

With respect to third persons, an actual partnership is considered by the law to subsist wherever there is a participation in the profits, even though the participant may have most expressly stipulated against the usual incidents to that transaction.

The rule is stated with precision by the court of appeals: <em>\u201c </em>The error into which the courts below have fallen, is in confounding a community of interest in <em>the property </em>out of which the profits are to arise, with a community of interest in <em>the profits themselves. </em>The latter is all that has ever been considered necessary to create a partnership <em>as against third persons.

The defendant Hall, lived in Providence, Rhode Island, and as appears, was a commission merchant there. <em>(See testimony of Akin, folio </em>26, <em>and Hall, folio </em>156.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\"><em>Second. </em>There is no pretence that Hall had anything to do personally with the purchase of the hay ; the whole question is, whether the facts clearly found make him liable as a partner of Wardwell &amp; Bardwell in the purchase of the hay ? The only facts proved, bearing upon that question, are that Ward-well &amp; Bardwell purchased the hay, and sent it to Hall at his place of business in Providence, to be sold, and to compensate him for his services, he was to have a portion of the profits arising from the adventure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">Hall was a mere agent to sell, and had no interest in the hay <em>till the sale was made, </em>and then his interest accrued in the proceeds of the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">Hall swears positively he had no interest in the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-9\"><em>Third. </em>The testimony of Wardwell was properly admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-10\">1. The testimony he gave was against his interest, it being for his interest to have Hall bound to pay his part of the debt. His testimony went merely to discharge Hall, leaving himself bound for the debt. <em>(Beal </em>agt. <em>Finch, </em>1 <em>Kernan, </em>128 ; <em>Lefever </em>agt. <em>Brigham, </em>10 <em>How. </em>385 ; 9 <em>How. </em>390.)</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-11\">By the court\u2014Davies, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aku\">The plaintiff in this action seeks to charge the defendant Hall, as partner with defendants Wardwell &amp; Bardwell, in a sale of hay, made by one Akin, and whose claim has been assigned to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The referee has found as a question of fact, that the purchase originally was made by the defendants Wardwell &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Bardwell, and that Hall was not a party to this purchase, although there is some evidence authorizing a different conclusion ; there is, we think, evidence sufficient to sustain the finding of the referee on this point. We do not think it necessary, therefore, to interfere with the conclusion on this question, to which he has arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The question of law submitted for our consideration, we think, was clearly and well stated, by the counsel for the defendant Hall, and is, did Hall, under the arrangement to sell the hay on joint account and divide the profits with Ward well &amp; Bardwell, constitute himself a partner so far as the plaintiff or his assignee is concerned ?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It is quite true, as between the defendants themselves, they were not partners. But it has long been settled, that although they might not be partners as between themselves, yet as to third persons, they might be liable as such. The rule is, that a participation in the profits, when such profits are not specifically fixed as a compensation for services, and paid to a subordinate, under the direction and control of principals, renders all such participants liable to third persons as partners. The case of <em>Waugh </em>agt. <em>Carver, </em>(2 <em>H. Black. </em>235,) decided on the authority of <em>Grace </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>(2 <em>W. Black. </em>998,) fully sustains this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">By an agreement entered into between the defendants, Carver and Carver &amp; Geisler, it was arranged between them, that they should respectively share in the profits of each other\u2019s business, in certain proportions, and it was also provided, that each should bear his own losses, and not be responsible for the defaults and losses of the other. The counsel for the plaintiff in that case, cited several authorities, which certainly sustain the position that a participation of profits is sufficient to constitute a partnership.</p>\n<author id=\"b193-8\">Chief Justice Eyre,</author>\n<p id=\"Acn\">in delivering the opinion of the court, says that it is plain upon the construction of the agreement, if it be construed only between the Carvers and Greisler, that they were not and never meant to be partners. They meant each house to carry on trade without risk of each other, and to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>at their own losses. And on the authority of <em>Grace </em>agt. Smith, <em>(supra,) </em>he holds that he who takes a moiety of all the profits, shall by operation of law be made liable to losses, if losses arise, upon the principle that by taking part of the profits, he takes from the creditors a part of that fund which is the proper sesurity to them for the payment of their debts; and he adds: \u201cfor though with respect to'each other, these persons were not to be considered as partners, yet they have made themselves such with regard to their transactions with the rest of the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The superior court in <em>Smith </em>agt. <em>Wright, (5 Sand. </em>113,) held in a case where two mercantile firms agree to share profits and loss upon contracts for the purchase or sale of merchandise,, to be made by each firm in its own name, and to be executed with its separate funds, they are not hable as copartners either as between themselves or to third persons. In that case, the arrangement between the parties was very like that, as testified to by defendant Hall, existed between him and defendants Wardwell and Bardwell. But the court of appeals reversed that judgment and held that the defendants though as between themselves were not copartners, the arrangement made between them to share the profits, constitutes them partners as to third persons. (1 <em>Abbott's Pr. Rep. </em>243.)</p>\n<author id=\"b194-6\">Edwards Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">in delivering the opinion of the court, says, \u201c all interest which is necessary to constitute a partnership, is an interest in the profits, and such an interest necessarily constitutes a partnership, unless, as has been stated, the interest in the profits is given as a compensation for services.\u201d The learned judge refers with approbation to the case of <em>Everett </em>agt. <em>Chapman, </em>(6 <em>Conn. Rep. </em>347,) where the parties had agreed that each one should purchase hides on his own credit, and should manufacture and sell the portion so manufactured by him, each party to participate in the profits. It was held that all the parties were liable as copartners to a third person, who sold hides to one of the parties in ignorance of the partnership, and charged the same to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The reasoning of the learned Judge Daggett, in the ease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>last cited, and the authorities cited by him, seem, to me conclusively to dispose of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The judgment entered on the report of the referee must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event, and the case may be referred to a referee residing in the city of Hew-York.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
