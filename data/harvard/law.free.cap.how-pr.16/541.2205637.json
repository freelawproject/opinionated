The county judge was incapable of hearing the appeal by reason of the fact that he had been counsel for one of the parties in the matters out of which the cause of action arose; and he transferred the cause to this court, pursuant to the directions contained in section thirty of the Code. The defendants\u2019 counsel objected to the hearing of the appeal in Broome county, and insisted that it should be heard in Cortland county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-10\">S. Kellogg, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-11\">R. H. Duell, <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b543-12\">Balcom, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AVx\">Although it was the duty of the clerk of Cortland county to transfer the papers in the cause <em>to the supreme court, in the same district, (Code, </em>\u00a7 30,) all he did or should have done, was tq take them from the county court files, and place them on those of this court <em>in his own office. </em>He is the clerk of each court. <em>(Constitution, article </em>6, \u00a7 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">The appeal must be heard in this court on the original papers, in the same manner that it would have been heard in the county court, if the county judge could have acted, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>cause, \u201c and no copy thereof need be furnished for the use of the court.\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 365.) The clerk of Cortland county is not required to take the papers out of his county at the instance or request of either party ; nor should he permit the attorney of either party, to bring them here or to carry them to any other county. The papers should remain on file in the office of the Cortland county cleik, until he is required by the court to bring them into the court-house in that county, on the hearing of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">For these reasons I am of the opinion the appeal in this cause should be heard in Cortland county. So decided.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
