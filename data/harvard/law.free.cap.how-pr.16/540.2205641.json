The defendants move to have this <em>allegation </em>struck out <em>on </em>the ground of irrelevancy. The plaintiffs counsel insists that it is material; as without it the complaint would show on its face that the claim, was barred by the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-10\">Geo. <em>Douglass, for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-11\">Bowman &amp; Green, <em>for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b548-12\">Clerke, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AAi\">In maintaining his argument, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel overlooks the provision contained in section 74 of the Code, which declares that <em>\u201c </em>the objection that the action was not commenced within the time limited, can only be taken by answer.\u201d So that evidently this allegation is unnecessary. Whatever may be the time stated in the complaint when the indebtedness was incurred, the plaintiff has a <em>prima facie </em>right to recover, and it is a mere optional privilege on the part of the defendants to interpose the defence allowed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the statute of limitations. If the defendants failed to answer a complaint showing on its face that the debt was incurred more than six years previous, judgment could be recovered by, default, and no error would appear on the- record. It is not necessary and, therefore, not relevant to insert the allegation complained of. In pleading, parties must be required to confine themselves to a statement of the mere facts essential to the maintenance of the action or the defence; and if a plaintiff were permitted to incumber his complaint with matters in anticipation of every possible defence which the apparent rights or ingenuity of a defendant may interpose, the record would be incumbered, and issues which may be otherwise avoided; would be introduced into the case. As it is probable that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel might have been misled by the decision -in <em>Genet </em>agt. <em>Tallmadge, </em>(1 <em>C. Rep. N. S. </em>346,) I grant this motion without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
