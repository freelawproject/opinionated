The answer was, first a general denial. 2d. It alleged that the title to the property was in one Tyrrell, and that the sheriff took the property by virtue of an execution against Tyrrell, issued upon a judgment in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">On the trial, the plaintiff gave evidence tending to show that the property belonged to him and was in his possession at the time it was taken by the sheriff and sold to the defendant, under and by virtue of the judgment and execution against Tyrrell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">The defendant offered to prove by one Danforth, that the property was not and never had been the property of the plaintiff, but that it was the property of Danforth. The defendant\u2019s counsel stated that he did not expect to connect the taking of the property in any manner with the title of Danforth, so as to justify the taking by any authority or permission of Danforth, but he claimed the right to give the evidence for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff was not the party in interest in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\">The judge upon objection rejected the evidence, and the defendant excepted.

The plaintiff was in possession of the property, claiming to be the owner, at the time it was taken and converted, and such possession gave him an interest sufficient to maintain an action against a stranger or naked wrongdoer, or against any one converting \"the property, except the owner or one who had a right to the possession. <em>(Bouvier, Action at Law, </em>430, <em>et seq; Duncan </em>agt. <em>Spear, </em>11 <em>W. </em>53 ; <em>McLaughlin </em>agt. Waite, 9 <em>Cow. </em>670; 2 <em>Green. Ev. </em>\u00a7 437; 2 <em>Saund. </em>47 <em>a, note </em>1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The defendant claims that the Code (\u00a7 111) has changed the law. By that section, every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except as otherwise provided in section 113. In my opinion the Code has not affected the question we are considering. .The plaintiff was \u201cthe real party in interest.\u201d He had an interest in protecting his possession, assuming that the property was not his, that is, that he was not the owner, but that it had been and was the property of Danforth. For aught that appears in the offered evidence, the plaintiff was the bailee of Danforth, and if so, it was his duty to protect the property, and the action could be maintained by him or by Danforth, the general owner. <em>(Story on Bail. </em>\u00a7 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The question presented in this case, was in the case of <em>Card </em>agt. Cheeny, decided some years since by the court at general term in this district. The like evidence was offered and rejected, and there was an exception. We held that the evidence was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">There must be judgment for the plaintiff upon the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
