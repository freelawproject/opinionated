The action involved the examination of a long account, and was clearly referable. The defendant\u2019s attorney wrote to plaintiff\u2019s attorney, two or three weeks before the trial, proposing to refer the cause, but received no answer, and again drew his attention to it orally. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, though not absolutely de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>dining, did not absolutely consent, and defendant\u2019s attorney served notice of motion to refer, on the Saturday preceding the circuit, on Tuesday following. The plaintiff had subpoenaed his witnesses before this, one of whom resided in the city of ISTew-York. The affidavit of the clerk of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, deposed that the notice of motion, was not served in time to countermand the service of subpoenas. The witnesses actually attended one day. The cause was referred by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">On the hearing before the referee, a witness residing in Brooklyn, was subpoenaed at Schuylerville, and on consulting counsel was advised that he was not obliged to attend, unless he was tendered the amount of his travel fees, from his place of residence to the place of hearing at Fort Edward, and refused otherwise to attend. The plaintiff paid him his full travel fees for four hundred miles, being $16. The clerk struck out all the witnesses\u2019 fees for attendance at September circuit, and also all the travel fees of the witness subpoenaed at Schuylerville, except for the distance to and from Fort Edward. The plaintiff moves for a re-adjustment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-6\">H. W.

L. Allen, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A-5\">The clerk was right in refusing to allow for the witnesses\u2019 fees at the circuit in September, 1856. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney knew that according to the course and practice of the court, the cause would be referred. The attorney for defendants, swears that he wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, on the 9th of September, about a fortnight before the circuit, proposing to refer, to which he received no answer; that afterwards, before serving the notice of motion, he saw the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and stated to him, that the issues were such, that the court would probably refer the cause, whether the parties consented or not; and again proposed the reference. The attorney did not positively decline, but postponed agreeing thereto, and defendant finally served his notice of motion on the 19th of September. On the following week, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>when the circuit was held, the defendant\u2019s attorney also once proposed to refer the cause on his part, which was not at that time assented to.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Under these circumstances, it is to be presumed that the attorney well knew, that the cause would be referred; and he should have so advised his client; and not have put him to the expense of bringing his witnesses to court, when he had every reason to believe and know that the cause would not be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As to the other item, I think the clerk erred in not allowing travel fees for the whole distance from the witness\u2019s place of residence. The witness, it is true, was subpoenaed at Schuylerville, where he was on business, and when he was about to return home. He insisted upon the whole amount of travel fees, from his place of residence, and refused otherwise to attend. It has been decided in this district, in a similar case, that he was entitled to it: and the plaintiff paid him the amount in good faith, and to secure his attendance before the referee. He was detained and prevented from returning home, or it may have been necessary for him to return and come back again. It is unnecessary, however, to dwell upon the question, as the decision already made, must control the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The motion for adjustment must be granted, unless defendant\u2019s attorney stipulates in writing, within twenty days, that the clerk may add $14.96, to the amount stricken out from this item, in which case, the motion is to be denied without costs to either party. Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
