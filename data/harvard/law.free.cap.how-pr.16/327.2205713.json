The plaintiff recovered a judgment . against the defendant in the Troy justices\u2019 court, for one hundred dollars, besides costs. The defendant appealed to the county court of Rensselaer county. The county judge being disqualified from hearing the appeal, the case was transferred to the supreme court, in the manner prescribed in the 13th subdivision of the 30th section of the Code. &lt;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-6\">The appeal having been argued before the supreme court the judgment of the justices\u2019 court was reversed. Upon the taxation of the costs upon such reversal, the attorney for the appellant claimed to be allowed $15 for proceedings before argument, and $30 for the argument, besides $10 for a calendar fee, at a term when the-cause was not reached. The clerk disallowed these items, and allowed $15 for the costs upon the reversal, together with disbursements. From this taxation the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-7\">R. A.

There was no other appeal in the case. The county court, as it was authorized to do by the 13th subdivision of the 30th section of the Code, transferred the action to this court, which thereby, and not by virtue of any appeal, acquired jurisdiction of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The 371st section of the Code, authorizes an allowance to the appellant, upon the reversal of a judgment on appeal from a justices\u2019 court to the county court, of fifteen dollars, together with the fees of officers and disbursements. This was such an appeal. It was not the less so, because by operation of law, it was transferred to, and the judgment of reversal was rendered by this court. The allowance provided by the 5th subdivision of the 307th section of the Code, is only applicable to appeals to this court. In this case there was no such appeal, and there being none, the defendant was not entitled to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>her costs taxed under this provision. <em>(See Taylor </em>agt. Seeley, 4 <em>How. </em>314.) There, was no error in the taxation, and the motion should therefore be denied, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
