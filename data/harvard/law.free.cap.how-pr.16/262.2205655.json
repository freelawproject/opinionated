If the order was a nullity <em>ah initio, </em>and Could afford no justification, these allegations would be unnecessary. But the order set forth in this complaint is clearly not void. If at all defective, and issued on a false affidavit, it is only voidable; and this must be determined by the competent authority, before an action can be sustained against the persons who procured it. <em>(Reynolds </em>agt. <em>Corss, </em>3 <em>Cai.
