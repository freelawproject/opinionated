The certificate of the superintendent of the bank department, that was given in evidence upon the trial, states that Cook commenced the banking business as an individual banker, at Havana, in 1851, under the aforesaid acts. Is the plaintiff a corporation ? The appellant\u2019s counsel contends the plaintiff is not a corporation, and that it has no' legal capacity to sue. It is now well settled that banking associations, formed under the aforesaid acts, are moneyed corporations. <em>(Gilbert </em>agt. Moody, 3 Comstock, 479.) By chapter 340 of the laws of 1848, individual bankers are declared to be \u201c banks of discount and deposit, as well as of circulation,\u201d and every report directed to be made by any law, from an individual banker, must be verified by the oath of the president and cashier. The term <em>association </em>is made to include every individual doing business alone for some purposes under the banking laws. <em>(Chap. </em>437, <em>Laws of </em>1849.) After a careful examination of the statutes authorizing and regulating the business of banking, I have cometo the conclusion that an <em>individual hanker </em>is a \u201c corporation sole.\" There is no express declaration in any statute to this effect, but individual bankers are clothed by statute with legal capacities and advantages which as natural persons by common law they could not have; and \u201c no particular form of words is requisite to create a corporation.\u201d (2 <em>Kents Com. </em>276.) Kent says: \u201c A corporation sole consists of a single person, who is made a body corporate and politic, to give him some legal capacities and advantages, and especially that of perpetuity,\" which as a natural person he could not have; a bishop, dean, parson and vicar, are given in the English books as instances of sole corporations.\u201d Perpetuity is not absolutely necessary to make an association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>or a single person a corporation. The existence of a corporation may be limited to any number of years. Therefore, what Kent says about perpetuity being a legal capacity or advantage possessed by an individual, when a corporation sole, has no controlling force. The statute prohibiting individual bankers from selling or transferring the business upon the securities deposited by them, was not passed until after the action was tried1. <em>(Laws of </em>1854, <em>p. </em>554, \u00a7 9.) \u201c As a general rule, a fee will not pass to a corporation sole without the word successors, and it will continue for the life only of the individual clothed with the corporate character.\u201d (2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>273 ; 2 <em>Blackstone\u2019s Com. </em>431.) This was the common law rule, but it has been changed by statute in this state. (1 <em>R. S. </em>748, \u00a7 1; <em>Nicoll </em>agt. <em>The New - York and Eric Railroad </em>Company, 2 <em>Ker</em>nan, 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">If an individual banker is a corporation sole, there can be no more objection to such banker taking any corporate name he shall choose to adopt, or to Mr. Cook being a corporation by the name of \u201c The Bank of Havana,\u201d than there is to an individual being a corporation by the name of bishop, dean, parson or vicar, which, as has been seen, is allowable under the English law. If these are correct conclusions, the proof established the plaintiff\u2019s legal capacity to <em>sue; </em>and this action was properly brought in the name by which Mr. Cook transacts his banking business. There was no necessity for bringing it in Mr. Cook\u2019s name <em>as </em>president of the Bank of Havana. <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>The Assessors of </em>Watertown, 1 Hill, 621; <em>Gilbert </em>agt. <em>Moody, </em>3 <em>Comstock, </em>483 ; <em>Con. art. </em>8, \u00a7 3 ; 1 <em>R. S. </em>599, \u00a7 1; <em>The East River Bank </em>agt. Judah, 10 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">But suppose the proof failed to establish that the plaintiff is a corporation\u2014the question arises, was the judge right in holding that the appellants by not denying in their answers the corporate capacity of the plaintiff to sue, thereby admitted such capacity ? This would clearly be so had there been a direct allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff was a corporation. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The only statement in the complaint, aside from the title of the action which imports that the plaintiff is a corporation, is in these words, viz : \u201c The Bank of Havana, the plaintiff in this suit.\u201d Is this a sufficient averment to show the plaintiff has legal capacity to sue ? The Revised Statutes provide that \u201c in actions by or against any corporation, by or under, any law of this state, it shall not be necessary to recite the act or acts of incorporation, or the proceedings by which such- corporation was created, or to set forth the substance thereof, but the same may be pleaded by reciting the title of such act, and the date of its passage.\u201d (2 <em>R. S. </em>459, \u00a7 13.) Section 471 of the Code, declares that the second part of the Code, which prescribes the manner of pleading in actions, shall not affect <em>\u201c </em>any statutory provisions relating to actions not inconsistent with this act, and in substance applicable to the actions hereby provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Mr. Justice Mitchell has held that \u201c banks created under the general banking law, when suing, should recite the title of the act and the date of its passage, under which proceedings were had' for its incorporation.\u201d <em>(Johnson, President, &amp;c. </em>agt. <em>Kemp, </em>11 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>186. <em>See also Bank of Lowville </em>agt. <em>Edwards, </em>11 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>216.) And I am of the opinion Justice Mitchell has given the correct construction to this enactment, when the question is properly raised by demurrer. <em>(See Onondaga County Bank </em>agt. <em>Carr, </em>7 <em>Wendell, </em>443.) How assuming that the complaint in this action should have recited the title of the act, and the date of its passage under which the plaintiff claims to have a legal existence, then the complaint upon its face does' not show that the plaintiff has legal capacity to sue; and as section 144 of the Code has been construed, the complaint shows upon its face that the plaintiff had <em>not </em>legal capacity' to sue, and for this cause was demurrable. (11 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>186 ; <em>Id. </em>216.) This construction of section 144 of the Code, is probably based' upon the assumption that the complaint is presumed to show all the legal capacity to sue that a plaintiff has; and, therefore, when such legal capacity-to sue does not appear from \"the complaint, it is deemed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>affirmatively that the plaintiff does not possess any legal capacity to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">By the same authorities, the complaint in this action was not demurrable on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (11 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>216.) But it could have been objected to by demurrer, for the reason that it appears upon the face that the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue, <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 144, <em>sub. </em>2, 11 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>186 ; <em>id. </em>216.) As the appellants took no objection by demurrer or answer, that the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue, by sections 147 and 148 of the Code, they are <em>\u201c </em>deemed to have waived the same.\u201d Had it, however, been neees\u00e1ary to set forth in the complaint that the plaintiff is a corporation, to make the complaint <em>\u201c </em>state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,\u201d then the defendant could have taken advantage of the defect in the complaint upon the trial. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 148.) But the capacity of the plaintiff to sue, has been held to be independent of the cause of action. (11 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Again, if the decision in <em>The Bank of Lowville agt. Edwards, </em>(11 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>216,) is to be upheld, the complaint in this action states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Although it does not recite the title of the act and the date of its passage, under which proceedings were had for the plaintiff\u2019s incorporation; upon this assumption it was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove its corporate existence on the trial. Prior to the Revised Statutes such proof was necessary when the general issue alone was pleaded. (8 <em>J. R. </em>378 ; 2 <em>Cowen, </em>778 ; 7 <em>Wend. </em>540.) But by such statutes, it is provided, \u201c in a suit brought by a corporation created by <em>or under </em>any statute of this state, it shall not be necessary to prove on the trial of the cause the existence of such corporation, unless the defendant shall have pleaded in abatement or in bar, <em>that the plaintiffs are not a corporation. </em>(2 <em>R. S. </em>458, \u00a7 3.) This statute is Still in force and it is applicable to actions under the Code. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 471.) Had the appellants in their answers denied each and every allegation in the complaint, the plaintiff would not have been obliged to show its corporate existence. \u201c To put the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>plaintiff to proof of that fact, the defence of <em>rad tiel corporation </em>must be set up by answer.\u201d The case of <em>The proprietors of the common and undivided land and meadows of Southold </em>agt. Horton, (6 <em>Hill, </em>501,) relied upon by the appellants\u2019 counsel, does not establish a different proposition. That was an ejectment suit, in which, by the statute then in force, a defendant might demur to the declaration or \u201c plead the general issue <em>only.1' </em>(2 <em>R. S. </em>306, \u00a7 22 <em>; 17 Wend. </em>443 <em>; 1 </em>Denio, 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">There is sufficient unexceptionable evidence in the case to sustain the finding of the justice upon the questions of fact. The judgment of the special term should, therefore, be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
