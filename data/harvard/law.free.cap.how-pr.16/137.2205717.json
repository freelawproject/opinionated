If the plaintiff can maintain this action, every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>other tax payer of the city who owns city stock amounting to $100, may institute a like one. It seems to me, the sanctioning of such a proposition would produce incalculable mischief, and violate the well established principle that one person cannot maintain a civil action for an injury of a public nature, when the injury he sustains is no greater than that sustained, by every other member of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The earlier decisions in this district, which seem to hold the doctrine that tax payers may maintain actions similar to the one at bar, have been too much shaken by recent adjudications in this city and the court of appeals, to be relied upon as establishing the right of the plaintiff to the relief demanded in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The tax payers of the city, and holders of city stock, must find a remedy, if one is to be found, through the ballot box, the grand jury or the attorney-general, for abuses of corporate authority, by their mayor and common council, in the disposition of city property, or they must apply to the legislature for the passage of different laws than are now to be found in the statutes of the state. I am of the opinion, the complaint in the action does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that the order made at the special term, overruling the demurrer to the complaint, interposed by the defendants Draper and Coleman, should be reversed, and that those defendants should have judgment upon the demurrer with costs, but with leave to the plaintiff to amend his complaint in twenty days, on payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
