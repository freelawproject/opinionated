Clark, liable for breach of a home improvement contract but awarding them only nominal damages. The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly (1) found that their proposed remediation estimate for exterior construction work was unnecessarily costly, (2) neglected to award damages on the basis of the defendant\u2019s failure to build certain bifold doors and (3) reduced the final damages award by their unpaid contract balance. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The plaintiffs brought their action in four counts. In the first count, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant breached a written home improvement contract by failing to properly build specified custom kitchen cabinetry and bifold doors. The second count alleged breach of an oral contract as a result of the improper installation of the kitchen cabinets.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the third count, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant breached a separate oral contract as to some exterior construction work. The fourth count sought damages for alleged violations of the Home Improvement Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.; and consequently the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., on the basis of the defendant\u2019s failure to register as a home improvement contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The court found in favor of the plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim alleged in count one<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but denied relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>for both the exterior defects complained of in count three and the CUTPA violations alleged in count four. The court subsequently offset the plaintiffs\u2019 total damages by the unpaid balance remaining on the contract and accordingly awarded only nominal damages. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision and articulation and the underlying record reveal the following undisputed facts. The defendant, doing business as Old House Woodcraft, is engaged in the trade of custom cabinetry making. During all times relevant to this dispute, the defendant was not registered as a home improvement contractor as required by General Statutes \u00a7 20-420.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In August, 2003, the plaintiffs and the defendant entered into a written contract for the fabrication and construction of custom kitchen cabinetry in accordance with certain design sketches. Included in that kitchen cabinetry contract were plans for the building of bifold doors designed to conceal a wall oven. The contract price for that kitchen work was $17,951.50. The plaintiffs later entered into a separate oral contract with the defendant for the installation of the custom cabinets and additional interior work. They agreed to a flat rate of $15,000 for the interior work and to an hourly rate for the cabinet installation work.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Subsequently, in October, 2003, the plaintiffs and the defendant entered into an additional oral contract for various exterior home improvements to the plaintiffs\u2019 deck, porch and lattice panels. The agreement included the fabrication and installation of porch railings and posts. The exterior work was to be billed on a time and materials rate. The defendant\u2019s total bill for the exterior work was $6810.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Over the course of the home construction project, the relationship between the parties deteriorated, and the plaintiffs eventually requested that the defendant not return to the construction premises. The plaintiffs thereafter brought this action seeking damages arising from the defendant\u2019s allegedly defective construction work. The plaintiffs, however, unilaterally withheld more than $8000 from their payment of invoices submitted to them in connection with the construction project. The plaintiffs claimed that they withheld that money to remediate the kitchen cabinetry and porch defects of which they complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Following a trial to the court, the court found that the custom kitchen cabinets fabricated by the defendant were defective. The court noted that there were \u201cnoticeable and uneven gaps between some cabinet doors and frames.\u201d Additionally, \u201csome paneling in the kitchen island . . . needed some minor corrective work, and [the] cabinet doors over the refrigerator did not \u2018sit flush\u2019 . . . .\u201d Furthermore, the court found that \u201cthe defendant admittedly failed to construct [the] bifold doors . . . .\u201d The court concluded that remediation expenses of $6336.95 for these defects were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In contrast, the court refused to award remediation damages for the allegedly defective exterior work performed by the defendant. The plaintiffs claimed exterior defects in the form of \u201cexcessive spacing on some porch flooring, lattice not per spec, balusters not evenly spaced, [and] newel posts and post caps [separation].\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Scott Newton, submitted a remediation estimate in connection with these alleged defects in the amount of $4904.16.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>found Newton\u2019s remediation proposal to be \u201cunnecessarily costly,\u201d reasoning that some of the alleged defects were repairable by applying caulking, while other proposed modifications were either approved by the plaintiffs or specifically not called for in the project blueprints.3 *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The court also denied any CUTPA relief. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant\u2019s failure to register as a home improvement contractor violated the act and consequently was a per se CUTPA violation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although, as the court found, \u201c[t]he defendant admittedly was not registered as a home improvement contractor,\u201d the court nevertheless also found that the plaintiffs did not suffer an ascertainable loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s registration inadequacies. Accordingly, the court found in favor of the defendant on the CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Finally, the court turned to the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages. The court repeated its finding that the plaintiffs were entitled to $6336.95 to remediate the defective kitchen cabinetry. The court found, however, that this award was necessarily offset by the plaintiffs\u2019 unilateral withholding of $8000 from the final contract balance. Finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 cost to remediate was less than the amount withheld, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim for nominal damages in the amount of $1.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly (1) found Newton\u2019s remediation proposal for exterior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>work to be unnecessarily costly and (2) declined to award them $750 in damages for the defendant\u2019s failure to construct the bifold doors. We disagree with both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The court\u2019s finding that the exterior remediation proposal was unnecessarily costly, along with its assessment of the bifold door damages, are findings of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. \u201cThe law governing [our] limited appellate review is clear. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we give great deference to its findings. ... In reviewing factual findings, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the [court] could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . Instead, we make every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stevenson Lumber Co.-Suffield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chase Associates, Inc., </em>284 Conn. 205, 216-17, 932 A.2d 401 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">With respect to their first challenge, the plaintiffs refer to the fact that the court mistakenly added two damage estimates when referencing Newton\u2019s remediation proposal in its memorandum of decision. See footnote 4. They maintain that this error evidences a flaw in the court\u2019s original conclusion that the proposed remedy was unnecessarily costly.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In its articulation, the court specifically addressed its miscalculation of Newton\u2019s damage estimate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>court found, however, that even in light of this mistake, the exterior repairs proposed by Newton were not reasonably necessary. Upon our thorough review of the record, including the reasonable inferences that the trial court could have drawn therefrom, we conclude that there is ample evidence to support the court\u2019s determination that Newton\u2019s proposal was unnecessarily costly.* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We cannot say that this finding was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The court\u2019s alleged failure specifically to award the plaintiffs $750 in damages for the bifold doors also was not clearly erroneous. There is no dispute that the defendant did not build the bifold doors; however, it is also undisputed that the plaintiffs withheld more than $8000 from invoices submitted to them by the defendant. The court responded to inquiries concerning the bifold doors in its articulation and stated that \u201c[a]ny costs to remediate defective workmanship are more than covered by the amount of the unpaid invoices.\u201d Accounting for the $6336.95 in contract damages found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>attributable to the defendant, it certainly was logical for the court to find that the claimed $750 in damages, even if genuine,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> would be more than \u201ccovered\u201d by the $8000 withheld by the plaintiffs. Therefore, the court\u2019s treatment of the bifold door damages was not clearly erroneous, and this claim also must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Last, the plaintiffs claim that the act; General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.; and specifically General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a), prohibited the court from offsetting the plaintiffs\u2019 damages award by an amount equal to the unpaid balance remaining on the contract as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Our analysis begins by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cTo the extent that we are required to review conclusions of law or the interpretation of the relevant statute by the trial court, we engage in plenary review.\u201d <em>Location Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colaccino, </em>287 Conn. 706, 717, 949 A.2d 1189 (2008). \u201cUnder plenary review, we must decide whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are legally and logically correct and find support in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Krichko </em>v. <em>Krichko, </em>108 Conn. App. 644, 648, 948 A.2d 1092, cert. granted on other grounds, 289 Conn. 913, 957 A.2d 877 (2008) (appeal withdrawn May 19, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The act expressly invalidates home improvement contracts that fail to meet certain provisions. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a). Specifically, \u00a7 20-429 (a) (8) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>declares contracts entered into by unregistered contractors unenforceable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201cin the absence of a showing of bad faith on the part of the homeowner, a contractor who does not comply substantially with \u00a7 20-429 (a) is barred from any monetary recovery, contractual or restitutionary.\u201d <em>New England Custom Concrete, LLC </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>102 Conn. App. 652, 659, 927 A.2d 333 (2007), citing <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 324-25, 576 A.2d 455 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">It is undisputed that the defendant was not registered as a home improvement contractor while engaging in construction work with the plaintiffs. Consequently, the plaintiffs maintain that this \u00a7 20-429 (a) violation prohibited the court from offsetting the plaintiffs\u2019 contractual damages by moneys they withheld from the defendant, as this was tantamount to a monetary recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Recently, our Supreme Court addressed this issue in <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>290 Conn. 1, 961 A.2d 373 (2009).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff homeowners brought an action against the defendant contractor on the basis of allegedly unfinished and defective construction work. Id., 4\u20145. As in the present case, the homeowners pursued the claim notwithstanding an unpaid balance due on the contract for work performed by the contractor. Id., 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The attorney trial referee filed a report finding that the plaintiffs incurred $16,085 in costs to complete and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>to repair the work. Id., 5. The defendant contractor requested that this potential award be offset by the $16,472 balance remaining on the contract withheld by the plaintiffs. Id. The attorney trial referee declined the defendant\u2019s request and concluded that because the contract did not comply with \u00a7 20-429 (a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the defendant was precluded from \u201creduc[ing] the damages award commensurate with the unpaid balance on the contract . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. The trial court accepted the referee\u2019s report and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Id., 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On appeal, the defendant claimed that neither the language of \u00a7 20-429 (a), nor any of the cases interpreting it, dispensed with traditional contract damage rules that mandate a showing of actual loss to recover on a contract claim. Id., 9. \u201cTo hold otherwise,\u201d the defendant argued, \u201cwould give [the homeowners] a windfall double recovery . . . .\u201d Id. Our Supreme Court agreed with this statutory analysis<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201c\u00a7 20-429 (a) does not preclude a trial court from reducing the homeowner\u2019s damages by the amount left unpaid under the contract.\u201d Id., 10. Otherwise, the court reasoned, \u201c\u00a7 20-429 (a) could be read to allow a homeowner affirmatively to obtain a free home improvement project from the contractor, rather than simply to prevent the contractor from enforcing otherwise valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>claims against the homeowner.\u201d Id., 16. Awarding this type of an \u201cunwarranted windfall\u201d could not have been intended by the legislature. Id., 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The plaintiffs in the present case, unlike the homeowners in <em>Ilees, </em>included a CUTPA claim in their action against the defendant contractor. This additional claim, however, does not alter our conclusion as to the applicability of \u00a7 20-429 (a) to the plaintiffs\u2019 damages award. \u201c[T]he simple fact that \u00a7 20-429 (a) serves as the basis for [a] CUTPA violation . . . does not affect the [ultimate] damages calculation . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 14-15. It also does not dispense with the firmly established principle that to succeed, a CUTPA claimant must demonstrate a statutory violation coupled with some ascertainable loss. \u201cOnce a violation of the act has been established . . . our cases make clear that the homeowners still must prove that they have suffered an injury or actual loss in order to recover damages under CUTPA.\u201d Id., 14; see also <em>Stevenson Lumber Co.-Suffield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chase Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 284 Conn. 214 (\u201cin order to prevail in a CUTPA action, a plaintiff must establish both that the defendant engaged in a prohibited act <em>and </em>that, as a result of this act, the plaintiff suffered an injury\u201d [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted]). Therefore, litigants seeking CUTPA relief must present evidence of damages they have suffered. See <em>New England Custom Concrete, LLC </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>supra, 102 Conn. App. 666. \u201cThere is no automatic entitlement to damages.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The record reveals that the plaintiffs have not provided adequate evidence demonstrating an ascertainable loss. The court found that the plaintiffs sustained $6336.95 in contract damages but reduced the final award by the $8000 that the plaintiffs withheld from the defendant. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the sum of damages awarded as compensation in a breach of contract action should place the injured party in the same position as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>he would have been in had the contract been performed. . . . The injured party, however, is entitled to retain nothing in excess of that sum which compensates him for the loss of his bargain. . . . Guarding against excessive compensation, the law of contract damages limits the injured party to damages based on his actual loss caused by the breach. . . . The concept of actual loss accounts for the possibility that the breach itself may result in a saving of some cost that the injured party would have incurred if he had had to perform. ... In such circumstances, the amount of the cost saved will be credited in favor of the wrongdoer . . . that is, subtracted from the loss . . . caused by the breach in calculating [the injured party\u2019s] damages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 290 Conn. 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">As our Supreme Court established in <em>Hees, </em>homeowners are unable to rely on \u00a7 20-429 (a) as a shield against their withholding of moneys due on a home improvement contract in an action brought by the homeowners themselves. Therefore, we agree with the court\u2019s conclusion in the present case that the plaintiffs\u2019 unpaid contract balance should have been subtracted from their total contract damages. The plaintiffs withheld an amount in excess of their actual damages incurred; consequently, they do not have an ascertainable loss for which recovery is permissible. Concluding otherwise would grant the plaintiffs a windfall that would reward their withholding of valid contract payments. This approach also would fail to account for their true contract damages. Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s offsetting of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages award by moneys they unilaterally withheld from the defendant was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\"> Originally, the second count included several additional allegations of interior home improvement work that was not completed by the defendant. These claims were subsequently withdrawn by the plaintiffs, leaving only the improper cabinet installation claim at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-12\"> The court included any possible damages for the improper installation work alleged in count two in the award for the claim stated in count one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-420 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall hold himself or herself out to be a contractor . . . without first obtaining a certificate of registration\u201d from the commissioner of consumer protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> In its memorandum of decision, the court initially calculated the Newton estimate to be $9246.52, rather than $4904.16. This is attributable to the plaintiffs\u2019 providing the court with two estimates prepared by Newton for the same exterior work. This inaccuracy is discussed further in part I of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> More specifically, the court found: \u201c[The defendant] credibly testified that separations in the newel posts and caps . . . were repairable by applying caulking. . . . The balusters can\u2019t be expected to all be equally spaced, especially near a newel post. Nor does the blueprint call for such [spacing], . . . With respect to the use of pine instead of cedar for the lattice . . . [t]he defendant made that recommendation to the plaintiffs, who approved the use of pine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b649-11\"> A violation of the act \u201cshall be deemed an unfair or deceptive trade practice under subsection (a) of section 42-110b.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-427 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\"> We note the following relevant portion of the court\u2019s articulation: \u201cThe [c]ourt apparently erred in finding the estimate to repair claimed defects in the newel posts and caps on the deck was $9246.52. The correct claim, it appears, should have been $4904.16. . . . [T]he evidence established [that] the newel posts and caps were installed properly. Any subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>[damage] could reasonably be remedied by applying caulking . . . [t]hat would not even come close to the approximately $5000 in costs to replace them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"> Newton\u2019s remediation proposal itemized restoration to balusters, lattice panels, and newel posts and caps. With respect to the balusters, the plaintiffs claimed that remediation was necessary to fix some uneven spacing. In response, the court noted that the equidistant spacing of balusters, particularly near the newel posts, was not called for in the blueprints. This was acknowledged by Newton himself when he testified as the plaintiffs\u2019 construction expert. As to the lattice work, the remediation proposal reflects the replacement of pine lattice panels with cedar panels. Although the original agreement may have called for the use of cedar panels, the court found, and the record demonstrates, that the plaintiffs did not object to the substitution of pine. The remediation estimate also reflects repair work to the newel post covers and post caps on the porch. In its memorandum of decision, and again in its articulation, the court stressed that any noticeable separation in the posts and caps was repairable by applying caulking. Our review of the record, including evidence that this separation was not present at the time of installation and likely resulted over time as a result of rainwater penetration, supports this finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\"> There is some dispute over whether the plaintiffs were entitled to any damages regarding the bifold doors. The defendant claims, and the plaintiffs concede, that the parties discussed the defendant\u2019s failure to construct the bifold doors and agreed that the defendant would credit this amount toward the plaintiffs\u2019 final invoices. Whether this amount was properly credited is not relevant to our conclusion that the court\u2019s bifold door damages findings are not clearly erroneous. Therefore, we decline to address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo home improvement contract shall be valid or enforceable against an owner unless it . . . (8) is entered into by a registered salesman or registered contractor . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\"> The principal issue in <em>Hees </em>was whether a violation of the act, and specifically \u00a7 20-429 (a), \u201cprecludes a home improvement contractor from reducing the damages that it owes for breach of contract to a nonbreaching homeowner by an amount equal to the unpaid balance remaining on the contract.\u201d <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 290 Conn. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\"> The home improvement contract did not include a right of rescission clause as required by \u00a7 20-429 (a) (6). <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 290 Conn. 5. Although the plaintiffs in the present case complained of a registration violation under \u00a7 20-429 (a) (8), this technical difference is of no consequence, as the Supreme Court in <em>Hees </em>analyzed the thrust of \u00a7 20-429 (a) as a whole.
