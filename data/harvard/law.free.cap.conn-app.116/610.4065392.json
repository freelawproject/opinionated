The defendant challenges as clearly erroneous the court\u2019s findings that (1) the defendant had constructive notice of the defect at issue and (2) the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">On March 1,2004, at approximately 11 a.m., the plaintiff was walking on the easterly side of Orange Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>in New Haven when she tripped on a metal grate, causing her to fall to the ground and sustain physical injury. As the court found in its memorandum of decision: \u201cAt a point in [the] sidewalk near Orange Street\u2019s intersection with Chapel Street, the sidewalk narrows because of a tree planted within the sidewalk\u2019s boundary, which tree is surrounded by a metal grate, which, over time has risen, creating a tripping hazard to persons walking on [the] sidewalk. The plaintiffs exhibit three is the complaint form of the city of New Haven, department of public works, and, under \u2018Description of Problem,\u2019 states [that] \u2018on [March 1, 2004 at] 11:00 a.m. at the raised decorative metal tree grate . . . [the plaintiff] fell on unevenness and raised metal grate in sidewalk.\u2019 The plaintiff, an elderly lady, testified that she was a cancer survivor and diabetic and was walking at the side of her husband toward the Giamo Building to obtain tax forms for the filing of their tax return; that she was in good health but experienced nearsightedness requiring that she wear glasses. She was walking on the side of her husband closest to the street. The plaintiffs exhibit four shows that the tree and grate installation occupies approximately 50 percent of the sidewalk\u2019s width, thereby significantly reducing the walking area for a pedestrian approaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The plaintiff subsequently commenced a civil action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149, commonly referred to as the municipal highway defect statute. See <em>McIntosh </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>274 Conn. 262, 266 n.4, 875 A.2d 459 (2005). A court trial followed, at the conclusion of which the court found in favor of the plaintiff and rendered judgment accordingly. From that judgment, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In enacting \u00a7 13a-149, our legislature \u201cimposed a penalty upon the municipality, measured by the actual injury caused by its disobedience of the statute, and enforceable by the person injured through an action on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Frechette </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>104 Conn. 83, 87, 132 A. 467 (1926). To recover under \u00a7 13a-149, a plaintiff \u201cmust prove, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, (1) that the highway was defective as claimed; (2) that the defendant actually knew of the particular defect or that, in the exercise of its supervision of highways in the city, it should have known of that defect; (3) that the defendant, having actual or constructive knowledge of this defect, failed to remedy it having had a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, to do so; and (4) that the defect must have been the sole proximate cause of the injuries and damages claimed, which means that the plaintiff must prove freedom from contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 205, 207, 439 A.2d 949 (1981). The second and fourth requirements are at issue in this appeal. Significantly, the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s determination that the grate was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The defendant first contests the court\u2019s finding that it had constructive notice of the defective condition of the grate on which the plaintiff tripped.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The existence of constructive notice is a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. Id., 207-208; see also <em>Ormsby </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>54 Conn. App. 98, 103, 734 A.2d 575 (1999) (\u201cconstructive notice is a question of fact\u201d), aff'd, 255 Conn. 670, 768 A.2d 441 (2001). \u201cA court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous only in cases in which the record contains no evidence to support it, or in cases in which there is evidence, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>omitted.) <em>Considine </em>v. Waterbury, 279 Conn. 830, 858, 905 A.2d 70 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">A municipality \u201cis required to exercise reasonable supervision over its streets and is chargeable with notice of what such supervision would disclose.\u201d <em>Mausch </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>184 Conn. 467, 469, 440 A.2d 157 (1981). That duty \u201cis a reactive obligation, not an anticipatory obligation.\u201d <em>Ormsby </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>255 Conn. 670, 676, 768 A.2d 441 (2001). \u201cThe notice, actual or implied, of a highway defect causing injuries which a municipality must receive as a condition precedent [to] liability for those injuries, is notice of the defect itself which occasioned the injury, and not merely of conditions naturally productive of that defect and subsequently in fact producing it. Notice of another defect, or of the existence of a cause likely to produce the defect, is not sufficient.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carl </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>93 Conn. 622, 628, 107 A. 502 (1919). Similarly, \u201cthe predictability of a future defect does not provide the requisite notice to establish municipal liability under \u00a7 13a-149.\u201d <em>Prato </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>246 Conn. 638, 644, 717 A.2d 1216 (1998). Rather, \u201cto charge a defendant with constructive notice it is incumbent on the plaintiff to establish that the defect had been there a sufficient length of time and was of such a dangerous character that the defendant by the exercise of reasonable care could and should have discovered and remedied it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tirendi </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>128 Conn. 464, 468, 23 A.2d 919 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Although municipal liability under \u00a7 13a-149 arises from the breach of a statutory duty; <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 212; negligence principles are relevant to the municipal highway defect statute. <em>Prato </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 645. A prerequisite to the application of those principles is the existence of an actual defect. As our Supreme Court has explained: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>\u201cBefore one can rely upon the principles of reasonableness and ordinary care to infer notice of a defect under \u00a7 13a-149, the claimed highway defect must actually exist. Municipalities are not liable under \u00a7 13a-149 for failure to inspect and discover a potential defect, or a defect that might arise at some future time. . . . [T]he reasonable duty to inspect and discover defects does not arise until there is an actual defect in the highway.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 646. Because the defendant does not contest the court\u2019s finding that the grate on which the plaintiff tripped was defective, the court properly could rely on principles of negligence to infer notice of that defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Under principles of negligence, \u201cmunicipalities must use reasonable care in discovering the existence of a defect, and negligent ignorance of a defect may support a finding that the municipality should have discovered the defect.\u201d Id., 645. What constitutes reasonable care in that context is a fact specific inquiry. As the Supreme Court has observed: \u201cWhat the law requires of [municipalities], and all that it requires, is the exercise of such efforts and the employment of such measures\u2014 directed to the end that their streets and walks be maintained in a reasonably safe condition, all the circumstances of the situation considered\u2014as, in view of the circumstances and conditions, are in themselves reasonable. The circumstances to be taken into account, and the considerations to be weighed, in determining what is reasonable to be done, and what is a reasonable condition to be sought after and attained, if reasonably attainable, are many. . . . [Our courts] have realized, and frequently expressed, the impossibility of framing one of universal application in other than general language which is elastic in that it embodies the qualification of reasonableness under all the circumstances at every turn of the definition. The accepted general rule looks constantly to the ever changing circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>situations, and its key-note throughout is reasonableness in view of the circumstances as they appear upon each occasion.\u201d <em>Carl </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, supra, 93 Conn. 625-26. For that reason, \u201cthe circumstances of each case must be examined.\u201d <em>Prato </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 646. On the particular circumstances presented in this case, we agree with the court that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care over its sidewalks.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Although the defendant does not dispute that a defect existed, the mere existence of a defect does not establish liability under \u00a7 13a-149. <em>Langton </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>38 Conn. App. 14, 19, 658 A.2d 602 (1995). It must also be demonstrated that the \u201cdefect had been there a sufficient length of time and was of such a dangerous character that the defendant by the exercise of reasonable care could and should have discovered and remedied it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tirendi </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 128 Conn. 468. In its memorandum of decision, the court did not find that the grate\u2019s defective condition was a recent development. Rather, the court specifically found that the grate had risen \u201cover time . . . .\u201d That finding is supported by the testimony of Christy Dlugolenski, the deputy director of parks and squares for the defendant, who testified that, as trees grow, the metal grates surrounding them are prone to rising. Dlugolenski testified that such a defect \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d but, rather, occurs \u201cover a moderate period of time.\u201d In addition, our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[i]nferences as to prior existence [of a highway defect] for a considerable time, which might arise from a condition necessarily more or less permanent or of slow development\u201d are permitted in certain circumstances. <em>Burlant </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>111 Conn. 36, 37, 149 A. 132 (1930); see also <em>Linn </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>135 Conn. 469, 471-72, 66 A.2d 115 (1949). Given Dlugolenski\u2019s testimony regarding the slow development of the defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>at issue, the court reasonably could have inferred that the defect existed for a period of time sufficient for the defendant to have had constructive notice thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Furthermore, to the extent that the defendant now complains that the court\u2019s finding lacked clarity, it was incumbent on the defendant, as the appellant, to seek articulation of that factual determination. Under our rules of practice, it is the sole responsibility of the appellant to provide this court with an adequate record for review. Practice Book \u00a7 61-10. Practice Book \u00a7 66-5 permits an appellant to seek an articulation by the trial court of the factual and legal basis on which it rendered its decision. \u201c[A]n articulation is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification. ... An articulation may be necessary where the trial court fails completely to state any basis for its decision ... or where the basis, although stated, is unclear. . . . The purpose of an articulation is to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fantasia </em>v. <em>Milford Fastening Systems, </em>86 Conn. App. 270, 283, 860 A.2d 779 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 919, 866 A2d 1286 (2005). \u201c[W]e will, in the absence of a motion for articulation, assume that the trial court acted properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Berglass </em>v. <em>Berglass, </em>71 Conn. App. 771, 789, 804 A.2d 889 (2002). The defendant did not request an articulation in the present case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Our Supreme Court has also instructed that \u201c[t]he nature of the defect is an important consideration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>determining whether a municipality is chargeable with constructive notice of it.\u201d <em>Tirendi </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 128 Conn. 468; see also <em>Prato </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 646-46 (duly to make reasonable inspection depends in part on nature of defect). The trial court found, and the defendant does not dispute, that the grate at issue (1) occupied \u201capproximately 50 percent of the sidewalk\u2019s width, thereby significantly reducing the walking area\u201d for pedestrian travel, (2) occupied a \u201cdowntown location . . . where heavy pedestrian traffic would be expected\u201d and (3) \u201cover time has risen, creating a tripping hazard to persons walking on [the] sidewalk.\u201d Those determinations find support in the testimony of Dlugolenski and the plaintiff, as well as multiple photographs of the defective grate that were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Returning our attention to the question of reasonable care in discovering the defect, we note that \u201c[t]he test is not whether a defect would have been disclosed by an examination of the particular street, but rather whether it would have been disclosed by a reasonable supervision of the streets of the city as a whole.\u201d <em>Meallady </em>v. <em>New London, </em>116 Conn. 205, 209, 164 A. 391 (1933); see also <em>Tirendi </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 128 Conn. 468. At the same time, a municipality is required to exercise a greater degree of care over its sidewalks than other traveled ways. <em>Meallady </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 209; <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>105 Conn. 447, 452, 135 A. 535 (1927); <em>Frechette v. New Haven, </em>supra, 104 Conn. 87 (municipality\u2019s duty \u201cis to maintain its streets in a reasonably safe condition for travelers thereon; the care required obviously being greater over the sidewalk than over the traveled way\u201d). Thus, the defendant\u2019s reasonable care in the present case is measured not by its supervision of the particular sidewalk on which the plaintiff fell, but by the supervision of the defendant\u2019s sidewalks as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>It is axiomatic that \u201c[t]he credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony is for the trier.\u201d <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 208; <em>Fukelman </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>4 Conn. App. 30, 31, 492 A.2d 214 (1985). As such, the court, as trier of fact, was \u201cfree to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony offered by either party. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Chan, </em>110 Conn. App. 511, 530, 955 A.2d 667 (2008). In its memorandum of decision, the court emphasized that Dlugolenski had testified that \u201cshe and the department were aware that these grates were purposely placed around young, neatly placed trees to aid water absorption into the soil to reach the roots of the trees, and she testified further that her department was aware of the fact that, as these trees grew and their root systems expanded, the pressure of the roots would cause the grates to rise above the sidewalk surface. She testified further that she knew that these grates could constitute a tripping hazard for persons walking on sidewalks.\u201d Dlugolenski also testified that the condition of the grate at issue was such that \u201c[i]t would have been put on a list to be ameliorated\u201d had the defendant detected it. She further testified that her department had \u201cmoved away from tree grates as a way to circle trees because of the fact that the trees grow into them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In addition, Dlugolenski testified that no maintenance, inspection or repair records regarding the sidewalks existed. By contrast, in <em>Burlant </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 111 Conn. 38, a case in which the court concluded that constructive notice did not exist, \u201c[t]he evidence disclosed numerous sidewalk inspections on [the street on which the plaintiff fell] in 1927, and on January 5th and 18th and February 2d and 11th, 1928. The inspectors were instructed to report any variations of more than three fourths of an inch out of level in flagstone walks and orders were given to relay them. Several such orders were issued on February 25th as to sidewalks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>on [the street on which the plaintiff fell] in the vicinity of the premises in question.\u201d Dlugolenski also testified that at the time of the accident in 2004, she was \u201cunderstaffed.\u201d As a result, Dlugolenski acknowledged that she was without adequate staff to maintain inspection reports or reports of work orders. Dlugolenski\u2019s testimony further supports the court\u2019s finding that \u201cno inspections were scheduled prior to the plaintiff\u2019s fall or after her fall . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On the particular facts and circumstances presented in this record, we conclude that the court properly determined that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care over its sidewalks. Accordingly, we cannot say that the court\u2019s finding of constructive notice was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The defendant next disputes the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Like the prior claim, the contention is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 207-208.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">To recover under \u00a7 13a-149, a plaintiff must prove, inter alia, that the defect was the sole proximate cause of her injuries. See id., 207; <em>McGloin </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>15 Conn. App. 668, 675, 546 A.2d 906, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 813, 550 A.2d 1083 (1988). Our Supreme Court first identified sole proximate cause as the standard for determining municipal liability in <em>Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>71 Conn. 686, 690, 43 A. 143 (1899), stating: \u201cIt is the statute only, which entitles the plaintiff to compensation for his injury when that injury is caused through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>or by means of a defect in the highway. If the negligence of himself or of a third person is also a proximate cause, he cannot say with truth that he was injured by the defect; he can only say with truth that he was injured by his own or another\u2019s carelessness and the defect, and the two combined give no cause of action under the statute.\u201d The Supreme Court since has rebuffed attempts to abandon the sole proximate cause standard. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 336, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990); see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>258 Conn. 56, 61-65, 779 A.2d 104 (2001) (discussing development of proximate cause standard in highway defect cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Because a plaintiff seeking recovery under \u00a7 13a-149 must prove that the defect was the sole proximate cause of her injuries, it follows that the plaintiff must demonstrate freedom from contributory negligence. <em>Szachon </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>29 Conn. App. 791, 798, 618 A.2d 74 (1992); <em>McGloin </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 675 (no presumption under \u00a7 13a-149 that plaintiff exercising due care at time of injury); <em>Janow </em>v. <em>Ansonia, </em>11 Conn. App. 1, 3, 525 A.2d 966 (1987). To do so, a plaintiff must have suffered injury while using the defective highway \u201cwith due care and skill.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>supra, 71 Conn. 695. In her complaint, the plaintiff alleged not only that the grate was defective, but also that she was in the exercise of due care at the time of her injury. In its answer, the defendant did not deny that allegation; it averred that it lacked sufficient knowledge on which to form a belief and thus left to the plaintiff her burden of proof. The defendant did not allege, as a special defense, that the plaintiffs injuries were proximately caused by her negligence. Cf. <em>Janow </em>v. <em>Ansonia, </em>supra, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In her closing argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201c[The location of the plaintiffs fall] is an area that\u2019s delineated ... by granite blocks, and there\u2019s a grate there. Now, the plaintiff said she didn\u2019t see the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>grate before she walked on it. It\u2019s . . . clearly a different color, and there is a perfectly good section of sidewalk for her to walk on. She . . . chose not to look, and I don\u2019t think you need to be looking down to see that grate; I think the reasonably prudent person is looking ahead, sees a tree. There\u2019s issues with trees; there are roots. This one happened to have a grate. And when a tree is growing in a sidewalk . . . there is the issue that if she was using her . . . faculties in the appropriate way, she would have reasoned that she couldn\u2019t walk in this particular area if she had looked. So, the law is, if she\u2019s any percent negligent, then she doesn\u2019t recover . . . .\u201d In its memorandum of decision, the court rejected that claim, expressly declining to attribute any contributory negligence to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">That determination finds support in the record before us. At trial, the plaintiff testified as to the events of the morning of March 1, 2004, and the manner in which she conducted herself as she walked on Orange Street. As sole arbiter of credibility, the court was free to credit that testimony and find that the plaintiff exercised due care. See <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, supra, 184 Conn. 208; <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Chan, </em>supra, 110 Conn. App. 530. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s finding of no contributory negligence was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\"> Although the plaintiff alleges that the claim was not preserved, the transcript of the April 2, 2008 proceeding indicates that the defendant\u2019s counsel argued that to impose liability, the court must find \u201ceither actual or constructive knowledge\u201d of the \u201cactual defect,\u201d rather than mere notice of conditions likely to create such defects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> We do not suggest that the defendant bears the burden of proof in the present case; that burden belonged to the plaintiff. At the same time, when a party pursues a given claim on appeal, it is responsible for providing this court with an adequate record for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> The plaintiff again alleges that the claim was not preserved. To the contrary, the defendant\u2019s counsel at the April 2, 2008 proceeding argued that a prerequisite to recovery under \u00a7 13a-149 is the plaintiffs freedom from contributory negligence and suggested that the plaintiff did not exercise due care.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
