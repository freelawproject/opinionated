Although a prehearing notice need not predict the precise action to be taken by the commission, the notice must \u201cfairly and sufficiently [apprise] those who may be affected of the nature and character of the action proposed, so as to make possible intelligent preparation for participation in the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>if such action seems desirable.\u201d <em>Shrobar </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>158 Conn. 202, 207, 257 A.2d 806 (1969). The public notice in this case referred to only one of two special permits requested by the applicant and failed to identify the locations for which the unspecified permit was sought. The principal issue in this appeal is whether, as the trial court held, these shortcomings in the text of the published notice were cured by the commission\u2019s inclusion of a statement that the application was on file in the town planning office. Because we disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion, we reverse its judgment in favor of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On December 4, 2006, the plaintiffs, Frances Cassidy and Diane Cassidy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed an appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to challenge the decision of the defendant zoning commission of the town of Woodbury (commission) approving the application of the defendant The Roman Catholic Church of St. Teresa, Inc. (church), for a special permit to expand the church and to grant its concurrent request for a special exception for off-site parking. Without directly challenging the special permit for the expansion of the church,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiffs claimed that the commission\u2019s approval of the special exception for parking was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>improper for two reasons. They maintained that the commission had no jurisdiction to address the church\u2019s request for the special exception because the public notice filed by the commission did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 8-7d and that the commission\u2019s approval of the special exception was not authorized by \u00a7 7.4 of the Woodbury zoning regulations, which governs ol'f-site parking. The court rejected both claims. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The underlying facts are undisputed. On April 13, 2006, the church filed an application with the commission for a special permit, pursuant to \u00a7 5.1 of the Wood-bury zoning regulations, to expand its existing church building in Woodbury to accommodate a significant growth in the number of its parishioners. Pursuant to \u00a7 7.4<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Woodbury zoning regulations, the proposed expansion plan required the church to provide adequate parking for the additional parishioners who would attend the contemplated larger religious ceremonies. Accordingly, the church concurrently sought a special exception to permit it to use additional off-site parking spaces.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In support of the church\u2019s expansion efforts and its concomitant need for more parking spaces, and to provide the proper basis for a public hearing, the commission sought to comply with \u00a7 8-7d by publishing a legal notice in the Republican-American newspaper on June 16 and 23, 2006. The notice informed the public that the commission had scheduled a public hearing on June 27,2006, to consider \u201cApplication 06-ZC-6016 submitted by [the church] for an expansion of church in the Main Street Design District and Special Permit for property at 146 Main Street South. (Tax Assessor\u2019s Map 105/Lot 116). At this hearing interested persons may appear to be heard and written communication will be received. The application is on file in the Town Planning Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Several drawings were attached to the application filed in the town planning office. One drawing, denominated 20.01 and entitled \u201cSite Plan,\u201d quoted the full text of \u00a7 7.4.11.2 of the Woodbury zoning regulations,* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which governs eligibility for a special exception for alternate off-site parking and referenced a second document, drawing 20.02, \u201cfor parking breakdown.\u201d Drawing 20.02 also quoted the text of \u00a7 7.4.11.2 and, more importantly, identified each of the parking areas that the church proposed to use. The off-site parking lots shown in the overall parking plan included private and public parking areas that the church had had permission to use in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The commission held several public hearings with respect to the church\u2019s proposed expansion. The plaintiffs attended these hearings and presented evidence to document their concerns about the church\u2019s plan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Nonetheless, after extensive discussion of the relevant issues, including those relating to parking, on November 14, 2006, the commission approved both the special permit for expansion of the church and the special exception for off-site parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In their certified appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiffs have renewed the two claims of law that they pursued at trial. They claim that the commission improperly granted the church\u2019s request for a special exception for parking because (1) the public notice filed by the commission did not comply with \u00a7 8-7d and the commission therefore had no jurisdiction to consider the merits of the church\u2019s request for a special exception for off-site parking and (2) the commission misapplied the Woodbury zoning regulations in granting the church\u2019s request. Because we are persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional claim and must reverse the judgment of the trial court for that reason,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we need not address their second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The focal point of the plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional argument is their disagreement with the court\u2019s conclusion that the legal notice published by the commission complied with the requirements of \u00a7 8-7d because the notice advised readers that additional relevant information was available on file in the Woodbury planning office. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal takes issue with this conclusion for two reasons. The plaintiffs maintain, first, that the application filed by the church failed to establish a factual basis for the church\u2019s request for a special exception for off-site parking. More fundamentally, the plaintiffs maintain that the public notice published by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the commission did not comply with \u00a7 8-7d as a matter <em>of </em>law because the notice did not refer to the church\u2019s off-site parking. We disagree with their first argument but, under the circumstances of this case, agree with the second.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first claim asserts that the application filed by the church, by its own terms, did not support the commission\u2019s decision to grant the church a special exception for off-site parking. If that were true, it would necessarily follow that the commission would have had no jurisdiction to grant such a request. We are not persuaded of the premise posited by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">According to the plaintiffs, the church should either have filed a separate application for this special exception or expressly should have noted this request in the text of the application that it did file. The plaintiffs buttress their argument by noting that the commission\u2019s motion to schedule a public hearing on the church\u2019s application did not refer to the church\u2019s request for a special exception for off-site parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The court declined to hold that an applicant for a parking special exception was required to file an application separate and apart from an application on file to expand its premises. The court observed that nothing within the Woodbury zoning regulations supported the plaintiffs\u2019 contention. Although the plaintiffs have renewed their claim on appeal, they have not filled the evidentiary gap that the court identified. We can find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>no authority in General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (b) or \u00a7 7.4.11.2 of the Woodbury zoning regulations that sustains their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">We are equally unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 related argument that the application that the church filed did not sufficiently reference the special exception for off-site parking sought by the church. The plaintiffs have cited no authority, and we know of none, that categorically requires such information to be presented in the body of the application rather than in an attachment thereto. Although local zoning regulations may include such a requirement, the plaintiffs have not cited anything to that effect in the Woodbury zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 principal challenge to the court\u2019s adverse jurisdictional ruling renews their claim that the public notice published by the commission did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 8-7d. They maintain that the court\u2019s adverse ruling on this issue must be set aside because (1) the court employed an improper standard of review in its consideration of this argument of law and (2) the court improperly concluded that the published notice passed statutory muster because it advised the public that the church\u2019s application \u201cis on file in the Town Planning Office.\u201d We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 first argument in part and with their second argument in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We agree with the plaintiffs that, in the absence of a dispute about the underlying facts, they are entitled to plenary review of their challenge to the legal sufficiency of the prehearing notice. See <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 174-75. We recognize that, in its discussion of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the court initially misspoke by referring to the substantial evidence standard of review as governing the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>analysis of both of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In its subsequent discussion of the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument on the notice issue, however, the court undertook a plenary examination of the relevant principle of law rather than defer to the commission\u2019s action. Examining this record as a whole, we are persuaded that the court properly undertook a plenary review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the issue of statutory notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We turn then to an examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive disagreement with the court\u2019s ruling that the notice filed by the commission complied with \u00a7 8-7d. They maintain that the notice was insufficient as a matter of law because, on its face, it described only the church\u2019s special permit application to expand the church without referencing in any way the church\u2019s concurrent request for a special exception for additional off-site parking. According to the plaintiffs, the failure to provide notice of the request for additional parking is particularly telling because the notice did not identify six of the seven sites that the church hoped to use to meet its expanded parking needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The church cannot and does not dispute that the published notice, on its face, did not contain the information whose omission the plaintiffs decry. Similarly, the church cannot and does not dispute that, under the applicable Woodbury zoning regulations,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it could not prevail in its special request for expansion of its premises without obtaining a special exception for expansion of its off-site parking. On appeal before both this court and the trial court, the church has relied on the equally indisputable fact that the notice expressly alerted its readers that \u201cthe application is on file in the Town Planning Office.\u201d Because, as the court observed, this cross-reference advised members of the public \u201cwhere they can find more information regarding the plan,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>church maintains that the court properly concluded that the notice was sufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Our case law on the role of notice incorporated by reference in land use disputes is inconsistent. The church relies on <em>Shrobar </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>supra, 158 Conn. 202, in which our Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the zoning board had no jurisdiction to consider the defendants\u2019 application for a variance even though the public notice, on its face, referred to a requested permit to improve and to reconstruct a gasoline station while the applicants in fact proposed to replace the existing structure with a new and larger facility. Id., 207. The court held that \u201cnotice of a hearing is not required to contain an accurate forecast of the precise action sought which will be taken on the subject matter referred to in the notice. . . . Anyone interested in the precise action sought could have consulted a plot plan showing all the details of the proposed changes which the defendants had filed ... in the office of the zoning board.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 207-208. This court followed <em>Shrobar </em>in <em>R. B. Kent &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>21 Conn. App. 370, 378, 573 A.2d 760 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The plaintiffs, however, cite <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Board, </em>25 Conn. App. 164, 593 A.2d 975 (1991), in which this court rejected the argument that a published notice required by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was sufficient if it informed the public about the existence and the file number of a land use application that a member of the public could have inspected at city hall. The applicant in that case sought a permit to remove material in a wetland to facilitate the construction of a nursing home. The pertinent part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>published notice stated: \u201cThe Stamford Environmental Protection Board . . . will hold a public hearing to consider information relevant to Application # 8843. Transcon Builders, Inc.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Board, </em>supra, 167. Without citing either <em>Shrobar </em>or A. <em>B. Kent &amp; Son, Inc., </em>this court held in <em>Peters </em>that \u201c[t]he statute does not call for cumulative notice, nor does it ask that the general public employ the skills of a research librarian to determine where the subject property is located. The act of giving statutory notice is much too important to be done by way of informal, unofficial or chancy cross-referencing.\u201d Id., 169. Again without citing either <em>Shrobar </em>or <em>R. B. Kent &amp; Son, Inc., </em>this court followed <em>Peters </em>in <em>Lauver </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>60 Conn. App. 504, 508-10, 760 A.2d 513 (2000), in which we held that a geographical identification of an excavation site in a permit application on file did not validate a public notice that misstated the location of the site. This court rejected the argument that the notice was sufficient \u201cbecause the public knew about the application and could have gone to the commission\u2019s office to look at the map of the subject property.\u201d Id., 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">A recent case by our Supreme Court expressly endorses this court\u2019s reluctance to permit maps on file to cure deficiencies in statutorily required public notices. The issue in <em>Bridgeport v. Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>277 Conn. 268, 890 A.2d 540 (2006), was whether an applicant for a zone change had complied with General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (a), which requires that a copy \u201cof such proposed . . . boundary shall be filed in the office of the town . . . clerk . . . for public inspection at least ten days before [the hearing on the proposed zone change] . . . .\u201d The notice stated in relevant part: <em>\u201cParkAvenue/Easton Turnpike </em>Application of the [defendant] to amend the Zoning Map and Zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Districts by the establishment of a AAA Zone on land presently zoned R-3 and R-2. This property is approximately 320 acres in size and is known as Fairchild Wheeler Golf Course and is shown as parcel [no.] 1 on Tax Assessor\u2019s Map [no.] 24 and parcel [no.] 2 on the Tax Assessor\u2019s] Map [no.] 11.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 271. Without citing <em>Shrobar, </em>but quoting at length from <em>Lauver, </em>the court held the notice to be insufficient because its mere reference to a map on file in a place other than that designated in the statute \u201cdoes not constitute adequate notice of the boundaries of a property affected by a proposed zone change.\u201d Id., 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><em>Bridgeport </em>is arguably distinguishable from the case before us because it addresses the notice required for a proposed zone change under \u00a7 8-3 (a) rather than the prehearing notice requirements of \u00a7 8-7d (a). At the very least, however, the holding in <em>Bridgeport </em>suggests that our Supreme Court no longer assigns dispositive significance to access to official records as a supplement to the information provided by the text of published notices. Indeed, courts in other states have exhibited the same reluctance. See, <em>e.g., Bedford Residents Group </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>130 N.H. 632, 636-37, 547 A.2d 225 (1988); <em>Golden Gate Corp. </em>v. <em>Narragansett, </em>116 R.I. 552, 556-57, 359 A.2d 321 (1976), citing <em>Federal Building &amp; Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Jamestown, </em>112 R.I. 478, 486, 312 A.2d 586 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In <em>Bridgeport, </em>the court determined that the notice the defendant was required to file at the town clerk\u2019s office was insufficient because it incorporated by reference maps on file in the tax assessor\u2019s office, thereby requiring interested parties to look beyond the contents of the notice to determine the boundaries of the proposed zoning change. Although <em>Bridgeport </em>did not consider whether the prehearing notice published pursuant to \u00a7 8-7d (a) was sufficient, it stands for the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>proposition that notice will be insufficient if it requires members of the public to conduct additional research simply to determine whether they will be affected by proposed zoning actions. In both <em>Bridgeport </em>and the present case, individuals with an interest in proposed zoning actions would not have received sufficient notice that their interests were affected without taking an additional step that the court has characterized as improperly requiring the general public to \u201cemploy the skills of a research librarian ... by way of informal, unofficial or chancy cross-referencing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><em>Bridgeport </em>may, however, be reconciled with <em>Shrobar </em>by limiting Shrobar's holding to cases in which the information provided in the public notice, while incomplete, can reasonably be held to have informed the reader about the major contours of the project at issue. In <em>Shrobar, </em>the published notice informed the public that the application contemplated the improvement and reconstruction of a gasoline station at a designated site, while the document on file sought authorization to replace and to enlarge the existing structure <em>at the same site. </em>Thus, in <em>Shrobar, </em>the published notice sufficiently informed the public of the site of the changes so that anyone with an interest in that location would have been prompted to check the application to gauge the scope and character of the proposed changes. In the present case, by contrast, the published notice addressed only the plans for enlarging the church without referencing the church\u2019s request for access to additional parking at sites <em>other </em>than that occupied by the church building. Unlike the neighboring landowners in <em>Shrobar, </em>those potentially impacted by the church\u2019s proposed off-site parking in the present case were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>prompted by the published notice to examine the filed application to determine which interests were at stake in the public hearing. Indeed, the notice omitted all of the off-site locations for which the church was seeking the parking special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Because an important function of the notice requirement is to alert those who may be affected by a proposed change in land use; see, e.g., <em>Roncari Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>281 Conn. 66, 73-74, 912 A.2d 1008 (2007); <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 276; we agree with the plaintiffs that, in this case, the absence of published notice of the proposed locations of the additional off-site parking contemplated by the church made the notice published by the commission insufficient as a matter of law. Like our Supreme Court in <em>Bridgeport, </em>we are persuaded that such serious deficiencies in a public notice cannot be cured by a reference to a map on file in a public office that potentially affected parties must consult to determine whether they are indeed affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">It follows from our conclusion that the notice filed by the commission failed to comply with \u00a7 8-7d, and the commission, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to address the merits of the church\u2019s requests to expand its building and to increase its use of off-site parking. Accordingly, we need not address the plaintiffs\u2019 further argument that the commission misapplied the Wood-bury zoning regulations in granting the church the permits that it sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNotice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in such municipality where the land that is the subject of the hearing is located . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe zoning commission ... of any municipality shall hold a public hearing on an application or request for a special permit or special exception ....
