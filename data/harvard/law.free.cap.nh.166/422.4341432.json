Hampers (husband) and Kristin C. Hampers (wife) challenge a post-divorce decision of the 5th Circuit Court \u2014 Claremont Family Division <em>(Yazinski, </em>J.) on the husband\u2019s motion to modify his child support and alimony obligations and on the wife\u2019s petition for contempt. The husband asserts that the trial court erred by: (1) applying a standing order requiring him to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the wife for any proceeding or matter related to the divorce decree and subsequent amendments; and (2) failing to calculate \u201cgross income\u201d for child support purposes under RSA chapter 458-C by using \u201cnet\u201d figures for investment income to account for losses and expenses as well as gains. The wife asserts that the trial court erred by: (1) calculating child support based upon the husband\u2019s 2009 income and tax return when his 2010 income information and tax return were available; and (2) ordering her to repay sums that she had received in excess child support. We affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\n<em>I. Attorney\u2019s Fees Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">The husband contends that the standing attorney\u2019s fees order should be vacated because, among other things, it violates his rights to equal protection and due process under the State and Federal Constitutions. <em>See </em>U.S. CONST, amends. Y, XIV; N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 14. The wife responds that the husband has challenged the same attorney\u2019s fees order on two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>prior occasions before this court, and, therefore, this challenge is barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel. The husband counters that these preclusive doctrines are inapplicable because the court has never issued a final decision on the merits as to the constitutionality of the attorney\u2019s fees award, because the same cause of action is not at issue in this case, and because the trial court maintains jurisdiction to review ongoing child support, custody, and alimony issues. We agree with the wife that res judicata bars this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Evaluation of the parties\u2019 procedural arguments requires an analysis of our previous rulings on the attorney\u2019s fees award. In the parties\u2019 2004 divorce decree, the trial court ordered the husband to pay all of the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the case and in any appeal from its ruling. <em>In the Matter of Hampers &amp; Hampers, </em>154 N.H. 275, 289 (2006) <em>(Hampers T). </em>The court further ordered the husband to pay all of the wife\u2019s \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees for any proceeding or any other matter relating to any term of this decree and any amendment thereto or to the child in this matter in the future\u201d within thirty days of the husband\u2019s receipt of the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee statement. <em>Id. </em>(brackets, ellipsis, and quotation omitted). The court found that it would not be equitable for the wife to pay fees and costs, <em>id., </em>and that it was necessary to require the husband to pay the wife\u2019s future attorney\u2019s fees to \u201cprevent abuse of this justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We left undisturbed the attorney\u2019s fees that the wife had already incurred and the husband had already paid. <em>Id. </em>at 290-91. However, we vacated the award of attorney\u2019s fees that the wife had incurred, but the husband had not yet paid, and remanded to the trial court to determine the reasonableness of those fees pursuant to the procedure we set out in <em>Gosselin v. Gosselin, </em>136 N.H. 350, 353-54 (1992). <em>Id. </em>at 291. We further held that the <em>Gosselin </em>procedure would apply to any attorney\u2019s fees the wife incurred in the future. <em>Id. </em>We declined to address the husband\u2019s constitutional arguments because he did not demonstrate that he had preserved them for our review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In 2007, the husband again challenged the attorney\u2019s fees award. In an unpublished order, we vacated the trial court\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees award \u201c[t]o the extent that the trial court awarded fees to the [wife], which were incurred between December 2004 and September 2006, without first subjecting these fees to a <em>Gosselin </em>review.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Hampers and Hampers, </em>No. 2007-519 (N.H. Jan. 24, 2008). We explained that \u201cfees incurred after the date of the final divorce decree could not have been part of the property settlement,\u201d and, therefore, were required to be reviewed under <em>Gosselin </em>\u2014 including those incurred in connection with the defense of the original case and appeal. <em>Id. </em>However, we rejected the husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>argument that the trial court erred by, in effect, awarding the wife appellate attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>We explained, first, that such an award is permissible, <em>see Salito v. Salito, </em>107 N.H. 77, 78 (1966), and, second, that \u201cwe [had] already impliedly upheld the trial court\u2019s inherent authority to award such fees in the instant case.\u201d <em>Hampers, </em>No. 2007-519 (N.H. Jan. 24, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The applicability of res judicata presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Sleeper v. Hoban Family P\u2019ship, </em>157 N.H. 580, 583 (2008). \u201cThe doctrine of res judicata prevents parties from relitigating matters actually litigated and matters that <em>could have </em>been litigated in the first action.\u201d <em>Gray v. Kelly, </em>161 N.H. 160, 164 (2010) (quotation omitted). The doctrine \u201capplies if three elements are met: (1) the parties are the same or in privity with one another; (2) the same cause of action was before the court in both instances; and (3) the first action ended with a final judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The husband contests both the second and third elements, arguing as to the latter that our decision based upon his failure to preserve constitutional arguments for vacating the attorney\u2019s fees award does not constitute a decision on the merits. We are not persuaded, since even a default judgment can \u201cconstitute res judicata with respect to a subsequent litigation involving the same cause of action.\u201d <em>McNair v. McNair, </em>151 N.H. 343, 353 (2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe essence of the doctrine of res judicata is that a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive upon the parties in a subsequent litigation involving the same cause of action,\u201d <em>Brzica v. Trustees of Dartmouth College, </em>147 N.H. 443, 454 (2002) (quotation omitted), \u201ceven though the plaintiff is prepared in the second action to present evidence or grounds or theories of the case not presented in the first action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455-56. Because we consider our decision in <em>Hampers I </em>to constitute a final decision on the merits for the purposes of res judicata analysis, we must determine only whether the petition to modify at issue here involves the same cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018cause of action\u2019 means the right to recover and refers to all theories on which relief could be claimed arising out of the same factual transaction in question.\u201d <em>Radkay v. Confalone, </em>133 N.H. 294, 297 (1990). \u201cGenerally, once a party has exercised the right to recover based upon a particular factual transaction, that party is barred from seeking further recovery, even though the type of remedy or theory of relief may be different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298; <em>see also Shepherd v. Town of Westmoreland, </em>130 N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>542, 544 (1988) (finding barred plaintiffs constitutional and inverse condemnation claims that arose out of the same factual transaction as did her previous claim for a variance).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The husband argues that the divorce proceeding and the present petition to modify are not the same \u201ccause of action\u201d because \u201ca cause of action is the underlying right that is preserved by bringing a suit or action\u201d (quotation omitted), and the underlying right at issue in the divorce proceeding was the bundle of issues connected with the dissolution of a marriage requiring equitable review. The underlying right now at issue, he contends, is his statutory ability to modify his child support payments under RSA 458-C:7 (Supp. 2013). He maintains that the attorney\u2019s fees award was ancillary to each of these rights, and, therefore, his claim is not barred. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In our 2006 opinion on the divorce proceeding, we upheld the enforceability of the standing attorney\u2019s fees order, including the portion of the order awarding the wife her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for \u201cany proceeding or any other matter relating to any term of this decree and any amendment thereto or to [the child] in this matter in the future.\u201d <em>See Hampers I, </em>154 N.H. at 289-91. The husband\u2019s current arguments that the standing attorney\u2019s fees order is unconstitutional and contrary to law are therefore barred by that determination. <em>See Brzica, </em>147 N.H. at 455 (\u201c \u2018Cause of action\u2019 has a broad transaction definition in the res judicata context, including the right to recover regardless of the theory of recovery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Although attorney\u2019s fees may be an ancillary issue, <em>see, e.g., Vinson v. Ass\u2019n of Apartment Owners, </em>312 P.3d 1247, 1253 (Haw. Ct. App. 2013), in <em>Hampers I, </em>it was one of the bases upon which the husband challenged the trial court\u2019s order. <em>Hampers </em>I, 154 N.H. at 289-91. Because \u201c[t]he essence of the doctrine of res judicata is that a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive upon the parties in a subsequent litigation involving the same cause of action,\u201d <em>Brzica, </em>147 N.H. at 454 (quotation omitted), and because we reached a final judgment specifically addressing the propriety of the same attorney\u2019s fees order at issue here, the husband has not demonstrated that his petition to modify constitutes a different \u201ccause of action\u201d such that our earlier judgment on the standing attorney\u2019s fees order lacks preclusive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The husband next argues that res judicata does not apply to attorney\u2019s fees awards when the trial court maintains jurisdiction to review ongoing child support, custody, and alimony issues. He distinguishes \u201cordinary\u201d divorce-related attorney\u2019s fees awards, which address the attorney\u2019s fees incurred during the initial divorce action, from the award here, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>provides that the husband will continue to pay the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees \u201cfor any proceeding or any other matter relating to any term of this decree and any amendment thereto or to [the child] in this matter in the future.\u201d <em>See Hampers </em>I, 154 N.H. at 289. He cites <em>Appeal of Carnahan, </em>a workers\u2019 compensation case, for the proposition that when a body exercises continuing jurisdiction over a matter, res judicata will not apply to prevent that body from exercising its statutory power to correct a mistake of law. <em>Appeal of Carnahan, </em>160 N.H. 73, 77-78 (2010). That proposition does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Although the modifiability of an order may affect the applicability of res judicata, <em>see </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS \u00a7 13 comment c at 133-34, \u00a7 73, at 197-200 (1982), here, unlike in <em>Appeal of Carnahan, </em>160 N.H. at 77, the standing order on attorney\u2019s fees was not part of the judgment subject to modification pursuant to statute. The statutory provisions the husband cites, RSA 458-C:2 (2004), :7, refer to the court\u2019s authority to modify child support orders, not orders on attorney\u2019s fees included in a divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We recognize that the Restatement (Second) of Judgments provides that \u201c[jjudgments that govern continuing or recurring courses of conduct may be subject to modification even though the power of doing so is not expressly provided.\u201d RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 73 comment <em>b </em>at 198. However, \u201cthe principal factor in whether a judgment is subject to modification is whether it contemplates an interaction between the activity of the judgment obligor and some other conditions over which the judgment does not exercise control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. Thus, when an \u201cunforeseen or uncontrollable interaction occurs between the judgment obligor and the surrounding circumstances, the balance between burden and benefit can be disturbed,\u201d and if such disturbance \u201cassumes substantial proportion, redress by modification may be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The husband, however, does not argue that changed circumstances warrant modifying the standing attorney\u2019s fees order. Rather, he contends that the standing attorney\u2019s fees order is based upon an error of law. Thus, the husband alleges no reason why the \u201cbalance between burden and benefit\u201d should be disturbed, and has failed to demonstrate that \u201credress by modification\u201d is warranted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\n<em>II. Investment Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">On the issue of child support, the parties\u2019 2004 divorce decree, which deviated from the child support guidelines, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>For purposes of calculating child support under the guidelines, [the husband\u2019s] income shall consist of his employment income plus one-half of all interest, taxable or tax-exempt, dividends, capital gains, or other income to which he is legally entitled whether he chooses to actually receive it annually as reported on this tax return. The court makes this deviation from the requirements of RSA 458-C:2, IV.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On appeal from the divorce decree, the husband did not challenge this definition of income for child support purposes, but rather the trial court\u2019s alleged failure to apply it properly. <em>See Hampers I, </em>154 N.H. at 283. Because we agreed that the record did not support the figure the trial court had used for his monthly gross income, we vacated the order and remanded. <em>Id. </em>at 277, 283. The subsequent procedural challenges to that recalculation are not before us in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">This appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling on the husband\u2019s March 5, 2010 motion to modify the child support order. <em>See </em>RSA 458-C:7, 1(a) (permitting either party to move for \u201cmodification of such order 3 years after the entry of the last order for support, without the need to show a substantial change of circumstances\u201d). The parties agreed to the amount of the husband\u2019s earned income for child support purposes, but disagreed as to how to calculate his \u201csubstantial unearned income from investments in partnerships and capital gains.\u201d Each party presented an expert witness to testify as to calculation of the husband\u2019s \u201cpresent income.\u201d The husband\u2019s expert, Richard J. Maloney, CPA, testified that capital losses of more than $3,000 in excess of capital gains should be carried forward to offset capital gains in subsequent years, in order to fully recognize the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d of the capital loss. He also testified that only the net income from the husband\u2019s investments in partnerships should be attributable to present income for the purposes of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The wife\u2019s expert, Dennis R. Stone, CPA, testified that a capital loss in excess of a capital gain should not affect gross income for child support purposes because it represents a loss of principal, not a reduction of income available for child support purposes. He contended that the practice of carrying forward capital losses to offset unrelated capital gains was tantamount to averaging income over time. As for partnership investment expenses, Stone explained that they are reported on the partner\u2019s personal tax return as itemized deductions, \u201c[n]ot as a reduction of the [partnership] income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The trial court agreed with the wife\u2019s expert. It noted that federal tax law is inapplicable to calculations of child support under New Hampshire law, and that RSA 458-C:2 \u201cincludes a definition of gross income and contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the word net only in reference to rental income,\u201d indicating the legislature\u2019s familiarity with the terms \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cnet\u201d and suggesting its intent to limit \u201cnet\u201d to rental income. Recognizing that its ruling would result in a large child support figure under the guidelines, the trial court explained that \u201cthe legislature provided an avenue to address the [husband\u2019s] concern by providing the Court with discretion to lower any child support award it deems confiscatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">On appeal, the husband argues that the trial court erred by refusing to allow him to carry over capital losses in excess of capital gains to offset future years\u2019 capital gains, and by declining to deduct the partnerships\u2019 expenses from the revenues of the partnership investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Trial courts have broad discretion in reviewing and modifying child support orders. <em>In the Matter of Jerome &amp; Jerome, </em>150 N.H. 626, 628 (2004). However, whether capital losses may be carried over to offset future years\u2019 capital gains in calculating \u201cinvestment income,\u201d and whether the trial court should have included the husband\u2019s partnership expenses as part of his gross income as defined under RSA 458-C:2, IV, are questions of statutory interpretation, and, thus, are questions of law, which we review <em>de novo. See In the Matter of Albert &amp; McRae, </em>155 N.H. 259, 262 (2007). We are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>In the Matter of Plaisted &amp; Plaisted, </em>149 N.H. 522, 523 (2003). We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written, and we will not consider what the legislature might have said or add words that the legislature did not include. <em>Id. </em>at 524. We interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> For purposes of calculating a parent\u2019s child support obligation, RSA 458-C:2, IV defines gross income as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">all income from any source, whether earned or unearned, including, but not limited to, wages, salary, commissions, tips, annuities, social security benefits, trust income, lottery or gambling winnings, interest, dividends, <em>investment income, </em>net rental income, self-employment income, alimony, <em>business profits, </em>pensions, bonuses, and payments from other government programs . . . including, but not limited to, workers\u2019 compensation, veterans\u2019 benefits, unemployment benefits, and disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">(Emphases added.). Although trial courts have discretion to adjust a child support award based upon special circumstances, see RSA 458-C-.4, II (2004), the legislative scheme requires that all items includable as \u201cgross income\u201d be considered to determine the parties\u2019 support obligation. <em>In the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Matter of State &amp; Taylor, </em>153 N.H. 700, 703 (2006); <em>see also In the Matter of Feddersen &amp; Cannon, </em>149 N.H. 194, 197 (2003). The parties characterize both questions before us as relating to the definition of \u201cinvestment income.\u201d Contrary to the wife\u2019s assertion that we implicitly answered these questions in <em>Albert, </em>155 N.H. at 263, the meaning of \u201cinvestment income\u201d for child support purposes under RSA 458-C:2 is an issue of first impression for this court. We note at the outset that \u201cincome tax returns are an unreliable guide to the income available for child support purposes,\u201d <em>Albert, </em>155 N.H. at 264, and we have interpreted the statute so that the concept of gross income encompasses the money available to the obligor parent for paying child support. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\n<em>A. Capital Losses in Excess of Capital Gains</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The husband argues that the trial court erred by allowing capital losses to offset gains only to the extent of the capital gains for any given year. He contends that this ruling: (1) is internally inconsistent because it recognizes losses only up to the point of the gain, but no further; (2) conflicts with persuasive authority recognizing the effect of capital losses; and (3) is against sound public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">None of the husband\u2019s arguments is persuasive as to the issue at hand: <em>i.e., </em>the treatment, for child support purposes, of capital losses that exceed capital gains within a given year. Maloney testified to three potential ways to address capital losses in excess of capital gains: (1) to follow the method consistent with federal tax law, pursuant to which a portion of the excess loss ($3,000) is deducted from other income, and the remainder of the loss is carried over to offset capital gains (and up to $3,000 of other income) in future years; (2) to deduct the entire capital loss from gross income in the year in which the loss was incurred; or (3) to \u201cignore the economic reality of the loss\u201d by deducting capital losses only up to the point of capital gains. Another option, which neither party addresses, is to treat capital gains as income and not to account for capital losses when calculating gross income. The husband argues in favor of option (1), and claims that option (3), which he characterizes as the approach that Stone supported and the trial court ordered, is not \u201crational\u201d because it does not accurately reflect the income available for child support purposes. We disagree and discuss each option in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We first conclude that \u201cinvestment income\u201d for child support purposes should not be defined as consistent with the federal taxation approach of carrying over to future years capital losses which exceed capital gains. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(b) (2012). \u201c[H]ow federal income taxation statutes define \u2018income\u2019 is of little relevance to our interpretation of gross income under the child support guidelines.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>153 N.H: at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>704; <em>see Albert, </em>155 N.H. at 263. \u201cThis is so because the objectives of the child support guidelines differ from the objectives of the federal income taxation statutes.\u201d <em>Albert, </em>155 N.H. at 263 (quotation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). \u201cThe objectives of the child support guidelines are to reduce the economic consequences of divorce on children and ensure that children enjoy a standard of living equal to that of the noncustodial parent\u2019s subsequent family.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>153 N.H. at 703; <em>see </em>RSA 458-C:l, II (2004); <em>see also In the Matter of Dolan and Dolan, </em>147 N.H. 218, 221-22 (2001). Allowing losses to carry over would violate the purposes of the child support guidelines because it would artificially decrease income in the years subsequent to the capital sale, even though the income available for child support in those subsequent years would not have decreased.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u201cThe child support guidelines set forth in RSA chapter 458-C mandate that an obligor\u2019s entire income be considered.\u201d <em>Jerome, </em>150 N.H. at 633 (quotation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[o]ur case law is clear that trial courts should not employ income-averaging over a number of years to determine child support obligations.\u201d <em>Rattee v. Rattee, </em>146 N.H. 44, 46 (2001). Instead, \u201cchild support should be determined on the basis of present income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As Stone testified, allowing a carry-over of capital losses is a form of income averaging because it nets \u201closses from prior periods that have nothing to do with the gains that were realized in the current period\u201d against one another. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly rejected the loss carry-over option to calculate investment income.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We likewise conclude that \u201cinvestment income\u201d for child support purposes should not be defined to permit deducting an excess capital loss from other categories of gross income in the year it is incurred. Under that option, capital losses could exceed income generated from other sources, leaving a parent with \u201cnegative\u201d income, regardless of whether the parent has actual income available for child support. As the parties agree, that approach would be against the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Because neither party argues in' favor of the fourth option, we need not decide whether to adopt the construction under which capital gains constitute income without regard to capital losses. <em>See </em>L. Morgan, Child Support Guidelines: Interpretation and Application \u00a7 4.07[H] at 4-47 to 4-48 (2d ed. 2013) (analyzing different courts\u2019 approaches to capital gains as income for child support purposes); <em>cf. Abercrombie v. Abercrombie, </em>No. E2003-01226-COA-R3-CV, 2004 WL 626713, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 29, 2004) (declining to offset capital gain with capital losses).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Thus, we uphold the trial court\u2019s decision to give effect to capital losses only up to the amount of capital gains realized during the same year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>First, we note that neither party argues that capital losses should not offset capital gains in the year that both are incurred. Thus, we need not decide here whether that treatment is permitted under our statutory scheme. Second, we agree that the definition of \u201cinvestment income\u201d limits the deduction of capital losses, at most, to the extent of any capital gains within the same year. The child support guidelines turn on the obligor parent\u2019s <em>income </em>available for support, and not on the parent\u2019s net worth. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 458-C:3 (Supp. 2013) (establishing formula for calculation of child support based upon parents\u2019 incomes); <em>In the Matter of Woolsey &amp; Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. 301, 306 (2012) (\u201ccalculating a parent\u2019s ability to pay child support necessitates determining an actual ability to pay\u201d). Given the guidelines\u2019 focus upon the obligor\u2019s actual ability to pay and the amount available for child support purposes, it is reasonable to limit a deduction of capital losses to the extent of any capital gains in one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Accordingly, as between the two approaches advanced by the parties, because the purposes of RSA chapter 458-C are better served by limiting the offset for capital losses to the extent of capital gains in the same year, as the trial court did, we affirm that ruling. If the legislature wishes to clarify the treatment of capital losses, it is of course free to amend the statute as it sees fit. <em>See Evans v. J Four Realty, </em>164 N.H. 570, 576 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>B. Income From Investments in Partnerships</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The husband next argues that in determining his gross income, the trial court erroneously declined to deduct reasonable and necessary investment expenses from the revenues of his partnership investments. There is no dispute that his 2009 income included income from investments in eight partnerships. Maloney explained in his report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">[The husband] is a limited partner in eight limited partnerships. These partnerships generate a variety of types of income as well as expenses. Because these investments are partnerships, the specific category of income and expense is reported in different sections of the tax return rather than combined to determine the actual net income from a particular partnership. Solely because of the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the expenses related to the investment activity in the partnership are not netted against the income for reporting purposes. Rather, the items of income are reported in determining gross income but the expenses are reported as itemized deductions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">The partnerships must file an information return (Form 1065). On Schedule K-l of that return, the partnership separately identifies many items of income, deduction, capital gain, capital loss, credits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>etc., with the remaining activity being summarized as \u2018ordinary business income (loss)\u2019. Each partner reports these various items on his individual tax return. These items will be reported on separate schedules (Schedule A for expenses, Schedule B for Interest and Dividends, Schedule D for capital gains, Schedule E for ordinary business income or loss, etc.). In order to calculate the correct total income from a partnership, all these items must be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Stone disagreed that \u201cinvestment and portfolio expenses should be deducted\u201d from income, reasoning \u201cthat such amounts are correctly categorized as expenses and as such should not be accounted for as a reduction of total income for child support purposes.\u201d Noting that the statutory definition of gross income includes the word \u201cnet\u201d only as applied to rental income, the trial court accepted Stone\u2019s opinion \u201cas the appropriate standard to apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The husband argues that the business expenses of the partnerships were the natural, necessary, and ordinary cost of investing in such partnerships, and maintains that these expenses must be deducted annually from the gains realized from the partnerships to determine the correct amount of \u201cinvestment income.\u201d He explains that, like the Limited Liability Company (LLC) at issue in <em>Albert </em>or an S-corporation, the partnerships are \u201cpass through\u201d entities, requiring each investor to report the partnership\u2019s gains, losses, and expenses on his or her tax return. <em>See Albert, </em>155 N.H. at 263-64. Citing <em>Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 307, he argues that an obligor\u2019s support obligation should be measured by taking into account all of his income and deducting therefrom the losses incurred and expenses actually paid that were directly related to the production of that income. He asserts, however, that \u201cit would be irrational and untenable to determine precisely how every partnership expense related to the income produced by the partnership.\u201d He further notes his lack of decision-making authority over the partnerships, highlighting his inability to shield income, manipulate the amount of money he received in order to reduce his child support obligation, or use the business to defray his personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The wife counters that each source of income enumerated in RSA 458-C:2, IV, other than \u201cnet rental income,\u201d is intended to refer to that source in gross, citing <em>Albert, </em>155 N.H. at 263. She also argues that including all of the husband\u2019s \u201cinvestment income\u201d in his gross income is more consistent with the goal of the child support guidelines to ensure that their son will enjoy a standard of living commensurate with that of the husband. Finally, she argues that the partnerships\u2019 expenses are the result of a \u201cdiscretionary decision to employ a third party that charges manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ment fees,\u201d and constitute \u201ca personal expense incurred for management of an investment asset,\u201d rather than a business expense directly related to the production of income. We disagree with the wife\u2019s arguments on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">We first note that the statute\u2019s failure to refer to \u201cnet\u201d investment income is not dispositive. We rejected a similar argument in <em>Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 304-06. There, we considered the meaning of \u201cself-employment income,\u201d which the legislature also did not qualify by the term \u201cnet,\u201d and found \u201cimplicit in RSA 458-C:2, IV that the term \u2018self-employment income\u2019 means self-employment income net of legitimate business expenses incurred for the purpose of earning that income.\u201d <em>Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 306. We reasoned that it was \u201cimprobable that the legislature intended the term \u2018self-employment income\u2019 in RSA 458-C:2, IV to mean the gross receipts of a sole proprietorship when a portion of that money is payable to others as legitimate business expenses, and is therefore unavailable for the payment of child support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We turn now to how an obligor parent\u2019s income from partnerships should be calculated. A partnership is subject to \u201cpass through\u201d taxation, similar to an S-corporation or an LLC. <em>See, e.g., Thill v. Thill, </em>26 S.W.3d 199, 202 n.1 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7701-709 (2013). The partnership itself does not pay tax, but its members are taxed on their distributive shares of the partnership\u2019s income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. The parties agree that the husband\u2019s income from the partnerships should be considered \u201cinvestment income\u201d; however, other states generally treat partnership income as in the nature of self-employment income. <em>See, e.g., </em>MORGAN, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4.08, at 4-89 (\u201cIncome from self-employment, including rent, royalties, income from proprietorship of a business, and income from joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation is calculated by taking gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required to produce such income.\u201d); <em>Rein v. Rein, </em>No. FA 064021530S, 2012 WL 898774, at *2-3 (Conn. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, 2012) (analogizing family partnership to self-employment for purposes of calculating parent\u2019s income, and concluding the parent\u2019s partnership earnings were \u201cincludable in gross income for child support purposes, but only after deduction of all reasonable and necessary business expenses\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Roubanes v. Roubanes, </em>No. 13AP-369,2013 WL 6858958, at *2-3 (Ohio Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2013) (interpreting statute defining \u201cself-generated income\u201d for child support purposes by focusing on amount of money actually available for child support purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We agree with the logic analogizing self-employment, proprietorship of a business, and joint ownership of a partnership. <em>Cf. Opinion of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Justices, </em>123 N.H. 296, 308 (1983) (understanding legislative concern to be that proposed tax on business income \u201cmight have the practical effect of being a tax on the income of sole proprietors or partners, since the <em>personal </em>income of such individuals is essentially the net profit derived from their businesses\u2019 income\u201d). As noted above, we have already determined that \u201cself-employment income\u201d in RSA 458-C:2, IV \u201cmeans self-employment income net of legitimate business expenses incurred for the purpose of earning that income.\u201d <em>Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 306. We reached this conclusion because \u201ccalculating a parent\u2019s ability to pay child support necessitates determining an actual ability to pay, and, therefore, . . . presupposes the deduction of legitimate business expenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">The determination of a parent\u2019s partnership income \u201cnet of legitimate business expenses incurred for the purpose of earning that income,\u201d however, involves more than simply applying the figures reported on income tax returns. <em>See Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 306; <em>see also Albert, </em>155 N.H. at 264. \u201c[T]o be deductible for purposes of determining \u2018self-employment income\u2019 under RSA 458-C:2, IV, business expenses must be actually incurred and paid, and reasonable and necessary for producing income.\u201d <em>Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 307 (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cIt is for the trial judge to determine whether claimed expenses meet those criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although a tax return may yield valuable <em>data </em>for a trial court\u2019s use in setting child support, <em>see Abercrombie, </em>2004 WL 626713, at *7, \u201cincome tax returns are an unreliable guide to the income <em>available for child support purposes.\u201d Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 305 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The statute does not suggest that an obligor parent\u2019s status as a limited partner should result in the blanket deductibility of his share of the partnership\u2019s tax-reported expenses, without regard to whether those expenses are reasonable and necessary for the production of income. <em>See </em>RSA 458-C:2, IV. The husband argues that the \u201crelevant calculus is whether the partnership expense is merely a mask for the personal expense of the obligor,\u201d asserting that the \u201cstereotypical case\u201d would be one in which an obligor who owns an interest in a closely held corporation makes minimal distributions to himself, while characterizing his personal living expenses as business expenses in order to avoid child support obligations. He contends that because he lacked decision-making authority over the partnerships, and therefore could not shield income or manipulate the amount of money he received in order to reduce his child support obligation or use the business to defray his personal expenses, the rationale for limiting deductions to only those that are reasonable and necessary for the production of income does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Our reasoning in <em>Woolsey </em>does not support the husband\u2019s position. <em>See Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 304-07. The justification for considering a parent\u2019s gross income to be less than the gross receipts of his business is that certain expenses must be paid from the business\u2019s receipts in order for the business to continue to function. <em>Id. </em>at 306 (\u201cTo embrace a rule that a child support obligation takes precedence over the self-employed obligor\u2019s business expenses could create the untenable situation that the expenses associated with the production of income be held in abeyance until the child support is paid.\u201d (quotation, ellipses, and brackets omitted)). It is only the reasonable and necessary business expenses, however, that may reduce a parent\u2019s gross income from self-employment. Thus, the parent who seeks to reduce his gross income must demonstrate why gross receipts from self-employment do not legitimately reflect income available for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In so interpreting our statute, we admittedly place a risk on a parent who is a limited partner with no control over the partnership\u2019s expenses: The partnership may incur expenses that are not reasonable and necessary for the production of income, and thus not deductible from the parent\u2019s income for child support purposes, yet the parent may not receive any benefit from these expenses. However, this is a justifiable risk. As between a parent who chooses to participate in (or invest in) a partnership that might incur unnecessary expenses, and that parent\u2019s children, it is the parent who should bear the risk. Other investment vehicles that are not in the nature of self-employment will not carry the same risk; however, with respect to income from a partnership, only those expenses that are reasonable and necessary for the production of income are deductible therefrom for the purposes of calculating child support. <em>See id. </em>at 306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Whether to deduct reasonable and necessary expenses from the business\u2019s income distributions when calculating a parent\u2019s income for child support purposes is a highly fact-specific determination. <em>See In re Marriage of Brand, </em>44 P.3d 321, 330 (Kan. 2002) (discussing treatment of income from an S-corporation). To the extent that the husband suggests that the burden is on the wife to establish that the charged expenses were <em>not </em>\u201cactually incurred and paid, and reasonable and necessary for producing income,\u201d <em>Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 307 (quotations and citation omitted), we hold that the burden of demonstrating the deductibility of such expenses is on him. <em>See, e.g., Reichert v. Hornbeck, </em>63 A.3d 76,103 n.11 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2013). The burden is properly on the partner because he or she has the ability to obtain information to establish the propriety of the partnership\u2019s actions. <em>Cf. Zold v. Zold, </em>911 So. 2d 1222, 1233 (Fla. 2005) (placing burden on S-corporation shareholder spouse to prove \u201cthat the undistributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\u2018pass-through\u2019 income was properly retained for corporate purposes rather than impermissibly retained to avoid alimony, child support, or attorney\u2019s fees obligations by reducing the shareholder-spouse\u2019s amount of available income\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">Here, the wife characterizes the contested partnership expenses as nondeductible personal expenses; the husband, based upon Maloney\u2019s testimony, disagrees. The trial court did not determine whether the expenses were reasonable and necessary for the production of the partnerships\u2019 income, however, and the record does not allow such a conclusion as a matter of law. Maloney explained that he had generated the schedules for his report by taking the figures as reported by the partnerships to the husband \u2014 that is, as they appeared in the tax returns. Stone likewise expressly disclaimed any knowledge as to whether the expenses were \u201cactually incurred and paid, and reasonable and necessary for producing income.\u201d Because \u201c[i]t is for the trial judge to determine whether claimed expenses meet [our established] criteria,\u201d <em>Woolsey, </em>164 N.H. at 307, and the trial court did not address the claimed expenses in this case, remand is necessary for the trial court to make that determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\n<em>III. Use of 2009 Income Figures</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The wife asserts that the trial court erred when it calculated child support based upon the husband\u2019s 2009 income and tax return, despite the fact that his 2010 income figures and tax return were available and neither party questioned the reliability of the more current earnings data. She contends that, unless the most recent figures are misleading, as they were in <em>Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. 194 (2003), and <em>In the Matter of Crowe &amp; Crowe, </em>148 N.H. 218 (2002), the most current figures available should provide the basis for the court\u2019s determination of \u201cpresent income.\u201d Here, she argues, the husband\u2019s 2009 income was abnormally low, compared to the years before and after, and therefore the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion when it based the husband\u2019s child support obligations on his 2009 income.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The husband responds that the trial court\u2019s decision to use his 2009 income figures was within its discretion, after hearing substantial testimony from both experts concerning the husband\u2019s income for both 2009 and 2010. He supports this argument with two policy considerations: first, that to require the court to consider only the most current information available would result in a cycle of discovery, expert preparation, and potentially strategic trial delay, leaving the figures (and thus the payment obligation) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>to depend upon the vicissitudes of court scheduling; and second, that the decision to use financial information from the date of filing is critical to preserving a moving party\u2019s right to modification, since a change in income before the petition is heard would obviate that party\u2019s right to an order setting child support at the amount commensurate with the party\u2019s need or ability to pay. He also contends that New Hampshire\u2019s child support statutory scheme and case law, providing for modification retroactive to the time of filing, reflects an intent to accurately reflect the obligor\u2019s ability to pay as that ability changes over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">In its October 2011 order, the trial court stated: \u201c[T]his case began in 2009 and the Court will utilize [the husband\u2019s] 2009 income for purposes of setting a child support payment.\u201d On reconsideration, the court further explained: \u201cThe Court utilized the income of 2009 because it found that the experts\u2019] analysis, exhibits, and testimony were more beneficial to the Court\u2019s analysis of [the husband\u2019s] current income than the testimony relating to other years. Further, [the husband] filed for modification in 2010 based upon his 2009 income.\u201d However, in its analysis of the capital gains issue, the trial court acknowledged that New Hampshire cases, including <em>Rattee, </em>146 N.H. at 46, and <em>Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. at 196, \u201cindicate that present income is the actual income that a party has available to it to utilize for itself or to benefit that party and to pay child support,\u201d and \u201cruled that the Court is required to determine present income utilizing RSA 458-C:2 to determine an appropriate child support payment.\u201d Thus, the issue is whether the court properly applied this precedent to calculate child support under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u201cTrial courts have broad discretion in reviewing and modifying child support orders.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>153 N.H. at 702. \u201cAccordingly, we will set aside a modification order only if it clearly appears on the evidence that the court\u2019s exercise of discretion was unsustainable.\u201d <em>Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. at 196 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">It is undisputed that \u201cchild support should be determined on the basis of present income.\u201d <em>Rattee, </em>146 N.H. at 46. \u201cWhen calculating a parent\u2019s child support obligation, the court must first determine the parent\u2019s \u2018present income.\u2019 \u201d <em>In the Matter of Gray &amp; Gray, </em>160 N.H. 62, 67 (2010). \u201cIt is up to the trial court to decide what income figures should be used based upon the facts presented at the hearing and the credibility and forthrightness of the noncustodial parent in disclosing income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cThis includes the use of past tax returns when the obligor provides \u2018misleading\u2019 information on the financial affidavit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). For example, in <em>Gray, </em>in which the only evidence of the obligor father\u2019s current income was an affidavit he submitted, \u201cthe family division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>observed that the father\u2019s \u2018reported income and expenses as well as his attitude and demeanor\u2019 raised doubts about \u2018his credibility and forthrightness,\u2019 \u201d and therefore \u201cproperly ordered the father to submit the past tax returns to aid in establishing his present income.\u201d <em>Id.; see Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. at 197; <em>Crowe, </em>148 N.H. at 223. Here, however, the parties do not dispute the veracity of the information the husband provided in his 2009 and 2010 tax returns, but disagree only as to the application of that information. The trial court made no finding that the husband\u2019s 2010 information was misleading. Thus, this exception to the general rule that current information is the best representation of \u201cpresent income\u201d is not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The trial court\u2019s decision was based upon review of two full sets of financial data relating to the husband\u2019s 2009 income and 2010 income, with analysis by experts for both sides. The court explained that it \u201cutilized the income of 2009 because it found that the expert[s\u2019] analysis, exhibits and testimony were more beneficial to the Court\u2019s analysis of [the husband\u2019s] current income than the testimony relating to other years. Further, [the husband] filed for modification in 2010 based upon his 2009 income.\u201d The trial court did not explain what characteristics of the 2009 evidence, as compared to the 2010 evidence, made the older information \u201cmore beneficial\u201d to an analysis of present income. Nor does the record support that conclusion. Furthermore, nothing indicates that the court\u2019s decision to use the 2009 figures was grounded in any concern raised in the husband\u2019s modification petition: He did not move to modify on the ground of a substantial change in circumstances, <em>see In the Matter of Duquette &amp; Duquette, </em>159 N.H. 81, 86 (2009); rather, he sought modification of the child support order without the need to show a substantial change of circumstances pursuant to RSA 458-C:7, 1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The husband argues that \u201c[t]he decision to use financial information from the date of filing is .. . critical to preserving a moving party\u2019s rights to modification.\u201d He asserts that if the obligor\u2019s financial circumstances warrant a modification when he moves for it, but change before the case is heard, then the obligor\u2019s right to modify his child support obligation to that commensurate with his ability to pay during the year in which he moved for hearing will be lost. He also points out that a court\u2019s order granting modification of a child support award is frequently retroactive to the date of the motion, indicating that the figures at the time of filing are intended to govern the modification. We agree that fairness concerns may be implicated when a parent\u2019s income fluctuates between the time of a request for modification and the time that the case is actually heard, resulting in either overpayment or underpayment for the period while the case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>pending. However, the remedy for a parent who has made payments under an outdated support order cannot be a new support order based upon financial figures that are not current; such a resolution would be inconsistent with the child support guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s child support guidelines shall be applied in all child support cases, including any order modifying a support order.\u201d <em>Duquette, </em>159 N.H. at 86 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption that a child support award calculated under the guidelines is the correct amount of child support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe presumption may be overcome and the trial court may deviate from the guidelines when it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate ... because of special circumstances.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Forcier &amp; Mueller, </em>152 N.H. 463, 465 (2005) (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cPursuant to the legislative scheme, all items includable as \u2018gross income\u2019 must be used to determine the parties\u2019 total support obligation.\u201d <em>Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. at 197. However, an item not includable as \u201cgross income\u201d may nonetheless be relevant to the computation of a child support award, by contributing to special circumstances that would make deviation appropriate. <em>See In the Matter of Fulton &amp; Fulton, </em>154 N.H. 264, 268 (2006) (holding that gifts are not included in definition of gross income, but that trial courts may consider impact of gifts on financial condition of the parties and that RSA 458-C:5\u2019s special circumstances standard is sufficiently flexible to address issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In the case of a parent\u2019s fluctuating income, the correct course of action is to calculate the parties\u2019 child support obligation under the guidelines, and then to explain what, if any, circumstances warrant deviation from that amount. <em>See Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. at 198 (\u201cThe statutory scheme provides courts with the means to address income fluctuations. For instance, trial courts may adjust an award when applying the uniform child support guidelines would result in a \u2018confiscatory support order.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Indeed, here, as the trial court noted in another context, \u201cthe legislature provided an avenue to address the [husband\u2019s] concern by providing the Court with discretion to lower any child support award it deems confiscatory.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA458-C:4, II (2004); RSA458-C:5 (Supp. 2013). Although the trial court may order modification effective as of the filing date of the petition to modify, <em>see </em>RSA 458-C:7; <em>Maciejczyk v. Maciejczyk, </em>134 N.H. 343, 345 (1991), \u201c[w]e would strain the bounds of logic ... to hold that the court\u2019s authority to order a reduction mandated such a reduction, or limited the court\u2019s discretion to deny the reduction if the circumstances warranted denial.\u201d <em>Giles v. Giles, </em>136 N.H. 540, 546 (1992). The statutory scheme is sufficiently flexible to allow trial courts to fashion a just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>modification and repayment order, as necessary, in cases in which the application of the guidelines \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 to either future payments or payments between the date of filing and the court\u2019s final order \u2014 would be \u201cunjust or inappropriate.\u201d RSA458-C:4, II; <em>see </em>RSA 458-C:7; RSA458-C:5,1 (\u201cspecial circumstances\u201d allowing adjustments in application of support guidelines are <em>not </em>limited to the special circumstances enumerated in the provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Nor are we persuaded by the husband\u2019s argument that our holding will require endless delays in order to obtain the latest financial data and allow experts time to analyze that data. We do not hold that hearings must be delayed to allow the calculation and review of ever-newer financial data. Our holding today merely reaffirms our long-standing rule that child support awards are to be based upon the obligor\u2019s \u201cpresent income.\u201d <em>See Hillebrand v. Hillebrand, </em>130 N.H. 520, 526 (1988); <em>see also, e.g., Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We conclude that, on the record before us, the trial court erred by using the husband\u2019s 2009 income for purposes of calculating his \u201cpresent income.\u201d Accordingly, we vacate the calculation of child support and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\n<em>IV. Reimbursement of Overpaid Child Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The wife argues that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order her to reimburse the husband for overpayment of support resulting from the modification of the support order. She maintains that the 2007 amendment to RSA 458-C:7, III, affects substantive rights because it provides that \u201cthe court <em>shall </em>order, absent a showing of undue hardship, the obligee to directly reimburse the obligor\u201d (emphasis added) for any overpayment of support resulting from a modification of a support order. Therefore, she argues, because her divorce was finalized in 2006, application of the 2007 amendment to her is unlawful. <em>See In the Matter of Donovan &amp; Donovan, </em>152 N.H. 55, 62-63 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Because we are remanding for redetermination of the child support amount, and the wife\u2019s argument regarding the trial court\u2019s authority to award reimbursement of any overage may again arise, we address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The wife\u2019s reliance upon <em>Donovan, </em>152 N.H. 55, <em>Walker v. Walker, </em>116 N.H. 717 (1976), and <em>Henry v. Henry, </em>129 N.H. 159 (1987), for the proposition that a statutory change that affects substantive rights may be applied only prospectively is misplaced. To be sure, \u201c[w]e have held previously that statutory changes affecting parties\u2019 rights to post-divorce financial support would not be applied retroactively to pre-existing divorce decrees.\u201d <em>Donovan, </em>152 N.H. at 63. However, the amendment to RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>458-C:7, III addresses the procedure for an obligor spouse to recover overpayments in the wake of a successful motion to modify his or her child support obligation. It does not retroactively change child support orders made under divorce decrees. <em>Cf. Donovan, </em>152 N.H. at 63 (contrasting prior statutory changes with substantive effect against procedural change from earlier amendment to RSA 458-C:7, which did not \u201cmandate a change in child support but simply open[ed] up a new channel of inquiry into whether a modification is appropriate\u201d (quotation omitted)). As noted above, the purpose of modification procedures is to ensure that the parties\u2019 obligations are commensurate with their respective needs and their respective abilities to meet them as of the time of the motion to modify and going forward. <em>See, e.g., Taylor, </em>153 N.H. at 702; <em>see also Feddersen, </em>149 N.H. at 195-96 (including in calculation of \u201cgross income\u201d significant increases between 1998, when motion to modify was filed, and 2002, when hearing was held).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Because the statutory amendment affects only modification procedures, it is the date of the motion to modify, rather than the date of divorce, that controls our retroactivity analysis. The husband\u2019s motion to modify was filed in 2010, after the effective date of the 2007 amendment to the modification procedures; the application of that amendment to the modification proceedings, therefore, cannot constitute a retrospective law. Laws 2007, 274:1 (effective January 1, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Because we are vacating the court\u2019s child support award and remanding, we do not address her argument that the trial court erred by failing to address whether the award would cause her \u201cundue hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-7\">Dalianis, C.J., concurred; Lynn, J., concurred specially.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b466-8\">Lynn, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZp\">concurring specially. I write separately to make explicit what I take to be implicit in section 11(B) of Justice Conboy\u2019s opinion. I agree that, in the case of a pass-through entity like a limited partnership, it makes sense to impose upon the limited partner, here the husband, the burden of demonstrating that expenses claimed by the partnership are reasonable and necessary for the production of income. To the extent that the limited partner is unable to sustain this burden, reported expenses may not be used to offset the limited partner\u2019s reported gross income from the partnership. However, consistent with the core principle that the basis for determining an obligor\u2019s child support obligation must be the income available to pay child support, in the case of a limited partner who establishes that he or she does not have control over the management of the partnership, I do not understand the court to suggest that the income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>attributed to the limited partner can exceed the total of the amount actually distributed to the limited partner or used for his or her personal benefit during the period in question. Based on this understanding, I concur in the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
