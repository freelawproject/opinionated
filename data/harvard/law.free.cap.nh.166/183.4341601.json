We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The trial court found or the record supports the following facts regarding a motor vehicle stop that occurred on the evening of November 23, 2011. Officer Roy Holland of the Enfield Police Department stopped a truck for having defective tail lights. Holland testified that he activated his emergency blue lights and followed the truck before it stopped on the side of the road. Further, Holland testified that he did not observe any erratic behavior to suggest that the truck\u2019s driver \u2014 the defendant \u2014 was under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Holland approached the defendant\u2019s truck and requested his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. He noticed that the defendant had bloodshot eyes and trembling hands and concluded that the defendant was nervous, but he also testified that the defendant was polite and cooperative during this brief interview. Holland allowed the defendant to step out of his truck to attempt to fix the tail lights while he conducted a license check in his cruiser. The officer testified that this license check was completed in approximately two to three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">Holland then returned to the defendant\u2019s truck and asked to see his tongue. The defendant complied with the request, and Holland observed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>green film coating the defendant\u2019s tongue. He believed this coating was consistent with marijuana use and asked the defendant when he had last smoked marijuana. The defendant initially denied smoking marijuana but subsequently admitted that he had smoked marijuana on the previous day. Holland asked if the defendant had marijuana paraphernalia in his truck. The defendant said that he did not. Concerned that the defendant was becoming agitated, Holland then obtained the defendant\u2019s consent to perform a pat-down search of his person. The officer felt two bulges in the defendant\u2019s back pockets, and the defendant produced two \u201cwads\u201d of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">After the pat-down, the defendant put the money back in his pockets, and Holland returned the defendant\u2019s license and registration with a verbal warning to repair the broken tail lights. This conversation was interrupted when the defendant received a telephone call from his father. Holland testified that he took the defendant\u2019s phone and detailed the circumstances of the stop to the defendant\u2019s father and said that the defendant \u201cwas going to drive home and park the vehicle until he could get it fixed.\u201d He then returned the telephone to the defendant and told him that he was free to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The two parted ways and walked toward their vehicles when Holland hesitated and asked the defendant whether he would answer another question. The defendant stopped getting into his truck and turned to Holland. Holland asked again whether the defendant had marijuana in his truck. The defendant denied that he did. He also deified Holland\u2019s subsequent request to conduct a search of his vehicle. The officer again stated that the defendant was free to leave, but then asked whether a drug canine would indicate that there were drugs in the vehicle. At this point, the defendant looked at the ground and replied that he did not think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Holland stepped away from the defendant but remained within hearing distance as he contacted dispatch to request a canine unit. The defendant lamented that he was \u201cscrewed,\u201d and Holland asked the defendant how much marijuana he had in his truck. The defendant confessed that he had \u201ca couple ounces\u201d of marijuana and mushrooms in his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Prior to his trial for possession with intent to distribute marijuana and psilocybin, the defendant filed four motions to suppress the following evidence: (1) Holland\u2019s examination of the defendant\u2019s tongue; (2) the initial questioning regarding marijuana use; (3) Holland\u2019s pat-down of the defendant; and (4) the subsequent interrogation regarding drug possession. The trial court granted the motion to suppress evidence of the green film on the defendant\u2019s tongue because the State failed to produce sufficient evidence that such was indicative of marijuana use, but denied the remaining motions. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to suppress all evidence obtained following the examination of the tongue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>violated his state and federal constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>See </em>N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19; U.S. Const. amends IV, XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). When reviewing a trial court\u2019s order on a motion to suppress, we accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous, and we review legal conclusions <em>de novo. State v. Tarasuik, </em>160 N.H. 323, 327 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>I. Expanding the Scope of a Stop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution protects \u201call people, their papers, their possessions and their homes from unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>State v. Schulz, </em>164 N.H. 217, 221 (2012) (quotation omitted). Evidence obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s rights under Part I, Article 19 of the State Constitution is inadmissible under the exclusionary rule, though an exception to this rule may apply if the State proves that the taint of the primary illegality is purged. <em>State v. De La Cruz, </em>158 N.H. 564, 566 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">A traffic stop is a \u201cseizure.\u201d <em>State v. McKinnon-Andrews, </em>151 N.H. 19, 22 (2004). The scope of such an investigative stop \u201cmust be carefully tailored to its underlying justifieation[,] must be temporary[,] and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>State v. Wong, </em>138 N.H. 56, 63 (1993) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). The scope of a stop may be expanded to investigate other suspected illegal activity only \u201cif the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that other criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>State v. Hight, </em>146 N.H. 746, 748-49 (2001) (quotation omitted). An investigatory stop may \u201cmetamorphose into an overly prolonged or intrusive detention (and, thus, become unlawful).\u201d <em>State v. Michelson, </em>160 N.H. 270, 274 (2010) (quotation omitted). Whether the detention is a lawful investigatory stop, or goes beyond the limits of such a stop, depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">To determine whether the scope of an otherwise valid stop has been exceeded by questioning, we must determine whether: (1) the question is reasonably related to the initial justification for the stop; (2) the law enforcement officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that would justify the question; and (3) in light of all the circumstances, the question impermissibly prolonged the detention or changed its fundamental nature. <em>McKinnon-Andrews, </em>151 N.H. at 25. In adopting this standard, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>If the question is reasonably related to the purpose of the stop, no constitutional violation occurs. If the question is not reasonably related to the purpose of the stop, we must consider whether the law enforcement officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that would justify the question. If the question is so justified, no constitutional violation occurs. In the absence of a reasonable connection to the purpose of the stop or a reasonable, articulable suspicion, we must consider whether in light of all the circumstances and common sense, the question impermissibly prolonged the detention or changed the fundamental nature of the stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The defendant does not dispute that he was lawfully stopped for a motor vehicle violation. <em>See Michelson, </em>160 N.H. at 273. Instead, he argues that the scope of this initially valid traffic stop was unlawfully expanded when Holland asked to see the defendant\u2019s tongue and took additional steps to investigate whether the defendant had possessed or consumed marijuana. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress Holland\u2019s examination of the tongue for evidentiary reasons, rather than on constitutional grounds. We begin our analysis, however, with the question of whether the request to examine the defendant\u2019s tongue was constitutional. We first conclude that Holland\u2019s request to see the defendant\u2019s tongue was not reasonably related to the initial reason for the stop. According to Holland\u2019s testimony, the defendant was stopped because his truck\u2019s tail lights were defective. By the officer\u2019s own admission, the subsequent examination of the defendant\u2019s tongue to investigate whether he had consumed marijuana was not related to this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Because Holland\u2019s request to examine the defendant\u2019s tongue was not reasonably related to the purpose of the stop, we must determine whether the officer\u2019s actions were justified by reasonable suspicion based upon \u201cspecific, articulable facts taken together with rational inferences from those facts \u2014 that the particular person stopped has been, is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.\u201d <em>McKinnon-Andrews, </em>151 N.H. at 25-26 (quotation omitted). To determine the sufficiency of an officer\u2019s suspicion, we evaluate the articulable facts in light of all surrounding circumstances, keeping in mind that a trained officer may make inferences and draw conclusions from conduct that may seem unremarkable to an untrained observer. <em>Id. </em>at 26. We recognize that the perceptions of experienced officers are entitled to deference, but this deference should not be blind. <em>See id. </em>at 28 (Broderick, J., concurring). These articulable facts must lead to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>something specific and not simply \u201ca general sense that this is probably a bad person who may have committed some kind of crime.\u201d <em>State v. Joyce, </em>159 N.H. 440, 446 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Here, we conclude that Holland did not have reasonable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity. Holland testified that he did not observe any indicia of impairment when he stopped the defendant\u2019s truck. Specifically, the defendant was not speeding, weaving through traffic, crossing lanes, or operating the truck in an erratic manner. He did not struggle to produce his license and registration, and the defendant walked without stumbling after Holland invited him to exit the truck. Holland also did not see anything in the truck that was suggestive of drug possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Despite the absence of signs of drug use and impairment, the State contends that the officer\u2019s actions were justified by the defendant\u2019s nervousness and bloodshot eyes. We are not persuaded. We have previously noted that nervousness is \u201centirely consistent with innocent behavior,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 447 (quotation omitted), and the officer in this case agreed that nervousness is \u201cnatural\u201d during a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The trial court relied upon <em>State v. Livingston, </em>153 N.H. 399 (2006), to support its ruling that Holland had reasonable suspicion to expand the scope of the stop. In <em>Livingston, </em>the officer approached the defendant\u2019s truck and smelled \u201ca strong odor of burnt marijuana\u201d emanating from the vehicle. <em>Livingston, </em>153 N.H. at 405. The officer also observed the defendant\u2019s nervousness and bloodshot eyes. <em>Id. </em>A critical factor supporting reasonable suspicion in that ease \u2014 the odor of burnt marijuana \u2014 is noticeably absent here. Despite Holland\u2019s training in detecting the odor of fresh and burnt marijuana, he did not detect any such odor in the car or on the defendant\u2019s person and observed no behaviors beyond the defendant\u2019s nervousness, bloodshot eyes, and shaky hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Absent additional facts, we decline to find that otherwise innocent factors like nervousness and bloodshot eyes are sufficient to support reasonable suspicion. \u201c[W]e think it impossible for a combination of wholly innocent factors to combine into a suspicious conglomeration unless there are concrete reasons for such an interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>263 F.3d 571, 594 (6th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Ferris v. State, </em>735 A.2d 491, 508, 510 (Md. 1999) (\u201cThe innocent and the guilty may both frequently react with analogous trepidation when approached by a uniformed police officer. ... In the absence of any testimony or scientific evidence as to some direct, observable correlation between eyes that are bloodshot, even extremely so, and drug usage or, intuitively less likely, drug possession, we find this fact to carry little, if any, weight.\u201d). This conclusion is consistent with our prior cases. <em>Compare Joyce, </em>159 N.H. at 447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>(investigative stop not justified by reasonable suspicion, despite nervousness and deceptive responses of defendant and his companion, when they denied using marijuana and nothing in car suggested drug consumption), <em>with State v. Wallace, </em>146 N.H. 146, 149-50 (2001) (stop justified by reasonable suspicion when the defendant was found near the scene of a recent robbery, dressed in hooded dark clothing, and cast furtive glances before he made a 360 degree turn and continued to approach the police cruiser), <em>and State v. Roach, </em>141 N.H. 64, 66 (1996) (reasonable suspicion justified investigative stop and further questioning when defendant acted furtively in Manchester\u2019s \u201ccombat zone\u201d at 3:55 a.m. and evaded police officer when he approached).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Finally, we address whether the officer\u2019s actions \u201cimpermissibly prolonged the detention or changed the fundamental nature of the stop.\u201d <em>McKinnon-Andrews, </em>151 N.H. at 25 (quotation omitted). Although the brief inspection of the defendant\u2019s tongue did not prolong the stop, we conclude that the search altered the fundamental nature of the stop by transforming a routine traffic stop into an investigation of potential drug activity. <em>Id. </em>By asking to see the defendant\u2019s tongue, the officer set out to determine whether the defendant had, in fact, consumed or was in possession of marijuana. Although a reasonable motorist may not understand that a green film on the tongue may be indicative of marijuana consumption, he would certainly recognize that the officer\u2019s request to see his tongue changed the fundamental nature of an otherwise routine traffic stop. <em>See id. </em>at 29 (Broderick, J., concurring) (\u201cTo my mind, a reasonable motorist would have perceived the question as altering the fundamental nature of the stop.\u201d). This was an impermissible and unconstitutional expansion of the scope of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>II. The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Our conclusion that the officer\u2019s request to see the defendant\u2019s tongue unlawfully expanded the scope of the stop does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that all other evidence obtained after that request is excludable. <em>Id. </em>at 29. We must determine whether, in view of the primary illegality, the evidence that the defendant sought to suppress was obtained by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. <em>Flight, </em>146 N.H. at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The State argues that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not apply in this case because the argument was not made before the trial court. We disagree. The four suppression motions and defense counsel\u2019s oral argument to the trial court establish that this issue was adequately preserved for our review. \u201cThe \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 doctrine requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the exclusion from trial of evidence derivatively obtained through a violation of Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution. If the evidence in question has been obtained only through the exploitation of an antecedent illegality, it must be suppressed.\u201d <em>State v. McGurk, </em>157 N.H. 765, 771 (2008) (quotation omitted). The purpose of this exclusionary rule is to: \u201c(1) deter police misconduct; (2) redress the injury to the privacy of the victim of the unlawful police conduct; and (3) safeguard compliance with State constitutional protections.\u201d <em>State v. Panarello, </em>157 N.H. 204, 207 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Read together, the defendant\u2019s four suppression motions are all based upon the officer\u2019s initial request to examine the defendant\u2019s tongue. This examination sparked the officer\u2019s suspicion that the defendant consumed marijuana and resulted in an interrogation about the defendant\u2019s marijuana use. The defendant\u2019s responses to the interrogation prompted the officer to pat down the defendant, and conduct further interrogation which resulted in the defendant\u2019s admission to marijuana and psilocybin possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In determining whether the taint of a Part I, Article 19 violation has been purged, we consider the following factors: \u201c(1) the temporal proximity between the police illegality and the acquisition of the evidence sought to be suppressed; (2) the presence of intervening circumstances; and (3) the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d <em>McGurk, </em>157 N.H. at 771 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). Regarding the first factor, the officer\u2019s illegal request to see the defendant\u2019s tongue and his subsequent observation of the film coating the tongue was closely followed by his interrogation of the defendant. <em>Hight, </em>146 N.H. at 750. Second, there were no intervening circumstances to purge the taint of the unlawful inspection of the defendant\u2019s tongue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Finally, we assess the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 751. Holland admitted that his request to examine the defendant\u2019s tongue was unrelated to the initial purpose of the stop, and it was the first of several efforts to find marijuana during an otherwise routine traffic stop for defective tail lights. Viewed objectively, Holland was determined to conduct a drug investigation unsupported by reasonable suspicion. This is especially troubling in light of the defendant\u2019s youth and Holland\u2019s statement to the defendant\u2019s father that he would be releasing the defendant to return home. All of the circumstances \u201cgive[ ] rise to the <em>appearance, </em>even if not the reality, that the officer\u2019s purpose was to engage in a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 for incriminating evidence by exploiting the defendant\u2019s ignorance of his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Because the officer\u2019s request to examine the defendant\u2019s tongue was an impermissible expansion of the stop, the exclusionary rule bars admission of the result of the officer\u2019s examination of the defendant\u2019s tongue. Moreover, the fruits of that search are also inadmissible because the State failed to establish that the taint of the unlawful expansion of the stop was purged. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court erroneously denied suppression of all evidence obtained following the unlawful expansion of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Because the evidence was obtained illegally under the New Hampshire Constitution, we need not reach the federal issue. <em>Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and BASSETT, JJ., concurred; LYNN, J., concurred specially.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b212-8\">LYNN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1R\">concurring specially. I agree with the majority that the incriminating statements made by the defendant after Officer Holland asked whether a canine would detect drugs in his vehicle, as well as the drugs themselves, must be suppressed. I write separately because I reach this result upon different grounds than the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The majority holds that Holland\u2019s request to view the defendant\u2019s tongue fails the third prong of the three-part sequential test we articulated in <em>State v. </em>McKinnon-Andrews, 151 N.H. 19, 25 (2004), for determining whether a police officer\u2019s questioning exceeds the scope of a lawful traffic stop. In doing so, the majority concludes that this single inquiry, which I agree was neither reasonably related to the initial justification for the stop nor based upon any reasonable suspicion that arose before the question was asked, fails the third prong of the test because it \u201cchanged the fundamental nature of the stop.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">I do not agree that <em>McKinnon-Andrews </em>so narrowly circumscribes the scope of questioning during a traffic stop that <em>any </em>inquiry aimed at detecting non-germane criminal activity changes the fundamental nature of the stop. If that is true, then the third prong of the test has little practical meaning because virtually all inquiries that fail the second prong of the test will automatically fail the third prong as well. For example, if in response to Holland\u2019s single \u201ctongue\u201d inquiry, the defendant had immediately admitted without further questioning that he had been smoking marijuana and had a supply of the drug in the car, would we really suppress that evidence? I think not. Thus, I do not find that Holland\u2019s request to view the defendant\u2019s tongue, without more, fundamentally changed the nature of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Rather, in my view, the proper grounds for suppression are two-fold. First, as the trial court found (a finding that the State did not cross-appeal), the State failed to show that the green tongue displayed by the defendant in response to Holland\u2019s request had any probative significance with respect to the defendant\u2019s use or possession of drugs. Second, notwithstanding the fact that the green tongue gave Holland no basis to make further drug-related inquiry, he continued to make multiple inquiries until the defendant finally admitted to possessing drugs. These repeated inquiries had the effect of impermissibly prolonging the stop, and, therefore, require that the fruits of this illegality be suppressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
