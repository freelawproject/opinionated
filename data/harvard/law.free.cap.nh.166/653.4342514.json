We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. In order to provide telecommunications services throughout the City, FairPoint maintains poles, wires, cables, and other equipment within the City\u2019s public rights-of-way. For the 2000 through 2010 tax years, the City imposed a real estate tax upon FairPoint for its use and occupation of this public property (the right-of-way tax).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>RSA 72:6 (1991); RSA 72:23, I (Supp. 2000) (amended 2002, 2003, 2006, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Prior to 2010, the City did not impose a right-of-way tax upon Comcast, which utilizes the City\u2019s rights-of-way to provide cable services pursuant to a franchise agreement. The City began imposing the tax upon Comcast in 2010 in response to a ruling by the New Hampshire Board of Tax and Land Appeals (BTLA) that, notwithstanding the franchise agreement, Comcast was subject to the tax. Prior to 2008, the City did not impose the same tax upon Public Service of New Hampshire (PSNH) because it was unaware that PSNH had used and occupied the rights-of-way. Similarly, the City did not tax certain other users of its rights-of-way for their use and occupation of public property during the relevant tax years because it was not aware of their usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">FairPoint brought an action challenging, in relevant part, the constitutionality of the City\u2019s right-of-way tax assessments against it for the 2000 through 2010 tax years. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In granting FairPoint\u2019s motion, and denying the City\u2019s motion, the trial court ruled, as an initial matter, that \u201cintentionality\u201d was not a required element of FairPoint\u2019s equal protection claim. Next, having implicitly found that the City had selectively taxed FairPoint, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">Concord\u2019s decision not to tax others similarly situated was not an exercise of judgment; rather, it was due to a misunderstanding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the law with respect to Comcast, and a misunderstanding of the facts that other entities, such as PSNH and others[,] . . . were using Concord\u2019s right-of-way. There can be no serious argument that the City of Concord had a rational governmental interest in deciding not to tax entities based on its misunderstanding of the law or its lack of diligence in investigating the facts. Concord could therefore not have had a \u201crational reason for selectively imposing [a] tax upon\u201d FairPoint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">(Quoting <em>Verizon New England v. City of Rochester, </em>156 N.H. 624, 631 (2007).) The court concluded that \u201cthe City violated FairPoint\u2019s right to the equal protection of the laws under the State and Federal Constitutions,\u201d and that \u201cthe appropriate remedy is to strike [the] illegal tax.\u201d The court denied the City\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. If our review of the evidence does not reveal any genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s decision. We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Anderson v. Motorsports Holdings, </em>155 N.H. 491, 494 (2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">On appeal, the City argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of FairPoint, and in striking the right-of-way tax levied against FairPoint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, it argues that it neither \u201cselectively impose[d]\u201d the right-of-way tax upon FairPoint, nor \u201csingle[d] FairPoint out for taxation,\u201d for the relevant tax years. It contends that, \u201c[t]o the extent that [it] failed to tax some entities that occupied the right-of-way\u201d while taxing FairPoint, any such difference in treatment resulted from errors of judgment, which \u201cdo not show that [it] engaged in [an] arbitrary or otherwise intentional and deliberate scheme to tax' FairPoint and not others similarly situated.\u201d Because \u201cFairPoint\u2019s equal protection claim is without merit,\u201d the City argues, \u201cFairPoint must be ordered to pay its assessed taxes owed to the City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>FairPoint argues that we \u201cshould affirm each of the trial court\u2019s rulings.\u201d Specifically, it argues that, for the relevant tax years, \u201c[the City] committed the very equal protection violation adjudicated in prior cases by selectively taxing FairPoint, but not other entities that used and occupied [the City\u2019s] rights-of-way ... in the same manner as FairPoint.\u201d It contends that, following our decision in <em>Verizon New England v. City of Rochester, </em>156 N.H. 624 <em>(.Rochester III), </em>\u201c[i]t is now beyond dispute that a municipality\u2019s failure to assess a right-of-way tax against all entities that use and occupy the public rights-of-way violates the State Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection.\u201d It further argues that discriminatory intent is not a required element for an equal protection claim based upon selective taxation, and that \u201c[the City] cannot point to any New Hampshire authority on analogous facts that requires intent to discriminate... to establish an equal protection violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In the alternative, it argues that the City \u201cintentionally discriminated against FairPoint\u201d by: (1) taxing only FairPoint for the 2000 tax year; (2) \u201cdeliberately cho[osing] not to assess a right of way tax against Comcast, meaning [the City] <em>intended </em>not to tax Comcast\u201d; and (3) \u201cfailing] to tax other right of way users, such as PSNH and [other] [a]ttachees, deliberately or through deliberate ignorance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We first address FairPoint\u2019s equal protection claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, 124 </em>N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). Because constitutional challenges to the application of a tax raise questions of law, we review the trial court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Rochester III, </em>156 N.H. at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We conclude that FairPoint\u2019s equal protection claim, like the one analyzed in <em>Rochester III, </em>is one of \u201cselective enforcement,\u201d and not an equal protection challenge to the tax scheme <em>itself </em>for \u201cimpermissibly establishing] classifications and, therefore, treating] similarly situated individuals in a different manner.\u201d <em>State v. Hofland, </em>151 N.H. 322, 325, 326 (2004) (quotations omitted). Although it employs the term \u201cclassification,\u201d FairPoint challenges what it calls the City\u2019s \u201cselective tax treatment,\u201d not the tax scheme itself. In any event, FairPoint has not shown that the tax \u201cimpermissibly established classifications and, therefore, treated similarly situated individuals in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we analyze FairPoint\u2019s claim of \u201cselective tax treatment\u201d under the rational basis test set forth in <em>Rochester III. See Rochester III, </em>156 N.H. at 630-31; <em>see also Hofland, </em>151 N.H. at 325-26 (noting selective enforcement and classification as alternative means of establishing equal protection violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201cThe equal protection clause protects an entity from state action which selects it out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting it to taxes not imposed on others of the same class.\u201d <em>Rochester III, </em>156 N.H. at 630 (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201c[T]o determine whether [FairPoint\u2019s] right to equal protection is being violated, we must apply the rational basis test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Under this test, we ask whether the City\u2019s taxation of FairPoint constituted selective taxation and, if so, whether the selection is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">To show \u201cselective taxation,\u201d <em>id., </em>FairPoint \u201cmust show that the selective enforcement [of the tax] was a <em>conscious, intentional discrimination\u201d Anderson, </em>155 N.H. at 499 (emphasis added). Accordingly, in order to succeed on its claim of selective tax treatment, FairPoint must demonstrate \u201csomething more\u201d than \u201cmere errors of judgment by officials,\u201d <em>Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, </em>247 U.S. 350, 353 (1918), or \u201cthat the enforcement was merely historically lax,\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>155 N.H. at 499. In addition, FairPoint \u201chas the burden to prove that the selection is arbitrary or without some reasonable justification and ... to negative every conceivable basis which might support the selection, whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.\u201d <em>Rochester III, </em>156 N.H. at 631 (quotations, citation, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">As an initial matter, we note that FairPoint misconstrues our rational basis test, as articulated in <em>Rochester III </em>\u2014 a case that it insists \u201ccontrols]\u201d this appeal. In <em>Rochester III, </em>we analyzed whether the City of Rochester\u2019s \u201ctaxation of only Verizon for its use and occupancy of public property,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 627, constituted \u201cselective taxation . . . [not] rationally related to a legitimate state interest,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 630. Our initial determination in <em>Rochester III </em>\u2014 that Rochester \u201c[was] selectively applying RSA 72:23, I, against Verizon,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 631 \u2014 necessarily followed from Rochester\u2019s failure to contest that it had \u201csingled Verizon out\u201d for taxation, <em>id. </em>at 629 (quotation omitted) \u2014 an allegation that, by its terms, implied a conscious decision to treat Verizon differently <em>(ie., </em>\u201ca conscious, intentional discrimination,\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>155 N.H. at 499). Next, because \u201c[Rochester] offer[ed], the record reveal[ed], and we [could] conceive of, no rational reason for selectively imposing this tax upon Verizon,\u201d we concluded that Rochester\u2019s \u201cselective application\u201d of the tax \u201c[was] discriminatory and violat[ed] our Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>Rochester III, </em>156 N.H. at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">FairPoint argues that, following <em>Rochester III, </em>\u201ca municipality\u2019s failure to assess a right-of-way tax against <em>all entities </em>that use and occupy the public rights-of-way violates the State Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This argument overlooks the fact that, in order for us to rule that an entity has been \u201cselected] . . . out for discriminatory treatment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 630 (quotation omitted), the selection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>itself must be intentional. <em>See Anderson, </em>155 N.H. at 499. Here, unlike in <em>Rochester III, </em>the City does not concede that it singled out FairPoint for taxation. Because FairPoint alleges that the City\u2019s <em>enforcement </em>of the right-of-way tax constitutes selective tax treatment, FairPoint \u201cmust show more than that the enforcement was merely historically lax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is also clear that mere errors of judgment by officials will not support a claim of discrimination.\u201d <em>Sunday Lake Iron Co., </em>247 U.S. at 353. \u201cInstead, [FairPoint] must show that the selective enforcement was a <em>conscious, intentional discrimination.\u201d Anderson, </em>155 N.H. at 499 (emphasis added); <em>see also Sunday Lake Iron Co., </em>247 U.S. at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">FairPoint argues, to the contrary, that discriminatory intent is not a required element of its equal protection claim. It contends that an erroneous failure to tax one or more entities necessarily results in selective enforcement, and that such selection, <em>because </em>it was based merely upon an error, is arbitrary <em>(i.e., </em>without rational basis). To follow FairPoint\u2019s reasoning, an <em>erroneous </em>failure to tax even one entity constitutes selective taxation without a rational basis \u2014 and thus forms the basis for an equal protection claim \u2014 for every other similarly situated, taxed entity. FairPoint\u2019s counsel defended this hypothetical at oral argument, by insisting that, if ninety-nine out of 100 similarly situated homeowners were assessed a real estate tax, but one homeowner was not taxed due to an error, each of the ninety-nine taxed homeowners would have a valid equal protection claim. We do not agree that such errors in taxation, without intentional selection, violate the equal protection rights of taxpayers. <em>Cf. Appeal of Hardy, </em>154 N.H. 805, 814 (2007) (\u201cTo accept the [respondent\u2019s] argument would lead to absurd results.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In the alternative, FairPoint argues that, even if it were required to demonstrate discriminatory intent to succeed on its equal protection claim, \u201cthe undisputed facts before the trial court demonstrated that [the City] intentionally discriminated against FairPoint.\u201d Because it ruled, erroneously, that FairPoint need not demonstrate discriminatory intent, the trial court did not explicitly address whether the City intentionally discriminated against FairPoint, and we decline to consider the issue in the first instance. Accordingly, we leave the issue to the trial court to address on remand. <em>See State v. Pepin, </em>159 N.H. 310, 313 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Thus, because the trial court applied an erroneous legal standard in ruling that the City selectively imposed the tax upon FairPoint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>Rochester III, </em>156 N.H. at 631, we vacate the trial court\u2019s rulings (1) granting summary judgment in favor of FairPoint and (2) striking the right-of-way tax imposed upon FairPoint, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The Federal Constitution offers FairPoint no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances. <em>See Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal v. Webster County, </em>488 U.S. 336, 345-46 (1989) (\u201cThe equal protection clause protects the individual from state action which selects him out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting him to taxes not imposed on others of the same class. We have no doubt that petitioners have suffered from such <em>intentional systematic </em>undervaluation by state officials of comparable property . . . .\u201d (emphasis added) (quotations, citation, and ellipsis omitted)); <em>Rochester III, </em>156 N.H. at 630-31. Accordingly, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b679-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\"> At oral argument, FairPoint conceded that the City did not tax it for the 1999 tax year. We therefore consider only the 2000 through 2010 tax years, and deem FairPoint\u2019s arguments regarding the 1999 tax year waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> To the extent the City also argues that the court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment, we deem that argument waived because the City failed to raise it in its notice of appeal. <em>See Granite State Mgmt. &amp; Res. v. City of Concord, </em>165 N.H. 277, 294 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\"> After implicitly finding that the City had selectively taxed FairPoint, the trial court proceeded to the second step of the rational basis test. The court concluded that \u201c[tjhere can be no serious argument that the City of Concord had a rational governmental interest in deciding not to tax entities based on its misunderstanding of the law or its lack of diligence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>investigating the facts.\u201d Because we hold that its implicit finding of selective taxation was in error, we need not address the court's explicit finding that there was no rational basis for the selection. In addition, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the appropriate remedy for an equal protection violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
