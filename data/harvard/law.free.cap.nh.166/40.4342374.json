Smith, appeals the sentence imposed by the Superior Court <em>(Fitzgerald, </em>J.) following his conviction by a jury of receipt of stolen property. <em>See </em>RSA 637:7, :11,1(b) (2007). The sole issue for our review is whether the trial court committed plain error by imposing a felony-level sentence, <em>see </em>RSA 637:11, 1(b), instead of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>misdemeanor-level sentence, <em>see </em>RSA 637:11, III (2007), when the jury was not instructed that it had to find that the stolen property consisted of firearms. <em>See </em>RSA 637:11,1(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. In the summer of 2010, the victim invited a man and a woman into his home for a drink and showed them two handguns that he owned: a Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson .44 caliber handgun and a SIG Sauer .380 caliber handgun. The three continued to drink, and eventually, the victim lost consciousness. When he awoke the next morning, he noticed the two handguns were missing, and he reported them stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In August 2010, Eric Underwood telephoned the defendant and asked if he was interested in buying any weapons. The defendant told Underwood to \u201cbring them over.\u201d Underwood retrieved the two stolen handguns from another man and drove to the defendant\u2019s residence where the defendant gave Underwood $400 for the two guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Sometime thereafter, the defendant asked a friend if he was interested in purchasing the two guns for $200 each. The friend immediately telephoned the Keene Police Department, offering to act as a confidential informant in this case. The police, together with the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Drug Task Force, arranged for the defendant\u2019s friend to purchase the guns from the defendant while the friend wore a recording device.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The \u201cbuy\u201d occurred on August 17, 2010. Before the friend met with the defendant, the police searched the friend and gave him $400. <em>See State v. Tabaldi, </em>165 N.H. 306, 309-10 (2013) (describing \u201ccontrolled buys\u201d in general). The police accompanied the friend to the defendant\u2019s home. The friend entered the home, spoke briefly with the defendant, gave him $400, and returned to the police with the two handguns. He was searched again after giving the guns to the police and was not found to have any contraband. An officer immediately checked the serial numbers on the guns and confirmed that they were the victim\u2019s stolen guns. At trial, the victim identified the guns as his stolen guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">At the beginning of the trial, the jury was read the indictment on which the defendant had been arraigned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">John Smith ... is charged with the crime of receiving stolen property contrary to RSA 637:7 and 637:11 on or about the 17th day of August, 2010 ... in that [he] did receive, retain, or dispose of the .380 caliber handgun and/or a .44 caliber handgun, knowing that the handgun or handguns had been stolen, or believing that the handgun or handguns had probably been stolen, with the purpose to deprive the owner of that handgun or those handguns by selling one or both handguns to J.M., contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Throughout the trial, witnesses, including the defendant, referred to the handguns as \u201cfirearms.\u201d At the trial\u2019s conclusion, the jury was instructed that, to convict the defendant, it had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that: (1) he \u201creceived, retained, and/or disposed of property\u201d; (2) \u201cthe property belonged to another person\u201d; (3) he \u201cknew the property had been stolen or believed that... it had probably been stolen\u201d; and (4) he \u201creceived the property with the purpose to deprive the owner of the property.\u201d The defendant did not object to those instructions. After the jury convicted the defendant, the trial court sentenced him to the New Hampshire State Prison for a minimum of three years and a maximum of six years, stand committed. The defendant did not object to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On appeal, however, the defendant argues that his sentence violates Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution because, for him to receive a felony-level sentence, the jury must have been instructed to find, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that the stolen property consisted of firearms. <em>See </em>RSA 637:11, 1(b) (receipt of stolen property constitutes a class A felony when \u201c[t]he property stolen is a firearm\u201d). Because the defendant did not make that argument in the trial court, he invokes the plain error rule, which allows us, under certain narrowly drawn circumstances, to correct errors not raised in the trial court. <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 16-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">For us to find plain error: (1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. <em>State v. Charest, </em>164 N.H. 252, 254 (2012). If all three conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to correct a forfeited error only if the error meets a fourth criterion: the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The rule is used sparingly, however, and is limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. <em>Id. </em>We assume, without deciding, that the first three prongs of the plain error test are met. <em>See State v. Russell, </em>159 N.H. 475, 490-94 (2009). We, therefore, confine our review to the fourth prong of the plain error test.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">We find <em>Russell </em>instructive. The defendant in <em>Russell, </em>159 N.H. at 490, was sentenced under RSA 651:2, Il-g (Supp. 2013), which provides for an enhanced sentence \u201c[i]f a person is convicted of a felony, an element of which is the possession, use or attempted use of a deadly weapon, and the deadly weapon is a firearm.\u201d The trial court had instructed the jury that to convict the defendant of armed robbery, it had to find that he was armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). However, the court did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d with which the defendant was armed was a firearm. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the trial court defined a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as \u201cany firearm, knife or anything else which is used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>such a way that the defendant knew or should have known that it could result in death or serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). At trial, there was evidence that the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d used could have been a BB gun. <em>Id. </em>at 492. The defendant argued that, based upon the jury instructions and evidence presented at trial, the jury could have convicted him of armed robbery with a BB gun. <em>Id. </em>at 489. Accordingly, he contended that because the trial court did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d he used in the armed robbery was a firearm, his sentence under RSA 651:2, Il-g was unconstitutional. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Because the defendant in <em>Russell </em>failed to object to the jury instructions and to his sentence, we reviewed his sentence under the plain error rule. <em>Id. </em>at 489. Although we agreed with the State\u2019s concession that the trial court erred and that the error was plain, <em>id. </em>at 490, we concluded that the fourth prong of the plain error test was not met because evidence that the defendant used a firearm was overwhelming and undisputed, <em>id. </em>at 491-93. We explained that although a witness testified \u201cthat he initially thought that the shooter had a BB gun ... , he also testified that the defendant pointed a gun at [the victim].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492. The witness stated that the gun looked like a revolver and that a BB gun would not have done as much damage to the window of the car in which the. victim was seated. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the victim testified that someone \u201chad stuck a gun inside [the] vehicle and shot out its back window.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A crime scene technician testified that he found a metal fragment in the vehicle\u2019s dashboard and that the fragment appeared to be a bullet. <em>Id. </em>A firearms expert confirmed that the fragment \u201cwas from a discharged bullet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In addition, at trial, the defendant in <em>Russell </em>did not dispute that the deadly weapon used during the robbery was a firearm. <em>Id. </em>\u201cGiven the overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence that the defendant used a firearm to commit the aimed robbery,\u201d we declined to exercise our discretion to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence under the fourth prong of the plain error test. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Similarly, here, evidence that the stolen property at issue consisted of handguns was overwhelming. The evidence at trial concerned only handguns as stolen property; no other allegedly stolen property was discussed. Additionally, the defendant did not dispute at trial, and does not dispute on appeal, that a handgun is a firearm. <em>See id. </em>At trial, witnesses, including the defendant, referred to the stolen handguns as \u201cfirearms.\u201d In this case, as in others involving the issue of whether a handgun is a \u201cfirearm,\u201d based upon the evidence at trial, \u201cthere was no real issue as to whether the handgun was a firearm.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>136 N.H. 131, 134 (1992); <em>see State v. St. John, </em>129 N.H. 1, 3-4 (1986) (when defendant was charged with possessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>a .357 Dan Wesson handgun and witnesses referred to the handgun as a \u201cfirearm\u201d at trial, there was no need for trial court to instruct jury that a firearm is \u201ca weapon from which shot is discharged by gunpowder\u201d (quotation omitted)). Accordingly, as in <em>Russell, </em>we will not exercise our discretion under the fourth prong of the plain error rule to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See Russell, </em>159 N.H. at 492. Given the essentially uncontroverted evidence that the stolen property consisted of handguns and that the handguns constitute firearms, \u201cthe real threat then to the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings would be if the defendant, despite th[at]... uncontroverted evidence ..., were not to receive the enhanced sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In <em>Russell, </em>we also declined to hold \u201cthat the failure to instruct the jury on an element of the offense always constitutes plain error,\u201d explaining that to do so \u201cwould create a windfall for criminal defendants,\u201d giving them \u201cevery incentive not to object\u201d at trial to jury instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 494. The defendant asks us to overrule that part of <em>Russell. </em>He asks that we hold \u201cthat, where the jury has not been instructed to find a sentencing enhancement element, sentencing based on that enhancement is plain error, satisfying all four elements of the plain error test.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">Generally, we will overrule a prior decision only after considering: (1) whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply by defying practical workability; (2) whether the rule is subject to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequence of overruling; (3) whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine; and (4) whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-8\"><em>Maplevale Builders v. Town of Danville, </em>165 N.H. 99,105 (2013) (quotation omitted). The defendant argues only that <em>Russell </em>is \u201cintolerable,\u201d but not because it \u201cdeffies] practical workability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). The defendant asserts that <em>Russell </em>is intolerable because: (1) it treats defendants who have preserved their objections to jury instructions and sentencing differently from those who have not; (2) it conflicts with prior and subsequent cases; and (3) it undermines \u201csignificant constitutional guarantees.\u201d In effect, the defendant finds <em>Russell </em>to be intolerable because he believes that it was incorrectly decided. However, \u201c[principled application of stare decisis requires a court to adhere . . . to . . . precedent in the absence of some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>was wrongly decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Having failed to brief the four stare decisis factors, the defendant has not persuaded us that <em>Russell </em>must be overruled. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-5\">HICKS, Conboy and Bassett, JJ., concurred; LYNN, J., concurred specially.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b65-6\">LYNN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">concurring specially. Because my view as to the factors that may warrant overruling precedent is broader than that of the majority, <em>see State v. Quintero, </em>162 N.H. 526, 543-47 (2011) (Lynn, J., concurring specially), I arguably would be more willing than the majority to overrule <em>State v. Russell, </em>159 N.H. 475 (2009), if I thought that case had been wrongly decided. But I do not believe <em>Russell </em>was wrongly decided; and insofar as the defendant argues that <em>Russell </em>is fundamentally at odds with our decision in <em>State v. Kousounadis, </em>159 N.H. 413 (2009), I tend to believe that it is <em>Kousounadis, </em>not <em>Russell, </em>that is ripe for reexamination. <em>See Kousounadis, </em>159 N.H. at 429-34 (Dalianis, J., joined by Hicks, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
