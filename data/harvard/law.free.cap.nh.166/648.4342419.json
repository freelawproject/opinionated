Kassotis, appeals a decision of the Superior Court <em>(Kissinger, </em>J.) dismissing his complaint, arising from the nonrenewal of his employment contract, against the respondent, the Town of Fitzwilliam (Town). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order and the record, or are otherwise undisputed. The petitioner and the Town entered into an employment contract (contract) under which the petitioner agreed to serve as the Town\u2019s Chief of Police for a two-year term beginning April 1, 2011, and ending April 1, 2013. The contract provided that it would \u201ccontinue in full force and effect from its expiration date until a new contract has been mutually agreed upon unless one party notifies the other party of its intent not to negotiate a renewal of the contract within one hundred and fifty (150) days of its expiration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">By letter dated. November 1, 2012, the Board of Selectmen of the Town (Selectmen) provided the petitioner with notice that, \u201cunder the terms of the [contract], and in accordance with Section 14. Length of Contract,... we do not intend to negotiate a renewal of the contract.\u201d The November 1, 2012, notice further provided: \u201c[T]his notice should not be construed to imply that we do not wish to continue your employment with the town. It is not the current intention of the town to terminate your employment at this time.\u201d By letter dated April 1, 2013, the contract\u2019s expiration date, the Selectmen provided a second notice stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">This will confirm that the Board of Selectmen has decided not to renew [the contract]. Accordingly, your last day of employment with the Town will be April 1, 2013, at which point your employment with the Town will end due to expiration of the two year term of employment and non-renewal of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">On May 15, 2013, the petitioner filed a complaint against the Town seeking, among other things, reinstatement as Chief of Police, damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees, for the Town\u2019s alleged failure to comply with RSA 105:2-a, which provides procedural protections to appointed chiefs of police who are \u201cdismiss[ed].\u201d RSA 105:2-a (2013). The Town moved to dismiss, arguing that, \u201c[b]eeause the Petitioner was not dismissed, RSA 105:2-a does not apply, and he fails to state a claim for relief.\u201d The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>granted the Town\u2019s motion on the basis that \u201cthe provisions of RSA 105:2-a are inapplicable to the [Town\u2019s] decision not to renew the employment contract.\u201d Specifically, it found, in pertinent part, that the petitioner \u201centered into a contract which provided that his employment relationship with the Town was for a set term. The fact that the Town exercised its right not to renew that contractual relationship did not constitute a \u2018dismissal\u2019 under the statute.\u201d The court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, we consider whether the allegations in the [petitioner\u2019s] pleadings are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery.\u201d <em>England v. Brianas, </em>166 N.H. 369, 371 (2014). \u201cWe assume that the [petitioner\u2019s] factual allegations are true and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We need not, however, assume the truth of statements that are merely conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We then engage in a threshold inquiry, testing the facts alleged in the pleadings against the applicable law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018We will uphold the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss if the facts pleaded do not constitute a basis for legal relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">On appeal, the petitioner argues that the trial court\u2019s dismissal order \u201cwrongly holds that RSA 105:2-a ... is inapplicable to the case . . . and therefore wrongly concludes that the Selectmen did not effectuate Chief Kassotis\u2019 <em>\u2018dismissal\u2019 </em>under the statute.\u201d He also argues, based upon \u201cthe significant statutory protections afforded appointed police chiefs under RSA 105:2-a\u201d and \u201csound public policy regarding protecting appointed police chiefs from effective <em>\u2018dismissal\u2019 </em>by use of <em>\u2018set term\u2019 </em>contracts,\u201d that \u201cthe two year term of [the contract] must be disregarded\u201d and he \u201cshould be reinstated\u201d as police chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">A determination of whether the court erred requires that we examine the language of RSA 105:2-a. \u2018We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Town of Newbury v. N.H. Fish &amp; Game Dep\u2019t, </em>165 N.H. 142, 144 (2013) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018We also interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018We review issues of statutory interpretation <em>de novo.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>RSA 105:2-a provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">[E]ach chief of police ... of any city or town who is appointed rather than elected... shall be subject to suspension without pay or dismissal only for cause, and after he or she has been presented with a written specification of the reasons. Upon such suspension or dismissal, he or she shall be entitled to a hearing, on the merits and reasonableness of the action, in superior court in the county in which the municipality is located, provided that he or she petitions the clerk of the superior court for such a hearing within 45 days of his or her suspension or dismissal. The court shall have the power to affirm, modify, or negate such suspension or dismissal, based upon its findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">RSA 105:2-a. Because the statute does not define \u201cdismissal,\u201d <em>id., </em>we will construe the term according to its \u201ccommon and approved usage.\u201d <em>Town of Bartlett Bd. of Selectmen v. Town of Bartlett Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>164 N.H. 757, 761 (2013) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Town of Barrington v. Townsend, </em>164 N.H. 241, 246 (2012). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cdismissal,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201c[a] release or discharge from employment.\u201d Black\u2019S Law Dictionary 537 (9th ed. 2009). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary similarly defines \u201cdismiss,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cto send or remove from employment.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 652 (unabridged ed. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The petitioner argues that \u201c[t]he Fitzwilliam Selectmen\u2019s decision neither to renew the Chief Contract nor to negotiate a new contract constituted a <em>\u2018dismissal\u2019 </em>under RSA 105:2-a ...[,] thereby affording [him] the substantial, procedural protections\u201d of the statute. He argues that, \u201c[b]ut for the notices given by the Selectmen [on November 1,2012, and on April 1, 2013], [he] would have continued to serve as Fitzwilliam Police Chief.\u201d In particular, he argues that \u201c[t]he effect of the latter notice from the Selectmen (the 04/01/2013 letter) was to <em>\u2018remove\u2019 </em>or to <em>\u2018discharge\u2019 </em>[him] from his <em>\u2018service\u2019 </em>or his <em>\u2018employment \u2019 \u201d </em>thereby constituting a dismissal under the statute, \u201cin light of the common dictionary definition of the term.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The Town argues that it did not dismiss the petitioner, but \u201c[i]nstead ... exercised its right \u2014 plainly provided in the Contract \u2014 to elect not to negotiate a new contract.\u201d As support for this argument, it cites cases from other jurisdictions holding, in the context of employment contract nonrenewal, that \u201c[a] dismissal is not the same as a nonrenewal of a contract.\u201d <em>Laurano v. Superintendent Schools of Saugus, </em>945 N.E.2d 933, 934 (Mass. 2011) (quotation omitted) (\u201cThe decision not to rehire a teacher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>on the expiration of his or her term of employment cannot be equated to dismissal of a teacher during his or her term of employment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We agree with the Town. While we need not here define the precise parameters of \u201cdismissal\u201d as used in RSA 105:2-a, we conclude that a definition encompassing the Town\u2019s nonrenewal of the petitioner\u2019s expiring term contract \u201cis not consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the word.\u201d <em>State v. Thiel, </em>160 N.H. 462, 466 (2010). We note that courts in other jurisdictions are in accord. For example, in <em>Brown v. Independent School District No. I-06, </em>974 F.2d 1237 (10th Cir. 1992), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit interpreted an analogous Oklahoma statute mandating that certain employees of boards of education be \u201csubject to . . . termination only for cause.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>974 F.2d at 1239 (quotation omitted). In determining whether the statute\u2019s protections applied to covered employees whose annual contracts were not renewed, the court held, as a matter of law, that, \u201cin the context of the language of [the statute], failure to renew is not the equivalent of an affirmative act of termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240. <em>Accord Chijide v. Maniilaq Ass\u2019n of Kotzebue, </em>972 P.2d 167, 172 (Alaska 1999) (holding that nonrenewal of plaintiffs year-to-year contract did not constitute \u201cfir[ing] her for cause,\u201d and that internal communication regarding the nonrenewal \u201c[did] not convert the non-renewal into a dismissal for cause\u201d); <em>Hicks v. KNTV Television, Inc., </em>73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 240, 249 n.4 (Ct. App. 2008) (\u201c[P]laintiff was not terminated in the generally understood sense of that word. Plaintiffs contract expired. Plaintiffs expectation that the contract would be renewed does not mean that he was discharged. His employment ended by operation of the contract.\u201d); <em>Cannon County Bd. of Educ. v. Wade, </em>No. M2006-02001-COA-R3-CV, 2008 WL 3069466, at *10 n.14 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 31, 2008) (\u201cThe non-renewal of an untenured teacher\u2019s contract is not. . . the same as a termination or dismissal. Generally applicable rules of contract law distinguish between a failure to renew a contract and a termination of that contract during its term, and those rules apply to employment contracts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Accordingly, we conclude, as a matter of law, that RSA 105:2-a does not apply to the Town\u2019s nonrenewal of the petitioner\u2019s employment contract. <em>See Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396, 399 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Finally, because we conclude that RSA 105:2-a is clear on its face, we decline to address the petitioner\u2019s further arguments, based upon legislative intent and public policy, that RSA 105:2-a\u2019s \u201csignificant statutory protections\u201d warrant us to \u201cdisregardf ]\u201d the contract\u2019s two-year term. <em>Cf. Appeal of Coos County Comm\u2019rs, </em>166 N.H. 379, 387 (2014) (\u201cBecause the statute is clear on its face, we decline to address the [petitioner\u2019s] further arguments... based upon legislative intent or public policy.\u201d). Such analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>would require us to look beyond the text of the statute \u2014 which does not limit the enforceability of term contracts \u2014 in order to \u201cconsider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Town of Newbury, </em>165 N.H. at 144 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b673-5\">\u00dcALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
