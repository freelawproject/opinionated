We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">The record establishes the following facts. The complainant is the defendant\u2019s daughter. She alleged that the defendant began \u201cdoing stuff that was not appropriate\u201d in April 2007, when she was fourteen years old. She alleged that the inappropriate behavior occurred on Monday evenings, when her mother took one of her siblings to gymnastics. The complainant testified that on some of those evenings, the defendant would \u201cput in a video\u201d for her younger siblings to watch and would then \u201cpull [her] into the bedroom.\u201d On other occasions, the complainant would already be in her bedroom. On those occasions, because the complainant\u2019s bedroom door would not lock, the defendant would put a book under it so that her siblings would not enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The complainant testified that the first time the defendant took her into her bedroom, he asked her to undress, and when she refused, forcibly-undressed her. Once she was undressed, the defendant \u201cstraddled\u201d her and \u201cplay[ed]\u201d with her breasts. He then \u201cstarted moving down toward [her] vagina and... started licking around there, too.\u201d The complainant testified that a similar incident occurred a few weeks later and that similar assaults occurred \u201cprobably almost every week\u201d until November 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The complainant testified that other assaults occurred during this time period, including one in which the defendant told her that he was going to \u201cfix\u201d her back and, while she was undressed, on her hands and knees, he penetrated her anus with his finger and then with a pencil. The complainant also described two occasions when the defendant penetrated her vagina with his finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">After a jury convicted the defendant, and we upheld his convictions on appeal, he filed a motion for new trial on the ground that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the State and Federal Constitutions. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST, amends. VI, XIV. The trial court found that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in several respects, but that it was not constitutionally deficient because the defendant was not actually prejudiced by it. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The defendant contends that the performance of his trial counsel (who is not his appellate counsel) was deficient under both the State and Federal Constitutions. We first address his claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). To prevail upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must demonstrate, first, that counsel\u2019s representation was constitutionally deficient and, second, that counsel\u2019s deficient performance actually prejudiced the outcome of the case. <em>State v. Brown, </em>160 N.H. 408, 412 (2010). A failure to establish either prong requires a finding that counsel\u2019s performance was not constitutionally defective. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">To satisfy the first prong of the test, the performance prong, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Id; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). To meet this prong of the test, the defendant must show that counsel made such egregious errors that she failed to function as the counsel the State Constitution guarantees. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>161 N.H. 507, 529 (2011). We afford a high degree of deference to the strategic decisions of trial counsel, bearing in mind the limitless variety of strategic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>and tactical decisions that counsel must make. <em>Id. </em>The defendant must overcome the presumption that trial counsel reasonably adopted her trial strategy. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201ca fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">To satisfy the second prong, the pr\u00e9judice prong, the defendant must establish that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Brown, </em>160 N.H. at 413; <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>160 N.H. at 413 (quotation omitted). \u201cIn making this determination, we consider the totality of the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u201cBoth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are not supported by the evidence or are erroneous as a matter of law, and we review the ultimate determination of whether each prong is met <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The defendant challenges his counsel\u2019s failure to object to improper expert witness opinion testimony by the complainant\u2019s therapist, Robert Fusco. Fusco testified that he has forty-two years of experience treating \u201cseriously traumatized abuse[d] and neglected children.\u201d On direct examination, without objection, Fusco testified that the complainant\u2019s behaviors \u201cfit perfectly into the same kind of behavioral symptoms that we would see for a child who had been sexually abused.\u201d Fusco testified that, as a result of the complainant\u2019s January 2008 disclosure to him about the 2007 sexual assaults, he realized that \u201cwe were no longer dealing with ... a major depressive disorder,\u201d but rather \u201ca post[-]traumatic stress disorder on a child who had \u2014 who \u2014 who allegedly had been sexually abused.\u201d Fusco also testified, absent objection, that the complainant\u2019s disclosure \u201cwas the missing piece,\u201d in his treatment of her. He stated that once the complainant disclosed the sexual assaults, \u201cit all fit into place\u201d and \u201cmade sense of all of her behaviors prior to this, especially things like hygiene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The trial court stated that it could not conclude that it was objectively reasonable to allow Fusco to so opine. The trial court explained that \u201cFusco\u2019s testimony is the type of expert testimony that the Supreme Court has held may not be offered to prove that a particular child has been sexually abused.\u201d <em>See State v. Cressey, </em>137 N.H. 402, 412 (1993). The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>court was correct. Our conclusion as to this issue is compelled by settled jurisprudence, which neither party requests that we overrule.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"> We have long held that testimony of a child sexual abuse victim\u2019s specific behavior \u201cis inadmissible ... if its purpose is to prove that abuse occurred, or if the expert testifies that the particular victim\u2019s behaviors were consistent with one who had been abused.\u201d <em>State v. MacRae, </em>141 N.H. 106, 109 (1996); <em>see State v. Chamberlain, </em>137 N.H. 414, 418-19 (1993) (expert\u2019s testimony \u201cthat the behaviors of the child victim were consistent with those of a child who had been sexually abused\u201d was inadmissible and did not constitute harmless error). In effect, Fusco was allowed to opine that the complainant was a victim of child sexual abuse. Her behaviors, he testified, \u201cfit perfectly\u201d with those of a child sexual abuse victim. After the complainant disclosed the sexual assaults, Fusco diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by alleged sexual abuse. Fusco\u2019s testimony constitutes a \u201cclear example of the type of unreliable evidence that we have held should be excluded from criminal trials.\u201d <em>State v. Luce, </em>137 N.H. 419, 421, 422 (1993) (expert\u2019s testimony that victim\u2019s drawings were \u201cconsistent with those of a child who\u2019s been sexually abused\u201d was inadmissible, and \u201ctrial court\u2019s error in admitting the testimony ... cannot be considered harmless\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Defense counsel also failed to object to Fusco\u2019s testimony that the fact that the complainant\u2019s disclosure \u201ccame out of the blue ... added to its credibility.\u201d Such testimony \u201ccross[ed] the line into the impermissible realm of vouching for the [alleged] victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>State v. DeCosta, </em>146 N.H. 405, 409 (2001). \u201cOf course, expert testimony concerning a particular child witness\u2019s veracity is inadmissible because that determination is solely within the province of the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Sargent, </em>144 N.H. 103, 105 (1999) (citation omitted). In light of our abundant case law on the subject, we can conceive of no strategic purpose for defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to Fusco\u2019s improper expert witness testimony. Defense counsel\u2019s failure to object \u201ccannot reasonably have been said to have been part of a trial strategy or tactical choice.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>161 N.H. at 530 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u201cTurning now to the prejudice prong, the prejudice in this case was manifest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532. \u201cAs in most sexual assault cases, this case turned on the complainant[\u2019s] credibility.\u201d <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>144 N.H. 205, 209 (1999). However, because of defense counsel\u2019s errors, that credibility was impermissibly bolstered. Because defense counsel failed to object, the jury heard from an expert, with forty-two years of experience, that the complainant\u2019s behaviors \u201cfit perfectly\u201d with those of a child sexual abuse victim <em>and </em>that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>alleged sexual assault. Because defense counsel failed to object, the jury heard that, in the expert\u2019s view, the fact that the complainant\u2019s disclosure \u201ccame out of the blue,\u201d made her allegations more credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Counsel\u2019s failures to object, in our view, \u201cwere so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687. Her conduct \u201cso undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686. Having determined that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under the State Constitution, we need not reach his federal claim. <em>See Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 237. Nor need we reach the other grounds the defendant asserts in support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
