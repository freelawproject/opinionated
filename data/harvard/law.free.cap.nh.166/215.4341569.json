Because we find that the regulation relied upon by the DMV in denying the petitioner\u2019s request is unconstitutionally vague, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On May 4, 2010, the petitioner applied for a vanity registration plate reading \u201cCOPSLIE.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 261:89 (Supp. 2013). The petitioner stated on his application that the intended meaning of the requested vanity registration plate was \u201ccops lie.\u201d That same day, the petitioner\u2019s application was rejected because several DMV employees believed the text to be \u201cinsulting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The petitioner appealed to the director of the DMV by letter dated May 5, 2010. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 514.61(e). On May 12, the director denied the petitioner\u2019s appeal, citing the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules, Saf-C 514.61. He concluded that \u201ca reasonable person would find COPSLIE offensive to good taste.\u201d <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) (\u201c[a] vanity . . . registration plate shall . . . [n]ot be ethnically, racially or which a reasonable person would find offensive to good taste\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">On July 9, the petitioner wrote to the commissioner of safety seeking reconsideration of the DMV\u2019s decision concerning his application for the vanity registration plate. On July 14, the commissioner\u2019s office responded to the petitioner, explaining that the commissioner had reviewed the petitioner\u2019s letter and agreed with the DMV\u2019s \u201cdecision to deny the license plate, for the same reasons which were set forth\u201d by the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">On August 30, the petitioner again applied for a vanity registration plate. This time, he listed \u201cCOPSLIE\u201d as his first choice, but also provided alternative choices, in order of preference, as follows: \u201cGR8GOVT,\u201d \u201cLUVGOVT,\u201d \u201cGOVTSUX,\u201d \u201cSEALPAC,\u201d and \u201cGOVTLAZ.\u201d The DMV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>denied the petitioner\u2019s first choice as \u201cinsulting,\u201d but issued the petitioner a vanity registration plate with the alternative text \u201cGR8GOVT.\u201d That same day, the petitioner surrendered the \u201cGR8GOVT\u201d vanity registration plate for standard registration plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Thereafter, the petitioner sought an injunction directing the DMV to issue him a vanity registration plate with the text \u201cCOPSLIE,\u201d as well as a permanent injunction enjoining the DMV from recalling the vanity registration plate. He also argued that Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) violates the right to free speech guaranteed under both Part I, Article 22 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. By order dated July 3,2012, the trial court upheld the DMV\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s requested vanity registration plate, finding no violation of the petitioner\u2019s right to free speech under the State or Federal Constitutions, and dismissed the petition. The petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">On appeal, the petitioner argues that the trial court erred by ruling that the DMV did not violate his free speech rights under the State and Federal Constitutions. He contends that vanity registration plates constitute a \u201cdesignated public forum\u201d and that the DMV\u2019s denial of his vanity registration plate was not narrowly tailored to serve a legitimate or compelling government interest. In the alternative, he contends that, if vanity registration plates are a \u201cnonpublic forum,\u201d the restrictions in Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) \u201care not viewpoint-neutral, for what one considers \u2018offensive\u2019 is fundamentally a matter of viewpoint.\u201d The petitioner also raises a facial challenge to Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) on the grounds that the regulation is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We first address the petitioner\u2019s claims under our State Constitution, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226,231-32 (1983), and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis, <em>id. </em>at 233. We review the constitutionality of state regulations <em>de novo. See Doyle v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Dep\u2019t of Resources &amp; Economic Dev., </em>163 N.H. 215, 220 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">We begin by noting that, although in his brief the petitioner refers generally to Saf-C 514.61(c)(3), the trial court found that the petitioner\u2019s challenge was to the regulation prohibiting vanity registration plates \u201cwhich a reasonable person would find offensive to good taste,\u201d and that the petitioner did not \u201csquarely challenge the regulatory restriction of plates related to ethnicity or race.\u201d <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 514.61(c)(3). Because the petitioner has not appealed that finding, we confine our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>analysis to the language in the regulation prohibiting vanity registration plates \u201cwhich a reasonable person would find offensive to good taste.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\n<em>A. Forum Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Part I, Article 22 of our State Constitution provides: \u201cFree speech and liberty of the press are essential to the security of freedom in a state: They ought, therefore, to be inviolably preserved.\u201d N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 22. Similarly, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the passage of laws \u201cabridging the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend I. It applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Lovell v. Griffin, </em>303 U.S. 444, 450 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The First Amendment\u2019s \u201cFree Speech Clause restricts government regulation of private, not government, speech.\u201d <em>Children First Foundation, Inc. v. Martinez, </em>829 F. Supp. 2d 47, 54 (N.D.N.Y. 2011). \u201cIt is well established that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls.\u201d <em>Perry v. McDonald, </em>280 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted). Here, because neither party has argued otherwise, we will assume, without deciding, that the speech at issue in this case is private speech and that vanity registration plates are government property.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u201cIn evaluating government regulations concerning private individuals\u2019 speech on government-owned property, the Supreme Court has identified three categories of forums \u2014 the traditional public forum, the designated public forum, and the nonpublic forum and \u2014 has developed a body of law styled \u2018forum analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.; see also HippoPress v. SMG, </em>150 N.H. 304, 312 (2003). The parties do not dispute that vanity registration plates are not a traditional public forum. The petitioner argues that by enacting RSA 261:89 to allow for vanity registration plates, the State intended to create a designated public forum. Thus, he contends that any restrictions on the messages displayed on vanity registration plates must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. <em>See HippoPress, </em>150 N.H. at 312 (explaining that restrictions on speech in a designated public forum are subject to highest scrutiny and survive only if they are narrowly drawn to achieve a compelling state interest). The DMV disagrees, arguing that vanity registration plates constitute a nonpublic forum and therefore any restrictions need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral. <em>See id. </em>at 312-13 (explaining that restrictions on speech in a nonpublic forum must be reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression based on the speaker\u2019s viewpoint).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">We need not decide what type of forum a vanity registration plate is because we conclude that the challenged restriction in Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>facially unconstitutional regardless of the forum. <em>See Airport Comm\u2019rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 569, 573-74 (1987); <em>Lewis v. Wilson, </em>253 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir. 2001). Nonetheless, we express some skepticism about characterizing vanity registration plates as a designated public forum given that individuals must obtain permission in order to gain access to the forum, <em>see </em>RSA 261:89; N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 514.61(e), (d). <em>See Sons of Confederate v. Comm\u2019r of Va. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>288 F.3d 610, 622 n.10 (4th Cir. 2002) (explaining that in nonpublic forum \u201cgovernment reserve[s] eligibility for access to the forum to a particular class of speakers, whose members must then, as individuals, obtain permission to use\u201d forum (quotations and ellipsis omitted)). Moreover, as the petitioner acknowledges, the primary function of vanity registration plates is to serve as a means of \u201cvehicle identification,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 259:85 (2004); N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 514.61(c)(8). <em>See Perry, </em>280 F.3d at 167 (determining that Vermont did not intend to create designated public forum when it established vanity license plate regime, in part, because \u201cstated policy in issuing license plates, including vanity plates, is to aid in vehicle identification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<em>B. Facial Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The petitioner argues that the restriction at issue in Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) is facially invalid because it is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. He maintains that \u201c \u2018[t]he offensive to good taste\u2019 standard ... promulgated by [Saf-C 514.61(c)(3)] casts too wide a net, and encroaches on the realm of protected speech\u201d and \u201cis implemented by [the] DMV to mean \u2018any point of view with which the DMV disagrees.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The DMV argues preliminarily that the petitioner \u201cimproperly merges the concepts of vagueness and overbreadth\u201d and that, in any event, the petitioner has not adequately briefed the vagueness issue. The DMV therefore concludes that the vagueness issue should be deemed waived. We disagree. In his brief, the petitioner separately challenges the restriction at issue as both unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally overbroad, and has sufficiently briefed these issues for our review. We, therefore, turn to the merits of the petitioner\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u201cIn the First Amendment context, courts are especially concerned about overbroad and vague laws that may have a chilling effect on speech.\u201d <em>Act Now to Stop War v. District of Columbia, </em>905 F. Supp. 2d 317, 329 (D.D.C. 2012). \u201cCourts are suspicious of broad prophylactic rules in the area of free expression, and therefore precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201cAlthough not identical, vagueness and overbreadth challenges in the First Amendment context are alternative and often overlapping grounds for the same relief, namely invalidation of the offending regulation.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Pugh, </em>425 F.3d 820, 827 (10th Cir. 2005); <em>see also Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983) (\u201c[W]e have traditionally viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines.\u201d); <em>Act Now to Stop War, </em>905 F. Supp. 2d at 330 (\u201cThe doctrines of substantial overbreadth and vagueness often overlap, and Courts frequently blend them together.\u201d); <em>State v. Princess Cinema of Milwaukee, </em>292 N.W.2d 807, 813 (Wis. 1980) (\u201cThe problems of vagueness and overbreadth in statutes, although raising separate problems, often arise together.\u201d). \u201cThe same evils are addressed, <em>i.e., </em>application of the statute\u2019s sanctions to protected activity and deterrence of others from engaging in similar conduct, and the same remedies are available, <em>ie., </em>a narrowing interpretation or facial invalidation.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>446 F. Supp. 890, 897 (D. Conn. 1978). \u201cAs a result, some courts have made no attempt to distinguish the two doctrines when measuring a statute against the requirements of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.) see, e.g., Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, </em>505 U.S. 123, 129-30 (1992) (\u201c[A] party [may] challenge an ordinance under the overbreadth doctrine in cases where every application creates an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas, such as an ordinance that delegates overly broad discretion to the decisionmaker, and in cases where the ordinance sweeps too broadly, penalizing a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 551 (1965) (\u201cThe statute at issue in this case ... is unconstitutionally vague in its overly broad scope.\u201d); <em>Jordan, </em>425 F.3d at 828 (\u201cOverbreadth and vagueness may overlap when the challenged statute is so unclear in its scope that officials enforce it in an overbroad manner.\u201d). With this in mind, we address whether Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) is unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The petitioner argues that the restriction in Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) is unconstitutionally vague because it is \u201cso loosely constrained\u201d that it \u201cauthorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The vagueness doctrine, \u201coriginally a due process doctrine, applies when the statutory language is unclear, and is concerned with notice to the potential wrongdoer and prevention of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>446 F. Supp. at 897; <em>see also State v. MacElman, </em>154 N.H. 304, 307 (2006) (explaining that vagueness may invalidate a statute for either of two independent reasons: (1) it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits; or (2) it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>natory enforcement). \u201cA vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972). \u201cThe absence of clear standards guiding the discretion of the public official vested with the authority to enforce the enactment invites abuse by enabling the official to administer the policy on the basis of impermissible factors.\u201d <em>United Food v. Southwest Ohio Regional Transit, </em>163 F.3d 341, 359 (6th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Thus, the vagueness doctrine serves to \u201c[rein] in the discretion of enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Act Now to Stop War, </em>905 F. Supp. 2d at 330. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cif arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 108. In particular, \u201cwhere a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109 (quotations and brackets omitted). \u201cUncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We recognize that \u201cperfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008) (quotation omitted). \u201cCondemned to the use of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 110. Nonetheless, when First Amendment interests are at stake, \u201c[c]ourts apply the vagueness doctrine with special exactitude.\u201d <em>Act Now to Stop War, </em>905 F. Supp. 2d at 351. Thus, when a regulation, like Saf-C 514.61(c)(3), \u201crequires that a speaker receive permission to engage in speech, the official charged with granting the permission must be provided specific standards on which to base his or her decisions.\u201d <em>Lems, </em>253 F.3d at 1080. \u2018Without such standards, every application of the regulation creates an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c[T]his principle applies with as much force to civil statutes as it does to criminal laws.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"> When considering whether the challenged restriction in Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) is unconstitutionally vague, we begin with the language of the regulation. <em>See Act Now to Stop War, </em>905 F. Supp. 2d at 347; <em>cf. Appeal of Town of Nottingham, </em>153 N.H. 539, 546 (2006) (\u201cThe starting point in any statutory interpretation case is the language of the statute.\u201d (quotation omitted)). The challenged portion of the regulation prohibits vanity registration plates that \u201ca reasonable person would find offensive to good taste.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>N.H. Admin. RULES, Saf-C 514.61(c)(3). The phrase \u201coffensive to good taste\u201d is not defined in the regulation. Further, to the extent the phrase could be construed to prohibit obscene material, we note that a separate provision in the regulation prohibits vanity registration plates that are \u201ccapable of an obscene interpretation.\u201d N.H. Admin. RULES, Saf-C 514.61(c)(2); <em>cf. Winnacunnet Coop. Sch. Dist. v. Town of Seabrook, </em>148 N.H. 519, 525-26 (2002) (\u201cWhen construing a statute, we must give effect to all words in a statute and presume that the legislature did not enact superfluous or redundant words.\u201d). To discern the meaning of \u201coffensive to good taste,\u201d we will look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used. <em>N.H. Residents Ltd. Partners of Lyme Timber Co. v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>162 N.H. 98, 101 (2011) (\u2018When construing statutes and administrative regulations, we first examine the language used, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to words used\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The word \u201coffensive\u201d means, in relevant part, \u201ccausing displeasure or resentment : giving offense: INSULTING, AFFRONTING.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S Third New International Dictionary 1566 (unabridged ed. 2002). As pertinent here, \u201cgood\u201d is defined as \u201cconforming to a certain ideal or standard of morality or virtue: wholly commendable: VIRTUOUS, PURE\u201d and \u201cconforming to some abstract standard or ideal (as of prudent conduct or proper condition): RIGHT, DESIRABLE, WISE.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978. \u201c[G]ood\u201d is also defined as \u201csomething that possesses desirable qualities, promotes success, welfare, or happiness, or is otherwise beneficial\u201d and \u201csomething that satisfies or commends itself to the ethical consciousness or is conceived as fitting in the moral order of the universe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201ctaste\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201cindividual preference: LIKING, RELISH, FONDNESS, INCLINATION.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2343. Taken together, these definitions lead to various potential interpretations of the phrase \u201coffensive to good taste.\u201d For example, one such interpretation could be that no vanity registration plates are allowed that are \u201cinsulting to the standard of morality or virtue of individual preference.\u201d This reading alone demonstrates the arbitrariness of determining whether a vanity registration plate is \u201coffensive to good taste.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We acknowledge that the phrase \u201coffensive to good taste\u201d is modified by the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard. <em>See </em>N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Saf-C 514.61(c)(3). However, this modifier fails to provide sufficient guidance to DMV officials in determining which vanity registration plates shall be authorized. \u201cReasonable people frequently come to different conclusions.\u201d <em>Act Now to Stop War, </em>905 F. Supp. 2d at 348; <em>cf. Coates v. City of Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 611, 614 (1971) (finding ordinance that made it a criminal offense for \u201cthree or more persons to assemble on any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sidewalks and there conduct themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by\u201d unconstitutionally vague because \u201c[cjonduct that annoys some people does not annoy others\u201d (quotation and ellipsis omitted)). Indeed, speech that one reasonable person finds \u201coffensive to good taste\u201d may not be offensive to the good taste of another reasonable person. As the United States District Court for the District of Maine stated thirty years ago, \u201c[f]ree public expression cannot be burdened with governmental predictions or assessments of what a discrete populace will think about good or bad \u2018taste.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanton by Stanton v. Brunswick School Dept., </em>577 F. Supp. 1560, 1572, 1574 (D. Me. 1984) (concluding that prohibition of quotation in high school yearbook \u201con the basis of a standard of \u2018poor taste\u2019 \u201d was vague and uncertain and did not pass constitutional muster). \u201cIf the intellectual and ideological ferment of the last four decades of the American social experience teaches anything, it teaches us that whatever may be the accepted meaning of \u2018good taste\u2019 on any given day, the content of that meaning does not rigidly abide through time.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>1574. Because the \u201coffensive to good taste\u201d standard is not susceptible of objective definition, the restriction grants DMV officials the power to deny a proposed vanity registration plate because it offends particular officials\u2019 subjective idea of what is \u201cgood taste.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">To the extent the DMV argues that its reasoning for denying the petitioner\u2019s requested vanity registration plate in this case aids in interpreting the phrase \u201coffensive to good taste,\u201d we disagree. The DMV initially denied the petitioner\u2019s request because several DMV employees believed the text to be \u201cinsulting.\u201d The DMV then argued that the phrase was applied \u201cto exclude . . . accusation^] of moral turpitude.\u201d We are not persuaded that these interpretations clarify or explain the meaning of \u201coffensive to good taste\u201d so as to render it constitutionally sufficient. Moreover, we question whether prohibition of accusations of moral turpitude would constitute \u201cviewpoint-neutral\u201d regulation. Regardless, in order to construe the phrase to avoid unfettered discretion in enforcement, we would have to add or delete text to the regulation. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The DMV further maintains that \u201cthe concept of vagueness is inapplicable\u201d in this case because the disputed language \u201cis not a prohibition on the [petitioner\u2019s] conduct but rather a standard by which State employees are to discharge their duties.\u201d As explained above, a regulation may be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague when \u201cit authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>MacElman, </em>154 N.H. at 307. The challenged restriction in Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) does just that. As a result, it is precisely the type of restriction that the vagueness doctrine serves to protect against. <em>See Act Now to Stop War, </em>905 F. Supp. 2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>330-31, 348; <em>see also United Food, </em>163 F.3d at 360 (concluding that term \u201caesthetically pleasing\u201d in authority\u2019s advertising policy \u201cinvites arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement\u201d); <em>cf. Penthouse Intern., Ltd. v. Koch, </em>599 F. Supp. 1338, 1351 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (concluding that \u201coffensive to good taste\u201d language used to determine acceptability of advertisements in subway stations was \u201ctoo vague and subjective to meaningfully circumscribe the discretion of subway officials\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We conclude that the restriction in Saf-C 514.61(c)(3) prohibiting vanity registration plates that are \u201coffensive to good taste\u201d on its face \u201cauthorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,\u201d <em>see MacElman, </em>154 N.H. at 307, and is, therefore, unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, we hold that, on its face, this restriction violates the right to free speech guaranteed by Part I, Article 22 of the State Constitution. In light of our decision, we need not address the petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments, including his arguments under the Federal Constitution. <em>See Doyle, </em>163 N.H. at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union (NHCLU), as <em>amicus curiae, </em>has filed a motion for leave to file late authority, to which the petitioner assents. The DMV objects. Because our ruling today does not rely upon the authority cited by the NHCLU, we decline to rule upon the NHCLU\u2019s motion as it is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, Lynn and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
