The City argues that the trial court erroneously ruled that RSA chapter 322 preempts the City\u2019s ordinances regulating junk and scrap metal dealers. RSA ch. 322 (2011 &amp; Supp. 2013). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">The trial court found the following facts to be undisputed. Prolerized is engaged in the business of scrap metal recycling, and operates two scrap metal recycling centers in Manchester. There is one other licensed scrap metal yard within the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">In 1995, the City adopted an ordinance requiring scrap metal dealers to maintain for inspection certain records regarding every transaction as a condition to the license to operate within the City. MANCHESTER, N.H., Code OF Ordinances \u00a7 114.03(B) (1995). The ordinance required dealers to document the proven identity of the seller, the date of the transaction, and to maintain an accurate, detailed description of each item purchased. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">In 2012, in an effort to combat the growing problem of scrap metal theft, the City adopted \u00a7 114.03(C), which requires scrap metal dealers to prepare transaction records electronically \u201cas directed by the Chief of Police or his designee,\u201d and to forward them \u201cto the Police Department or authorized data storage site ... no later than 24 hours after completion of the transaction.\u201d MANCHESTER, ORDINANCES \u00a7 114.03(C) (2012). Subsection 114.03(C) also requires that the electronic transaction records include a digital photograph of the scrap metal seller and a color digital photograph of all items sold in the transaction. <em>Id. </em>The City also adopted \u00a7 114.03(D), which requires dealers to include a complete and accurate description of the seller\u2019s vehicle, as well as \u00a7 114.03(E), which levies a fee of fifty cents per electronic transaction for which a record must be prepared pursuant to \u00a7 114.03. Manchester, Ordinances \u00a7 114.03(D), (E) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 114.03(C), the City designated a private company, LeadsOnline, as the authorized storage site for the electronic transaction records, and directed Prolerized to set up a user account and begin uploading data. Shortly thereafter, Prolerized filed a petition seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that \u00a7 114.03, as amended, is preempted by State law. Prolerized also argued that the fifty cent per transaction fee is an unlawful business tax because it raises revenues in excess of the reasonable costs to the City, and violates Prolerized\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of contract and equal protection. The City filed a motion to dismiss, and Prolerized filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the City\u2019s motion to dismiss and entered summary judgment for Prolerized, ruling that State law preempted \u00a7 114.03. Because of its preemption ruling, the trial court did not consider whether \u00a7 114.03 imposes an unlawful business tax or violates constitutional protections. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts in its summary judgment ruling.\u201d <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas v. City of Concord, </em>164 N.H. 14, 15 (2012) (quotation omitted). \u2018We consider all of the evidence presented in the record, and all inferences properly drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. \u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On appeal, the City argues that its ordinance \u201crelative to transaction fees, digital record keeping, and digital reporting neither expressly contradicts the statute nor intrudes upon an area reserved to the exclusive control of the General Court.\u201d Prolerized counters that the trial court properly concluded that, because \u00a7 114.03 and RSA chapter 322 conflict, the state statutory scheme preempts the City\u2019s ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\n<em>I. General Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\u201cPreemption is essentially a matter of statutory interpretation and construction.\u201d <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, </em>164 N.H. at 16 (quotation omitted). \u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>\u2018We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnless we find statutory language to be ambiguous, we will not examine legislative history.\u201d <em>Clare v. Town of Hudson, </em>160 N.H. 378, 384-85 (2010) (quotation omitted). \u201cFurthermore, we interpret statutes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, </em>164 N.H. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"> \u201cPreemption may be express or implied.\u201d <em>N. Country Envtl. Servs. v. Town of Bethlehem, </em>150 N.H. 606, 611 (2004). Express preemption is not claimed here. One form of implied preemption exists \u201cwhen there is an actual conflict between State and local regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, \u201c[a] conflict exists when a municipal ordinance or regulation permits that which a State statute prohibits or vice versa.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even when a local ordinance does not expressly conflict with a State statute, it will be preempted when it frustrates the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> A second form of \u201c[i]mplied preemption may be found when the comprehensiveness and detail of the State statutory' scheme evinces legislative intent to supersede local regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen the State has preempted the entire regulatory field, <em>any </em>local law on the subject is preempted, regardless of whether the terms of the local and State law conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612. Nonetheless, \u201c[t]he mere fact that a state law contains detailed and comprehensive regulations of a subject does not, of itself, establish the intent of the legislature to occupy the entire field to the exclusion of local legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo determine whether the legislature has intended to occupy the field, the court may look to the whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme and need not find such intent solely in the statutory language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe very nature of the regulated subject matter may demand exclusive state regulation to achieve the uniformity necessary to serve the state\u2019s purpose or interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">[T]he following questions are pertinent in determining whether the state has preempted the field: does the ordinance conflict with state law; is the state law, expressly or impliedly, to be exclusive; does the subject matter reflect a need for uniformity; is the state scheme so pervasive or comprehensive that it precludes coexistence of municipal regulation; and does the ordinance stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 611-12 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">\n<em>II. Comprehensiveness of State Statutory Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">RSA chapter 322 delegates to local authorities the general regulation of junk and scrap metal dealers. The legislature granted authority to \u201c[t]he governing body of any town, city, or unincorporated place\u201d to license, \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>[its] discretion,\u201d junk and scrap metal dealers within the municipality. RSA 322:1 (2011). Local boards are authorized to issue and revoke licenses and \u201cestablish rules, regulations and restrictions,\u201d each of which \u201cshall be incorporated in the license.\u201d RSA 322:2 (2011). These boards may designate the location for junk and scrap metal dealers to conduct business and to store their wares, RSA 322:1, and may, by regulation, designate areas of the city where these operations are prohibited. RSA 322:6 (2011). A dealer must keep \u201crecords sufficient to the licensing authority\u201d \u2014 that is, the same municipal body \u2014 \u201cof the accumulation, storage, and handling of commodities as a junk or scrap metal dealer.\u201d RSA 322:6-a (2011). RSA chapter 322 does not give the State a role in governing the management or operations of junk and scrap metal dealers. Thus, \u201c[t]he design of the statute is to localize the junk-business, as well as to confine it to conduct by proper persons.\u201d <em>Belmont v. Parent, </em>90 N.H. 249, 252 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Prolerized argues that RSA 322:6-a, RSA 322:7 (2011), and RSA 322:11 (2011) evince a legislative intent to establish a uniform statewide system of regulating junk and scrap metal dealers. However, each of these provisions grants control to the local board. Although RSA 322:6-a requires that the transaction records include certain information, it also requires each licensee to \u201ckeep records sufficient to the licensing authority,\u201d <em>ie., </em>the local board. RSA 322:7 authorizes any officer with jurisdiction to enter the licensed premises, which would include local law enforcement. <em>See </em>63 C. J.S. <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 632 (explaining powers of police officers), \u00a7 633 (generally the powers conferred on police officer must be exercised within territorial limits of municipality) (2011). RSA 322:11 requires a local board to establish the license fee and dictates that the fee be paid into the treasury of the city or town where the license is in force. Thus, not only do these provisions fail to demonstrate a legislative intent to preempt municipal control, they demonstrate precisely the opposite: an intent to delegate control to local entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Prolerized cites <em>JTR Colebrook v. Town of Colebrook, </em>149 N.H. 767 (2003), in support of its claim. In <em>JTR Colebrook, </em>we held that the State Indoor Smoking Act preempted a municipal ordinance that prohibited smoking in any restaurant for public health reasons with certain strictly limited exceptions. <em>JTR Colebrook, </em>149 N.H. at 768-70 (explaining statute), 773. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">RSA 155:77 provides that: \u201cNothing in this subdivision shall be construed to permit smoking where smoking is prohibited by any other provision of law or rule relative to fire protection, safety and sanitation.\u201d We interpret this provision according to its plain meaning and hold that it permits additional municipal regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>of smoking only with respect to fire protection, safety and sanitation, not with respect to public health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 771. Here, in contrast, RSA chapter 322 contains no such limited authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Significantly, in <em>JTR Colebrook, </em>we concluded that, given the comprehensiveness of the State Indoor Smoking Act and the balancing of multiple interests, it was \u201chighly improbable that the legislature . . . intended to leave the ultimate public health regulation of indoor restaurant smoking to the vagaries of local regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In comparison, here, the legislature has specifically delegated the regulation of junk and scrap metal dealers to local authorities. RSA 322:1, :2; :6.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Therefore, we hold that RSA chapter 322 does not constitute a comprehensive and detailed State regulatory scheme of junk and scrap metal dealers that occupies the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">\n<em>A. Record-Keeping</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Our conclusion that the State regulatory scheme does not occupy the field does not end our inquiry because municipal ordinances are nonetheless implicitly preempted if they conflict with state law. <em>See, e.g., N. Country Envtl. Servs., </em>150 N.H. at 611. Prolerized argues that \u00a7 114.03(C) and (D) are preempted because they impose stricter record-keeping requirements than are authorized under RSA chapter 322. Specifically, it argues that: (1) the amended ordinance imposes more detailed record-keeping requirements than do RSA 322:6-a and RSA 322:7; and (2) RSA chapter 322 does not impose an affirmative obligation to transmit records, but only requires dealers to keep records. Prolerized also challenges the terms and conditions imposed by the City\u2019s designee as contrary to the statute. Because, as Prolerized notes, extension of this argument raises issues \u201cnot directly germane to the issue on appeal (i.e. preemption),\u201d we limit our review to Prolerized\u2019s argument that RSA chapter 322 does not authorize a local board to require a licensee to enter into a contract with a private third party. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">First, Prolerized argues that RSA 322:6-a evinces a legislative intent to preempt ordinances such as \u00a7 114.03(C) and (D), which require more detailed record-keeping requirements. Specifically, Prolerized contends that \u201c[h]ad the legislature intended to allow municipalities to impose striet[er] requirements on scrap metal dealers concerning recordkeeping and handling, it could have explicitly done so <em>like it did in RSA 322:1, 322:2 and 322:6.\u201d </em>(Quotation omitted.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u201cAn ordinance which merely enlarges upon the provision of a statute by requiring more restrictions than the statute requires creates no conflict unless the statute limits the requirement for all cases to its own terms.\u201d <em>Peak v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>73 So. 3d 5, 19 (Ala. Crim. App. 2011) (quotation and emphasis omitted). \u201c[I]t is no objection to a municipal ordinance not in contravention of a state law that it affords additional regulation complementary to the end state legislation would effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">RSA 322:6-a provides that \u201c[e]ach person required to be licensed under this chapter shall keep records sufficient to the licensing authority of the accumulation, storage, and handling of commodities as a junk or scrap metal dealer.\u201d This provision requires a licensed dealer to maintain records that <em>the licensing authority </em>\u2014 that is, the local board \u2014 finds sufficient, thereby vesting discretion within the local board to determine what is sufficient. RSA 322:6-a also provides that the transaction records \u201cshall be legibly written in the English language and provide account and description of the goods purchased, the date and time of their purchase, and the name and residence, verified by photo identification issued by a governmental agency, of the seller.\u201d Read in light of the statute\u2019s mandate that such records be \u201csufficient to the licensing authority,\u201d these statutory requirements cannot be read as maximum allowable requirements. <em>See, e.g., In re Guardianship of Williams, </em>159 N.H. 318, 323 (2009) (\u201cthe legislature is not presumed to waste words or enact redundant provisions and... every word of a statute should be given effect\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). Because the statute vests the local licensing authority with the power to determine what additional information the records must contain to be \u201csufficient,\u201d we disagree with Prolerized that the more detailed record-keeping requirements of the ordinance conflict with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Next, Prolerized argues that RSA chapter 322 does not authorize the City to impose upon dealers the affirmative obligation to transmit transaction records to a third-party designee, but rather, only enables the City to require junk and scrap metal dealers to keep records. We disagree. The statute\u2019s mandate that dealers \u201ckeep records sufficient to the licensing authority\u201d vests discretion in the local board to determine how a junk and scrap metal dealer keeps records, including the discretion to require dealers to keep records electronically on a third-party website. <em>See </em>RSA 322:6-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Moreover, RSA 322:2 provides a local licensing authority general power to adopt rules and regulations governing licensees. RSA 322:2 states that \u201c[t]he board which grants said license . . . may from time to time establish rules, regulations and restrictions relative to the business carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>on as aforesaid.\u201d The plain language does not limit the type of ordinances that a local licensing authority can enact; consequently, under the authority of RSA 322:2, a local licensing authority may require a junk and scrap metal dealer to upload data to a third-party designee. Given that RSA 322:2 enables a local board to enact regulations governing record-keeping, it was unnecessary to repeat the identical authority in RSA 322:6-a. <em>Cf Lessee of Hannel v. Smith, </em>15 Ohio 134, 146 (1846) (\u201cBut it is at least reasonable to suppose, that the Legislature having once, in the same act, made this express provision, deemed it unnecessary to repeat the identical words in every clause of the statute where this list of forfeited lands was treated of.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Prolerized argues that the ordinance requiring the upload of data to a third party conflicts with RSA 322:7 because LeadsOnline, the City\u2019s designee, is not an \u201cofficer[ ] having jurisdiction\u201d to enter onto a dealer\u2019s premises. <em>See </em>RSA 322:7 (\u201cAny officer, having jurisdiction may enter upon any premises used by a licensee for the purpose of his or her business, ascertain how the licensee conducts business and examine all commodities purchased, obtained, kept, or stored in or upon said premises, and all books and inventories relating thereto.\u201d). However, RSA 322:7 governs only entries upon the physical premises to conduct an inspection and examination of commodities stored on the premises. It does not govern the transmission or storage of electronic data for the purpose of recordkeeping under RSA 322:6-a. Given that LeadsOnline does not enter the physical premises of the dealers, the City\u2019s requirement that dealers store the data in a designated manner and transmit the data to a third-party designee does not conflict with RSA 322:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In sum, nothing in RSA chapter 322 expressly prohibits what the City requires in terms of more detailed record-keeping requirements, or the transmission of transaction data to a third-party designee. Manchester, Ordinances \u00a7 114.03. Nor does anything in RSA chapter 322 limit the reporting requirements of dealers or the method of reporting to its own terms. A dealer complying with the City\u2019s record-keeping requirements can still comply with the less-specific requirements of RSA chapter 322, and both the statute and ordinances can operate concurrently. <em>See State ex rel. Whiteco v. Bowers, </em>965 S.W.2d 203, 209 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998) (\u201cA municipal ordinance may expand upon the provisions of a state statute by requiring more than what is required in the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Prolerized cites <em>Tosi v. County of Fresno, </em>74 Cal. Rptr. 3d 727 (Ct. App. 2008), in support of its argument that municipalities cannot enact stricter requirements than those set forth in RSA chapter 322. In <em>Tosi, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>California Court of Appeals concluded that state law preempted municipal ordinances, <em>see id. </em>at 732, that required, among other restrictions, that junk and scrap metal dealers engage in more detailed record-keeping. <em>Id. </em>at 733. The court found that these ordinances were preempted because the commercial activities of scrap metal dealers \u201care matters of statewide concern that our Legislature has comprehensively addressed through various provisions of this state\u2019s Penal and Business and Professions Codes, leaving no room for further regulation at the local level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733 (quotation and brackets omitted). The California law does not authorize municipalities to adopt rules and regulations, and outlines in great detail the information that dealers must report. Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7\u00a7 21600-21610 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2013). In contrast, RSA chapter 322 allows municipalities to adopt rules and regulations, and requires dealers to keep records \u201csufficient to the licensing authority.\u201d RSA 322:2; :6-a. Thus, <em>Tosi </em>is inapposite. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred when it ruled that the City\u2019s record-keeping ordinances were preempted because they were incompatible with State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">\n<em>B. Transaction Fee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Subsection 114.03(E) states: \u201cEvery junk dealer and/or scrap yard that purchases an item in which a transaction record must be prepared pursuant to \u00a7 114.03 shall pay to the city a fee of [fifty cents] per transaction due in full the second Tuesday of every month, for the preceding month.\u201d Manchester, Ordinances \u00a7 114.03(E). RSA 322:11 states that \u201cno person shall be required to pay a larger fee for said license than that required to be paid by any other person in the same city or town for a similar license.\u201d Neither party argues that RSA 322:11 is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Prolerized contends that the transaction fee conflicts with RSA 322:11 and is therefore preempted, arguing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">[subsection 114.03(E)] of the ordinance requires dealers to pay to the City a fee of [fifty cents] per transaction. The more transactions a particular dealer processes, the higher its license fee will ultimately be. As different dealers have different transaction volumes, the ordinance necessarily imposes different fees upon different scrap metal dealers in violation of [RSA 322:11].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The City responds that the ordinance is lawful because all junk and scrap metal dealers are charged the same annual license fee, which is based on square footage, as well as the same fifty-cent fee per transaction. Furthermore, it argues that it is permissible to have transaction fees based on volume, and, therefore, that RSA 322:11 does not preempt the fee. We agree with the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>By its very terms, RSA 322:11 applies only to license fees paid by junk and scrap metal dealers \u2014 not to any other fee paid to the local board. Therefore, the issue before us is whether the fifty-cent transaction fee is a license fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The term \u201clicense\u201d or \u201clicense fee\u201d is not defined in RSA chapter 322. \u201cTherefore, we ascribe to the term its plain and ordinary meaning, utilizing the dictionary definition for guidance.\u201d <em>Magoon v. Thoroughgood, </em>148 N.H. 139, 142 (2002). The term license is commonly understood to mean \u201ca right or permission granted in accordance with law by a competent authority to engage in some business or occupation, to do some act, or to engage in some transaction which but for such license would be unlawful.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1304 (unabridged ed. 2002). Indeed, the dictionary definition of license is consistent with the legislature\u2019s definition of license in other parts of the Revised Statutes Annotated. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 170-E:2, IX (2014) (\u201c \u2018License\u2019 means an authorization granted by the commissioner to provide one or more types of child day care.\u201d); RSA 170-E:25, XI (2014) (\u201c \u2018License\u2019 means a complete license issued to an operator of a child care agency, child care institution or child-placing agency, authorizing the licensee to operate in accordance with the term and conditions of the license, this subdivision, and the rules of the department.\u201d); RSA 399-A:l, VI (2006) (\u201c \u2018License\u2019 means the authority to do business issued by the commissioner under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d); RSA 402-J:2, VI (2006) (\u201c \u2018License\u2019 means a document issued by the commissioner authorizing a person to act as an insurance producer for the lines of authority specified in the document.\u201d); RSA 433:21, XI (Supp. 2013) (\u201c \u2018License\u2019 means an authorization from the director to sell plant stock.\u201d); RSA 541-A:1, VIII (2007) (\u201c \u2018License\u2019 means the whole or part of any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter or similar form of permission required by law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Although it is true that the City\u2019s description of the fee in its ordinance \u201cdoes not settle the question of its character,\u201d <em>Tirrell v. Johnston, </em>86 N.H. 530, 535 (1934), we observe that \u00a7 114.03(E) refers to the fifty-cent fee as a <em>transaction </em>fee, and that \u00a7 110.20 requires payment of a license fee. Section 110.20, entitled \u201cBusiness License Fees,\u201d requires that a person seeking a license pay a fee \u201cbased on the gross square feet of area occupied by the business seeking such license as follows: For the first 1,500 square feet or fraction thereof, $50; plus $2 per 100 square feet or fraction thereof over 1,500 square feet, except that the maximum fee for any license shall be $1,000.\u201d Manchester, Ordinances \u00a7 110.20 (2001). It is of consequence that the fifty-cent transaction fee is not paid in order to secure the right to engage in the business of scrap metal recycling \u2014 rather, the fee is paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>each transaction for which a licensed dealer files an electronic record as required by the City regulations. MANCHESTER, ORDINANCES \u00a7 114.03(E). The right to engage in such a business is instead secured by the payment required by \u00a7 110.20. <em>See </em>Manchester, Ordinances \u00a7 110.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We note that Prolerized acknowledges its inability to find cases, and we could not find any, which support its argument that the transaction fee is preempted. Nonetheless, as Prolerized argues, because the issue is whether the ordinance is preempted by RSA 322:11, the City\u2019s arguments as to the validity of volume-based fees under other statutory schemes, <em>see Tirrell, </em>86 N.H. at 537, or constitutional provisions, <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N.H. 513 (1947), and <em>Northeast Airlines, Inc. v. Aeronautics Comm\u2019n., </em>111 N.H. 5 (1971), are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Because we conclude that the fifty-cent transaction fee is not a license fee, it is not incompatible with state law, and, therefore, is not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b650-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HlCKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
