We deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">The record establishes the following facts. The defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in 2008. On December 31, 2008, we docketed the automatic appeal required under RSA 630:5, X (2007), and in May 2009, the defendant filed his notice of appeal pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">In August 2009, Attorney Lisa Wolford, who had been employed by the New Hampshire Public Defender for approximately seven years, began working with the New Hampshire Appellate Defender on a two-year rotation. When Wolford began her rotation, the appellate defender office was preparing a brief regarding the standards applicable to our mandatory review of the defendant\u2019s sentence under RSA 630:5, XI (2007). In addition to other appeals, for which she had sole responsibility and on which she spent the majority of her time, Wolford was assigned to research and draft the \u201caggravating factors\u201d section of that brief, which was filed with this court in November 2009. <em>See State v. Addison, </em>160 N.H. 732 (2010). After the State filed its opposing brief, Wolford was assigned to review and summarize the cases cited in a footnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In early 2010, Wolford was reassigned from the defendant\u2019s defense team, and in February 2012, she completed her rotation with the appellate defender and returned to work for the public defender in the Stratham office. In March 2012, she submitted her resume to the attorney general\u2019s office, requesting consideration for a position with the criminal justice bureau\u2019s appeals division. In a letter accompanying her resume, she stated that she was \u201cinterested in a position that enables me to continue to focus on appellate advocacy.\u201d Her resume noted that, in addition to other work with the appellate defender, she \u201c[contributed to ... the defendant\u2019s brief in the capital sentencing appeal in <em>State v. Addison, </em>160 N.H. 732 (2010).\u201d Wolford was offered a position with the attorney general\u2019s office; she began employment there in early July 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Approximately one month before Wolford began working at the attorney general\u2019s office, the executive director of the public defender office inquired by letter to then Attorney General Michael Delaney whether, given that Wolford had \u201cworked on appeals in the Michael Addison capital case, and had ongoing access to confidential and privileged information and defense strategies relating to that case,\u201d he had \u201csatisfied [himself] on the propriety of this move before extending an offer to Ms. Wolford.\u201d The attorney general, replying by letter, stated that \u201c[a]s you are aware, there is no general bar under the Rules of Professional Conduct against a former public defender assuming a position as a prosecutor,\u201d that several former public defenders had accepted employment in the attorney general\u2019s office, and that his office would \u201censure that [Wolford] is screened from any matter in which she had involvement as a public defender, <em>see </em>N.H. R. PROF. Conduct 1.9,1.11(d), or was exposed to confidential information, <em>see </em>N.H. R. Prof. Conduct 1.6, including the <em>Addison </em>case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On August 27, 2012, the attorney general received a letter from outside counsel retained by the public defender \u201cto assist... in reviewing Wolford\u2019s recent transfer from the Public Defender\u2019s [0]ffice to the Attorney General\u2019s [OJffice, and any ethical issues that may arise from that transfer.\u201d The letter sought information regarding \u201cthe steps that are now being taken within [the attorney general\u2019s] office to protect confidential client information about Mr. Addison\u2019s ease that [Wolford] may have learned from former colleagues at the Public Defender\u2019s Office or the Appellate Defender\u2019s [0]ffice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The attorney general replied by letter dated October 2, 2012, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">From the outset of her employment at the Attorney General\u2019s Office, Attorney Wolford was instructed that she was not to have any involvement in any case (a) on which the Appellate Defender\u2019s Office represented the defendant while she was employed in that office; (b) on which the Stratham Public Defender\u2019s Office repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sented the defendant while she was employed in that office; (c) involving a former client; or (d) that, for whatever reason, might present a conflict under the Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The letter confirmed that, as of August 30, 2012, \u201cMs. Wolford was locked out of all electronic files related to <em>State v. Addison. </em>An audit was conducted of each of those matters back to July 6, 2012, her first day in the office, which confirmed that Ms. Wolford has not accessed any of those files.\u201d In addition, the attorney general noted, \u201cThe attorneys assigned to the <em>Addison case </em>have all formally acknowledged their understanding that Ms. Wolford is screened from the <em>Addison </em>case and cannot be involved in any conversation about the case.\u201d Regarding electronic research files Wolford brought with her from the public defender\u2019s office, the attorney general explained that \u201c[w]hen she arrived she downloaded those files to her file on the H: drive, which is a personal network file that is not accessible by anyone other [than] the named individual and the system administrators. She has since removed those files from the network and transferred them to a thumb drive, which has been secured.\u201d Attached to the letter was a memorandum dated September 4,2012, memorializing the screening policy that was effective as of the date of her employment and signed by Wolford as confirming her \u201cunderstanding of the screening policy ... and that [she has] had no discussions with anyone at the Attorney General\u2019s Office about any of the cases involving Michael Addison, beyond ensuring [her] and the Office\u2019s adherence to the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">On November 9, 2012, the defendant filed a motion in this court for \u201cpartial remand for discovery regarding the adequacy of screening and other protective measures implemented by the Office of the Attorney General to protect confidential information relating to [the defendant\u2019s] representation by the Office of the New Hampshire Public Defender and the Appellate Defender.\u201d The motion asserted that \u201c[w]ith discovery, a more complete record will be available on which to make definitive assessments of the protective measures at issue; and any relief that may be warranted.\u201d We granted the motion in part and remanded the case to the trial court \u201cfor the limited purpose of ruling upon the defendant\u2019s \u2018Motion for Discovery.\u2019 \u201d The parties subsequently filed a joint statement that the discovery had been completed and that any additional relief, \u201cin the form of discovery or otherwise,\u201d would be sought from this court. On July 15,2013, the defendant filed the motion before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The defendant argues that we should \u201cfollow a line of cases that requires per <em>se </em>disqualification of an entire prosecutor\u2019s office from a defendant\u2019s case when (a) the defendant\u2019s attorney switches sides and joins the prosecutor\u2019s office in the middle of the case and (b) the defendant does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>waive the conflict.\u201d Or, short of adopting such a rule, he argues that we should apply a <em>per se </em>rule in this case because under the circumstances presented, \u201cthe appearance of impropriety and the resulting harm to the perceived integrity of the criminal justice process are compelling grounds for <em>per se </em>disqualification of the Attorney General\u2019s [0]ffice.\u201d According to the defendant, such circumstances include: the prosecutor\u2019s office that Wolford joined \u201cis trying to put the defendant to death\u201d; she joined the criminal bureau\u2019s appeals unit \u201cat the very time this case was on appeal\u201d; Wolford was \u201cdeeply involved in developing appellate strategies\u201d; and she \u201cuploaded to the prosecutor\u2019s computer network a document containing confidential attorney work product relating to an important issue that has not yet been fully briefed in the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In the alternative, the defendant seeks disqualification of all members of the attorney general\u2019s office who were employed or associated with that office between the date Wolford commenced employment as a prosecutor in July 2012, and two months later when the defendant alleges that screening procedures were put in place. Finally, if he is required \u201cto prove actual prejudice or the actual disclosure of confidential information,\u201d the defendant requests \u201cadditional discovery and fact finding under the supervision of a specially appointed master.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The State objects, arguing that a <em>per se </em>rule of disqualification \u201chas been rejected by nearly every state that has considered the issue,\u201d would \u201cdirectly conflict with the Rules of Professional Conduct,\u201d and would \u201cseverely chill the hiring and movement of attorneys in this small state, and create a disincentive for government employment.\u201d The State asserts that we \u201cshould reject the <em>per se </em>rule, and instead adopt a rule that requires proof of an actual ethical violation \u2014 the sharing of confidential information \u2014 or a rule that creates a rebuttable presumption of prejudice.\u201d Because there is no claim of actual prejudice to the defendant and because any presumption of prejudice can be rebutted, the State argues that the motion to disqualify should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Preliminarily, we note that the State questions whether, under the Separation of Powers Doctrine, the judicial branch has the authority to disqualify the entire attorney general\u2019s criminal bureau from conducting the prosecution of the defendant. However, because we reject a <em>per se </em>rule of disqualification, and find that the State would prevail here under either the presumptive prejudice or actual prejudice approaches discussed below, we need not reach this constitutional issue. <em>See State v. Wamala, </em>158 N.H. 583, 592 (2009) (court decides constitutional questions only when necessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that we should adopt a <em>per se </em>rule of disqualification. Under such a rule, an entire prosecutor\u2019s office must be disqualified from a case and a special prosecutor appointed when an attorney who previously worked on a defendant\u2019s behalf subsequently \u201cswitches sides\u201d by joining the prosecutor\u2019s office handling the same ease. <em>See, e.g., People v. Stevens, </em>642 P.2d 39, 40-41 (Colo. Ct. App. 1981); <em>State v. Croka, </em>646 S.W.2d 389, 393 (Mo. Ct. App. 1983); <em>People v. Shinkle, </em>415 N.E.2d 909, 910 (N.Y. 1980). In cases where a <em>per se </em>rule of disqualification is followed, screening the attorney in question is generally not recognized as curative of the imputed conflict and disqualification of the office is required, regardless of whether any confidences were breached or any prejudice to the defendant resulted. <em>See Whitaker v. Com., </em>895 S.W.2d 953, 955-56 (Ky. 1995) (if the switching attorney \u201cengaged in a substantial and personal participation in the defendant\u2019s case,\u201d the defendant need not show prejudice); <em>Croka, </em>646 S.W.2d at 393 (where switching attorney \u201cacquired knowledge about the case\u201d from the defendant while acting as his appointed counsel, when attorney joined the prosecutor\u2019s office, \u201cthat office was thereby disqualified from prosecuting the case irrespective of the assumed facts that [the attorney] revealed no confidences and did not himself participate in the prosecution\u201d). A small minority of jurisdictions have applied a <em>per se </em>rule. <em>See State v. Pennington, </em>851 P.2d 494, 497 (N.M. Ct. App. 1993) (citing cases from eight jurisdictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The majority of jurisdictions that have addressed this issue have declined to apply a <em>per se </em>rule. <em>See id. </em>at 498 (citing cases from more than twenty jurisdictions). Several reasons have been given for rejecting such a rule. One reason is an unwillingness to presume \u201cthat prosecutors would violate a clear mandate (that the disqualified employee be isolated from all involvement in the prosecution) and then lie about such violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Another reason is that a <em>per se </em>rule \u201cwould unnecessarily limit mobility in the legal profession and inhibit the ability of prosecuting attorney\u2019s offices to hire the best possible employees. . . .\u201d <em>State v. Kinkennon, </em>747 N.W.2d 437, 444 (Neb. 2008); <em>see State v. Jones, </em>429 A.2d 936, 942-43 (Conn. 1980) <em>(per se </em>rule \u201cwould result in many unnecessary withdrawals, limit mobility in the legal profession, and restrict the state in the assignment of counsel where no breach of confidentiality has in fact occurred\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Powell, </em>442 A.2d 939 (Conn. 1982). Other reasons include that a <em>per se </em>rule mandates disqualification of a prosecutor\u2019s office based solely upon an appearance of impropriety with no analysis of the facts before the court, and fails to recognize any distinction between lawyers engaged in private practice and prosecutors engaged in constitutionally- and statutorily-mandated duties on behalf of the public. <em>See State v. Camacho, </em>406 S.E.2d 868, 874-75 (N.C. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>We join the majority of jurisdictions and reject application of a per se rule in all cases. We agree with a number of other courts that employ \u201ca more flexible, case-by-case approach,\u201d <em>Lux v. Com., </em>484 S.E.2d 145, 151-52 (Va. Ct. App. 1997), in which \u201cthe circumstances of a particular case\u201d are evaluated to determine \u201cwhether disqualification of the entire office\u201d is required. <em>Kinkennon, </em>747 N.W.2d at 443. \u201cUnder this approach, courts consider, among other things, whether the attorney divulged any confidential information to other prosecutors or participated in some way in the prosecution of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These jurisdictions are generally of the view that the entire office need not be disqualified if the attorney who had previously worked for the defendant \u201cis isolated from any participation in the defendant\u2019s prosecution.\u201d <em>Pennington, </em>851 P.2d at 498; <em>see Kinkennon, </em>747 N.W.2d at 443; <em>State v. McClellan, </em>216 P.3d 956, 960 (Utah 2009); <em>Lux, </em>484 S.E.2d at 151-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The defendant argues that even if we decline to adopt a per <em>se </em>rule in all eases, we should apply such a rule in this case because Wolford was \u201cdeeply involved in developing appellate strategies\u201d and she joined the attorney general\u2019s office \u201cat the very time this case was on appeal.\u201d However, as other jurisdictions have recognized, when a defense attorney first becomes involved in a case at the appellate level and subsequently joins the prosecutor\u2019s office, the danger of prejudice to a defendant is lessened because the prosecutors are bound by the facts in the appellate record. As one court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">When a defendant\u2019s lawyer switches sides, the principal danger is that information supplied in confidence will be used to the defendant\u2019s disadvantage. That danger is greatest when the lawyer switches sides prior to trial, and is in a position to use confidential information in his formulation of strategy and development of the facts. Resulting prejudice would be impossible to assess. The danger of prejudice is far less when a prosecutorial conflict arises during appellate proceedings. At that stage, the prosecution has far less discretion; its role is to answer arguments made by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>Pisa v. Com., </em>393 N.E.2d 386, 390 (Mass. 1979) (citations omitted); <em>see People v. Rankin, </em>540 N.Y.S.2d 628, 629 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989) (no risk of abuse of confidence when district attorney will be bound by the facts appearing in the record on appeal and thus cannot take advantage, to the defendant\u2019s prejudice, of any facts outside the record but within the knowledge of the switching attorney); <em>Com. v. Harris, </em>460 A.2d 747, 749 (Pa. 1983) (where the defense attorney enters the case at the post-trial level and later joins the prosecutor\u2019s office, \u201ca defendant must show an <em>actual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>impropriety in order to establish the requisite prejudice\u201d). Here, Wolford had no involvement in the defendant\u2019s case at the pre-trial or trial stages and participated in a limited aspect at one preliminary phase of the defendant\u2019s multi-phased appeal approximately three years before joining the attorney general\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Among courts that reject a <em>per se </em>rule of disqualification, several have held that a defendant\u2019s former attorney\u2019s subsequent affiliation with the prosecutor\u2019s office creates a presumption that confidences will be shared or that an appearance of impropriety has been shown, but the presumption can be rebutted by a showing that the disqualified attorney has been effectively screened from the ongoing prosecution. <em>See, e.g., Lux, </em>484 S.E.2d at 152; <em>McClellan, </em>216 P.2d at 961; <em>People v. Davenport, </em>760 N.W.2d 743, 749 (Mich. Ct. App. 2008). \u201cThe rebuttable presumption of shared confidences . . . avoids the drastic result of disqualifying an entire [prosecutor\u2019s] office based on only the appearance of impropriety... while at the same time ensuring the rights of the accused are protected.\u201d <em>McClellan, </em>216 P.2d at 961. One obvious problem with the presumptive approach is that presumptions generally are employed in situations where, in common experience, the presumed fact generally or naturally can be expected to follow if the predicate fact is shown to exist, <em>see Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, </em>45 U.S. 591, 600 (1846); <em>Osorio v. Dole Food Co., </em>665 F. Supp. 2d 1307, 1328 (S.D. Fla. 2009), <em>aff'd, </em>635 F.3d 1277 (11th Cir. 2011), yet we are aware of no empirical or other evidence suggesting that members of the bar are typically or frequently inclined to disregard their ethical obligations when they switch employment. Thus, we are not persuaded to adopt the rebuttable presumption approach in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">However, even if we assume without deciding that the presumptive approach is applicable to this case, such assumption is of no benefit to the defendant because, as explained below, the record demonstrates that the State has definitively rebutted any presumption that the defendant was prejudiced by Wolford\u2019s switch of employment. Because we hold that the record before us, including the State\u2019s submissions, demonstrates that the defendant has suffered no prejudice as a result of Wolford\u2019s change of employment from the public defender\u2019s office to the attorney general\u2019s office, we need not decide whether there are circumstances in which a rebuttable presumption of prejudice would be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The defendant acknowledges that \u201ca timely and effective screening policy .. . serve[s] as a presumptive safe harbor from office-wide disqualification.\u201d He argues, however, that \u201cfor reasons that are incomprehensible, nothing approaching an effective screening procedure was put into place [here] for approximately two months.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>As set forth above, the attorney general\u2019s letter of October 2, 2012, describes the screening policy that was in place when Wolford began employment in July 2012. That policy was memorialized on September 4, 2012. The State has submitted a memorandum signed by each of the five attorneys involved in the defendant\u2019s prosecution acknowledging that Wolford was screened from the defendant\u2019s case and that none of them \u201chave . . . discussed, and will not discuss, with [Wolford] any of Mr. Addison\u2019s cases.\u201d In addition, the State submitted affidavits from all five of the attorneys. Three attested that since Wolford joined the criminal justice bureau, they \u201chave had no communication with [her] regarding Michael Addison, or any of the cases that involve Mr. Addison,\u201d nor have they \u201cseen any written material created by Attorney Wolford regarding Mr. Addison\u201d or \u201cshared with Attorney Wolford any paper or electronic records regarding Mr. Addison.\u201d The fourth attorney attested that with the exception of a conversation with Wolford on the first day of her employment with the attorney general\u2019s office \u201cregarding the screening policy that applied to her,\u201d he has had \u201cno communication with Attorney Wolford regarding Michael Addison, or any of the cases that involve Mr. Addison.\u201d The fifth attorney attested that \u201cwith one exception, [she has] had no communication with Attorney Wolford regarding Michael Addison, or any of the cases that involve Mr. Addison. The one exception occurred either one weekend or one evening, Attorney Wolford asked [her] what [she] was working on, and she said \u2018Addison,\u2019 and the conversation ended there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The State has provided affidavits from every other lawyer, paralegal, victim/witness advocate, investigator, and legal secretary employed in the criminal justice bureau since Wolford became employed there, attesting that, except for conversations related to screening, the Rules of Professional Conduct, or responding to discovery on the issues presented in the motion to disqualify, he or she has had no communication with Wolford about the defendant or the defendant\u2019s case. The State has also provided affidavits from employees in the Office of Information Technology, responsible for the support of the executive branch agencies, which attest that none of the limited number of people with the authority to access Wolford\u2019s \u201ch:\\drive\u201d did so. In addition, Wolford, who retained independent counsel, submitted an affidavit in which she attests, among other things, that she \u201cdid not share the fact of the existence of, or the contents of\u2019 the files on her \u201cH: drive\u201d and that she has \u201cnever spoken with anyone at the [attorney general\u2019s office] about Mr. Addison, my work on his case, or any other aspect of his case.\u201d She further attests that, \u201cLikewise, no one at the [attorney general\u2019s office] has ever attempted to speak to me about the case except to obtain information to respond to the discovery conducted pursuant to [the] disqualification motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We conclude that the State has demonstrated that it implemented screening procedures that have prevented the disclosure of any confidential information about the defendant\u2019s case from Wolford to other prosecutors in the attorney general\u2019s office. <em>See United States v. Goot, </em>894 F.2d 231, 233, 235-37 (7th Cir. 1990) (both the disqualified attorney and others in the office affirmed under oath that discussion about the case was prevented, thereby rebutting the presumption of shared confidences); <em>State ex rel. Tyler v. MacQueen, </em>447 S.E.2d 289, 292-93 (W. Va. 1994) (affidavits by prosecuting attorney and member of office who previously represented defendant were sufficient to prove existence of effective screening procedures); <em>Kinkennon, </em>747 N.W.2d at 445 (to establish effective screening, \u201cat a minimum, the disqualified lawyer should acknowledge the obligation not to communicate with any of the other lawyers in the office with respect to the matter\u201d and \u201cthe other lawyers in the office who are involved with the matter should be informed that the screening is in place and that they are not to discuss the matter with the disqualified lawyer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Accordingly, we hold that disqualification of the entire attorney general\u2019s office in this case is not warranted. <em>See State v. Walters, </em>241 S.W.3d 435, 438 (Mo. Ct. App. 2007) (\u201cFrom the record, we see no indication that [the defendant\u2019s former attorney] used anything gathered from his previous representation of [the defendant] to [the defendant\u2019s] disadvantage.\u201d); <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>464 So. 2d 1185, 1188 (Fla. 1985) (imputed disqualification of entire prosecutor\u2019s office is unnecessary \u201cwhen the record establishes that the disqualified attorney has neither provided prejudicial information relating to the pending criminal charge nor has personally assisted, in any capacity, in the prosecution of the charge\u201d). Given the record before us, and our conclusions herein, we also deny the defendant\u2019s request to conduct additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>Motion to disqualify denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Aav\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
