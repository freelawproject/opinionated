He argues that the trial court erred by: (1) denying his request to cross-examine the victim about an allegedly false statement she made on her 2010 application to renew her driver\u2019s license; (2) allowing the State to introduce evidence that he treated the victim\u2019s dog well; and (3) imposing consecutive sentences for second degree assault and reckless conduct with a deadly weapon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The jury could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim began dating in June 2010. On December 13, 2010, they were at his apartment where he had cooked dinner for her. After they quarreled, the victim announced that she was \u201cjust going to go home.\u201d While she was in the bathroom changing, she heard the defendant say, \u201cYou\u2019re not F\u2019ing going anywhere\u201d and then punch a wall. He came into the bathroom and grabbed the victim by the throat. The victim lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness, she was in the bathtub, and the defendant was on top of her, strangling and beating her \u201creally hard\u201d with a curling iron, saying that he was going to kill her. The victim saw the curling iron \u201ccoming right at [her]\u201d as the defendant then \u201cshoved [it] inside of [her] throat,\u201d causing her to choke. She again lost consciousness, and when she regained it, she was in the kitchen, trying to scream for help, although she was only able to do so \u201cvery quietly.\u201d Eight days later, after the victim had explained that she no longer desired contact with the defendant because he frightened her, he sent her a text message that said: \u201cNot talking was part of our problem. Should have finished what I started last week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On appeal, the defendant first argues that the trial court violated New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 403 and 608(b) and the Confrontation Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, <em>see </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST, amends. VI, XIV, by precluding him from cross-examining the victim about an allegedly false statement she made on a 2010 application to renew her driver\u2019s license. The State contends that any error was harmless. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the trial court erred, and we agree with the State that any error was harmless. <em>See State v. Hernandez, </em>159 N.H. 394, 401-02 (2009) (applying harmless error review to admission of evidence in violation of State and Federal Confrontation Clauses).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u201cAn error is harmless if we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Beede, </em>156 N.H. 102, 109 (2007). \u201cThe State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe evaluation of whether the State has met its burden involves consideration of the alternative evidence presented at trial and the character of the contested evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight, and if the contested evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was compelling. The victim\u2019s co-worker testified that on the morning after the assault, the victim had \u201cblack eyes,\u201d bruises and cuts on her lips, red and bloody marks on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>neck, and bruises on her arms. The co-worker also testified that the victim\u2019s \u201cscalp ... was covered in red dots.\u201d The co-worker testified that the victim \u201csounded like she had laryngitis\u201d and that she was \u201cvery upset\u201d and \u201ccrying.\u201d The victim\u2019s supervisor testified that he could barely hear the victim when she spoke to him a few days after the assault and that he saw \u201cbruising and red marks on her neck.\u201d Several days later, the bruises were still visible, according to police testimony and photographic evidence. The emergency room physician, who examined the victim approximately nine days after the assault, testified that he saw a \u201csmall laceration\u201d on her neck and bruises on her arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The defendant admitted that, on the night in question, when the victim told him that she no longer wanted to continue their conversation, he grabbed her arms, used his hand to push her by her throat against the bathtub, and, slapped her \u201chard\u201d several times \u201cacross her face\u201d while holding her by the neck up against a wall. The defendant testified that he grabbed the victim by the arms and held her in the bathroom because he wanted to talk with her. The defendant confirmed that later that evening, he sent the victim a text message, asking what she planned to tell others about the bruising he had caused and asking her if she planned to call the police. Another text message read: \u201cThe only thing that Fs with me is that it took me doing what I did to get you to talk.\u201d In another message, the defendant said: \u201cI should have f***ed you while you were here.\u201d He admitted to sending the victim a text message eight days after the incident, which said: \u201cNot talking was part of our problem. Should have finished what I started last week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Moreover, the defendant impeached the victim\u2019s credibility. <em>See id. </em>He cross-examined her about lying to medical personnel about having used marijuana on the night in question. He also cross-examined the victim vigorously about inconsistencies between her testimony and her account to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Although we acknowledge that this case essentially presented a credibility contest between the defendant and the victim, in view of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the additional impeachment value of his proposed inquiry into the victim\u2019s 2010 application to renew her driver\u2019s license would not have affected the verdict. <em>See State v. Goodale, </em>144 N.H. 224, 234 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce the following evidence that he treated the victim\u2019s dog well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">Q: Okay. And did the dog and the Defendant get along?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>A: They did very much so. I think [the defendant] loved her more than he loved me and would regularly buy her steaks and stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">A: They had a very, very, very close relationship. And he played with her all the time. And like I said, would buy her full steaks and cook them up just for her. And go to fast food restaurants just for her to buy her cheeseburgers. And they were very close. Probably closer than I was to her at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">A: I was a bit jealous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The admissibility of evidence is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. McDonald, </em>163 N.H. 115, 121 (2011). We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo demonstrate an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Munroe, </em>161 N.H. 618, 626 (2011). Here, we uphold the trial court decision because the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s admission of the challenged evidence was \u201cclearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d Although the evidence may have been of questionable relevance, the defendant has not persuaded us that its admission prejudiced his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court violated the common law doctrine of merger when it imposed consecutive sentences for second degree assault and reckless conduct with a deadly weapon. In so arguing, he relies primarily upon our decision in <em>State v. Young, </em>159 N.H. 332 (2009). In <em>Young, </em>the jury could have found that the defendant fired multiple gunshots into a parked car, seriously injuring the victim. <em>Young, </em>159 N.H. at 335. Young was convicted of attempted murder and first degree assault. <em>See id. </em>Young argued on appeal that the trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences, contending that the sentences violated both the common law doctrine of merger and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy <em>Id. </em>at 341. We analyzed his claim only under the common law doctrine of merger. <em>Id. </em>In so doing, we observed that we had not fully developed the doctrine and that the parties\u2019 \u201climited briefing\u201d gave us no cause to do so in that case. <em>Id. </em>Instead, we attempted to glean general principles from a prior case, <em>State v. Naughton, </em>139 N.H. 73 (1994). Ultimately, we decided that because the attempted murder and first degree assault indictments charged Young with the identical criminal activity \u2014 intentionally discharging a firearm into the vehicle occupied by the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u2014 and because the attempted murder charge \u201csubsume[d]\u201d the first degree assault charge based upon the same conduct, the two charges merged. <em>Young, </em>159 N.H. at 342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In hindsight, we find our analysis in <em>Young </em>to be problematic. For instance, although we stated that the attempted murder charge \u201csubsumed\u201d the first degree assault charge based upon the same criminal activity, <em>id. </em>at 343, we also \u201cacknowledged that the indictments [for the two charges] alleged different <em>mens reas </em>and consequences of intentional conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 342. Specifically, the first degree assault charge alleged that Young \u201cknowingly caused bodily injury,\u201d while the attempted murder charge did not, and the attempted murder charge alleged that Young had the purpose to cause the victim\u2019s death, while the first degree assault charge did not. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in fact, the attempted murder charge did not \u201csubsume[]\u201d the first degree assault charge; once the attempted murder charge was proved, all of the elements of the first degree assault charge were not proved. <em>See State v. Farr, </em>160 N.H. 803, 807-09 (2010) (possessing pornography charge was a lesser included offense of delivering pornography charge because proof that defendant delivered video clip necessarily constituted proof that he possessed or controlled the clip).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Although <em>Young </em>is of analytic concern, neither party asks us to overrule it, and we are disinclined to do so at this juncture. We are also disinclined to extend <em>Young </em>to this case. Therefore, we limit <em>Young </em>to its unique factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In the context of multiple sentences stemming from a single act, there should be \u201cno difference between a double jeopardy analysis and a [common law] merger analysis; double jeopardy and merger are identical [in this context] and the operative consideration in both is whether the [two]... offenses are the same or different.\u201d <em>Com. v. Anderson, </em>650 A.2d 20, 23 (Pa. 1994); <em>see </em>Note, <em>The Interplay of Double Jeopardy, the Doctrine of Lesser Included Offenses, and the Substantive Crimes of Forcible Rape and Statutory Rape, </em>82 Temp. L. Rev. 1103, 1107 (2009) (observing that \u201c[m]ost courts ... have either abolished the [common law merger] doctrine as unnecessary or treat merger analysis as identical to the double jeopardy \u2018same offense\u2019 analysis\u201d); Shellenberger &amp; Strazzella, <em>The Lesser Included Offense Doctrine and the Constitution: The Development of Due Process and Double Jeopardy Remedies, </em>79 Makq. L. Rev. 1, 132 n.455 (Fall 1995) (\u201cMost jurisdictions now have discarded the \u2018common law merger doctrine\u2019 as repudiated or no longer necessary.\u201d). Accordingly, we apply double jeopardy principles to analyze whether the two offenses at issue were the \u201csame\u201d for purposes of the common law merger doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cMultiple punishment cases . . . come in two varieties.\u201d <em>Tarrant v. Ponte, </em>751 F.2d 459, 461 n.3 (1st Cir. 1985). \u201cFirst, there are the so-called \u2018double-description\u2019 cases, in which the issue is whether two statutes describe two separate offenses or are merely different descriptions of the same offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cSecond, there are \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 cases [in which] the problem is not that the same course of conduct is proscribed by more than one statute but that a defendant\u2019s continuing course of conduct is fragmented into more than one violation of a single statutory provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In both \u201cdouble description\u201d and \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d cases, we examine whether proof of the elements of the crimes as charged will require a difference in evidence. <em>Compare State v. Sanchez, </em>152 N.H. 625, 630-32 (2005) (\u201cdouble description\u201d case involving charges for first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder), <em>and State v. McKean, </em>147 N.H. 198, 200-01 (2001) (\u201cdouble description\u201d case involving kidnapping and criminal threatening charges), <em>with State v. Krueger, </em>146 N.H. 541, 542-43 (2001) (\u201cunit of prosecution\u201d case involving multiple indictments for aggravated felonious sexual assault of the same victim during the same twenty-five minute encounter), <em>and State v. Stratton, </em>132 N.H. 451, 454-55 (1989) (\u201cunit of prosecution\u201d case involving multiple indictments for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Here, proof of the elements of the two charges, one for second degree assault and the other for reckless conduct with a deadly weapon, required different evidence. The second degree assault indictment alleged that the defendant \u201crecklessly caused bodily injury\u201d to the victim \u201cunder circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life by ramming a curling iron into [her] throat impairing her ability to speak in her normal voice for a prolonged period of time.\u201d The reckless conduct with a deadly weapon indictment alleged that the defendant \u201crecklessly placed or may have placed [the victim] in danger of serious bodily injury in that he rammed a curling iron into her throat, and the curling iron was a deadly weapon in the manner used or threatened to be used pursuant to RSA 625:11, V.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">As charged, each indictment required the State to prove a fact not necessary to the other. The second degree assault indictment required the State to prove that the defendant \u201crecklessly caused bodily injury,\u201d to wit, impairing the victim\u2019s ability to speak in her normal voice for a prolonged period of time. The reckless conduct with a deadly weapon charge did not require proof of actual bodily injury. Similarly, the reckless conduct with a deadly weapon charge required proof that the defendant placed the victim in danger of \u201cserious\u201d bodily injury and that the curling iron \u201cwas a deadly weapon\u201d in the way he used or threatened to use it, while the second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>assault indictment did not. Thus, because the evidence required to prove each indictment is different, even though based upon the same conduct, the two charges did not merge. <em>See McKean, </em>147 N.H. at 200-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-6\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
