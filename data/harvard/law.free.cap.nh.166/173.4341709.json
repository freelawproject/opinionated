In addition to the issue raised on appeal, we ordered the parties to brief whether the thirty-day appeal period in criminal appeals set forth in Supreme Court Rule 7(1)(C) begins to run on the date of sentencing or on the date on which the mittimus is issued. We hold that a criminal appeal must be filed within thirty days of sentencing and dismiss the appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Pursuant to Rule 7(1)(C), in the absence of a timely-filed post-trial motion, \u201c[i]n criminal appeals, the time for filing a notice of appeal shall be within 30 days from the date of sentencing.\u201d Under Rule 7(1)(C), \u201c[a] timely filed post-trial motion stays the running of the appeal period.\u201d Here, the defendant was sentenced on July 30, 2012, and no timely post-trial motion was filed. Consequently, the notice of appeal should have been filed on or before August 29, 2012. The notice of appeal was not filed, however, until October 11, 2012, and, accordingly, we originally dismissed the appeal as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">In response, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion to accept late filing of the appeal, noting that the trial court did not issue a mittimus until September 14, 2012, and that the notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of that date. We treated the pleading as a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the appeal and granted reconsideration, but deferred ruling upon the timeliness of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Rule 7(1)(C) is clear on its face. When no timely post-trial motion is filed, a notice of appeal in a criminal appeal must be filed \u201cwithin 30 days from the date of sentencing.\u201d The \u201cdate of sentencing\u201d is the date on which the court pronounces the sentence. As we have explained in another context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Due process requires a sentencing court to communicate clearly to the defendant the exact nature of the sentence as well as the extent to which the court retains discretion to modify it or impose it at a later date. Due process thus imposes an outer limit upon the court\u2019s ability to correct a sentence after pronouncing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em>State v. Ortiz, </em>162 N.H. 585, 596 (2011) (citation omitted). Thus, the \u201cdate of sentencing\u201d is the date on which the court \u201ccommunicate[s] clearly to the defendant the exact nature of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The defendant contends that other Rules \u201cundermine the clarity of Rule 7(1)[(C)] by suggesting that a notice of appeal is only deemed filed when the appellant has fully and completely complied with the rules governing the content of the notice of appeal.\u201d He asserts that Rules requiring that the appealing party attach to the notice of appeal \u201cthe decision below\u201d and \u201cthe clerk\u2019s written notice of the decision below\u201d imply that the mittimus must be attached to the notice of appeal in a criminal appeal in which no timely post-trial motion has been filed. SUP. Ct. R. 7(6). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Generally, a party is first notified of a decision on the merits when a written order, along with the clerk\u2019s notice of the decision, is mailed to the parties. Because there is often a delay between the date of the decision and the clerk\u2019s written notice of the decision, we calculate the thirty-day appeal period from the date of the written notice, <em>not </em>from the date of the decision. To determine whether the appeal is timely, we require an appellant to attach the clerk\u2019s written notice to the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">However, in a criminal appeal in which no timely post-trial motion has been filed, waiting for the \u201cclerk\u2019s written notice of the decision\u201d has no significance since the defendant was notified of the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision when the sentence was pronounced. The issuance of the mittimus is, thus, irrelevant for purposes of filing such an appeal. Although we conclude that Rule 7(1)(C) is clear on its face, in an abundance of caution, we refer this matter to the Advisory Committee on Rules for its review. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Alternatively, the defendant argues that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to waive the requirements of Rule 7(1)(C). <em>See </em>SUP. CT. R. 1 (empowering court for \u201cgood cause shown\u201d to \u201csuspend the requirements or provisions\u201d of any Supreme Court Rule). \u201cGood cause\u201d is not the correct standard. Rule 21(6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>specifically governs the late entry of appeals, and it allows a motion for late entry of a notice of appeal to be granted only \u201cupon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 21(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In arguing that \u201cgood cause\u201d remains the standard, the defendant relies upon <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Fischer), </em>152 N.H. 205, 209 (2005), <em>State v. Cotell, </em>143 N.H. 275, 278-79 (1998), and <em>State v. Hayes, </em>138 N.H. 410, 411 (1994). However, in those cases, we applied earlier versions of Rule 21(6) that did not include the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d language. <em>See </em>SUR Ct. R. 21(6) (2003-2004 Supp.) (amendment to Rule 21(6), adding \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d language, became effective January 1, 2004); <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Fischer), </em>152 N.H. at 209 (applying 2003 version of rule). His reliance upon those cases, therefore, is misplaced. Here, the defendant has neither argued nor demonstrated that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist. Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
