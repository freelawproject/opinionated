Anderson is the only petitioner who appealed. He argues that the trial court erred when it determined that RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV (2013) as applied to him is not an unconstitutional retrospective law. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 23. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">The record establishes the following facts. Anderson is a retired Plaistow police officer who was a member of the NHRS. <em>See Appeal of Eskeland, </em>166 N.H. 554, 559 (2014) (at retirement, a member of the NHRS becomes a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d within the meaning of the applicable statutes). Anderson retired in November 2011. After retiring, he worked part-time as a police officer in Plaistow, Atkinson, and Hampstead.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">When he retired, RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV provided that \u201c[p]art-time,\u201d for the purposes of employing a NHRS retiree meant, \u201cemployment <em>by an [NHRS] employer\u201d </em>of no more than \u201c32 hours in a normal calendar week,\u201d or if the work hours in some weeks exceeded thirty-two hours, then no more than \u201c1,300 hours in a calendar year.\u201d Laws 2011, 248:2 (emphasis added). Anderson understood that provision \u201cto mean [he] could work potentially up to 32 hours per week for Plaistow, up to 32 hours per week for Atkinson, and up to 32 hours per week for Hampstead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">In 2012, the legislature amended RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV to provide that \u201c[p]art-time,\u201d for the purposes of employing a NHRS retiree, \u201cmeans employment during a calendar year <em>by one or more employers </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>retired member which shall not exceed 32 hours in each normal calendar week,\u201d or if the work hours in some weeks exceed thirty-two hours, then no more than 1,300 hours in a calendar year. Laws 2012, 194:5 (the 2012 amendment) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In August 2012, Anderson and three other NHRS retirees petitioned for declaratory and injunctive relief. Anderson contended that to apply the 2012 amendment to him violated Part I, Article 23 of the New Hampshire Constitution. Specifically, he asserted that, as a result of the 2012 amendment, he would be \u201crestored to service\u201d under RSA 100-A:7 (2013) and, thus, lose his retirement benefits if he worked more than \u201c[p]art-time\u201d as defined in RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV. Under RSA 100-A:7, when a retiree is \u201crestored to service,\u201d his \u201cretirement allowance shall cease,\u201d and he \u201cshall again become a member of the [NHRS] and . . . shall contribute\u201d to that system. Anderson contended that the 2012 amendment substantially impaired his vested right because its effect is to restore him to service if he works more than thirty-two hours per week or 1,300 hours per year for any combination of NHRS employers, even if he does not work full-time hours for any single NHRS employer. Thereafter, the petitioners moved for summary judgment, and the State cross-moved for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in the State\u2019s favor, and Anderson\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, \u201cwe consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>State Employees\u2019 Assoc. of N.H. v. State of N.H., </em>161 N.H. 730, 734 (2011) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">We do not reach the merits of Anderson\u2019s constitutional challenge to the 2012 amendment because we conclude that it rests upon a mistaken interpretation of the underlying statutes. <em>See Olson v. Town of Fitzwilliam, </em>142 N.H. 339, 345 (1997) (noting that we decide cases on constitutional grounds only when necessary). Anderson contends that because the pre-2012 version of RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV refers to \u201can employer\u201d instead of \u201cone or more employers,\u201d it allowed a retiree to work up to thirty-two hours per week or 1,300 hours per year for any number of municipal employers as long as the retiree did not work more than thirty-two hours per week or 1,300 hours per year for any one such employer. However, the legislature has provided that in construing all statutes, \u201c[w]ords importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons or things,\u201d RSA 21:3 (2012), \u201cunless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature or repugnant to the context of the same statute,\u201d RSA 21:1 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>In the instant case, the 2012 amendment makes clear that such construction is consistent with legislative intent. When the legislature changed \u201can employer\u201d to \u201cone or more employers\u201d in 2012, it stated that it was merely \u201cclarify[ing] recent changes to the administration of the New Hampshire retirement system.\u201d Senate Bill 244, <em>available at </em>www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2012/SB0244. Under those circumstances, the 2012 amendment to RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV is \u201cstrong evidence of the legislative intent concerning the original enactment.\u201d <em>Blue Mountain Forest Ass\u2019n v. Town of Croydon, </em>119 N.H. 202, 205 (1979). In other words, although the pre-2012 version of RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV referred to \u201can employer,\u201d the legislature intended the singular \u201can employer\u201d to include the plural \u201cone or more employers.\u201d Thus, contrary to Anderson\u2019s contentions on appeal, when he retired in 2011, he had no right, vested or otherwise, to work up to thirty-two hours per week or 1,300 hours per year for more than one NHRS employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Because we have resolved Anderson\u2019s appeal in this way, we express no opinion as to whether he correctly interprets the applicable statutes when he contends that a NHRS retiree is \u201crestored to service\u201d pursuant to RSA 100-A:7 when he or she works more than \u201c[p]art-time,\u201d as defined in RSA 100-A:1, XXXIV, but fewer than the full-time hours required for membership in the NHRS, <em>see </em>RSA 100-A:1, VII (2013). We invite the legislature to clarify its intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b775-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
