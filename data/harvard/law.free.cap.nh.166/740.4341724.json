(Mahindra), appeals a decision of the Superior Court <em>(Smukler, </em>J.) affirming a default judgment by the New Hampshire Motor Vehicle Industry Board (Board) in favor of the respondents, Holloway Motor Cars of Manchester, LLC, Peters Auto Sales, Inc., and Crest Chevrolet, Inc. (collectively \u201cdealers\u201d). Mahindra argues that the trial court erred by finding that the Board had personal jurisdiction over Mahindra and subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the dealers\u2019 claims against Mahindra. We vacate the order of the superior court and remand with instructions to remand to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order, the record, or are otherwise undisputed on appeal. On July 12, 2011, the dealers filed a protest with the Board alleging that Mahindra, a motor vehicle manufacturer based in Mumbai, India, violated RSA chapter 357-C. <em>See generally </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>RSA 357-C:3, :7 (2009 &amp; Supp. 2013). The dealers asserted that Mahindra entered into a distributor agreement with Global Vehicles, U.S.A. Inc. (Global Vehicles) by which Global Vehicles became the exclusive distributor of Mahindra\u2019s motor vehicles in the State of New Hampshire. They further alleged that the dealers paid a fee to Global Vehicles in order to become dealers of Mahindra\u2019s motor vehicles. The dealers claimed that Mahindra \u201cviolated RSA [chapter] 357-C by its wrongful termination of the Distributor Agreement with Global [Vehicles], its announced intention not to honor the franchise agreements held by the dealers, and its refusal to provide motor vehicles to Global [Vehicles] and the dealers in accordance with its agreement and state law.\u201d Although the dealers had entered into agreements only with Global Vehicles, they brought their protest against both Mahindra and Global Vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The Board issued a notice of pre-hearing conference to the dealers, Global Vehicles, and a senior vice president of Mahindra U.S.A., a subsidiary of Mahindra, in Kennesaw, Georgia. The notice to Mahindra U.S.A. was returned. Mahindra did not participate in the pre-hearing conference. After the conference, the dealers attempted service of the protest on Mahindra through a variety of means. They sent copies of the protest by certified mail to Mahindra\u2019s counsel in Georgia and to the president of Mahindra\u2019s automotive and farm equipment sector at an address in Houston, Texas. The dealers also sent a copy of the protest to the same Mahindra sector president at an address in Mumbai, India, which was delivered by United Parcel Service. In addition, the dealers sent a copy of the protest to the sheriff\u2019s office in Marietta, Georgia, for service on the senior vice president of Mahindra USA Automotive. The sheriff\u2019s return stated that the individual could not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On May 22, 2012, the Board issued a notice of hearing to the dealers, Global Vehicles, and Mahindra\u2019s sector president in Houston, Texas. Mahindra\u2019s attorney in Georgia sent a letter to the Board (the \u201cletter\u201d) responding to the hearing notice and requesting that all claims against Mahindra be dismissed. The letter was filed \u201cfor the limited purpose of raising three objections:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">First, Mahindra respectfully submits that it is not subject to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction because Mahindra was never served with the July 12,2011 Protest. Second, Mahindra also is not subject to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction because Mahindra does not manufacture or assemble new motor vehicles for use and operation on the public highways of New Hampshire. Third, as set forth further herein, [the dealers\u2019] protest improperly asks this Board to interject itself into a private contractual dispute between Global Vehicles and Mahindra. This dispute was decided in Mahindra\u2019s favor earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>this year following an international arbitration that Global Vehicles initiated in London pursuant to a binding arbitration clause in the Mahindra-Global Vehicles Distributor Agreement. Accordingly, even if the Board had jurisdiction over the contract dispute between Global Vehicles and Mahindra (it does not), that dispute was subject to an arbitration where Global Vehicles\u2019 claims have been soundly rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">With respect to the third objection, relating to the arbitration with Global Vehicles, the letter explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">Even if the Board finds that it has jurisdiction over Mahindra, Mahindra observes that [the dealers\u2019] Protest consists primarily of allegations about the Mahindra-Global Vehicles Distributor Agreement, to which [the dealers] are not parties. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">In the arbitration, Global Vehicles had claimed that Mahindra engaged in certain conduct in violation of the Distributor Agreement. . . . [T]he arbitral tribunal rejected Global Vehicles\u2019 claims, including the claim that Mahindra wrongfully terminated the Distributor Agreement. Instead, the tribunal found that the Distributor Agreement automatically terminated on June 11,2010 according to its own terms, and that Mahindra had not otherwise violated any state or federal dealer laws that may govern the relationship between Mahindra and Global Vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">[The dealers] have not alleged that they entered into any separate contracts with Mahindra. To the extent [the dealers] intend to re-litigate Global Vehicles\u2019 claims against Mahindra on Global Vehicles\u2019 behalf in this forum, any issues relating to the prior dispute between Global Vehicles and Mahindra \u2014 including but not limited to any issues related to the performance and termination of a Distributor Agreement to which [the dealers] are not parties \u2014 should be off-limits in this forum. Those disputes were subject to Section 60(b) of the Distributor Agreement and have already been decided in a binding overseas arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The Board concluded that, because neither Global Vehicles nor Mahindra appeared for the final hearing despite being properly noticed, they had defaulted. The Board additionally found and ruled \u201cthat Mahindra and Global [Vehicles] ha[d] violated RSA 357-C:3 and RSA 357-C:7\u201d and barred Mahindra from doing business in New Hampshire until it \u201cappears before th[e] Board to answer to th[e] protest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Mahindra filed a motion asking the Board to vacate the default judgment, arguing that, because India and the United States are parties to the Hague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, Nov. 15, 1965, 20 U.S.T 361 (Hague Service Convention), the dealers could have effectuated service of process on Mahindra only by complying with its requirements. Mahindra argued that the methods of service attempted by the dealers did not comply with the Hague Service Convention and sought dismissal of the protest for lack of service. The Board denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Mahindra appealed the Board\u2019s order to the superior court in accordance with RSA 357-C:12, VII (2009), arguing that the dealers did not serve Mahindra in accordance with the Hague Service Convention. Mahindra also asserted that the Board lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute because Mahindra did not manufacture motor vehicles for sale or operation in New Hampshire. The court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, finding that, notwithstanding the applicability of the Hague Service Convention, the third objection in the letter to the Board \u201craise[d] a defense to the protest, the ground of preclusion.\u201d The trial court, therefore, concluded that \u201cMahindra waived service and submitted to the jurisdiction of the [Board].\u201d The trial court also found that the dispute was within the scope of RSA 357-C:2 (2009), such that the Board had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the protest. Mahindra\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The trial court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s decision is governed by RSA 357-C:12, VII, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">All findings of the board upon all questions of fact properly before the court shall be prima facie lawful and reasonable. The order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law. No additional evidence shall be heard or taken by the superior court on appeals from the board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision is similarly limited: we will not set aside or vacate the trial court\u2019s decision except for errors of law. <em>See Strike Four v. Nissan N. Am., </em>164 N.H. 729, 735 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">\n<em>III. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Mahindra asserts that \u201cthere is no dispute that [it] was never properly served by the [dealers] in this matter,\u201d and argues that the trial court erred in finding that it waived its right to insist on proper service pursuant to the Hague Service Convention. The dealers contend that they were not bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>by the requirements of the Hague Service Convention in this case and that, regardless of the convention\u2019s applicability, Mahindra waived its challenge to service and jurisdiction. We agree with Mahindra, and find that the trial court erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">\n<em>A. Service of Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\u201cIn order to obtain jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, proper service of process is required.\u201d <em>Impact Food Sales v. Evans, </em>160 N.H. 386, 390 (2010). If personal service is not effected within the boundaries of the State, <em>see </em>RSA 510:2 (2010), \u201cjurisdiction over a nonresident can only be obtained if the legislature has provided another method of service of process.\u201d <em>South Down Recreation Assoc. v. Moran, </em>141 N.H. 484, 486 (1996) (quotation omitted). \u201cThis requirement is separate from the due process requirement that the defendant have minimum contacts with the jurisdiction such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87 (quotation omitted). \u201cAlthough we construe our statutes providing personal jurisdiction over nonresidents to the full constitutional limit, we also consistently require strict compliance with statutory requirements for service of process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487 (citation and quotation omitted); <em>see also Estate of Lunt v. Gaylor, </em>150 N.H. 96, 97 (2003). \u2018Where a statute points out a particular method of serving process[,] such method must be followed.\u201d <em>South Down Recreation Assoc., </em>141 N.H. at 487 (quotation and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The Hague Service Convention applies \u201cin all cases, in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.\u201d Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, Nov. 15, 1965, art. 1, 20 U.S.T 361, 362. The Convention was implemented \u201cto provide a simpler way to serve process abroad, to assure that defendants sued in foreign jurisdictions would receive actual and timely notice of suit, and to facilitate proof of service abroad.\u201d <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk, </em>486 U.S. 694, 698 (1988); <em>see also </em>Hague Service Convention, Preamble, 20 U.S.T. at 362. Both the United States and India are signatories to the treaty. <em>See </em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 2013 410 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> In their answer and counterclaim to Mahindra\u2019s appeal to the superior court, the dealers asserted that the requirements of the Hague Service Convention are inapplicable when service is made in the United States. They further asserted that they effectuated proper service on Mahindra by serving its attorney in Georgia and its sector president in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Houston, Texas. However, at the hearing before the trial court, the dealers conceded that, absent a waiver, the Hague Service Convention governed service of process in this proceeding. The following exchange occurred between the court and counsel for the dealers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">THE COURT: In other words, if there were not a waiver, would the Hague [Service] Convention govern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">[COUNSEL]: I agree, it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">THE COURT: I understand that you\u2019re arguing the waiver, but you\u2019re not contesting that the Hague [Service] Convention governs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">[COUNSEL]: It does govern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">At no point during the proceedings before the trial court did the dealers retreat from this concession that, absent a waiver by Mahindra, the Convention governed service requirements. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the dealers are bound by their concession. <em>See Doyle v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Dep\u2019t of Resources &amp; Economic Dev., </em>163 N.H. 215, 221-22 (2012) (declining to consider whether park was limited public forum or nonpublic forum because trial court premised its ruling on defendants\u2019 representation that park was traditional public forum and plaintiff relied on that representation); <em>TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of Revenue, </em>503 S.E.2d 471, 474 (S.C. 1998) (\u201cAn issue conceded in a lower court may not be argued on appeal.\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Ayer, </em>150 N.H. 14, 29 (2003) (State conceded issue at oral argument on appeal and therefore we were \u201cforeclosed\u201d from considering it). We note that the trial court did not rule on the issue of whether the dealers\u2019 service on individuals in the United States obviated the service requirements under the Convention, and that, subsequent to their concession, the dealers did not seek such a ruling. To the extent that the dealers ask us to revive their assertion that service on individuals in the United States was sufficient, we decline to do so; in their appeal, they have failed to support this assertion with any developed legal analysis. <em>See Camire v. Gunstock Area Comm\u2019n, </em>166 N.H. 374, 379 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">As to whether the dealers, in fact, effectuated service pursuant to the Convention, the trial court found that, \u201c[a]lthough they originally disputed it, the [dealers] now concede that they did not effectuate service that conforms to the Hague [Service] Convention.\u201d Because the dealers did not challenge this finding and have advanced no argument that they effectuated service in compliance with the Convention, we hold that Mahindra did not receive sufficient service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\n<em>B. Waiver of Challenge to Service</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Mahindra argues that because it did not waive its right to insist on proper service in the letter, the trial court erred in finding that the Board had personal jurisdiction. The dealers argue that the trial court correctly concluded that, regardless of the applicability of the Hague Service Convention, Mahindra waived any challenge that it might have had to the validity of service or personal jurisdiction. They assert that \u201cMahindra sought to have the protest dismissed by claiming that the favorable result in the arbitration is an affirmative bar to the protest.\u201d They argue that because Mahindra submitted this issue to the Board, it submitted itself to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The dealers rely upon <em>Lyford v. Academy, </em>97 N.H. 167, 168 (1951), which states: \u201c[A]n objection to service or notice is waived when a party, by general appearance or otherwise, submits any other question, except the sufficiency of service or notice, to the court or other tribunal.\u201d <em>Lyford, </em>97 N.H. at 168 (quotation omitted). We note that although a new rule regarding waiver of personal jurisdiction challenges became effective in October 2013 with respect to proceedings in the superior court, no party asserts that the new rule should apply in this case. <em>See </em>SUPER. Ct. ClV. R. 9(f) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. (\u201cUnder the new rule... the litigant [will not] be deemed to have waived such challenges and submitted to the court\u2019s jurisdiction by filing an Answer or other pleadings or motions that raise issues aside from personal jurisdiction, sufficiency of process or sufficiency of service of process.\u201d). Accordingly, we look to our prior precedents to determine whether Mahindra waived the service requirements in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201c[W]aiver, like any question of fact, is to be determined upon all the evidence and is not concluded by the declaration of the party.\u201d <em>Lyford, </em>97 N.H. at 168 (quotation omitted). \u201cIt is the character of his acts in praying the consideration of the court, and not the form of the statements which the defendant makes, which determines the effect of his conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe question is whether he has in fact submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe effect of the defendant\u2019s action is to be determined not solely with reference to isolated allegations contained in its pleadings, but with respect to its action as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169. \u201cAny act which recognizes the jurisdiction [of the tribunal] has some tendency to show that the actor intends to submit to it.\u201d <em>Dolber v. Young, </em>81 N.H. 157, 159 (1923). Although waiver ordinarily is a question of fact, <em>see Lyford, </em>97 N.H. at 168, here, because the trial court\u2019s waiver finding was based solely upon Mahindra\u2019s letter, the waiver issue presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Edwards v. RAL Auto. Group, </em>156 N.H. 700, 705 (2008) (the interpretation of written documents is a question of law that we review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>de novo); Masse v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>136 N.H. 628, 632 (1993) (\u201cAs all the documents... are available for our perusal, the [trial] court was in no better position to decide the case than are we.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The language in Mahindra\u2019s letter is distinguishable from the circumstances in other cases in which we have held that a defendant waived objection to service. For instance, we have concluded that defendants waived their objections to service of process by asserting an affirmative defense, <em>see Gagnon v. Croft Manufacturing &amp;c. Co., </em>108 N.H. 329, 330 (1967) (holding defendant waived jurisdictional claim by including plea of statute of limitations); by actively participating in the case, <em>see Dolber, </em>81 N.H. at 159 (determining that defendant\u2019s \u201capplication for a commission to take depositions to be used in the trial of [the] issue was an unreserved invocation of the jurisdiction\u201d); and by addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claims, <em>see Barton v. Hayes, </em>141 N.H. 118, 120 (1996) (holding that defendant waived jurisdictional argument by conceding liability in a motion to strike default judgment). <em>See also, e.g., Druding v. Allen, </em>122 N.H. 823, 826-27 (1982) (holding that party waived any jurisdictional objections and submitted himself to the court\u2019s jurisdiction by \u201cfil[ing] various pleadings with the court, including requests for substantive findings and rulings\u201d); <em>Jewett v. Jewett, </em>112 N.H. 341, 342-43 (1972) (concluding that defendant \u201cwaived all objection to the sufficiency of the service or notice\u201d because his counsel tried the case on the merits). In these cases, our determination that the defendants had waived any objection to jurisdiction was based upon the premise that the defendants could not \u201cat the same time invoke the judgment of the court upon the merits of the case and deny its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Dolber, </em>81 N.H. at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Here, Mahindra\u2019s letter did not ask the Board to resolve an issue with the dealers while simultaneously arguing that the Board did not have jurisdiction. The third objection in the letter sought only to apprise the Board of a \u201cprivate contractual dispute between Global Vehicles and Mahindra\u201d that was \u201csubj ect to an arbitration where Global Vehicles\u2019 claims ha[d] been soundly rejected.\u201d In its letter, Mahindra stressed that the dealers\u2019 protest \u201cconsists primarily of allegations about the MahindraGlobal Vehicles Distributor Agreement, to which [the dealers] are not parties.\u201d The letter, therefore, identified an agreement, subject to binding arbitration, which governed the dispute between Mahindra and Global Vehicles \u2014 the two named respondents in the proceeding before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In support of their argument that Mahindra waived its jurisdictional objection, the dealers rely upon the trial court\u2019s assessment that the third objection in Mahindra\u2019s letter \u201craises as a defense to the protest, the ground of preclusion\u201d and interpret the letter as asserting \u201cthat a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>proceeding fully and finally resolved the dispute between the parties.\u201d We read the language of the letter differently and disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"> The doctrine of issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) bars a party to a prior action, or a person in privity with such party, from relitigating any issue or fact actually litigated and determined in the prior action. <em>Hansa, Consult of N. Am. v. Hansaconsult Ingenieurgesellschaft, </em>163 N.H. 46, 50 (2011); <em>see Aubert v. Aubert, </em>129 N.H. 422, 425 (1987) (recognizing collateral estoppel and issue preclusion as the same doctrine).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">Under certain circumstances, collateral estoppel may preclude the relitigation of findings made by a previous court when: (1) the issue subject to estoppel is identical in each action; (2) the first action resolved the issue finally on the merits; (3) the party to be estopped appeared in the first action or was in privity with someone who did; (4) the party to be estopped had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue; and (5) the finding at issue was essential to the first judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><em>Hansa Consult of N. Am., </em>163 N.H. at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In the letter, Mahindra did not assert a collateral estoppel defense. It did not allege that the issues raised before the Board and resolved in arbitration were identical. Rather, in the letter, Mahindra noted that the dealers asked the Board \u201cto adjudicate certain alleged conduct by Mahindra that allegedly violates RSA 357-C:3 and RSA 357-C:7,\u201d while the arbitration decided the \u201ccontractual dispute between Global Vehicles and Mahindra.\u201d Mahindra noted the distinction between the dispute with Global Vehicles \u2014 which the arbitration governed \u2014 and the dispute before the Board. Given the distinction between the disputes, nothing in Mahindra\u2019s letter can be read to assert that the issue before the Board was identical to the issues resolved in the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Moreover, in its letter, Mahindra did not assert that the dealers appeared in the arbitration action or were in privity with someone who appeared. Instead, the letter stated that the dealers were not a party to the Distributor Agreement that was at issue in the arbitration. Nonetheless, the dealers argue that \u201c[although Mahindra did not use the legal label[ ] of privity ..., Mahindra was claiming that the [dealers] were in privity with Global [Vehicles] because the [dealers\u2019] protest consists \u2018primarily of allegations about the Mahindra-Global Vehicles Distributor Agreement\u2019 \u201d and also because Mahindra claimed that the dealers \u201cintend to re-litigate Global Vehicles\u2019 claims against Mahindra on Global Vehicles\u2019 behalf.\u201d We disagree with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>\u201cThe relationship between party and non-party implied by a finding of privity in the estoppel context has been described as one of virtual representation, and substantial identity.\u201d <em>Cook v. Sullivan, </em>149 N.H. 774, 779 (2003) (quotation omitted). These phrases imply not a formal, but a functional, relationship, in which, at a minimum, the <em>interests of the non-party were in fact represented </em>and protected in the prior litigation. <em>Id. </em>Thus, privity is found to exist, for example, when a non-party controls or substantially participates in controlling the presentation or if a non-party authorizes a party in litigation to represent his or her interests. <em>Id. </em>Nothing in Mahindra\u2019s letter suggests that the dealers\u2019 interests were in fact represented during the arbitration or that the dealers authorized Global Vehicles to represent their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Consequently, we reject the dealers\u2019 argument that the third objection in Mahindra\u2019s letter raised a collateral estoppel defense. Rather, in the letter, Mahindra simply identified a binding arbitration agreement that governed disputes between Mahindra and Global Vehicles. In doing so, Mahindra did not submit to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to the dealers\u2019 protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We also reject the dealers\u2019 argument that \u201cMahindra\u2019s request for affirmative relief in its motion to strike the default judgment conferred] jurisdiction on the Board and waive[d] any claim of improper service.\u201d The dealers assert that \u201cMahindra affirmatively sought to contest not service but the merits of the Protest\u201d by \u201crequesting \u2018an opportunity to contest the merits of the [Board\u2019s] Opinion.\u2019 \u201d Because Mahindra\u2019s motion to strike again focused on the jurisdictional issue, we do not find that its request was sufficient to support a conclusion that Mahindra recognized the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and submitted itself to it. In all of its filings, Mahindra consistently maintained that the Board lacked jurisdiction due to insufficient service of process. Mahindra filed the motion to vacate \u201cfor the limited purpose\u201d of requesting that the Board vacate its order because Mahindra was not properly served. Although Mahindra \u201crequested] an opportunity to contest the merits\u201d of the Board\u2019s order, it conditioned this request upon \u201cthe Board... deciding] service was proper.\u201d Here, as in <em>Lyford, </em>Mahindra never actually addressed the merits of the dealers\u2019 claims. <em>Lyford, </em>97 N.H. at 169 (holding that defendant\u2019s assertion in its motion to vacate default judgment that it \u201c \u2018intends to defend said action\u2019 \u201d \u201csought no determination of the merits\u201d and therefore did not invoke court\u2019s jurisdiction). Consequently, we conclude that, as a matter of law, the character of Mahindra\u2019s request of the Board cannot be regarded as a waiver of its jurisdictional objection, and Mahindra\u2019s actions as a whole do not support a conclusion that it submitted itself to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction or that it waived its right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>to contest service of process. <em>See Estate of Lunt, </em>150 N.H. at 97-98 (holding that motion to strike default judgment was based solely on defective service and did not waive objections to personal jurisdiction); <em>Duncan v. McDonough, </em>105 N.H. 308, 310-11 (1964) (concluding that defendant did not waive his right to contest jurisdiction because all of his actions \u201cpertained to the jurisdictional issue and were in pursuance thereof\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Finally, the dealers argue that, to the extent that Mahindra contests personal jurisdiction, it waived that issue by failing to include it in its motion to vacate the default judgment. Implicit in Mahindra\u2019s argument that it never received proper service is the argument that the Board never obtained personal jurisdiction over Mahindra because \u201c[i]n order to obtain jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, proper service of process is required.\u201d <em>Impact Food Sales, </em>160 N.H. at 390. Therefore, because Mahindra pursued its challenge to service of process throughout this litigation, we conclude that it did not waive its argument that the Board lacked personal jurisdiction to adjudicate the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We hold that the trial court erred in finding that Mahindra waived its objection to service of process and submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Board. Consequently, because the Board never obtained personal jurisdiction over Mahindra, we need not reach Mahindra\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in finding that the Board had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the dealers\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
