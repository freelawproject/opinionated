Bass, for allegedly violating RSA 664:16-a (2008) (amended 2014) by engaging in \u201cpush-polling.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 664:21, VI (Supp. 2013). The AG argues that the trial court erroneously determined that the Federal Election Campaign Act, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30101 <em>et seq. </em>(FECA),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> preempts RSA 664:16-a. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order or are otherwise undisputed on the record before us. In September 2010, the AG\u2019s Office received information regarding polling telephone calls made to New Hampshire residents that were described as containing negative content about United States congressional candidate Aun McLane Kuster. The AG investigated, and concluded that the Committee had engaged in \u201cpush-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>polling\u201d as defined in RSA 664:2, XVII (2008) (amended 2014) without complying with the disclosure requirements set forth in RSA 664:16-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">At the time of the AG\u2019s investigation, RSA 664:2, XVII defined \u201c \u2018push-polling\u2019 \u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">(a) Calling voters on behalf of, in support of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office by telephone; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">(b) Asking questions related to opposing candidates for public office which state, imply, or convey information about the candidates[\u2019] character, status, or political stance or record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">(c) Conducting such calling in a manner which is likely to be construed by the voter to be a survey or poll to gather statistical data for entities or organizations which are acting independent of any particular political party, candidate, or interest group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">RSA 664:16-a provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">I. Any person who engages in push-polling, as defined in RSA 664:2, XVII, shall inform any person contacted that the telephone call is being made on behalf of, in support of, or in opposition to a particular candidate for public office, identify that candidate by name, and provide a telephone number from where the push-polling is conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">II. Any person or entity who violates paragraph I shall be subject to penalty under RSA 664:21, V and VI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">According to the AG, the Committee violated RSA 664:16-a by asking questions in the polling calls about Kuster that implied or conveyed negative information about her character, status, political stance, or record in a manner that was likely to be construed by voters as a survey or poll to gather statistical data for an independent entity or organization without disclosing that the calls were made on behalf of the Committee. As a result, the AG filed a petition in Superior Court against the Committee, seeking statutory civil penalties pursuant to RSA 664:21. After unsuccessfully attempting to remove the case to federal court, the Committee moved to dismiss the AG\u2019s petition on the ground that RSA 664:16-a is preempted by the FECA. The Committee contended that the FECA contains an express preemption provision that demonstrates Congress\u2019s \u201cexplicit intent to preempt state law with regard to the entire field of election laws concerning campaigns for federal offices.\u201d The preemption provision states, subject to limitations not relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-12\">[T]he provisions of [the FECA], and of rules prescribed under [the FECA], supersede and preempt any provision of State law with respect to election to Federal office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30143(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The Committee maintained that legislative history of the FECA demonstrates Congress\u2019s intent that the Act preempt state law with regard to reporting and disclosing political contributions and expenditures by federal candidates and political committees. The Committee also relied upon an advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that concluded that RSA 664:16-a is preempted by the FECA because, if applied to candidates for federal office who want to pay for telephone surveys, as defined in RSA 664:2, XVII, the statute would impose additional disclosures as to those expenditures. <em>See </em>F.E.C. Adv. Op. 2012-10,2012 WL 1529235, at *4 (F.E.C. Apr. 27, 2012). Thus, the Committee argued that RSA 664:16-a \u201cinterferes with the intent of Congress, by requiring a candidate for federal office to make disclosures regarding election-related expenditures\u201d and, therefore, is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The trial court ruled that the FECA preempts RSA 664:16, concluding that \u201c[p]ush-polling is a campaign expenditure because the campaign must expend funds in order to conduct the activity.\u201d The court ruled that, \u201c[b]ecause [the] FECA regulates the required disclosures associated with campaign expenditures, and because RSA 664:16-a mandates disclosure associated with a specific type of campaign expenditure, federal law preempts the state statute.\u201d The court therefore dismissed the AG\u2019s petition, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The sole issue for our review is whether the trial court erred when it ruled that RSA 664:16-a is preempted by the FECA because push-polling is a campaign expenditure and the FECA regulates the required disclosures associated with campaign expenditures. \u201cGenerally, when reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss, we consider whether the [plaintiffs] allegations are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery.\u201d <em>Gray v. Kelly, </em>161 N.H. 160, 164 (2010) (quotation omitted). Because the trial court\u2019s determination of federal preemption is a matter of law, our review is <em>de novo. See Appeal of Bretton Woods Tel. Co., </em>164 N.H. 379, 387 (2012); <em>Carlisle v. Frisbie Mem. Hosp., </em>152 N.H. 762, 770 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">We also review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Pelkey v. Dan\u2019s City Used Cars, </em>163 N.H. 483, 487 (2012), <em>aff'd, </em>133 S. Ct. 1769 (2013). The meaning of the FECA is a question of federal law, and we, therefore, interpret it in accordance with federal policy and precedent. <em>Cf. id. </em>When interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We do not read words or phrases in isolation, but in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">\n<em>III. Federal Preemption Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">We begin by reviewing the general principles of federal preemption. The federal preemption doctrine is based upon the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the United States Constitution. <em>See Arizona v. United States, </em>182 S. Ct. 2492, 2500 (2012); <em>Appeal of Sinclair Machine Prod\u2019s, Inc., </em>126 N.H. 822, 826 (1985). Article VI provides that federal law \u201cshall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2. \u201cUnder this principle, Congress has the power to preempt state law.\u201d <em>Arizona, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2500. \u201cConsideration of issues arising under the Supremacy Clause starts with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by Federal Act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992) (quotation, brackets and ellipsis omitted). \u201cAccordingly, the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone of pre-emption analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">To that end, courts look to the language of the pre-emption statute and the statutory framework surrounding it as well as the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole, as revealed not only in the text, but through the reviewing court\u2019s reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect interested parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-7\"><em>Janvey v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>793 F. Supp. 2d 825, 838 (N.D. Tex. 2011) (quotations omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>712 F.3d 185 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">\u201cCongress\u2019 intent may be explicitly stated in the statute\u2019s language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.\u201d <em>Cipollone, </em>505 U.S. at 516 (quotation omitted). \u201cExplicit statutory or regulatory language provides the clearest expression of preemptive intent.\u201d <em>Janvey, </em>793 F. Supp. 2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">\u2018When Congress has spoken expressly... the preemptive scope of a federal law is governed entirely by the express language.\u201d <em>Weber v. Heaney, </em>995 F.2d 872, 875 (8th Cir. 1993). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Cipollone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-10\">When Congress has considered the issue of pre-emption and has included in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly address<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ing that issue, and when that provision provides a reliable indicium of congressional intent with respect to state authority, there is no need to infer congressional intent to pre-empt state laws from the substantive provisions of the legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-5\"><em>Cipollone, </em>505 U.S. at 517 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Since \u201c[preemption of any type fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,\u201d <em>Teper v. Miller, </em>82 F.3d 989, 993 (11th Cir. 1996) (quotation omitted), our preemption analysis begins with the source of the alleged preemption. See <em>DerGazarian v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>836 F. Supp. 1429, 1431 (W.D. Ark. 1993). We, therefore, turn to an examination of the relevant sections of the FECA.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\n<em>TV. The FECA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Originally enacted in 1971, the FECA sets forth \u201can intricate federal statutory scheme governing campaign contributions and expenditures related to federal elections.\u201d <em>Teper, </em>82 F.3d at 994; <em>see Weber, </em>995 F.2d at 875. Its \u201cprimary purpose ... is to regulate campaign contributions and expenditures in order to eliminate pernicious influence \u2014 actual or perceived \u2014 over candidates by those who contribute large sums\u201d of money. <em>Karl Rove &amp; Co. v. Thornburgh, </em>39 F.3d 1273, 1281 (5th Cir. 1994). To this end, \u201c[t]he FECA imposes limits and restrictions on contributions; provides for the formation and registration of political committees; and mandates reporting and disclosure of receipts and disbursements made by such committees.\u201d <em>Running v. Com. of Ky., </em>42 F.3d 1008, 1011 (6th Cir. 1994) (referring to provisions in the FECA dealing with the organization, registration, and reporting requirements for political committees). The FECA defines \u201c[t]he term \u2018expenditure\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cany purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30'101(9)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">\u201cThe FECA also created the [FEC], which is empowered with the administration and enforcement of the Act.\u201d <em>Bunning, </em>42 F.3d at 1011. \u201cCongress delegated the FEC extensive rulemaking and adjudicative powers and authorized it to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of [the] FECA.\u201d <em>Weber, </em>995 F.2d at 875 (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cThe FEC also is empowered to give advisory opinions when requested.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30107(a)(7), 30108.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The critical language in the preemption provision states that the FECA shall \u201cpreempt any provision of State law with respect to election to Federal office.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30143(a). \u201cWhile at first blush, [the preemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>provision] appears to have an exceedingly broad scope, courts have not interpreted [it] in that manner.\u201d <em>Krikorian v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>No. 1:10CV103, 2010 WL 4117556, at *10 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 19, 2010). \u201cRather, courts have recognized that [the provision] is ambiguous and have given [it] a narrow preemptive effect in light of its legislative history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted); <em>see Karl Rove &amp; Co., </em>39 F.3d at 1280; <em>Weber, </em>995 F.2d at 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">To determine whether the scope of the preemption provision is broad enough to preclude enforcement of RSA 664:16-a against federal candidates and political committees, we must \u201cidentify the domain expressly [preempted].\u201d <em>Burning, </em>42 F.3d at 1011 (quotation omitted); <em>see Cipollone, </em>505 U.S. at 517. Because the preemption provision is ambiguous, we look to its legislative history. <em>See ATV Watch v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Resources &amp; Econ. Dev., </em>155 N.H. 434, 437 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The preemption provision, enacted in 1974, \u201creplaced a prior version [of the statute] which expressly saved state laws from preemption, except where compliance with state law would result in a violation of the FECA, or would prohibit conduct permitted by the FECA.\u201d <em>Bunning, </em>42 F.3d at 1012. \u201cThe House Committee that drafted the current provision intended \u2018to make certain that the Federal law is construed to occupy the field with respect to elections to Federal office and that the Federal law will be the sole authority under which such elections will be regulated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Teper, </em>82 F.3d at 994 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1239, at 10 (1974)). Significantly, the legislative history reveals that Congress intended \u201cFederal law [to] occup[y] the field with respect to reporting and <em>disclosure of political contributions to and expenditures by Federal candidates and political committees.\u201d </em>S. Rep. No. 93-1237 (1974) (Conf. Rep.), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5587, 5668 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The preemption provision \u201cincorporates by reference \u2018rules prescribed under\u2019 [the] FECA,\u201d and, pursuant to its authority, \u201c[t]he FEC has issued a regulation interpreting the scope of [this provision] in accordance with the statute\u2019s plain language and its legislative history.\u201d <em>Krikorian, </em>2010 WL 4117556, at *11; <em>see </em>11 C.F.R. \u00a7 108.7 (2014). That regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">(a) The provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, and rules and regulations issued thereunder, supersede and preempt any provision of State law with respect to election to Federal office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">(b) Federal law supersedes State law concerning the \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">(1) Organization and registration of political committees supporting Federal candidates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>(2) Disclosure of receipts and expenditures by Federal candidates and political committees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">(3) Limitation on contributions and expenditures regarding Federal candidates and political committees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">(c) The Act does not supersede State laws which provide for the \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">(1) Manner of qualifying as a candidate or political party organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">(2) Dates and places of elections;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-9\">(3) Voter registration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-10\">(4) Prohibition of false registration, voting fraud, theft of ballots, and similar offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-11\">(5) Candidate\u2019s personal financial disclosure; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-12\">(6) Application of State law to the funds used for the purchase or construction of a State or local party office building to the extent described in 11 CFR 300.35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">11 C.F.R. \u00a7 108.7. Thus, our examination of the language of the preemption provision itself and its interpretative regulation, along with the legislative history of the FECA, demonstrates that the FECA preempts laws related to federal campaign expenditures and <em>disclosure </em>of such expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">\n<em>V. Application of the Preemption Provision to RSA 66p.l6-a</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">The AG argues that the FECA does not preempt RSA 664:16-a because the FECA governs campaign expenditures and \u201cRSA 664:16-a constitutes a disclaimer requirement, not a statute regarding campaign expenditures.\u201d The Committee disagrees, contending that RSA 664:16-a is preempted by the FECA to the extent it applies to <em>disclosures </em>of campaign <em>expenditures </em>by federal candidates and political committees because \u201c[disclosures concerning the financing or control of polling efforts like those at issue in this case are <em>not </em>among the narrow categories of legitimate state regulation that escape the ambit of\u2019 the preemption provision. Although we recognize that there is a \u201cstrong presumption against pre-emption,\u201d <em>Cipollone, </em>505 U.S. at 523, and that \u201ccourts have given [the preemption provision] a narrow preemptive effect in light of its legislative history,\u201d <em>Karl Rove &amp; Co., </em>39 F.3d at 1280 (quotation omitted), we nonetheless conclude that RSA 664:16-a, as applied to election to federal office, falls within the scope of the preemption provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">On its face, RSA 664:16-a does not fit neatly within the ambit of any of the areas specifically preempted or excepted in 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 108.7. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>RSA 664:16-a \u201cis intended to insure that the public is fully informed when candidates engage in push-polling\u201d by requiring \u201ccandidates [to] be fully accountable for the statements and messages generated by their campaigns.\u201d Laws 1998, 12:1. The statute\u2019s aim, therefore, is to prevent the \u201cadverse impact on the political process\u201d caused by anonymous push-polling. <em>Id. </em>\u201cNonetheless, it is the <em>effect </em>of the state law that matters in determining preemption, not its intent or purpose.\u201d <em>Teper, </em>82 F.3d at 995. \u201cUnder the Supremacy Clause, state law that in effect substantially impedes or frustrates federal regulation, or trespasses on a field occupied by federal law, must yield, no matter how admirable or unrelated the purpose of that law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Here, the version of RSA 664:16-a in effect at the time the AG brought this action required the Committee to disclose that the telephone calls were \u201cbeing made on behalf of, in support of, or in opposition to a particular candidate for public office, identify that candidate by name, and provide a telephone number from where the push-polling is conducted.\u201d RSA 664:16-a, I. The effect of requiring such disclaimers is to reveal the identity of the sponsor of the telephone calls, <em>ie., </em>to disclose who is paying for the calls. In this way, RSA 664:16-a imposes a disclosure requirement on campaign expenditures related to the election of a candidate for federal office.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The AG argues that RSA 664:16-a \u201cdoes not directly <em>limit </em>campaign spending in the area of telephone surveys\u201d and that, \u201c[w]hile undoubtedly it is true that funds are expended to conduct polls, this does not support or suggest the conclusion that requiring a disclaimer be included in the script of a poll <em>limits </em>the amount of money that can be spent on polling activity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The AG\u2019s argument, however, addresses only a part of the domain regulated by the FECA. The FECA not only preempts laws that regulate <em>limits </em>on campaign expenditures by federal political committees, but also those that regulate <em>\u201c[disclosure </em>of. . . expenditures by . . . political committees.\u201d 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 108.7(b)(2) (emphasis added). Indeed, our discussion of the FECA\u2019s legislative history above makes clear that Congress intended the FECA to occupy \u201cthe field with respect to . . . disclosure of political contributions to and expenditures by Federal candidates and political committees.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1237 (Conf. Rep.). Moreover, the title of subchapter one of the FECA is entitled \u201cDisclosure of Federal Campaign Funds.\u201d <em>See Bourne v. Sullivan, </em>104 N.H. 348, 352-53 (1962) (title of act not conclusive, but significant when considered in connection with legislative history). The logical effect of the requirements in RSA 664:16-a is to require disclosure of expenditures. Accordingly, we conclude that RSA 664:16-a, as applied to a federal candidate or political committee, is preempted by the FECA.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>We note that our conclusion is in accord with the FEC advisory opinion addressing the precise issue here. <em>See </em>F.E.C. Adv. Op. 2012-10, 2012 WL 1529235, at *2; <em>see also </em>52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30108(c). The FEC concluded that RSA 664:16-a, I, is preempted by the FECA and the FEC\u2019s regulations \u201cwith respect to the proposed telephone surveys made on behalf of Federal candidates, their authorized committees, or other Federal political committees that refer only to candidates for Federal office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the FEC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-3\">The legislative history of the [FECA] makes clear that Congress intended to make certain that the Federal law is construed to occupy the field with respect to elections to Federal office and that the Federal law will be the sole authority under which such elections will be regulated.... Federal law occupies the field with respect to reporting and disclosure of political contributions to, and expenditures by, Federal candidates and political committees, but does not affect State laws as to the manner of qualifying as a candidate, or the dates and places of elections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\">Here, [RSA 664:16-a], if applied to Federal candidates who wish to pay for the telephone surveys described in the request, would impose an additional disclaimer requirement on those expenditures. Under the Act\u2019s preemption clause, only Federal law may require disclosure regarding expenditures by Federal candidates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\"><em>Id. </em>at *2, 4 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We recognize that our decision prevents the AG from enforcing RSA 664:16-a against a federal candidate or committee. Nor can the AG bring a private action against a federal candidate or committee under the FECA. <em>See </em>52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30106(b)(1), 30107(e), 30109. Nonetheless, the absence of a direct cause of action alone is no bar to preemption if, as in this case, Congress has manifested a clear intention to preempt certain state law causes of action. <em>Cf. Pelkey, </em>163 N.H. at 496 (noting that absence of any federal remedy for private injuries of the kind allegedly suffered supported conclusion that federal law did not preempt state law). Moreover, although the AG cannot bring an action under RSA 664:16-a because the FEC has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over enforcing\u201d the provisions of the FECA, <em>Kean for Congress Committee v. Federal Election, </em>398 F. Supp. 2d 26, 28 (D.D.C. 2005); <em>see </em>52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106(b)(1), we note that the FECA \u201cpermits \u2018any person\u2019 to file a signed, sworn administrative complaint with the FEC alleging a violation of [the] FECA.\u201d <em>Kean, </em>398 F. Supp. 2d at 28-29; <em>see </em>52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Citing the exceptions to preemption in 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 108.7(c), the AG maintains that \u201c[fjederal regulations establish that a state may regulate federal campaigns directly and <em>specifically, </em>even if it regulates <em>activities that are paid for </em>by the campaign.\u201d To the extent that the exceptions in section 108.7(c) \u201cregulate federal campaigns directly and specifically,\u201d however, those exceptions are grounded in the constitutional authority granted to States to regulate broad election matters related to the voting process itself \u2014 matters unrelated to campaign expenditures. <em>See Cook v. Gralike, </em>531 U.S. 510, 523 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The United States Supreme Court has explained that States have no inherent authority to regulate elections to federal office. <em>See U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, </em>514 U.S. 779, 804, 833-34 (1995). Rather, \u201cpowers over the election of federal officers had to be delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Elections Clause to the United States Constitution delegated to the States the power to regulate the \u201ctimes, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and representatives.\u201d U.S. CONST, art. I, \u00a7 4. The Supreme Court has construed this clause to grant states \u201c \u2018broad power\u2019 to prescribe the procedural mechanisms for holding congressional elections.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>531 U.S. at 523. These procedural mechanisms encompass \u201cmatters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523-24 (quotation omitted). Thus, the exceptions in section 108.7(c) \u201cmerely acknowledge a long-standing constitutional dichotomy concerning which aspects of federal elections the states may regulate.\u201d <em>Dewald v. Wriggelsworth, </em>748 F.3d 295, 308 (6th Cir. 2014) (Cole, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The AG also cites the FEC\u2019s decision in <em>In the Matter of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee </em>to argue that \u201cthe FEC has explicitly found that polling activities are not subject to [the] FECA\u2019s disclaimer requirements.\u201d <em>See In the Matter of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee &amp; a., </em>MUR 5835 (F.E.C. July 1, 2009), <em>available at </em>http:// eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocs/29044244624.pdf. In that decision, the FEC determined that survey research (referred to as \u201cpolls\u201d) conducted over the telephone on behalf of a political committee does not require disclaimers under the FECA. <em>Id. </em>at 1,4. That decision, however, examined the reach of former 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441d (2012), now reclassified as 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30120, dealing with the publication and distribution of statements and solicitations, a provision of the FECA not at issue in this case. Moreover, the FEC distinguished the polls at issue in that case, which it referred to as \u201clegitimate forms of survey research,\u201d from the push-polls alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>occurred in this case, which the FEC described as \u201ca survey instrument containing questions which attempt to change the opinion of contacted voters, generally by divulging negative information about the candidate which is designed to push the voter away from him or her and pull the voter toward the candidate paying for the polling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10 (quotation omitted). Since the FEC addressed only the disclaimer requirements for the former type of polls, we decline to find its decision applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The AG further contends that our determination in this case \u201cmust be made by reference to [the] FECA\u2019s own expenditure regulations and whether consideration of RSA 664:16-a <em>duplicates . . . </em>those expenditure regulations.\u201d We disagree. \u201cNothing in the language of\u2019 the preemption provision \u201csuggests that [the] FECA\u2019s pre-emption is limited to <em>inconsistent </em>state regulation.\u201d <em>Weber, </em>995 F.2d at 876 n.4 (quotations omitted). \u201cThus, supplemental and consistent state regulation is preempted as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Nor are we persuaded by the AG\u2019s argument that if RSA 664:16-a is preempted by the FECA, then \u201cvirtually all state statutes that in any way involve expenditures by a campaign committee would be preempted.\u201d Our task here is to determine whether RSA 664:16-a requires disclosure of campaign expenditures such that it falls within the boundaries of the preemption provision. We have concluded that it does. Whether other statutes involve campaign expenditures so as to be similarly preempted does not control our analysis, and we express no opinion with respect to the preemption of any other state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The AG cites several cases from other jurisdictions in which courts have not found preemption \u201c[e]ven where state regulations deal with the transfer of funds or involve transactions that could, in theory, affect expenditures.\u201d <em>See Janvey v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>712 F.3d 185 (5th Cir. 2013); <em>Karl Rove &amp; Co., </em>39 F.3d 1273; <em>Stern v. General Elec. Co., </em>924 F.2d 472 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Trie, </em>21 F. Supp. 2d 7 (D.D.C. 1998); <em>State v. Jude, </em>554 N.W.2d 750 (Minn. Ct. App. 1996). However, these cases are inapposite because they pertain to state laws that did not regulate expenditures or disclosure of expenditures related to election to federal office.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">For instance, <em>Janvey </em>involved a suit brought under the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (TUFTA) against several national political committees to recover certain political contributions made to the committees alleged to be made as fraudulent conveyances. <em>Janvey, </em>712 F.3d at 189. In that ease, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the claim brought under the TUFTA was not preempted by the FECA because the \u201cTUFTA is a general state law that happen[ed] to apply to [the] federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>political committees in [that] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200. Similarly, in <em>Karl Rove &amp; Company, </em>the Fifth Circuit \u201crejected a federal candidate\u2019s argument that FECA preempted a company\u2019s state law cause of action against him for the debts of his campaign committee,\u201d <em>id.-, see Karl Rove &amp; Co., </em>39 F.3d at 1280, finding that the preemption provision did not \u201cstretch ... far enough to create a preemptive bar to applying state law to hold federal candidates personally liable\u201d for such debts. <em>Karl Rove &amp; Co., </em>39 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Likewise, in <em>Stem, </em>the Second Circuit Court of Appeals addressed whether state law corporate waste claims based upon a corporation\u2019s use of funds to support federal political campaigns were preempted by the FECA. <em>Stem, </em>924 F.2d at 474. Noting that the preemption provision of the FECA \u201crelates only to state-law provisions with respect to election to Federal office,\u201d the court explained that \u201c[t]he narrow wording of this provision suggests that Congress did not intend to preempt state regulation with respect to non-election-related activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475 (quotation omitted). The court concluded that the FECA did not \u201cpreclude New York from pursuing its independent interest in ensuring that corporate directors exercise sound judgment in the expenditure of corporate funds,\u201d and that the state law corporate waste claims were not preempted. <em>Id. </em>The courts in other cases cited by the AG reached similar conclusions. <em>See also Trie, </em>21 F. Supp. 2d at 18-19 (denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss certain counts in indictment brought under general felony statute on preemption grounds because Congress did not express any intent that misdemeanor sanctions of FECA be a substitute for all other possible criminal sanctions); <em>Jude, </em>554 N.W.2d at 753, 752 (finding that FECA does not preempt state law prohibiting \u201cfalse campaign advertisements, and other false statements in the course of a campaign\u201d because law \u201cmerely prohibits certain nonfinancial campaign practices\u201d). Unlike the state laws examined in those cases, the effect of RSA 664:16-a is to mandate a disclosure requirement upon campaign expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">\n<em>VI. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In summary, we conclude that RSA 664:16-a imposes a disclosure requirement on campaign expenditures related to the election of a candidate for federal office. Accordingly, we hold that the FECA preempts RSA 664:16-a as applied to federal candidates and political committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b830-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-13\"> Effective September 1, 2014, the provisions of the FECA were transferred from Title 2 to Title 52 of the United States Code. <em>See </em>Office of the Law Revision Counsel, United States Code, <em>Editorial Reclassification Title 52, United States Code, available at http:// uscode.house.gov/editori.alreclassification/t52/index.html. </em>As of the date of this opinion, the printed version of Title 52 is not available and, therefore, we have not included dates in our citations to the FECA.
