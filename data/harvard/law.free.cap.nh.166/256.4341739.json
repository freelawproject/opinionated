We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">The record supports the following facts. The resort is located in Lincoln. Live entertainment is offered in a function room that features both a stage and public address system. Peter Spanos, the president and owner of the resort, testified that his enterprise is a \u201cresort type business\u201d with \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>restaurant, rooms, [and] entertainment,\u201d which offers live entertainment on sixty to seventy percent of the nights that it is open. He further testified that the resort advertises upcoming entertainment in local newspapers, online promotions, and flyers, and explained that the resort spent $120,000 on entertainment in 2009, featuring approximately fifty entertainers during that year. Meals and optional lodging are provided to entertainers.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Coulombe appeared as a musical entertainer at the resort in both solo and group performances beginning in approximately 1980. He also performed at other venues but testified that he performed at the resort nearly three hundred times in the last two years that he worked there. The resort and Coulombe negotiated a pay rate for Coulombe\u2019s services, and he was paid weekly for his performances. He provided his own instruments and selected the songs he would play in his performances, though the resort asked him to perform new material prior to the end of his relationship with the resort. He reported that his last booking with the resort occurred on June 2, 2012, after which the relationship terminated. He subsequently filed for unemployment benefits with DES.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On July 19, 2012, DES determined that Coulombe was eligible for unemployment benefits. The resort appealed this determination to the DES Appeal Tribunal (tribunal). Following a hearing, the tribunal concluded that Coulombe \u201cdid not provide services in employment\u201d under the exception contained in RSA 282-A:9, III (2010). Specifically, the tribunal concluded that the resort is in the business of, among other things, \u201ccoordinating\u201d entertainment, which it distinguished from \u201cthe business of singing, playing instruments, or other forms of entertainment.\u201d Coulombe\u2019s request for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Coulombe then appealed to the board. The board initially denied the appeal, but upon reconsideration, ruled that the tribunal\u2019s decision was erroneous because it drew a \u201cdistinction without substance\u201d regarding the coordination of entertainment services. Accordingly, the board awarded unemployment benefits to Coulombe. The board denied the resort\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On appeal, the resort argues that: (1) RSA 282-A:65 (2010) required the board to affirm the tribunal\u2019s decision; (2) the tribunal\u2019s decision was legally and factually correct; and (3) the board\u2019s order is \u201cinconsistent with, and undermines, the purpose of\u2019 RSA chapter 282-A. Coulombe responds that: (1) the resort failed to prove that entertainment services in general, and Coulombe\u2019s entertainment services in particular, were outside its usual course of business under RSA 282-A:9,111(b); and (2) the board\u2019s order is consistent with RSA chapter 282-A\u2019s remedial purpose to help unemployed workers like Coulombe.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>RSA 282-A:65 permits the board to reverse the tribunal only in certain circumstances. <em>Appeal of N.H. Sweepstakes Commission, </em>130 N.H. 659, 662 (1988). The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">The appellate board shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner or appeal tribunal as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, or as to the prudence or desirability of the determination. The appellate board shall reverse or modify the decision or remand the case for further proceedings only if the substantial rights of the appellant had been prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions, or the decision is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">I.

Sweepstakes Commission, </em>130 N.H. at 662; <em>see </em>RSA 282-A:67, II (2010). We may reverse or modify the tribunal\u2019s decision only in limited circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">The court shall reverse or modify the decision of the appeal tribunal, or remand the case for further proceedings, as determined by the court, only if the substantial rights of the appellant had been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, or conclusions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-15\">(a) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-16\">(b) In excess of statutory authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-17\">(c) Made upon unlawful procedures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>(d) Clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">(e) Affected by other error of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Otherwise, the court shall affirm the appeal tribunal\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">RSA 282-A:67, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The resort challenges Coulombe\u2019s employment status based upon the exemption provided in RSA 282-A:9, III, which excludes certain workers from the definition of \u201cemployment.\u201d <em>See Appeal of Aspen Contracting NE, </em>164 N.H. 88, 89 (2012). Under RSA 282-A:9, III:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Services performed by an individual for wages shall be deemed to be employment subject to this chapter unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner of the department of employment security that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">(a) Such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services, both under his contract of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">(b) Such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed or that such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">(c) Such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">\u201cThe burden is on the party challenging an \u2018employment\u2019 determination to establish that all three requirements for exclusion have been satisfied; failure to establish any of them is conclusive proof of employment for purposes of RSA chapter 282-A.\u201d <em>Appeal of Aspen Contracting NE, </em>164 N.H. at 91 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">This appeal hinges upon the meaning of RSA 282-A:9,III(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-15\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. </em>We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. In interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. Unless we find that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>language is ambiguous, we need not look to legislative intent. Furthermore, we interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Appeal of Stewart, </em>164 N.H. 772, 775 (2013) (quotation omitted). RSA 282-A:9,111(b) sets forth two circumstances under which a service will not be considered employment: when a service is \u201coutside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed\u201d or when a service is \u201cperformed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed.\u201d RSA 282-A:9,111(b). The provision is \u201cdisjunctive, meaning that the employer needs to show only one of the two alternatives.\u201d <em>Sinclair Builders v. Unemployment Ins., </em>73 A.3d 1061, 1067 (Me. 2013) (interpreting identical Maine statutory provision). Neither party argues that Coulombe provided entertainment \u201coutside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed.\u201d RSA 282-A:9,III(b). Therefore, we focus on whether Coulombe\u2019s services were outside the resort\u2019s usual course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u201cOutside the usual course of the business\u201d can be an elusive concept. <em>See Carpet Remnant Warehouse v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>593 A.2d 1177, 1186 (N.J. 1991) (interpreting similar provision in New Jersey statute). We have not adopted a general standard as to the meaning of this phrase, but several other courts have done so with regard to statutory provisions analogous to RSA 282-A:9, III(b). <em>See, e.g., Mattatuck Museum v. Unemployment Comp., </em>679 A.2d 347, 351 (Conn. 1996); <em>Yurs v. Director of Labor, Dep\u2019t of Labor, Div. of U.C., </em>235 N.E.2d 871, 875 (Ill. App. Ct. 1968); <em>Sinclair Builders, </em>73 A.3d at 1067; <em>Bigfoot\u2019s, Inc. v. Bd. of Rev. of Indus. Com\u2019n, </em>710 P.2d 180, 181 (Utah 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We find the Supreme Court of Connecticut\u2019s approach most useful. In <em>Mattatuck Museum, </em>the court examined a statutory provision similar to RSA 282-A:9, IH(b), and held that \u201c[i]f ... an enterprise undertakes an activity, not as an isolated instance but as a regular or continuous practice, the activity will constitute part of the enterprise\u2019s usual course of business irrespective of its substantiality in relation to the other activities engaged in by the enterprise.\u201d <em>Mattatuck Museum, </em>679 A.2d at 351. We adopt this standard and conclude that Coulombe\u2019s services \u2014 and, more generally, live entertainment \u2014 were within the resort\u2019s usual course of business because they were regularly and continuously provided at the resort. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The resort emphasizes its other amenities \u2014 including lodging, outdoor sporting activities, and scenic locations \u2014 to argue that the lounge and its related live entertainment are not essential to its business. The availability of these other amenities and services, however, does not negate the regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>and continuous presence of live entertainment and, more specifically, Coulombe\u2019s performances at the resort. <em>See id. </em>Spanos testified that the resort offers live entertainment on sixty to seventy percent of the nights that it is open. Moreover, Coulombe\u2019s particular services were provided on a regular and frequent basis. He appeared at the resort for approximately thirty years and had nearly three hundred bookings in the last two years that he performed at the resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The resort also argues that Coulombe\u2019s services are not within its usual course of business because it \u201cdoes not itself provide live music and it is not a band or a group of musicians or singers,\u201d and, \u201cat most, [the resort] coordinates scheduling independent musicians such as Coulombe to play in the [resort] lounge.\u201d We agree with the board that this is a \u201cdistinction without substance\u201d in this case. The resort does not merely coordinate live entertainment. In addition to the regularity of live entertainment noted above, the resort maintains various amenities, including a stage and public address system, to facilitate live entertainment, and advertises upcoming performances to attract patrons to the resort. <em>Cf. Bigfoot\u2019s, Inc., </em>710 P.2d at 181 (\u201cSince it was usual and customary for the hotel to furnish entertainment in connection with its operations, the employment of musicians . . . was within the \u2018usual course of the business.\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Nor are we persuaded by the resort\u2019s suggestion that the board erred by failing to appreciate that Coulombe\u2019s services merely contributed to the resort\u2019s \u201cambience.\u201d The resort relies upon <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission v. Mathews, </em>111 P.2d 111, 119 (Wyo. 1941). In that case, the Supreme Court of Wyoming assessed the employment status of musicians performing in a restaurant and reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">If a restaurant owner contracts with a florist to supply flowers for his tables, is that a service within the \u201cusual course\u201d of the owner\u2019s business? Flowers on the restaurant tables give pleasure to the owner\u2019s guests as does music played by those who can be hired to supply it in the restaurant rooms. Are the florist and those employed by him employees of the owner? We are inclined to think not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\"><em>Id. </em>The resort cites this language in its brief and, at oral argument, analogized Coulombe\u2019s performances to these decorative \u201cfloral arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ments\u201d to argue that live entertainment is not in the resort\u2019s usual course of business but rather a part of the resort\u2019s \u201cambience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">This argument ignores the significance of Coulombe\u2019s services to the resort\u2019s business. Rather than creating mere \u201cambience,\u201d Coulombe\u2019s services were used to attract new business to the resort, whose president and owner testified that the business provides \u201centertainment.\u201d The record includes several advertisements featuring Coulombe\u2019s likeness and the name of his musical acts. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Coulombe\u2019s services were not incidental to, but rather were an integral part of, the resort\u2019s business. <em>Cf Sinclair Builders, </em>73 A.3d at 1067 (\u201cIn order to demonstrate that an individual\u2019s services are not within the employer\u2019s usual course of business, the employer must show that the service is not an integral part of the employer\u2019s business, but is rather merely incidental to it.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Finally, the resort contends that the board\u2019s order undermines the purpose of RSA chapter 282-A. Specifically, the resort argues that Coulombe is an independent contractor who was free to perform, and did perform, for other entities, and that the unemployment compensation statute was not designed to offer assistance to such individuals. The resort further asserts that the \u201cmischaracterization\u201d of singers and musicians as employees could encourage New Hampshire businesses to refrain from hiring those individuals and thus jeopardize the employment prospects of independent musical artists.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\"> \u201cThe purpose of our unemployment compensation statute, RSA chapter 282-A, is to prevent the spread of unemployment and to lighten the burden on those workers who are involuntarily unemployed through no fault of their own.\u201d <em>Appeal of Aspen Contracting NE, </em>164 N.H. at 90 (quotation and brackets omitted). Because we have determined that Coulombe was an employee for the purposes of RSA chapter 282-A, our conclusion is not contrary to the statute\u2019s purpose. The resort\u2019s argument that such a decision will impose \u201csignificant legal restrictions and financial obligations\u201d on businesses and thus \u201cplace a whole group of independent musical artists out of work\u201d is equally unpersuasive because the determination of whether a particular entertainer is an employee under RSA chapter 282-A turns upon the unique facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Because the resort has failed to demonstrate that it meets the test of RSA 282-A:9, III(b), we need not consider whether it satisfied the two remaining requirements set forth in RSA 282-A:9,III(a) and (c). <em>See id.; cf. Appeal of Work-a-Day of Nashua, </em>132 N.H. 289, 293 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-10\">Dalianis, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> The resort further argues that <em>Bigfoot\u2019s, Inc. </em>is distinguishable because \u201c[tjhe employer in <em>Bigfoot\u2019s, Inc. </em>operated a beer bar and not a diverse family-oriented resort such as [the resort\u2019s] facility\u201d and \u201c[t]here was no evidence referenced in the <em>Bigfoot\u2019s, Inc. </em>case that the beer hall owner also featured scenic attractions, dining and other family-friendly activities as part of its business and as part of its allure to guests.\u201d We are not persuaded by this distinction, for our analysis does not turn on whether the business enterprises are identical or analogous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
