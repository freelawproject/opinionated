The plaintiffs appeal rulings of the Superior Court <em>{McNamara, </em>J. and <em>Smukler, </em>J.) denying their summary judgment motions and granting the defendants\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment on two counts in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition. We reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that New Hampshire Administrative Rules, He-M 426.04(a)(2) does not violate the federal Medicaid Act and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Harbor Homes is a non-profit New Hampshire corporation in Nashua that provides independent living and support services (rehabilitative services) to Medicaid-eligible individuals with serious mental illness. The individual plaintiffs received Medicaid-funded rehabilitative services from Harbor Homes. DHHS is the state agency responsible for administering the Medicaid program in New Hampshire. <em>Bel Air Assocs. v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>154 N.H. 228, 229 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\n<em>A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axs\">\n<em>1. Medicaid</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The Medicaid program, established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>(Medicaid Act), is a cooperative federal-state program in which the federal government offers funding to states that provide healthcare services to certain individuals who cannot afford to pay their own medical costs (Medicaid program). <em>See Bel Air Assocs. v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>158 N.H. 104, 105, 108 (2008). Although state \u201cparticipation in the Medicaid program is entirely optional, once a State elects to participate, it must comply with the requirements of Title XIX.\u201d <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">\u201cEach state designs, implements, and manages its own Medicaid program, with discretion as to the proper mix of amount, scope, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>duration limitations on coverage.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood Arizona Inc. v. Betlach, </em>727 F.3d 960, 963 (9th Cir. 2013) (quotation omitted) <em>(Planned Parenthood of </em>Arizona); see <em>also Dist. of Col. Pod. Soc. v. District of Columbia, </em>407 F. Supp. 1259, 1263 (D.C. 1975) (explaining that states are given \u201cconsiderable discretion and latitude in devising their Medicaid Plans\u201d). In designing its Medicaid program, each state \u201cmust create its own administrative rules and regulations for operating the Medicaid program in that state.\u201d <em>Moore ex rel. Moore v. Reese, </em>637 F.3d 1220, 1238 (11th Cir. 2011). The discretion afforded to each state in designing its Medicaid program, however, has limits: \u201cTo receive Medicaid funding, states must comply with federal criteria governing, among other matters, who is eligible for care, what services must be provided, how reimbursement is to be determined, and what range of choice Medicaid recipients must be afforded in selecting their doctors.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Arizona, </em>727 F.3d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">One of the Medicaid Act\u2019s requirements is that state Medicaid programs must allow \u201cany individual eligible for medical assistance\u201d to \u201cobtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) (2012). This is known as the free-choice-of-provider provision. <em>See Planned Parenthood v. Com\u2019r of Dept. Health, </em>699 F.3d 962, 969 (7th Cir. 2012) <em>(.Planned Parenthood of Indiana). </em>This provision affords Medicaid beneficiaries \u201cthe right to choose among a range of <em>qualified </em>providers, without government interference.\u201d <em>O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, </em>447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). Thus, \u201c[w]hen several qualified providers of a service exist, the state may not dictate where a Medicaid recipient is to receive treatment.\u201d <em>King by King v. Sullivan, </em>776 F. Supp. 645, 655 (D.R.1.1991). States may establish \u201creasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.51(c)(2) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In formulating its Medicaid program, each state may elect to provide certain optional services or may extend services to certain populations that might not otherwise be covered. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii), 1396d(a) (2012). When a state provides optional services, it must do so consistent with Medicaid requirements and regulations, including the free-choice-of-provider provision. <em>See Eder v.

Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Since 1991, Harbor Homes has participated in New Hampshire\u2019s Medicaid program pursuant to a Medicaid Provider Enrollment Agreement. On June 23, 2008, Harbor Homes entered into an interagency agreement (IAA) with a community mental health program, Community Council of Nashua, NH, now known as Greater Nashua Mental Health Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>(GNMHC), which authorized Harbor Homes, as a community mental health provider, to provide certain Medicaid-funded rehabilitative services to GNMHC patients. The purpose of the IAA was to ensure collaborative service planning and delivery, continuity of care between Harbor Homes and GNMHC, with minimal resource duplication, and the provision of twenty-four hour emergency services. <em>See </em>N.H. ADMIN. Rules, He-M 426.04(a)(2). By its terms, the IAA was \u201ceffective for the period beginning July 1, 2008 and ending on June 30, 2011.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\">Under the IAA, Harbor Homes provided services to approximately one hundred and sixty individuals with serious mental illness, including the individual plaintiffs in this case. GNMHC is responsible for psychiatry and case management for the individuals served by Harbor Homes as well as preparing and approving individual treatment plans that prescribe the type and level of service needed for the individuals receiving services from Harbor Homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In February 2011, Harbor Homes learned that GNMHC did not intend to renew the IAA and that the Medicaid reimbursable services provided by Harbor Homes would be transitioned to GNMHC. Under Rule He-M 426.04(a)(2), because, as of July 1, 2011, Harbor Homes would no longer have an IAA with a community mental health provider, it would no longer be permitted to provide Medicaid funded mental health services to approximately one hundred and forty of its clients, including the individual plaintiffs in this ease. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. RULES, He-M 426.04(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On June 28, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a petition for injunctive and declaratory relief, seeking a court order enjoining DHHS from \u201cterminating or limiting Harbor Homes\u2019 status as a qualified Medicaid provider\u201d and directing the State to allow the individual plaintiffs to obtain community mental health services from Harbor Homes, the provider of their choice. Following two hearings, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction. Thereafter, all parties moved for partial summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that DHHS\u2019s reliance upon the IAA requirement as a reason to terminate Harbor Homes\u2019s status as a qualified Medicaid provider was improper because the requirement is invalid both on its face and as applied in this case. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion, in part, and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 facial challenge to the validity of the regulation failed as a matter of law because \u201c[t]he IAA requirement relates to administration of the state [Medicaid] plan and qualifications of providers pursuant to the Medicaid Act\u201d and is, therefore, a valid requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The remaining issues were later disposed of by order or voluntary nonsuit without prejudice, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, \u201cwe consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Granite State Mgmt. &amp; Res. v. City of Concord, </em>165 N.H. 277,282 (2013) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>III. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Although the plaintiffs advance four arguments on appeal, we need consider only one: whether DHHS\u2019s reliance upon the IAA requirement to disqualify Harbor Homes as a community mental health provider violates the free-choice-of-provider provision of the Medicaid Act. The plaintiffs contend that the IAA requirement does not relate to a provider\u2019s qualifications to perform services and, therefore, violates the free-choice-of-provider provision. The defendants counter that the Medicaid Act permits states to set reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.51(c)(2). They maintain that the IAA requirement is a reasonable standard relating to the qualifications of providers and, therefore, does not run afoul of the free-choice-of-provider provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Our review of this issue requires an examination of the pertinent federal statutory and regulatory framework, as well as New Hampshire law implementing that framework in the context of the mental health system. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. N.H. Assoc. of Counties v. Comm\u2019r., N.H. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>156 N.H. 10, 15 (2007). Because the meaning of the free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A), is a question of federal law, we interpret it in accordance with federal policy and precedent. <em>Cf. Planned Parenthood of Arizona, </em>727 F.3d at 968-71; <em>Pelkey v. Dan\u2019s City Used Cars, </em>163 N.H. 483, 487 (2012) (interpreting 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1) (2006) in accordance with federal policy and precedent), <em>aff'd, </em>133 S. Ct. 1769 (2013). When interpreting a statute, we begin with the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>See Pelkey, </em>163 N.H. at 487. When the language of the statute is clear on its face, its meaning is not subject to modification. <em>Appeal of Lake Sunapee Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>165 N.H. 119, 125 (2013). We will neither consider what Congress might have said, nor add words that it did not see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>fit to include. <em>See Planned Parenthood of Arizona, </em>727 F.3d at 970; <em>cf Appeal of Lake Sunapee Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>165 N.H. at 125 (construing state statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the \u201crequirement of maintaining an IAA to be a qualified provider of Medicaid mental health services violates [the free-choice-of-provider] provision because\u201d it does not \u201crelate to the ability of the provider to provide the care.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The free-choice-of-provider provision requires that state Medicaid plans \u201cmust... provide that... any individual eligible for medical assistance ... may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person <em>qualified to perform, the service or services required.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) (emphasis added). The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently interpreted this provision in <em>Planned Parenthood of Indiana. See Planned Parenthood of Indiana, </em>699 F.3d at 977-80. In that case, Planned Parenthood of Indiana challenged an Indiana defunding law as violating the free-choice-of-provider provision. <em>Id. </em>at 967-68. Indiana argued that, even if the provision conferred on Medicaid recipients the right to choose among a range of qualified providers, \u201cthe states may establish provider qualifications that effectively limit that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 977-78. The Seventh Circuit disagreed, ruling that Indiana\u2019s argument \u201cconflicts with the unambiguous language of \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) and finds no support in related Medicaid statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The Seventh Circuit noted that \u201c[t]he Act does not define what it means for a provider to be \u2018qualified,\u2019 and the term is not self-defining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It explained that \u201cMedicaid regulations provide that the states may establish \u2018reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.51(c)(2)). Nonetheless, \u201c[t]his authority . . . does not suggest that states are free to ascribe <em>any </em>meaning to the statutory term \u2018qualified\u2019 \u2014 including a meaning entirely strange to those familiar with its ordinary usage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cAs the limiting term \u2018reasonable\u2019 in the regulation suggests, a state\u2019s authority to determine provider qualifications must be keyed to the permissible variations in the ordinary concept of what it means to be \u2018qualified\u2019 in this particular context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The court reasoned that, \u201c[r]ead in context, the term \u2018qualified\u2019 as used in \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously relates to a provider\u2019s fitness to perform the medical services the patient requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, it held that \u201c[t]o be \u2018qualified\u2019 in the relevant sense is to be capable of performing the needed medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit agreed with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation. <em>See Planned Parenthood of Arizona, </em>727 F.3d at 969. In doing so, it found that Congress removed \u201cany doubt as to how [to] read the word \u2018qualified\u2019 in\u201d the free-choice-of-provider provision when it added \u201cthe further specification \u2018qualified <em>to perform the service or services </em>required.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)). It reasoned that \u201cthe words \u2018to perform the service or services required\u2019 modify the adjective \u2018qualified,\u2019 telling us that Congress meant for that adjective not to refer to a Medicaid Act-specific authorization, but to denote the capability to carry out a particular <em>activity </em>\u2014 \u2018performing the medical service\u2019 that a given Medicaid recipient requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets omitted). \u201cThe provision thus indexes the relevant \u2018qualifications\u2019 not to any Medicaid-specific criteria (whether imposed by the federal government or the states), but to factors external to the Medicaid program; the provider\u2019s competency and professional standing as a medical provider generally.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We agree with both the Seventh and the Ninth Circuits that, when read in context, \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 as used in \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously relates to a provider\u2019s fitness to perform the medical services the patient requires.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Indiana, </em>699 F.3d at 978; <em>see also Planned Parenthood of Arizona, </em>727 F.3d at 969. As the Ninth Circuit explained, \u201cThe verb \u2018perform\u2019 here is key: It confirms that the relevant question is not whether the provider is qualified in some sense specific to Medicaid patients, but simply whether the provider is qualified in a general sense to <em>perform, </em>i.e., <em>carry out, </em>the service in question, whether for Medicaid patients or for any other patients.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Arizona, </em>727 F.3d at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The defendants argue that \u201c[w]hat it means to be a qualified provider is not controlled by the Medicaid Act; rather, the federal government has left it to the States to set reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers.\u201d There is no dispute \u201cthat the states retain considerable, authority to establish licensing standards and other related practice qualifications for providers,\u201d and that \u201cthis residual power is inherent in the cooperative-federalism model of the Medicaid program and expressly recognized in the Medicaid regulations.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Indiana, </em>699 F.3d at 980; <em>see also </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.51(c)(2). Further, the free-choice-of-provider provision \u201ccannot prevent the State from adopting administrative processes that are necessary for allocating and delivering its limited medical assistance funds efficiently.\u201d <em>King by King, </em>776 F. Supp. at 656 (concluding that Rhode Island\u2019s practice of matching applicants for private intermediate care facilities to appropriate intermediate care facilities and group homes was necessary practice and did not violate free-choice-of-provider provision). The defendants\u2019 interpretation, however, would permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>states to \u201cdetermine for any reason that a provider is not qualified for Medicaid purposes, even if the provider <em>is </em>otherwise legally qualified, through training and licensure, to provide the requisite medical services within the state.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Arizona, </em>727 F.3d at 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">\u201cNowhere in the Medicaid Act has Congress given a special definition to \u2018qualified,\u2019 much less indicated that each state is free to define this term for purposes of its own Medicaid program however it sees fit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, were we to adopt the defendants\u2019 interpretation, we would detach \u201cthe word \u2018qualified\u2019 from the phrase in which it is embedded; \u2018qualified to perform the service or services required.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>This we will not do. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The defendants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Warr v. Horsley, </em>705 F. Supp. 540 (M.D. Ala. 1989) and <em>District of Columbia Podiatry Society </em>is misplaced. In <em>Warr, </em>the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama concluded that, since \u201cAlabama has not chosen to include podiatric care in its [Medicaid] plan,\u201d podiatrists were excluded from the terms of the free-choice-of-provider provision and were, therefore, \u201cnot entitled to receive reimbursement under Medicaid for their services unless the state [chose] to include podiatric care in its plan as an optional service.\u201d <em>Warr, </em>705 F. Supp. at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Similarly, in <em>District of Columbia Podiatry Society, </em>the United States District Court for the District of Columbia determined that the District of Columbia had the discretion to impose limitations on the scope of the optional podiatric care services it offered under its Medicaid plan and was not required to fund all services that a licensed podiatrist could legally perform. <em>Dist. of Col. Pod. Soc., </em>407 F. Supp. at 1263-66. The court reached this conclusion based, in part, upon \u201cthe [federal] Medicaid regulations ... [which do] not require that podiatrists or any other medical care provider be compensated for every procedure or service they may legally perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1264-65. The court interpreted the phrase \u201cqualified to perform the service\u201d in the free-choice-of-provider provision as meaning \u201cthat a provider is \u2018qualified\u2019 if the service is one compensable under the State Plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1266 n.32. Since the podiatry services for which the plaintiffs sought reimbursement were not compensable under the District of Columbia\u2019s Plan when performed by a podiatrist, the free-choice-of-provider provision did not entitle a Medicaid recipient to obtain assistance from a podiatrist for those services. <em>See id. </em>Thus, these cases addressed services that were not reimbursable under Medicaid because the respective states had chosen not to include such services in their Medicaid plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">New Hampshire\u2019s Medicaid plan, however, includes optional rehabilitative services such as those at issue in this case, <em>see </em>N.H. Admin. RULES, He-C 6420.04(d)(7); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii), 1396d(a)(13); 42 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u00a7 440.130(d), and the defendants do not contend that these services are limited or in any way not covered under New Hampshire\u2019s Medicaid Program. Since New Hampshire has elected to provide rehabilitative services, \u201cit bound itself to act in compliance with [the Medicaid Act] and the applicable regulations in the implementation of those services.\u201d <em>Meyers by Walden v. Reagan, </em>776 F.2d 241, 243-44 (8th Cir. 1985) (concluding that Iowa could not exclude electronic speech devices from coverage under its plan once it chose to offer \u201cphysical therapy and related services\u201d); <em>see also Harris, </em>448 U.S. at 301; <em>Eder, </em>609 F.2d at 702. This includes complying with the free-choice-of-provider provision. <em>See Eder, </em>609 F.2d at 702. Although states have the authority to adopt \u201creasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.51(c)(2), these standards must relate to the ability of the provider to perform the Medicaid services in question, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe provider\u2019s fitness to render the medical services required,\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Indiana, </em>699 F.3d at 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The defendants contend that the IAA requirement is reasonable because it \u201censures collaborative service planning and delivery to provide continuity of care in a manner that is efficient and effective.\u201d They contend that \u201c[t]he sharing of information required by the [IAA] ensures that the diagnosis, development of an individualized service plan, and the provision [of] services is based upon the full complement of information about the individual\u2019s clinical needs and current level of functioning.\u201d Thus, according to the defendants, because the collaboration provided by an IAA is necessary to \u201cserve[] the best interests of the clients to whom services are provided,\u201d the IAA requirement has a rational basis and is a reasonable standard relating to the quality of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We do not doubt the importance of having a mental health system that assures quality of services to its recipients and collaboration of care in providing those services. But the defendants\u2019 argument fails to explain how the IAA requirement directly relates to \u201cthe <em>provider\u2019s </em>fitness to render the medical services required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>cf Young v. Jesson, </em>796 N.W.2d 158, 161, 164-69 (Minn. Ct. App. 2011) (concluding that, under applicable regulatory framework, fact that assisted-living and memory care facility did not have contract with county did not mean it was not \u201cqualified provider\u201d under free-choice-of-provider provision). As explained above, \u201c[t]o be 'qualified\u2019 in the relevant sense is to be capable of performing the needed medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Indiana, </em>699 F.3d at 978. Currently, the IAA requirement in Rule He-M 426.04(a)(2) makes the ability of a community mental health provider to provide Medicaid-funded mental health services dependent upon whether it has an IAA with a community mental health program, rather than upon its \u201ccapability] of performing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>needed medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner,\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Indiana, </em>699 F.3d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Here, the IAA requirement excludes Harbor Homes from Medicaid for a reason unrelated to its fitness to provide the requisite services. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the IAA requirement does not violate the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-7\">Hicks and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
