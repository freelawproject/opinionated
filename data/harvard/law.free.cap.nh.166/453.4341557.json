The appellee, Melissa D., is Madelyn B.\u2019s biological mother. We reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Susan\u2019s pleadings allege, in part, the following: She and Melissa met in 1997 and soon became romantically involved. They held a commitment ceremony on August 16, 1998, and \u201cconsidered [them]selves to be as fully committed to one another as any married couple.\u201d Melissa took Susan\u2019s last name as her own. We note that, at that time, same-sex marriage was prohibited in New Hampshire, and did not become legal until 2010. <em>Compare </em>RSA 457:1, :2 (1992) (amended 2009) <em>with </em>RSA 457:1, :l-a, :2 (Supp. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Susan and Melissa intended to raise a family together, and they jointly bought a house in which to raise their family. When Melissa sought to become pregnant using an anonymous sperm donor, they searched for a donor who shared Susan\u2019s Irish heritage. After the initial course of fertility treatments failed, Susan sought insurance coverage for another course of treatments. Melissa became pregnant and, in 2002, gave birth to Madelyn. Susan and Melissa decided to give Madelyn Susan\u2019s middle and last names.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Susan and Melissa were both named as Madelyn\u2019s parents in the birth announcements sent to friends and family and printed in the local newspaper, as well as in a \u201cdedication ceremony\u201d held in the Unitarian Universalist Church when Madelyn was a year old. Susan was listed as Madelyn\u2019s parent in her preschool documents and in her medical records. Susan was involved in the daily care of Madelyn, and Susan and Melissa jointly made all decisions involved in raising Madelyn, including decisions regarding health care, education, and religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">An attorney for Susan and Melissa advised them that Susan could not legally adopt Madelyn, and that \u201ca guardianship was the best available option to protect [Susan\u2019s] parental relationship with her.\u201d Susan was appointed Madelyn\u2019s guardian on March 15, 2002. Melissa also amended her will to appoint Susan as Madelyn\u2019s guardian should Melissa die while Madelyn was a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In November 2008, when Madelyn was six years old, Susan and Melissa\u2019s relationship ended. Melissa and Madelyn moved in with Eugene D., whom Melissa later married. Susan and Melissa agreed upon a schedule for regular visitation. Susan saw Madelyn every weekend, had overnight visits every other week, and continued to be actively involved in Madelyn\u2019s life. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Susan paid weekly child support and, in addition, helped with the cost of Madelyn\u2019s extracurricular activities. She also provided Madelyn with food, clothing, and gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In February 2013, Melissa stopped cashing Susan\u2019s child support checks. Susan avers that she nevertheless continued to send them. On March 2, 2013, when Susan attempted to pick up Madelyn for her weekly visitation, she was informed that Madelyn no longer wanted a relationship with her. At a meeting the two had later to discuss the situation, Melissa \u201cclaimed that [Madelyn] no longer wanted to see Susan.\u201d Melissa did not return Susan\u2019s subsequent phone calls, and Susan was unable to contact Madelyn directly through online social media because Madelyn\u2019s settings had been changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On April 2, 2013, Melissa filed a motion to terminate Susan\u2019s guardianship over Madelyn, asserting that the guardianship was \u201cno longer necessary because Madelyn no longer wishes to have a relationship with Susan.\u201d On April 4, Melissa filed an <em>ex parte </em>emergency motion to terminate the guardianship alleging that Susan had been \u201cshowing up at Madelyn\u2019s school, contacting family members and behaving in such a way that both Madelyn and [Melissa] fear [for Madelyn\u2019s] safety.\u201d The court suspended the guardianship that day \u201cpending response to [r]equest to terminate ... and subsequent order,\u201d and ordered \u201c[n]o hearing to be scheduled pending further order.\u201d Susan, representing herself, filed an objection on April 5. On April 12, the court terminated the guardianship on the grounds that it was \u201cno longer necessary to provide for Madelyn\u2019s essential physical and safety needs and termination would not adversely affect Madelyn psychologically.\u201d The court found that the guardianship had been created to give Susan the \u201cright and duty\u201d to care for Madelyn if Melissa were not available to do so. It further found that following the termination of Susan and Melissa\u2019s relationship and Melissa\u2019s subsequent marriage, Melissa\u2019s \u201chusband is the logical choice to care for Madelyn in Melissa\u2019s absence as they are now the family unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">On April 18, Susan, represented by counsel, moved for an immediate hearing. Melissa objected, noting, \u201cWe have begun the process of my husband, Madelyn[\u2019]s stepfather, adopting her.\u201d The court denied the motion and Susan\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">On April 29, 2013, Susan moved to intervene in the pending adoption proceeding. On the same day, she filed a verified parenting petition seeking temporary and final orders on child support and a parenting plan, as well as a determination that she \u201cis a legal parent to,\u201d or \u201cstands <em>in loco parentis </em>to[,] Madelyn.\u201d The court denied the motion to intervene, and dismissed Susan\u2019s verified parenting petition, finding that she \u201cis not [a] parent.\u201d (Quotation and bolding omitted.) The court denied Susan\u2019s subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>motion for reconsideration of the order denying her motion to intervene and for an order \u201cproviding [her] with notice and the right to request a hearing to prove her legal parentage of Madelyn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On appeal, Susan argues, in part, that the family division erred by: (1) terminating the guardianship without a hearing or opportunity to conduct discovery; (2) ruling that the legal standard for termination of a guardianship had been satisfied; (3) dismissing her parenting petition; and (4) denying her motion to intervene in the adoption case. Melissa counters that the guardianship was created to allow Susan to provide health insurance for Madelyn and to further \u201cthe daily practicalities of child-rearing.\u201d She argues that since \u201cMadelyn\u2019s sustenance is being adequately met by her new family,\u201d the guardianship is no longer necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We first address Susan\u2019s parenting petition claim because it is dispositive of her other claims at this stage of the proceedings. Susan characterizes the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of her verified parenting petition as a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See Kennedy v. Titcomb, </em>131 N.H. 399, 402 (1989) (noting that \u201c[a] trial court has the discretion to dismiss an action <em>sua sponte </em>where the allegations contained in a writ do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d). In essence, the trial court ruled that Susan\u2019s petition failed to state a claim on any of her asserted bases for claiming to be a parent of Madelyn. <em>Cf. In the Matter of J.B. &amp; J.G., </em>157 N.H. 577, 580 (2008) (holding that petitioner could maintain his action seeking \u201cparental rights and responsibilities under RSA chapter 461-A,\u201d notwithstanding his lack of biological relationship to the child, \u201cso long as he alleges sufficient facts to establish his status as a parent by other means\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u201c[I]n reviewing the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal [for failure to state a claim], [we] must determine whether the plaintiffs writ contains facts which are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. [We] must rigorously scrutinize the complaint to determine whether, <em>on its face, </em>it asserts a cause of action.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>131 N.H. at 401 (quotation and citation omitted). \u201c[W]e assume the truth of the facts alleged by the plaintiff and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Farm Family Cas. Ins. Co. v. Town of Rollinsford, </em>155 N.H. 669, 670 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Susan first argues that the family division erred in dismissing her parenting petition because she sufficiently alleged a claim under RSA 168-B:3, I(d)\u2019s \u201cholding out\u201d provision. <em>See </em>RSA 168-B:3, 1(d) (2002). Because this argument raises an issue of statutory interpretation, our review is <em>de novo. See Town of Newbury v. N.H. Fish &amp; Game Dep\u2019t, </em>165 N.H. 142, 144 (2013).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. When examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. We also interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">RSA 168-B:3, I, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">I. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a man is presumed to be the father of a child if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">(d) While the child is under the age of majority, he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">RSA 168-B:3, I (2002). Susan asserts that \u201c[a]lthough the statute uses \u2018father\u2019 and male pronouns, this Court must construe the holding out provision to apply to mothers as well, in accordance with statutory rules of construction, the original intent and purpose of the statute, and constitutional guarantees of equal protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The legislature has instructed that in construing all statutes, \u201cwords importing the masculine gender may extend and be applied to females,\u201d RSA 21:3 (2012), \u201cunless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature or repugnant to the context of the same statute,\u201d RSA 21:1 (2012). We have previously declined to employ that instruction as liberally as is urged here. In <em>Chretien v. Company, </em>87 N.H. 378 (1935), we held that \u201ca statute requiring that words denoting the masculine gender shall include females will not authorize us to read the word widow as including widower.\u201d <em>Chretien, </em>87 N.H. at 379 (quotation omitted); <em>cf. id. </em>at 378-79 (noting also, however, that the statutory instruction to construe masculine terms to include women would allow the words \u201c \u2018workman\u2019 and \u2018his\u2019 \u201d to include a female worker). In reaching that conclusion, we noted, after surveying similar cases from other jurisdictions, that \u201c[n]o case has been found where so liberal a construction has been adopted as would supply \u2018widower\u2019 for \u2018widow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">By contrast, other jurisdictions have interpreted the terms \u201cpaternity\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d to apply to women. In <em>Rubano v. DiCenzo, </em>759 A.2d 959 (R.I. 2000), for instance, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>While the word \u201cpaternity\u201d implies the \u201cfathering\u201d of a child, we are mindful of the Legislature\u2019s instruction that when statutes are construed \u201c[e]very word importing the masculine gender only, may be construed to extend to and to include females as well as males.\u201d Thus, two women may certainly be \u201cadults who shall be involved with paternity\u201d of a child for purposes of this statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Rubano, </em>759 A.2d at 970 n.13 (citation omitted) (interpreting statute granting family court jurisdiction over matters relating to adults involved with paternity of children born out of wedlock to apply to dispute between same-sex partners over visitation with child conceived by one, according to agreement between them, through artificial insemination).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Susan correctly notes that courts in other jurisdictions have applied the particular paternity presumption she asserts \u2014 the \u201cholding out provision\u201d \u2014 equally to mothers. <em>See, e.g., Chatterjee v. King, </em>280 P.3d 283, 293 (N.M. 2012). We note that those jurisdictions had statutory provisions, more specific than ours, instructing that their paternity \u201cpresumptions are to be read in a gender-neutral manner insofar as practicable in an action to determine ... the existence of a mother and child relationship.\u201d <em>Frazier v. Goudschaal, </em>295 P.3d 542, 559 (Kan. 2013) (Biles, J., concurring in part) (quotation omitted); <em>see Elisa B. v. Superior Court, </em>117 P.3d 660, 665 (Cal. 2005) (holding that woman was presumed mother under Uniform Parentage Act\u2019s (UPA) provision presuming paternity based upon receiving the child into one\u2019s home and holding out child as one\u2019s own where UPA \u201cexpressly provides that in determining the existence of a mother and child relationship, insofar as practicable, the provisions of this part applicable to the father and child relationship apply\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)); <em>In re S.N.V., </em>284 P.3d 147, 151 (Colo. Ct. App. 2011) (interpreting presumptive paternity provision of the UPA, in light of its statutory construction provisions, so that \u201c[a] woman\u2019s proof of marriage to the child\u2019s father, or her proof of receiving the child into her home and holding the child out as her own,... may establish the mother-child relationship\u201d); <em>Chatterjee, </em>280 P.3d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We find these cases instructive, not only for our application of RSA 21:3, but also for our application of other canons of statutory construction. One such canon recognizes that \u201c[o]ur goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Sheehan v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Resources &amp; Economic Dev., </em>164 N.H. 365, 368 (2012). RSA 168-B:3 is contained within a chapter entitled \u201cSurrogacy.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA ch. 168-B (2002). The chapter\u2019s statement of purpose provides that \u201c[t]he purpose of this act is to establish consistent state standards and procedural safeguards for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>protection of all parties, and to determine the legal status of children born as a result of [surrogacy] arrangements.\u201d Laws 1990, 87:1, II. Specifically, the Legislature noted that the chapter ensures, among other things, that \u201cthe resulting child\u2019s status is legally certain in order that the child not be the chief remedial focus of litigation; and that adequate support be assured for the resulting child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In furtherance of the chapter\u2019s stated purpose, RSA 168-B:7 provides: \u201cIf, under the provisions of this chapter, a parent-child relationship is created between 2 persons, the child shall be considered, for all purposes of law, the legitimate child of the parent.\u201d Further, RSA 168-B:8 declares that \u201c[a]ny person who is determined to be the parent of a child under the provisions of RSA 168-B:2-5 shall support the child.\u201d RSA 168-B:8,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"> In addition, the chapter indicates an implicit legislative preference for the recognition of two parents. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 168-B:2 (mother-child relationship), :3 (father-child relationship). \u201cBy recognizing the value of determining paternity, the Legislature implicitly recognized the value of having two parents, rather than one, as a source of both emotional and financial support, especially when the obligation to support the child would otherwise fall to the public.\u201d <em>Elisa B., </em>117 P.3d at 669; <em>cf. In the Matter of Gendron &amp; Plaistek, </em>157 N.H. 314, 321 (2008) (noting, in the context of paternity determinations, that \u201cstability and continuity of support, both emotional and financial, are essential to a child\u2019s welfare\u201d (quotation omitted)); RSA 461-A:2, I (Supp. 2013) (stating as premise of statutory policy that \u201cchildren do best when both parents have a stable and meaningful involvement in their lives\u201d). The <em>Chatterjee </em>court similarly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">[T]he state has a strong interest in ensuring that a child will be cared for, financially and otherwise, by two parents. If that care is lacking, the state will ultimately assume the responsibility of caring for the child. This is one of the primary reasons that the original UPA was created, and it makes little sense to read the statute without keeping this overarching legislative goal in mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em>Chatterjee, </em>280 P.3d at 292 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The policy goals of ensuring legitimacy and support would be thwarted if our interpretation of RSA 168-B:3 failed to recognize that a child\u2019s second parent under that statute can be a woman. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 287-88 (noting that \u201c[b]ecause the [UPA\u2019s holding out] presumption is based on a person\u2019s conduct, not a biological connection,\u201d it \u201cis reasonably capable of being accomplished by either a man or a woman\u201d). Without that recognition, a child in a situation similar to Madelyn\u2019s could be entitled to support from, and be the legitimate child of, only her birth mother. <em>See </em>RSA 168-B:2, :7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>:8. Two adults \u2014 Melissa and Susan \u2014 intentionally brought Madelyn into the world and held her out as their child; we cannot read RSA 168-B:3 so narrowly as to deny Madelyn the legitimacy of her parentage by, and her entitlement to support from, both of them. <em>Cf In re Jessica W., </em>122 N.H. 1052, 1056-57 (1982) (interpreting adoption statute liberally, \u201cin accordance with the legislative intent to protect, not injure, adopted children,\u201d to allow unwed natural parents to utilize the stepparent exception to the general rule that \u201cadoption severs the rights of the natural parent(s),\u201d so that their child would \u201cnot have to be deprived of its relationship with its mother in order to be legitimized by its natural father through the adoption process\u201d). We note that the intention of Melissa\u2019s husband to adopt Madelyn does not alter our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Consistent with the above-noted policy goals is the recognition that \u201c[t]he paternity presumptions are driven, not by biological paternity, but by the state\u2019s interest in the welfare of the child and the integrity of the family.\u201d <em>In re Salvador M., </em>4 Cal. Rptr. 3d 705, 708 (Ct. App. 2003). \u201cThe familial relationship between a nonbiological [parent] and an older child [over two years of age], resulting from years of living together in a purported parent/child relationship, is considerably more palpable than the biological relationship of actual paternity and should not be lightly dissolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted); <em>cf Roberts v. Ward, </em>126 N.H. 388, 392-93 (1985) (noting that \u201c[psychiatrists and psychologists unanimously counsel that children should maintain and retain meaningful relationships and that to deny them continuing contacts is a deprivation\u201d (quotation and ellipses omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Accordingly, in some cases, we have refused to allow a presumption of paternity to be rebutted by proof of biological paternity. In <em>Watts v. Watts, </em>115 N.H. 186 (1975), for instance, we affirmed the denial of a divorcing husband\u2019s request for blood tests to dispute the paternity of children of the marriage. <em>Watts, </em>115 N.H. at 189. We held that although, in general, common law and statutory paternity presumptions may be rebutted by blood tests, \u201cthose rules do not apply . . . where defendant has acknowledged the children as his own without challenge for over fifteen years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, we have allowed a determination of paternity to stand despite a confirmed lack of biological connection. Thus, in <em>In the Matter of J.B. &amp; J.G., </em>we held that the petitioner \u2014 who was listed as the father on the child\u2019s birth certificate, had filed an affidavit of paternity, had a child support order entered against him, and had \u201cconsistently maintained contact with the child\u201d \u2014 had \u201cstanding to seek full parental rights and responsibilities under RSA chapter 461-A\u201d notwithstanding that paternity testing had confirmed he was not the child\u2019s biological father. <em>In the Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>of J.B. &amp; J.G., 157 </em>N.H. at 578, 581. We rejected the contention of the respondent, the child\u2019s biological mother, that the petitioner could not be a \u201cparent\u201d under RSA chapter 461-A because he did not meet the dictionary definition of \u201cone that begets or brings forth offspring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">After considering the overarching statutory scheme in this area, as we must, we observe that the legislature has set forth too many alternative routes to establish parental status that do not require proof of biological ties for us to give the respondent\u2019s argument much weight. The petitioner\u2019s lack of a biological connection to [the child] is therefore not fatal to his request for parental rights and responsibilities under RSA chapter 461-A, so long as he alleges sufficient facts to establish his status as a parent by other means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the lack of a biological connection between Susan and Madelyn is not a bar to application of the holding out presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Given our construction of RSA 168-B:3, I (d), we need not address Susan\u2019s constitutional arguments. <em>See Olson v. Town of Fitzwilliam, </em>142 N.H. 339, 345 (1997) (noting that we decide cases on constitutional grounds only when necessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that RSA 168-B:3, 1(d) applies equally to women and men. We must now determine whether Susan has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim under that statute. We conclude that she has.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Assuming the truth of Susan\u2019s alleged facts, and construing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to her, <em>Farm Family Cas. Ins. Co., 155 </em>N.H. at 670, we conclude that she adequately pleaded that she received Madelyn into her home and openly held Madelyn out as her child. She and Melissa planned to have and raise children together. They prepared Madelyn\u2019s nursery together in the home they had jointly purchased because they \u201cthought it would be a good place to raise a family.\u201d When Madelyn was born, Susan was in the delivery room. She alleges: \u201cFrom the very beginning, Maddie, Melissa, and I were a family. Melissa was the \u2018Mommy,\u2019 and I was the \u2018Momma.\u2019 Together we were ... Maddie\u2019s parents, and Maddie was our daughter. I loved Maddie as my daughter, treated her as my daughter, and saw her as my daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Susan\u2019s allegations, taken as true, indicate that Melissa also regarded Susan as Madelyn\u2019s parent as evidenced by, among other things, giving Susan a greeting card commemorating the \u201cBirth of Our Baby,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>including her as \u201cMomma,\u201d and her parents as Madelyn\u2019s grandparents, on Madelyn\u2019s family tree. The allegations also indicate that Susan appeared \u201cto the world\u201d to be Madelyn\u2019s parent. Madelyn shares Susan\u2019s last name. Susan was named as a parent, along with Melissa, in birth announcements and in a church ceremony. Susan was named as a parent in Madelyn\u2019s school and medical records, and was treated as a parent at Madelyn\u2019s preschool.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Taking Susan\u2019s allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, we hold that she has stated a claim for presumed parentage under RSA 168-B:3, 1(d). <em>Cf. Elisa B., </em>117 R3d at 670 (holding birth mother\u2019s same-sex partner was \u201ca presumed mother . . . because she received the children into her home and openly held them out as her natural children\u201d); <em>Chatterjee, </em>280 P.3d at 296 (holding same-sex partner of adoptive mother asserted sufficient facts to give her standing to establish parentage \u201cbecause her allegations satisfy the [statutory] hold out provision\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse the family division\u2019s dismissal of Susan\u2019s verified parenting petition and remand. We direct the family division to schedule a prompt hearing on Susan\u2019s request for temporary orders. In light of our holding regarding Susan\u2019s parentage claim based upon the statutory holding out provision, we need not address her other asserted bases of parental rights, and we express no opinion with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Consequently, we also vacate the family division\u2019s denial of Susan\u2019s motion to intervene in the adoption proceedings and stay those proceedings until the issue of Susan\u2019s parentage of Madelyn is finally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Similarly, we vacate the family division\u2019s termination of Susan\u2019s guardianship over Madelyn and stay those proceedings until the issue of Susan\u2019s parentage of Madelyn is finally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\n<em>Reversed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b483-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
