Gallo (the Gallos), on their petition to quiet title to land that the Gallos use to access their home on Captain\u2019s Pond in Salem. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The trial court found the following facts after a two-day evidentiary hearing and a view of the property in question. In 1986, the Gallos purchased land on Emilio Lane Extension in Salem. They tore down the existing structures and, in 1987, built their current home. They built a garage in September 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Since purchasing the property, the Gallos have accessed it by using a looped driveway that ends on Emilio Lane Extension. They paved the driveway in May 1989. Before doing so, the Gallos installed a cement retaining wall and a decorative stone wall, planted a \u201cburning bush\u201d inside the stone wall, and planted various flowers and other vegetation along one side of the paved driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">In 1997, Susan Traina purchased property on Captain\u2019s Pond. In 2004, as part of a settlement agreement with her cousin, Ronald Peredna, she became the owner of a strip of land immediately to the east of the Gallos\u2019 property, which includes a paved area directly in front of the Gallos\u2019 walkway to their home and garage, a portion of their retaining wall and decorative stone wall, and the \u201cburning bush.\u201d At some point, Peredna had acquired an easement to use a strip of land between the Gallos\u2019 property and his own property. The strip of land is currently owned by Dennis Iannalfo and his wife. Peredna later conveyed an easement deed to Susan, purporting to convey the easement to her. The Gallos\u2019 paved driveway and plantings are included on the Iannalfo strip of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The instant lawsuit was prompted by a long-running dispute between the neighbors that culminated in Susan\u2019s threat to build a fence around her property to cut off the Gallos\u2019 access to their garage. She also demanded that the Gallos remove the stone wall and plantings. The Gallos sought a declaration that they had a prescriptive easement to use their paved driveway located on the strip of land owned by the Iannalfos and that they had the right, by adverse possession, to maintain their retaining and decorative stone walls and plantings on Susan\u2019s land. Susan filed a cross-petition asserting a superior right to use the Iannalfo strip of land. On the morning of trial, Susan added her husband as a party. Although she originally purchased the subject property in her own name, it has since been transferred to her and her husband as joint tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">With regard to the Gallos\u2019 use of the land owned by the Tra\u00ednas, the trial court ruled as follows. The court decided that land on which the retaining and stone walls and the bush sit belongs to the Gallos by adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>possession. The trial court rejected the Tra\u00ednas\u2019 assertion that the granite post and fence that they installed in 2007 on their boundary line, to the south of the Gallos\u2019 retaining wall, and their occasional yard work around the burning bush interfered with the Gallos\u2019 exclusive use of the property. Specifically, the court found that \u201c[b]y placing the fence there,\u201d the Trainas \u201cin no way interfered with the Gallos\u2019 burning bush, retaining wall, or stone wall\u201d and that the fence and maintenance of the land did not constitute \u201ca co-occuring use of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The court explained that \u201cto interrupt the adverse possession, the record owner must perform some act which constitutes an ouster of the adverse claimant.\u201d Such conduct, the court observed, \u201cmust be such as would put a reasonably prudent person on notice that he or she actually has been ousted.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Accordingly, the court stated, \u201c[a] mere casual entry for a limited purpose by the record owner is not necessarily sufficient to destroy adverse possession.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Based upon the evidence at the hearing and its view of the property, the court concluded that the Trainas\u2019 actions were insufficient to interrupt the Gallos\u2019 adverse use.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The court also determined that the Gallos have only a prescriptive easement to use the paved area in front of their driveway and walkway, which is located on the land in dispute. The court ruled that the easement allowed the Gallos to access their property over the paved area. The court concluded that \u201cConsistent with their 20 years of notorious, open, and adverse use of [the] land, the Gallos may also maintain this paved portion by having it repaved, refinished, plowed, or other similar actions necessary to maintain the access in the manner that [they] have been using it since 1989.\u201d Nevertheless, because the land itself belongs to the Trainas, the court ruled that the Gallos could not \u201cblock the paved area or engage in any other actions that would restrict the Trainas\u2019. . . use of their property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">With regard to the Gallos\u2019 use of the strip of land owned by the Iannalfos, the court found that \u201cthe evidence clearly demonstrates that the Gallos have used the easement area in an open and notorious manner that is inconsistent with an easement broader than the paved driveway.\u201d The court observed that \u201c[t]he Gallos planted trees and other vegetation along the western side of the driveway 20 years ago at the same time that they paved the dirt path\u201d and that \u201c[t]hey continue to maintain that area,\u201d including the trees and vegetation. Based upon the evidence at the hearing and its view of the property, the court found that \u201cthe use of the land immediately to the west of the paved driveway is inconsistent with any easement access Susan... may have obtained.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cbecause the Gallos have openly, notoriously, and adversely used the easement area west of the paved driveway for more than 20 years, their adverse possession of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>area, vis-a-vis Susan . . . , has extinguished any right [she] may have obtained to pass over this area.\u201d The Tra\u00ednas unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s order, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In an action to quiet title, the burden is on each party to prove good title as against all other parties whose rights may be affected by the court\u2019s decree. <em>Hersh v. Plonski, </em>156 N.H. 511, 514 (2007). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s determination unless it is erroneous as a matter of law or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The Tra\u00ednas argue that the trial court erred when it determined that the Gallos owned by adverse possession the land underneath the retaining and stone walls and the burning bush. They contend that the Gallos\u2019 use of that property was not exclusive and that they successfully interfered with the Gallos\u2019 use by, among other things, making \u201cnumerous entries onto the land for landscaping, surveying, and installation of a fence.\u201d The Tra\u00ednas also argue that the trial court erred when it found that their easement was extinguished by the Gallos\u2019 adverse possession of the strip of land owned by the Iannalfos.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">As the appealing parties, the Tra\u00ednas have the burden of demonstrating reversible error. <em>See Coyle v. Battles, </em>147 N.H. 98, 100 (2001). Based upon our review of the trial court\u2019s order, the Tra\u00ednas\u2019 challenges to it, and the record submitted on appeal, we conclude that the Tra\u00ednas have not demonstrated reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b760-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
