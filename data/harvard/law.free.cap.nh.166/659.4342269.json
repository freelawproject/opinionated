Ct. R. 11, the State appeals the determination of the Superior Court (Smukler, J.) that the rule announced in <em>Miller v. Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), precluding the imposition of mandatory life-without-the-possibility-of-parole sentences on juvenile offenders under the age of eighteen at the time of their crimes, applies retroactively to the respondents (petitioners in the trial court), Robert Dingman, Eduardo Lopez, Jr., Michael Soto, and Robert Tulloch, on collateral review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The respondents were convicted of first degree murder for offenses committed when they were seventeen years old. Accordingly, they each received a statutorily-mandated sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. <em>See </em>RSA 630:l-a, III (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">On June 25,2012, after all of the respondents\u2019 convictions had become final, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Miller, </em>holding \u201cthat the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2469. The Court stated that, when sentencing juvenile offenders convicted of homicide, sentencers must \u201ctake into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">As a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the respondents each sought post-conviction relief in the superior court, arguing that the rule announced in <em>Miller </em>applied retroactively and that, consistent with <em>Miller, </em>the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Part I, Articles 18 and 33 of the New Hampshire Constitution, they are each entitled to a new sentencing hearing. The cases were consolidated to address the threshold question of whether <em>Miller </em>applies retroactively. After hearing arguments, the trial court ruled that <em>Miller </em>applies retroactively so as to entitle each respondent to a new sentencing hearing. Thereafter, the State filed this petition for writ of certiorari challenging the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Certiorari is a remedy that is not granted as a matter of right, but rather at the discretion of the court. <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. MacDonald), </em>162 N.H. 64, 66 (2011); <em>see </em>SUP. CT. R. 11. Certiorari is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>available to review whether the trial court acted illegally with respect to jurisdiction, authority or observance of the law, or unsustainably exercised its discretion or acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The sole issue for our review is whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review, <em>i.e., </em>whether the decision applies to the respondents in this case whose direct appeals were completed before <em>Miller </em>was decided. Because this issue poses a question of law, we review the matter <em>de novo. See In the Matter of Sullivan &amp; Sullivan, </em>159 N.H. 251, 254 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>III. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\n<em>A. Miller v. Alabama</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We begin our analysis by examining the <em>Miller </em>decision itself. In <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether imposing mandatory life-without-parole sentences upon juvenile offenders violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments. <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2460. The case involved the consolidated appeals of two fourteen-year-old offenders, each of whom was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn neither case did the sentencing authority have any discretion to impose a different punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One of the offenders, Evan Miller, was granted certiorari from a direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 2462-63. However, the other offender, Kuntrell Jackson, was granted review from the dismissal of a state court petition for habeas corpus relief. <em>Id. </em>at 2461.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The Supreme Court found that both Miller\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s cases implicated \u201ctwo strands of precedent reflecting [its] concern with proportionate punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2463. \u201cThe first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of the penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That line of precedent includes several cases that \u201cspecially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For instance, the Court noted that in <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551 (2005), it held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment of children. <em>Id. </em>It also noted that in <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48 (2010), it held that the Eighth Amendment \u201cprohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomicide offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Drawing from those cases, the Court explained that juveniles \u201care constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2464. <em>\u201cRoper </em>and <em>Graham </em>emphasized that the distinctive attributes of youth\u201d \u2014 such as immaturity, impetuosity, inability to appreciate risks, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>vulnerability to family and home environment \u2014 \u201cdiminish the penalogical justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2465, 2468. The Court explained that although <em>Graham </em>addressed life-without-parole sentences for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes, \u201cnone of what it said about children \u2014 about their distinctive (and transitory) mental traits and environmental vulnerabilities \u2014 is crime specific.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2465. \u201cThose features are evident in the same way, and to the same degree, when ... a botched robbery turns into a killing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>\u201cGraham\u2019s </em>reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sentence imposed on a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide <em>offenses----Graham </em>insists that youth matters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying this reasoning, the Court found that, \u201cby subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult \u2014 these laws prohibit the sentencing authority from assessing whether the law\u2019s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2466. This, the Court concluded, contravened the foundational principle in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Roper: </em>\u201c[Ijmposition of a State\u2019s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The second strand of precedent implicated in <em>Miller </em>prohibits \u201cmandatory imposition of capital punishment, requiring that sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2463-64. In the Court\u2019s view, <em>Graham\u2019s </em>treatment of life-without-parole sentences as analogous to capital punishment made relevant its line of capital punishment precedent \u201cdemanding individualized sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2467. Citing its decision in <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280 (1976), which \u201cheld that a statute mandating a death sentence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amendment,\u201d the Court explained that it \u201cthought the mandatory scheme flawed because it gave no significance to the character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the offense and excluded from consideration the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). The Court concluded that \u201cthe confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2464. Thus, the Court held that, in order to be constitutional, \u201ca judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2475.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The states argued that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles are not unusual and, therefore, not violative of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2470-71. The Court explained, however, that, unlike other decisions \u201cconsidering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole,\u201d in which it examined \u201csociety\u2019s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2470 (quotations omitted), the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller </em>did \u201cnot categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2471. Rather, the decision \u201cmandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process \u2014 considering an offender\u2019s youth and attendant characteristics \u2014 before imposing a particular penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that, \u201c[i]n so requiring, [its] decision flows straightforwardly from [its] precedents: specifically, the principle of <em>Roper, Graham, </em>and [the Court\u2019s] individualized sentencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting out the law\u2019s most serious punishments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court reversed the <em>Miller </em>and <em>Jackson </em>judgments and remanded the cases for further proceedings consistent with its holding. <em>Id. </em>at 2475.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\n<em>B. Retroactivity Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We next review the legal principles governing the retroactive application of judicial decisions on collateral review. \u201cThe determination [of] whether a constitutional decision of the United States Supreme Court is retroactive \u2014 that is, whether the decision applies to conduct or events that occurred before the date of the decision \u2014 is a matter of federal law.\u201d <em>State v. Tallard, </em>149 N.H. 183, 185 (2003) (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cThe retroactive applicability of a constitutional decision of [the Supreme Court] ... is every bit as much of a federal question as what particular federal constitutional provisions themselves mean, what they guarantee, and whether they have been denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cIn order to ensure the uniform application of decisions construing constitutional requirements and to prevent States from denying or curtailing federally protected rights, the Court has consistently required that state courts adhere to its retroactivity decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288 (1989), and its progeny, the Supreme Court \u201claid out the framework to be used in determining whether a rule announced in one of [its] opinions should be applied retroactively to judgments in criminal cases that are already final on direct review.\u201d <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007). The Court explained that \u201cthe question whether a decision announcing a new rule should be given prospective or retroactive effect should be faced at the time of that decision.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 300 (quotation and brackets omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u201cRetroactivity is properly treated as a threshold question, for, once a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\u201cUnder the <em>Teague </em>framework, an old rule applies both on direct and collateral review, but a new rule is generally applicable only to cases that are still on direct review.\u201d <em>Whorton, </em>549 U.S. at 416. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Teague, </em>\u201c[ujnless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 310. The Court concluded in <em>Teague </em>\u201cthat a new rule will not be applied retroactively to defendants on collateral review unless it falls within one of two exceptions.\u201d <em>Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 329 </em>(1989), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Under the two exceptions, \u201c[a] new rule applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a \u2018watershed rule of criminal procedure\u2019 implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Whorton, </em>549 U.S. at 416 (quotation and brackets omitted). In this case, the parties agree that <em>Miller </em>announced a new rule. They dispute whether the <em>Miller </em>rule falls within the first exception, <em>ie., </em>whether the rule is substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The first exception provides that a new rule will \u201cbe applied retroactively if it places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 307 (quotation omitted), or if it prohibits \u201ca certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense,\u201d <em>Penry, </em>492 U.S. at 330. \u201cSuch rules apply retroactively because they necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 352 (2004) (quotations omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[a] rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <em>353. </em>With this in mind, we now turn to the question of whether the <em>Miller </em>rule applies retroactively to cases on collateral review, including the four cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">\n<em>C. Application of Retroactivity Principles to Miller</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The State argues that the <em>Miller </em>rule \u201caddressed the process by which juvenile defendants who are convicted of first-degree murder should be sentenced\u201d simply by adding \u201cthe requirement of a sentencing hearing.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Accordingly, the State contends that the rule announced in <em>Miller </em>constitutes a new procedural rule that cannot be applied on collateral review. The respondents disagree, contending that <em>Miller </em>announced a new substantive rule of law that applies retroactively in this case and, therefore, requires that each of them receive a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Federal and state courts across the country \u201chave considered whether <em>Miller </em>announced a new rule that should be applied retroactively, with varying outcomes.\u201d <em>Malvo v. Mathena, </em>Civil Action No. 2:13-cv-375, 2014 WL 2808805, at *10 (E.D. Ya. June 20, 2014); <em>see also id. </em>at *10-13 (collecting cases). \u201cIndeed, there is no consensus among lower courts whether <em>Miller </em>is retroactively applied to cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">Generally, in consideration of [the <em>Miller </em>decision and federal retroactivity principles], lower courts that hold <em>Miller </em>is retroactive on collateral review find that it announced a new substantive rule, or that because the Supreme Court applied the holding to Jackson, a petitioner before the court on collateral review, the Supreme Court signaled that the rule must be applied retroactively. Alternatively, lower courts that hold <em>Miller </em>is not retroactive find that the new rule was not substantive but instead was a procedural rule that did not rise to the level of a \u201cwatershed\u201d rule of procedure for purposes of the <em>Teague </em>analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">After thoroughly reviewing the decision in <em>Miller </em>and the jurisprudence on both sides of the matter, we agree with the reasoning of those courts finding the <em>Miller </em>rule to be \u201ca new, substantive rule which should be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>122 So. 3d 698, 703 (Miss. 2013); <em>see Songster v. Beard, </em>Civil Action No. 04-5916, 2014 WL 3731459, at *2-4 (E.D. Pa. July 29,2014); <em>People v. Davis, </em>6 N.E.3d 709, 722 (Ill. 2014); <em>State v. Ragland, </em>836 N.W.2d 107, 117 (Iowa 2013); <em>Diatchenko v. District Atty. for Suffolk, </em>1 N.E.3d 270, 281 (Mass. 2013); <em>State v. Mantich, </em>842 N.W.2d 716, 730-31 (Neb. 2014), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>82 U.S.L.W. 3676 (U.S. May 5, 2014); <em>Ex parte Maxwell, </em>424 S.W.3d 66, 75 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014). We recognize that <em>Miller </em>did not categorically ban sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. <em>See Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2471. Nonetheless, \u201cit explicitly foreclosed the imposition of a <em>mandatory </em>sentence of life without parole on juvenile offenders.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>122 So. 3d at 702; <em>see also Songster, </em>2014 WL 3731459, at *4 (concluding that <em>Miller </em>announced a new substantive rule, in part, because it \u201cbans a sentencing practice or a scheme as applied to all juveniles convicted of murder\u201d). By prohibiting the imposition of manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>tory sentences and requiring that the sentencing authority \u201chave the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles,\u201d <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2475, <em>Miller </em>changed the permissible punishment for juveniles convicted of homicide. <em>See Jones, </em>122 So. 3d at 702; <em>Mantich, </em>842 N.W.2d at 730; <em>Maxwell, </em>424 S.W.3d at 75. As the Nebraska Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\"><em>Miller </em>did not simply change what entity considered the same facts. And <em>Miller </em>did not simply announce a rule that was designed to enhance accuracy in sentencing. Instead, <em>Miller </em>held that a sentencer must consider specific, individualized factors before handing down a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for a juvenile. Effectively, then, <em>Miller </em>required a sentencer of a juvenile to consider new facts, i.e., mitigation evidence, before imposing a life imprisonment sentence with no possibility of parole. ... In other words, it imposed a new requirement as to what a sentencer must consider in order to constitutionally impose life imprisonment without parole on a juvenile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Mantich, </em>842 N.W.2d at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The State maintains that the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Miller </em>that its decision \u201cdoes not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime,\u201d but \u201c[ijnstead,... mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process,\u201d <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2471, evinces the Court\u2019s intent that <em>Miller </em>not be regarded as a substantive rule. <em>See Craig v. Cain, </em>No. 12-30035, 2013 WL 69128, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 4, 2013) (concluding that <em>\u201cMiller </em>does not satisfy the test for retroactivity because it does not categorically bar all sentences of life imprisonment for juveniles\u201d); <em>see also In re Morgan, </em>713 F.3d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir. 2013); <em>Malvo, </em>2014 WL 2808805, at *15-16; <em>Johnson v. Ponton, </em>Civil Action No. 3:13-CV-404, 2013 WL 5663068, at *5 (E.D. Va. Oct. 16, 2013); <em>Williams v. State, </em>No. CR-12-1862, 2014 WL 1392828, at *14-15 (Ala. Crim. App. Apr. 4, 2014); <em>Geterv. State, </em>115 So. 3d 375, 384-85 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2013); <em>State v. Tate, </em>130 So. 3d 829, 836-37 (La. 2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>134 S. Ct. 2663 (2014); <em>People v. Carp, </em>852 N.W.2d 801, 825-26 (Mich. 2014); <em>Chambers v. State, </em>831 N.W.2d 311, 328-30 (Minn. 2013); <em>Com. v. Cunningham, </em>81 A.3d 1, 10-11 (Pa. 2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>134 S. Ct. 2724 (2014). The respondents disagree, and contend that the State \u201creads too much into that statement, given its context.\u201d We believe, however, that, given its context, the State reads the statement too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">When read in context, the statement does not support the conclusion that the <em>Miller </em>rule is procedural; to the contrary, it supports the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>that the rule is substantive. Although there is a procedural element to the rule in that it \u201cmandates ... that a sentencer follow a certain process,\u201d that procedural element is the result of the Court\u2019s substantive change in the law prohibiting mandatory life-without-parole sentencing for juveniles because \u201cyouth matters for purposes of meting out the law\u2019s most serious punishments.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2471; <em>see Davis, </em>6 N.E.3d at 722. We cannot see how such a rule could be anything other than substantive. Indeed, to hold otherwise would create \u201ca- significant risk that a defendant ... faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352 (quotation omitted); <em>see Jones, </em>122 So. 3d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Schriro </em>regarding the retroactivity of the rule announced in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584 (2002), supports our conclusion. <em>See Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 353. <em>\u201cRing </em>held that a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, may not find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty. Rather, the Sixth Amendment requires that those circumstances be found by a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353 (quotations, citation, and brackets omitted). In <em>Schriro, </em>the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">[The Ring] holding did not alter the range of conduct [the] law subjected to the death penalty. It could not have; it rested entirely on the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury-trial guarantee, a provision that has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize. Instead, <em>Ring </em>altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment. Rules that allocate decisionmaking authority in this fashion are prototypical procedural rules, a conclusion we have reached in numerous other contexts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Unlike the holding in <em>Ring, </em>the <em>Miller </em>rule does more than merely \u201cregulate . . . the manner of determining the defendant\u2019s culpability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). <em>Miller </em>provides discretion in sentencing where there once was none. <em>See Maxwell, </em>424 S.W.3d at 75. As the trial court here explained, <em>Miller </em>mandates that \u201ca juvenile defendant is required to have the opportunity to establish that life without parole is not an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>See Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2475. In this way, <em>Miller </em>\u201cbroadened the range of punishment for juveniles convicted of homicide.\u201d <em>Malvo, </em>2014 WL 2808805, at *11; <em>see People v. Morfin, </em>981 N.E.2d 1010, 1022 (Ill. App. Ct. 2012); <em>Davis, </em>6 N.E.3d at 722. Accordingly, <em>Miller </em>altered the range of outcomes for juveniles convicted of homicide by allowing a sentencer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>consider a punishment other than life in prison without the possibility of parole. <em>See Morfin, </em>981 N.E.2d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We also find it noteworthy that, upon rendering its decision in <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court reversed the state court decision dismissing Jackson\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus relief. <em>See Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2475. Like the respondents in this case, Jackson was before the Court on collateral review. <em>See id. </em>at 2461. Although, as the State points out, it does not appear that the issue of retroactivity was raised by the state as a bar to relief in the <em>Jackson </em>case, we nonetheless find the Supreme Court\u2019s decision regarding Jackson to be significant. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Teague, </em>\u201conce a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 300. Under this reasoning, \u201cthe relief granted to Jackson in <em>Miller </em>tends to indicate that <em>Miller </em>should apply retroactively on collateral review.\u201d <em>Morfin, </em>981 N.E.2d at 1023; <em>see also Songster, </em>2014 WL 3731459, at *1-2; <em>Davis, </em>6 N.E.3d at 722; <em>Ragland, </em>836 N.W.2d at 116; <em>Diatchenko, </em>1 N.E.3d at 281; <em>Mantich, </em>842 N.W.2d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Relying upon <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656 (2001), the State further contends that <em>Miller </em>is not retroactive to eases on collateral review because \u201c[t]he Supreme Court did not \u2018hold\u2019 that its decision in <em>Miller </em>or <em>Jackson </em>was retroactive to cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>See In re Morgan, </em>713 F.3d at 1367 (citing <em>Tyler </em>and concluding that \u201cthe Supreme Court has not held that <em>Miller </em>is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\u201d). In <em>Tyler, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the word \u201cmade\u201d in the federal statute which \u201crequires a district court to dismiss a claim in a second or successive [habeas] application unless . . . the applicant \u2018shows\u2019 that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, <em>made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, </em>that was previously unavailable.\u201d <em>Tyler, </em>533 U.S. at 660-61. The Court concluded \u201cthat a new rule is not \u2018made retroactive to cases on collateral review\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the statute, \u201cunless the Supreme Court holds it to be retroactive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663. The statutory provision interpreted in <em>Tyler </em>is not at issue here, however, and we are not persuaded that the Court\u2019s statutory analysis in <em>Tyler </em>as to congressional limitations on the federal courts\u2019 habeas corpus jurisdiction has controlling effect \u201cupon the application of the judicially crafted <em>Teague </em>construct as applied in the setting of a state post-conviction petition.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Johnson, </em>2013 WL 5663068, at *3 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">We conclude that, pursuant to the <em>Teague </em>framework, the rule announced in <em>Miller </em>constitutes a new substantive rule of law that applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>retroactively to cases on collateral review. Consequently, we find that the respondents are entitled to the retroactive benefit of the <em>Miller </em>rule in post-conviction proceedings. In light of our decision, we decline to address the respondents\u2019 argument that we should \u201capply a broader retroactivity doctrine than the federal courts apply.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
